The strategy prioritises actions to support the provision of Irish-medium education in Gaeltacht areas and schools.  This was further reinforced by the Gaeltacht Act 2012.  In line with the strategy, the Department is committed to providing Gaeltacht students with the opportunity to receive their education through the medium of Irish by implementing a range of measures that aim to improve and enhance Irish generally as well as measures that relate specifically to schools in the Gaeltacht.  To date, the Department has prioritised the implementation of educational actions in the 20-year strategy relating to curriculum, assessment and teacher education.  These measures have been introduced in tandem with the implementation of the national literacy and numeracy strategy, developments in initial teacher education and the reform of the junior cycle.  The Department meets regularly with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to discuss progress on the implementation of the educational measures in the 20-year strategy.<\/p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills also plans to carry out a detailed analysis during the coming school year of the particular challenges facing Gaeltacht schools of varying linguistic profiles, with a view to identifying policy options for Irish-medium instruction in these schools that will be consistent with the needs of Gaeltacht communities.  The findings of this analysis will enable good forward planning of educational provision in Gaeltacht areas.  This analysis by the Department is occurring in a context in which each Gaeltacht community will be expected to prepare a language plan and clarify its status as a Gaeltacht area in accordance with the Gaeltacht Act 2012.<\/p> <p>One of the criteria for recognition as a Gaeltacht language planning area relates to the extent to which there is provision for Irish-medium instruction in schools in a community in accordance with the policy of the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p> On the staffing of schools, it is important to note that the Department, like all other Departments, is operating in the context of a budgetary programme that is designed to put the public finances on a sustainable footing.  It is particularly challenging to achieve savings in the education sector given the ongoing and significant increases in demographics across all levels.  Notwithstanding this, and unlike in most other areas of the public service, vacancies in schools continue to be filled in the normal manner.  <\/p><p> The criteria used to allocate teachers to primary schools, including those in the Gaeltacht, are published annually on the Department's website.  The published criteria are commonly referred to as the staffing schedule.  The staffing schedule for the 2013-14 school year has been provided in the briefing material for the committee members.  The staffing schedule operates on the basis of enrolment bands and does so in a clear and transparent manner.  It currently operates on the basis of a general average of one classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS band one schools.  The staffing schedule significantly benefits small primary schools.  For example, a two-classroom or two-teacher school with 30 pupils has an average class size of 15 pupils, while a typical ten-classroom school with 272 pupils has an average class size of 27.2 pupils.  One of the savings measures in budget 2012 was a phased increase in the pupil threshold for the allocation of classroom teachers in small primary schools, including those in the Gaeltacht.  The impact of the budget measure means that the staffing levels in small primary schools will no longer be as favourable as they were previously, but it is important to note that they will still be better than the general average of 28:1 that operates in all other schools under the staffing schedule.<\/p><p> A new appeals process for small schools was introduced as part of the budget 2012 measure.  This enables small schools that are due to lose a classroom post as a result of the budget measure to retain the classroom post on the basis of their projected enrolments.  In 2012, six small schools in the Gaeltacht lost a classroom post as a result of the budget 2012 measure and those six are out of a total of more than 600 teachers in those schools.  The staffing arrangements at post-primary level, including for schools in the Gaeltacht, are outlined in the briefing material provided to committee members.<\/p><p> In an overall context, it is important to note that all public servants are being asked to do more with less.  The teachers in our schools, including those in Gaeltacht schools, cannot be exempt from this requirement.  The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.  We have given more detail in the briefing material provided to the committee.  We are happy to take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Loftus","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369830900,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I join the Chairman in welcoming Ms N&iacute; Chart&uacute;ir and Ms Ni Mhain&iacute;n as well as Mr. Loftus and his departmental team to discuss this issue.  I particularly welcome Mr. Loftus, as this is his first time to appear before the committee, and I thank him for raising this as an issue and putting together his presentation on it.<\/p><p>  The point of view from which I approach this issue is that we need to protect our educational services.  In my party's last pre-budget submission we provided for no cuts in the education budget and instead proposed more cuts in other Departments.  Nevertheless, my party reduced spending on education when in government.  However, we must recognise that we have got to a stage in education at which there is no potential for any more cuts, as anything that is introduced has a large effect on educational services.  That is no more so the case than in one-, two-, three- and four-teacher schools, and that is particularly visible in the Gaeltacht schools which the our guests are here today to discuss.  They have had to absorb a number of very difficult cuts which have undoubtedly had an impact on the schools.  They have outlined the impact, in particular, on the pupil-teacher ratio.  For Gaeltacht schools, 80% of which have four teachers or fewer, the cuts in the capitation grant and particularly the cut in the minor works grant are having a significant impact.  The value of the minor works grant would be a minimum of &euro;5,000 for any applicant school, regardless of how small, and the cut in the payment of that grant is having an impact.  Last autumn was the first time that grant was not paid.  Research has been done and there is evidence to show that more than half of primary schools are now in deficit and ran a deficit last year.  That grant will not be paid this autumn and it is then we will see a funding cliff for many of our primary schools.<\/p><p>  I recently visited a 70-teacher school that had applied for a minor works grant of &euro;7,000 the year prior to the cutting of the grant for carrying out essential repairs.  The grant was not paid to schools last year and it will not be paid this year.  In the case of that school, it had to fund-raise to gather that &euro;7,000 on top of everything else.  That figure would amount to &euro;100 per pupil, but the families of those pupils would not have the potential to absorb that expense as they are otherwise under exceptional financial stress.<\/p><p>  On the point concerning pupil-teacher ratios, will our guests from the schools division and from the Department outline the genesis of the lower retention rate for Gaeltacht schools?   If we go back to 2011-12, the number of pupils required for the retention of three teachers was 76 for a Gaeltacht school, as opposed to 83 for Gaelscoileanna and for primary schools, and the number of pupils required to retain four teachers was 96 for a Gaeltacht school, as opposed to 115 for Gaelscoileanna and for primary schools.  I am interested in the rationale for a lower retention rate for Gaeltacht schools <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> other schools of a similar size that are English-speaking, and particularly in the reason it applies to Gaeltacht schools but not Gaelscoileanna.  I have no doubt that lower retention rate has made a big difference, but why was it not in place for other schools?<\/p><p>  Focusing on the pupil-teacher ratio that has had to be applied by Gaeltacht schools and other small schools in recent times, from 2012 the ratio for one-teacher schools will increase from 12 pupils to 20 pupils.  Any school that does not have a minimum of 20 pupils this September will lose a teacher the following year.  For two-teacher schools, the figure will increase from 49 to 56 pupils this September and for three-teacher schools it will increase from 81 to 86 this September.  As our guest rightly pointed out, the impact of that change for Gaeltacht schools is even more significant, with the figure increasing from 76 to 86.  Those are significant increases and they will make it difficult for schools to continue to teach students in the way they would like to and have done up to now.  The reason there is a preferential pupil-teacher ratio for smaller schools is that it is more difficult for one teacher to teach a number of classes than it is for a teacher in schools with eight or more teachers to teach one class, although there may be different learning grades within it.  I would like an answer to those questions.  I would like our guests to outline what they want the Department to do on foot of this meeting and what they would request the Minister to do.  I have a good idea what that is but I would like them to specify their requests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900008#G00300","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1369830900,"counter":27,"content":"<p>On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900008#G00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1369830900,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh will ask a few questions in Irish but I have one question in English, if that is in order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900008#G00500","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1369830900,"counter":29,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900008#G00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1369830900,"counter":30,"content":"<p>On the three recommendations that were made, I wish to touch on the third one, the establishment of special board or authority with responsibility for strategic planning and development.

That would be fine if the playing field were level but it is not because there is a specific statutory responsibility, which was outlined today, for Gaeltacht schools.  It is not a level playing field and that is not just because these are small, isolated schools but because other supports are required.  As a parent whose children go to a Gaelscoil in the city I can see the need for text books at primary and secondary level at the same time as the English medium books are published.  Often the Irish language textbooks appear two or three years after the curriculum has changed or even later.  There are schools which are still working with photocopies.  They are the additional challenges that face Irish language schools, whether Gaelscoileanna or Gaeltacht schools.  Go raibh maith agaibh as an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt sibh go dt&iacute; seo.

I cannot see the logic of this review happening after the fact rather than before it.  It is in the nature of this and previous Governments to cut first and then examine the consequences or problems.  If the review was carried out and the Department could stand over a cut we could argue on a different level.  It seems illogical that the Department studies it after the fact and might end up having to row back on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900008#G00800","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369831500,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I welcome the ladies.

Will they be brought to this committee for discussion?<\/p><p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said, doing the review after the job is done is a bit like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  Will Gaeltacht schools close down as a result of these changes?  The Department is a year into the changes and Mr. Loftus said that six posts have been lost.  If Gaeltacht schools do close down will the students be placed in English medium schools or will they be put into Gaelscoileanna where they are taught through the medium of Irish?  This can cause a huge problem, especially if the children go on to be educated through Irish.  I recall somebody saying to me once that they did not send their child to a Gaelscoil because they could not help the child with homework as they did not know the names of the mountains and rivers as Gaeilge.  If children taught for several years through Irish are suddenly landed into an English medium school it will be hard for them, for example, to study geography.  It will be like learning a new language all over again.  I would appreciate if Mr. Loftus could indicate the impact of this on the Gaeltacht schools and whether they will eventually close down, and if so, is it proposed to amalgamate them with English medium schools?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900009#H00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1369831500,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na finn&eacute;ithe.  Mo leithsc&eacute;al nach raibh m&eacute; anseo ar dt&uacute;s.  I appreciate the presentations made here and I take on board the points that have been made.  I am on the record as calling for the measures in the 2012 budget to be reversed.  As late as yesterday I put down several parliamentary questions which unfortunately were not taken in the House because of the lottery system we have for oral answers.  The change in threshold numbers for small schools throughout the country, not just in the Gaeltacht, is regressive.  That there could be 55 children across eight streams in two classrooms, including perhaps children with special needs, is not good enough.  I agree with Mr. Loftus that we cannot put a value on the language and we need to take this matter more seriously.<\/p><p>  As a Government backbencher I will continue to work to see if these measures can be halted or even reversed.  The reasoning behind these thresholds is given as cost-cutting and encouraging amalgamation but there are more proactive ways to encourage amalgamation.  I have not seen any proactive approach from the Department that involves engaging with school communities and showing the benefits that would exist in some cases where amalgamation might be a positive option.  The one-cap-fits-all approach is completely ludicrous.  I find it very frustrating that this is happening over three years.  It needs attention.<\/p><p>  There is also an attitude in the Department to places that are far away.  In my constituency, Corca Dhuibhne, west of Dingle there are seven primary schools.  I saw a television documentary 12 months ago in which officials in the Minister's office found it amazing and ludicrous that there were seven schools west of Dingle.  That, however, made my job in my constituency much easier because people have since told me that now they know what I am dealing with.  There are seven schools west of Dingle because it is a large hinterland and the people there are entitled to their seven schools.<\/p> <p>This is because it is a large hinterland, covering a large area, and the people living in the communities west of Dingle are entitled to their seven schools.  It is completely ludicrous for someone to sit in an office in Dublin, look at the map and simply think the world should end at Dingle, with the next stop at Newfoundland.  There must be a serious rethink on the part of the Government on the entire approach.  In an attempt to have an informed debate on this issue, I have been calling for publication of the value-for-money report into small schools for a long time.  As recently as yesterday, in the response to a parliamentary question I had tabled, I was informed the report is nearing finality.  However, I was told the same thing approximately 12 months ago.  I believe this to be a case of putting the cart before the horse.  If there is to be an informed and open debate on this matter, the relevant facts and information are also necessary.  I will use this opportunity to call for the immediate publication of the aforementioned document.  It is something of which members must have sight without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900009#H00300","speaker":"1051","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369832100,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I will revert to the witnesses and invite Ms N&iacute; Mhain&iacute;n and Ms N&iacute; Chart&uacute;ir to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900010#J00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369832100,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Both Ms N&iacute; Chart&uacute;ir and I might take up the questions.  On the pupil-teacher ratio, up to approximately three years ago, gaelscoileanna had a more favourable retention rate - the Department will be able to clarify this - but then they lost it.  My understanding is the more favourable retention rate was to ensure that, as Ms Anna N&iacute; Chart&uacute;ir already had stated, teachers need to put in more time because there was a lot more work to do, including translation, for schools that were teaching through the medium of Irish.  This is my understanding of it anyway.  There was a lot more work to do in such schools, be they in a Gaeltacht or in a Gaelscoil setting.  Consequently, Gaeltacht schools had a more preferential retention rate until last year, after which it basically was wiped out.<\/p><p>  As for the recommendations we have made, in a nutshell, proper education planning and accounting must happen that would take into account the varying linguistic challenges that lie in each Gaeltacht area.  This must be done by the Department of Education and Skills before making any changes to pupil-teacher ratios or anything else pertaining to education in the Gaeltacht from now on.  This is actually stated in the 20-year strategy for the Irish language, which sets out in black and white what the Department must do.  As for the absence of educational planning, while everyone understands that cuts must be made, why make them and then carry out reviews, value-for-money reports and everything else?  Why always put the cart before the horse?  Could we not for once have proper planning, whereby we approach education in the manner it should be approached, as teachers do in schools?  As they plan their classes, lessons and year, can this not be done at a higher level? <\/p><p>  As for the question the Deputy asked regarding An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, COGG, that recommendation has been made time and again through various studies that have been published from 2005 onwards.  It has been recommended that a separate entity or body be set up to ensure that Gaeltacht schools are fulfilling their statutory regulations under the Education Act but that such a body be separate from the Department.  I believe that had such an entity be set up, we would not be talking about it before the joint committee today.  No planning has been done by the Department of Education and Skills, even though views have been expressed, as well as this, that and the other thing.  However, these are bits and pieces coming year after year or whatever.  This should have been done before any cuts or before anything else.  We should have known what we were talking about and what was going to come in the future.  That basically is the source of this recommendation.  The studies to which I refer primarily are Staid Reatha na Scoileanna Gaeltachta, which was published in 2004, Strucht&uacute;r Oideachais na Gaeltachta, which I think was published in 2007 and an Staid&eacute;ar Cuimsitheach Teangeola&iacute;och ar &Uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, which also was published in 2007.  They are the three primary studies that were published and which recommended that such a separate entity would be set up.<\/p><p>  As for the review, is d&oacute;igh liom gurb &eacute; an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh a d'iarr mar gheall ar an athbhreithni&uacute; at&aacute; le d&eacute;anamh.  Tagaim ar ais go dt&iacute; pointe a rinne an tUasal Loftus mar gheall ar forward planning.  Is iontach go deo an rud &eacute; m&aacute; t&aacute; an Roinn ag f&eacute;achaint ar phlean&aacute;il chun cinn a dh&eacute;anamh maidir leis an oideachas Gaeltachta.  While it would be great if the Department is looking at this review as a means of forward planning for Gaeltacht education, I reiterate the point I have made continuously today, which is it should have been done before any cuts were made.<\/p><p>  Senator Moloney asked whether Gaeltacht schools will close.  I can give her one example of a Gaeltacht school that has closed.  It has not actually closed because of numbers but it closed because their numbers fell too low for the school to remain viable.  However, on the point the Senator made, it was a Gaeltacht school in category B.  In other words, it was neither the weakest nor the strongest but was in the middle of the road.  However, it was a wonderful school that had a wonderful Irish policy and everything else.  The children concerned moved to a Gaeltacht school that teaches through the medium of English and were completely and utterly lost for months.  My organisation carried out a survey from the middle of last month up to the end of the first week of this month, approximately.  However, we then were obliged to call a halt to it even though schools were still responding to us.  To give the Senator an indication in respect of the points she raised, in the eventuality that schools must amalgamate because of the changes in the pupil-teacher ratio, 10% of Gaeltacht schools have indicated to us that they would be amalgamating with English-medium schools.  Moreover, 50% of the schools have indicated they will be under severe pressure to amalgamate because of the changes in the pupil-teacher ratio.  As to whether there would be a category change for the schools, 27% of the schools responded there would be.  Moreover, as has been recognised, this would involve going down the linguistic categories, not going up.  As for whether schools will be threatened with closure, 32% responded they would.  These are the statistics that have come back to us as an indication of the survey we carried out<\/p><p>  I will make two other brief points in response to the last two speakers.  A proactive approach certainly is needed from the Department in respect of amalgamations.  Time and again, the schools have told us they would love the Department to be involved in the process of amalgamation.  They would welcome guidance of some kind or that something was available to them as to how to go about it.  Schools are clueless, as they are there to teach children, not to go through the business of amalgamating, which is another kettle of fish.  As for the one-size-fits-all approach, an interesting point I wish to take up is that time and again, due consideration is not given to the language aspect where Gaeltacht schools are concerned.  This was highlighted the most with Circular 0044\/2007 on language and literacy in infant classes in Irish-medium schools.  While it was withdrawn, I think it is coming back in again and when that happens, will be prescribed in the primary curriculum.  What was good for the goose was good for the gander in this regard because it satisfied Gaelscoileanna to a certain point.  I believe the Department's view is that if it is okay for gaelscoileanna, then it is fine for the Gaeltacht schools.  However, that is not satisfactory at all.  As members themselves have stated today, a proactive approach is needed, as well as a very different attitude towards the Gaeltacht when it comes to education and planning for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Treasa N&iacute; Mhain&iacute;n"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369832100,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I deal with a lot of the staffing side of things in the Department.  I will let Ms Treasa Kirk talk about some of the issues from the perspective of the inspectorate.  As for the lower retention rate for Gaeltacht schools, the context in this regard is that in the late 1990s or thereabouts, improvements were being made in the staffing schedule for primary schools.<\/p> <p>At that time 28 pupils were needed for the second teacher in a school.  There was one teacher with up to 27 pupils.  It is important to bear that in mind.  The number was reduced to 12 and now we are bringing it back up to 20 but that is still well below what it was.<\/p><p> The historical retention rates were there at certain points in the staffing schedule for Gaeltacht schools and Gaelscoileanna.  They were introduced as part of the improvements.  Money was available in the late 1990s and early 2000s and there were slight reductions in our demographics which were stable or falling a bit.  We had scope in funding and teacher numbers to make some improvements and the policy decisions at that time were to make improvements in small schools.  We are in the opposite position now.  We have no money and we have significant increases in our demographics.  We are trying to manage our funding in such a way that we are able to have a teacher in all the classrooms which need one.  As a result, as part of these phased increases, there are more pupils in the classroom but the most important factor in education provision is the quality of the teacher and the supports the teacher has, as distinct from whether there are one or two extra pupils in the classroom.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the review and analysis the Department is undertaking of Gaeltacht provision and forward planning and in a sense putting the cart before the horse.  It is important to recognise that the review and the recommendations that might flow from it need to be done in the context of what we can afford as a country in staffing small schools.  That report will be published and all the stakeholders and colleagues here will be involved in that.  There is no point doing a review that does not reflect the fact that the country cannot afford a high level of staffing resources because we do not have the money.<\/p><p> Deputy McConalogue mentioned that the lower retention rate for Gaelscoileanna was standardised and that retention rate was withdrawn for Gaelscoileanna as part of budget measures for budget 2011 under the previous Government.  That budget measure would have resulted in some higher jumps for the schools at that point and it was done in one single jump.  The current budget measures for small schools generally, including for Gaeltacht schools, are being introduced on a phased basis.  The other key change, compared with the budget measure for Gaelscoileanna, is that there is a new appeals process was introduced for the small schools that enables them to retain their teacher based on projected enrolments for the following September.  The net effect of that in 2012 was that the budget measure, as it affected Gaeltacht schools, was a loss of six classroom posts.  The overall staff in Gaeltacht schools is over 600.  That helps to put things in context.  The budget impact on Gaeltacht schools in 2013 is evolving but as of now there are four schools that will definitely lose a classroom post.  That might rise marginally but it will be of that order.  Where a classroom post is lost there are standard redeployment arrangements in place for teachers in those posts and they are redeployed in line with those.<\/p><p> The small schools value-for-money review was also mentioned today.  My colleagues in Tullamore lead that review but as far as I understand that review is now completed and went recently to the Minister.  It is on his desk and he will be considering it with his Cabinet colleagues.  That will be published in due course.  The Minister has indicated that when that is published it will be given to this committee for discussion here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Loftus","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369832700,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Good afternoon, Chairman, Deputies and Senators.  I would like to highlight the Department's ultimate commitment to the implementation of the expectations and targets set out in the 20 year strategy, in line with available resources.  The Department has decided to undertake a review of Gaeltacht provision mainly because in the language strategy the Gaeltacht communities are highlighted as being absolutely fundamental to promoting the sustainability of the Irish language and Gaeltacht schools are part and parcel of that provision.  The purpose of the review is to clarify Department policy on educational provision in Gaeltacht communities.  In order to do that it is necessary to examine the primary research that has been undertaken to date nationally and Ms Treasa N&iacute; Mhean&iacute;n and Ms Anna Ni Chart&uacute;ir have referred to some of the studies undertaken by An Comhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscoil&iacute;ochta, COGG, the Educational Research Centre and by various third level institutions.  We will also be examining current international research, studies that have already been conducted, based on communities with similar sociolinguistic conditions, for example, the Basque region, Alberta, Wales and other jurisdictions.  As Ms N&iacute; Mhean&iacute;n and Ms Ni Chart&uacute;ir have highlighted, the Gaeltacht context is very complex for a range of reasons.  We have already mentioned school size, sparse distribution of the population, inward migration, various economic circumstances and unemployment in some cases, and the fact that two-thirds of the Gaeltacht schools are two to three teacher schools with an average enrolment of 77.  The standards for oral competency in the language vary widely and English can be the medium of instruction in some cases.  Parental choice is another issue.  There are many challenges in that sector.  The purpose of the review is to identify options and clarify Department policy to ensure that appropriate provision is made for the future in Gaeltacht communities.<\/p><p>  Senator Moloney asked about the timeframe.  It is planned that this review would be undertaken within this year.  A report will be published in 2014.  The terms of reference have been developed in collaboration with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and those terms of reference will be shared with the various bodies involved in Irish medium education.  Someone referred to the importance of strategic groups.  The Taoiseach chairs the Cabinet sub-committee.  There is also an inter-departmental group and a high level bilateral group involving officials from the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Education and Skills.  There is also a high level group involving officials from the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and Education and Skills, COGG, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge.<\/p> <p>It is envisaged that this partnership approach would be essential for a positive outcome and to clarify planning for the Gaeltacht communities and Gaeltacht schools.  There is also a designated team within the Department, with responsibility for Gaeilge and Irish medium education, including Gaeltacht schools, to ensure this happens.<\/p><p> A number of evaluations have been carried out by the inspectorate over recent years with a focus on the past three years.  A total of 68 evaluations were carried out by the inspectorate in that period, 41 in primary schools and 27 in post-primary schools.  There are 20 post-primary schools located in Gaeltacht areas so that is approximately 90% coverage of Gaeltacht schools and about 31% coverage in the primary sector.<\/p><p> It is interesting to note that in the case of Gaeltacht schools, a number of very positive features are in place and these have been reported on by inspectors.  All the reports are published on the website.  There is very encouraging evidence of good practice.  Where best practice exists it is accompanied by positive, proactive leadership, great involvement of the whole school community, and active boards of management and parents' associations.  There is also a positive ethos in such schools with good pastoral care systems and a very good focus on well-being and mentoring at over-arching, whole-school level.  There are also high levels of language proficiency among the teams in those schools, of involvement of student councils, as well as of co-curricular and extra-curricular activities in some cases.  In those effective schools, the class lessons are very well structured with a very strong emphasis on the development of language competency, the use of co-operative group work and the use of teacher modelling of the language.  Children are given the opportunity to practise the language.  That is what makes a difference to language competency.  Such schools provide good opportunities for students to use ICT, and it is used very effectively.<\/p><p> Parents and pupils are surveyed as part of an inspectorate evaluation.  All those 68 evaluations which were reviewed by the inspectorate indicate that parents and pupils, generally speaking, are happy with the provision in those schools.  However, areas which need to be developed are also recognised in the inspection reports.<\/p><p> Another positive aspect relates to resources.  The reports are available on the website and they show that inspectors report that the schools are well equipped with a good range of teaching and learning resources.  I wish to pay tribute to COGG, An Comhairle Um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, on the substantial work undertaken over the past five to ten years on the development of resources across primary, post-primary and early childhood education.<\/p><p> It is important to highlight the inspectors' recommendations as to what areas need to be developed.  Many of the reports refer to the importance of developing strategic plans, particularly with regard to the development of language plans which were mentioned earlier and the requirements under the Education Act to ensure Irish language plans promote the culture as well as the language in those communities.  There is also reference in the reports to the need to strengthen the role of school level management and to ensure all schools hold parent-teacher meetings. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Treasa Kirk","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369833300,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I will take some questions from members at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900012#L00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1369833300,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as ucht an cur i l&aacute;thair.

Is it their constitutional right, having been born in a Gaeltacht area to Gaeltacht parents who speak Irish, to be taught through the medium of Irish?  I ask the question because these things are not beyond the bounds of possibility.  I wonder why there is a discrepancy between the figures as to the number of Gaeltacht primary schools.

This Department and other Departments look at figures and statistics.  The six teaching posts in question are very important because hundreds of children are affected by those six posts.  The entire school communities associated with the six different schools are affected.  There may have been a 1% reduction in the overall staffing levels, but hundreds of children have been affected in their formative years as a result of that policy change.  The appeals mechanism is welcome in that it helps to make a bad situation a little bit better.  However, what it has done is to take the very unfair retrospective element out of the process but it has not really done anything else.  Last year in County Kerry, two posts were lost and five posts were saved through the appeals mechanism.  It is a case of kicking the can a little further down the road because with the increasing thresholds, all the appeals mechanism can do is give the schools a chance at least.  People will say it should not have been retrospective in the first place.  It is very scant consolation.<\/p><p>  The level of actual savings achieved is much less than originally anticipated.  I stand open to correction on the figures.  I asked parliamentary questions on this subject and the reply gave a figure of approximately &euro;2.5 million, which is a very small amount in the overall scheme but it has caused a significant level of upset, anger and frustration.  It is easy to say here that this needs to be reviewed, but there has not been any significant financial saving for the Department.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh touched on this aspect in his contribution.  It would be a different matter if it made up a significant part of the annual savings required by the Department.  There is good reason to rethink this policy because there is not a massive financial saving associated with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900013#M00400","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speech","time":1369833900,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I ask about the number of pupils in Gaeltacht schools now compared with years gone by.

Six posts were lost in the 2012 to 2013 period.  There will be four and possibly more posts lost.  I wish to deal with another aspect of this issue.  Last year, 30 hours of learning support in Gaeltacht schools were lost because of the loss of those six teaching posts.  This has a significant impact on those children.  A minimum of four posts, which is another 20 hours, will be lost in learning support for children in Gaeltacht areas this September.

I will deal with the questions regarding teacher allocations.  The increases in staffing schedules were introduced in budget 2012 and are being phased over a three-year period.  The decision to do so was not taken lightly.  It was done because the Department had a tight budget to manage, with no additional money available to us, and it was necessary to make difficult choices in order to achieve savings.  This is one of the cost-saving measures that was selected.  It was done as fairly as possible in terms of phased increases and the introduction, for the first time, of an appeals process in respect of projected enrolments.<\/p><p>  This budget measure is designed to achieve total savings of &euro;15 million per annum when fully implemented, yielding 250 posts over a three-year period.  The phased structure means that the projected savings are 100 in the first year, 75 in year two and 75 in year three, giving a total of 250.  For 2012, which is year one of the three-year process, approximately two thirds of the projected savings were achieved.  That number would probably have been closer to the full initial projection if the appeals process was not in place.  We are anxious, however, to ease the picture as best as possible.<\/p><p>  Where posts are lost, teachers are redeployed.  In 2012, as again in 2013, we were working in a climate where no school could be left with a surplus permanent teacher.  We are operating a system of 100% redeployment.  In fact, we are one of the most effective sectors within the public service in terms of staff redeployment.  We achieved our 100% deployment target in 2012 and expect to do the same this year.  Our approach in this regard is that any school vacancy is not fillable until the 100% target is achieved.<\/p><p>  Deputy Brendan Griffin referred to the impact of the loss of six jobs.  Those schools will have teachers remaining, who will have extra pupils in their classes.  One of the greatest impacts we must bear in mind relates to the very significant increases in our demographics.  We want to avoid a situation where in those areas which are experiencing significant demographic growth, there would be classrooms with no teacher because the payroll does not support it.  We are operating in a context whereby overall teacher numbers in our schools, even with the impact of this and other budget measures that affect schools at both primary and post-primary level, will be higher this coming September than they were last September.  The challenge is to balance the requirement for difficult budget decisions against the reality of increasing enrolments.  We are trying to stretch our money as far as we can, and that, unfortunately, necessitates difficult decisions.<\/p><p>  In terms of the number of schools affected, our records show 132, which does not quite match up with the figure of 142 that was mentioned.  We will clarify this issue with our statistics section and come back to the committee.  Some of the information coming through that section is not broken down to the same level of detail for every category of school.<\/p><p>  Senator Marie Moloney asked whether this particular measure could be open to legal challenge.  The reality is that any measure is potentially open to such challenge, in which case it is up to the courts to decide.  We would vigorously defend our position that we have been fair and reasonable in the approach we have taken with this and other budget measures.  We are working with finite resources and cannot do everything we could do in the past.  Some of the historical arrangements we have discussed were introduced at a time when demographics were declining and we had a great deal more money.  We are in the opposite scenario now and must cut our cloth to measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900014#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Loftus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369834500,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I will address the point raised by Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh.

Colleges are implementing some of these programmes to promote different strategies to enhance the language.<\/p><p> It is also important to point out that the NCCA, which advises the Minister in respect of the curriculum, is undertaking a number of various curricular initiatives to support language teaching.  In the context of the primary sector, for example, a language integrated curriculum is being developed for pupils from junior infants up to second class.  This curriculum will soon be available for the purposes of consultation and schools, teachers and the various partners will be given the opportunity to comment on and provide input in respect of it.  In addition, and specifically for Gaeltacht schools in Irish-medium education, the curriculum is very much based on learning outcomes.  There will be higher targets or targets set at a particular level for pupils in such schools.  The expectations would be such that immersion education would allow for the learning outcomes to come together and merge at a certain time.  The Department is very much committed to immersion education.<\/p><p> In the post-primary sector, the language curriculum continues into the junior cycle framework.  Members will be aware of the announcement made by the Minister last October or November in respect of the that framework.  The NCCA is developing an Irish-medium syllabus or curriculum - at junior cycle level - for post-primary schools.  The Minister has also requested that the NCCA develop a specialised short course for Irish-medium Gaeltacht schools, with a particular emphasis on teaching literature so that the saibhreas teanga do na scol&aacute;ir&iacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os fearr n&aacute; mar at&aacute; s&eacute; faoi l&aacute;thair.<\/p><p> The Educational Research Centre, ERC, carried out national assessments of English reading and mathematics in 2010 in respect of 49% - a total of 51 - Gaeltacht schools.  This was a representative sample.  The pupils surveyed in respect of their English reading in 2010 outscored those who were surveyed in 2009.  The same was true in respect of mathematics.  It is interesting to note that the survey also highlights that very few children in Gaeltacht schools have reading problems.  That is encouraging and it is obviously due to very good teaching on the part of staff in such schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900014#N00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Treasa Kirk","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369835100,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I could not allow Mr. Loftus leave without challenging what he said about phased increases being fair and equal.  That was not the case because the Department took away the preferential ratio which previously obtained in respect of Gaeltacht schools.  That is the crux of the problem.  I am interested in the thinking behind that move, particularly as the Department seems to be of the view that an English-medium school in a non-Gaeltacht - possibly rural - area and a Gaeltacht school are exactly the same.  We are trying to explain that they are not the same.  Mr. Loftus also stated that there had been 100% redeployment.  If that were the case, where did the savings arise?  The Department is still employing the same number of teachers.  Does what was done involve a bias towards urban schools, which have obtained additional teachers, and rural Gaeltacht schools, which have lost teachers?  If there were such a bias, then I have an issue with it.  The change to the pupil-teacher ratio gave rise to a double whammy for Gaeltacht schools.  Not only did the Department increase the ratio in respect of schools with between one and four teachers, it also removed the preferential rate which applied to Gaeltacht schools.  What would have happened if the preferential rate had been left in place and if the ratio for Gaeltacht schools had been increased by the same number?  Mr. Loftus stated that six posts had been lost.  If the Department had gone halfway, then three posts would have been lost and a further two in the 2013-2014 school year.  I contend that this would not be of major significance in the context of the overall savings made by the Department.  Perhaps it might review the position.<\/p><p>  D&iacute;reach ar an bpointe a rinne Treasa N&iacute; Mhainin - glacaim leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; le r&aacute; aici - t&aacute; knock-on effect ag na ciorruithe sna bunscoileanna ar na me&aacute;nscoileanna.

The standardisation with all other small schools was done as part of the attempt to achieve budget savings.  In that context, it occurred as a result of a policy decision by the Government and I cannot comment upon that.  However, part of that policy decision was to treat all small schools equally.  The only differentiation made was in respect of DEIS band 1 schools, which are the most disadvantaged.  All other small schools were treated in the same way.  I tried to make the point earlier that if one compares this to the type of change that was implemented - via the budgetary process - by the previous Government in respect of gaelscoileanna, which had a more favourable staffing schedule, one will see that this was done in one go and that there was no appeals process.  For the Gaeltacht schools, this was done on a phased basis and an appeals process was put in place.<\/p><p>  Savings relating to redeployment are achieved by way of the Department not being obliged to foot an additional cost for filling teaching vacancies in other schools through the recruitment of new teachers.  This year, for example, a total of 400 surplus permanent teachers were on our redeployment panels.  Approximately, 80% to 90% of these have already been redeployed.  The redeployment of these teachers - some of whom came from Gaeltacht schools - saves the Department the additional cost of employing 400 new teachers if it did not redeploy.  All of those teachers will be redeployed to take up vacancies in other schools.

It is important to remind ourselves of the background.  At the end of July of last year, the Government decided to introduce a local property tax, LPT, and that, without prejudice to the policy decisions, this would be collected by Revenue.  Together with my Commissioner colleagues, we began to develop an implementation pathway in circumstances in which we were missing key policy decisions, a register, legislation and an IT system.<\/p><p>  Nine months later, by the end of March, two LPT Bills had been drafted and enacted, a register had been compiled and an IT system had been built.  We were more than half way through the issue of LPT returns in respect of more than 1.66 million properties, the first 25,000 returns had been already filed and the first &euro;1 million had been already transferred to the Exchequer.  In other words, we had a fully functioning new tax within nine months.<\/p><p>  Since the register was compiled from several databases, we knew that some people would receive letters in error.  We flagged this from the beginning publicly and in our letters to customers.  We also knew that we would be missing properties.  Given the scale, we knew from the start that Revenue did not have the necessary infrastructure to manage the volume of queries that was inevitable with a new tax.  We made arrangements to manage it with a mix of Revenue and external resources.  We identified risks and put in place contingency plans.  We continued to build the register even as the issue of returns was ongoing.  We issued LPT returns to just over 1.69 million properties either by post or by way of their Revenue Online Service, ROS, inboxes.  We carried out an extensive communications campaign and advised property owners that, if we did not contact them, they still had an obligation to file.  We were supported in our communication campaign by the Citizens Information Services.  I am grateful for its help.<\/p><p>  I will turn to the credit card issue, as the committee asked that I address it specifically.  While we certainly had not foreseen it, the systems and people we had in place ensured that we were able to respond quickly after it happened.  Late on Thursday, 9 May, senior Revenue officials were informed that a member of the public had contacted Revenue's LPT branch via the LPT helpline and reported that unauthorised access to his credit card had been attempted.  He advised that he had recently used the helpline to file his property tax return.  Revenue immediately contacted Abtran, the company that operates the LPT helpline on our behalf.  Using sophisticated call recording technology, Abtran quickly identified the agent who took the call, confirmed to us early on Friday morning that it had identified the individual and reported the incident to the Garda.  Subsequently, Abtran also confirmed that the Garda had met and interviewed the person in question.  Given the fact that the issue is still under investigation, it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further.<\/p><p>  Given the nature of the breach, we reported the issue to the Data Protection Commissioner on the Friday in question.  While we are continuing to work with his office, he has stated publicly that he is satisfied that Revenue acted correctly by reporting the incident and in the way we handled it.<\/p><p>  Over the weekend in question, Revenue officials were in constant contact with Abtran.  It subsequently transpired that the agent had inappropriately obtained the credit card details of 11 customers in total.  We issued a comprehensive public statement on Sunday, 12 May and engaged extensively with the media on Monday, 13 May to reassure the public.  I have already circulated copies of the relevant statements to the committee.<\/p><p>  Most importantly, I can confirm to the committee that, while the individual in question tried to effect transactions using some of the credit card details, he was not successful and no one suffered a loss.  I can also confirm that he was not a member of any payments authorised team within Abtran, had no authority to ask for those details and should not have done so.<\/p><p>  Senior Revenue officials have since met Abtran and conducted a full review of data security and personnel vetting arrangements.  The company, which is accredited to internationally recognised standards, including certification for payments security and ISO 27001, has on foot of its own internal investigations assured us that the incident was an isolated matter involving a single individual.<\/p><p>  Regarding systems and technology, I wish to clarify that no Abtran employee has any access to Revenue's computer systems.  These are fully secure and were not impacted on in any way by this incident.<\/p><p>  Thankfully, the issue does not seem to have had a negative impact on the number of customers choosing to file their property tax returns by telephone.  In fact, one of the reasons we decided to extend the filing deadline until 8 p.m. today was the volume of requests received yesterday to file over the telephone, approximately 8,000.<\/p><p>  The outcome of the voluntary phase of the LPT has been successful to date and I am pleased to be able to advise the committee that LPT returns have been filed in respect of 1.52 million properties, a slight increase on the number cited in the information provided to members.  Returns are being received this morning at the rate of 2,000 per hour.  Next week, when the Department of Finance announces the May Exchequer figures, I expect that it will include more than &euro;100 million of this new tax, transferred by Revenue to the Exchequer.  This result is a credit to the work of teams of people in Revenue and, more importantly, to the taxpayers who responded and shows once again that voluntary tax compliance is high in this country.<\/p> <p>These numbers do not include about 160,000 properties for which local authorities or social housing groups are liable, and for which special payment provisions were made in legislation.  Those bodies will be filing by separate arrangements with us, and including these will bring the voluntary compliance figure to 1.68 million properties.<\/p><p> I need to explain at the outset that detailed analysis of the returns will take some time and I hope the committee will appreciate that I do not have many detailed facts and figures today, bearing in mind that more than 400,000 returns have been filed since last Friday evening.  We have, however, done some work at a high level this morning and I have some preliminary data which I can share with the committee.  For example, 22% of filers filed a paper return, 73% filed online and 5% filed by telephone or through the local tax office network.  Provisionally, I can say that approximately 3% opted for deferral or exemption, and this figure is smaller than was originally estimated by the Department of Finance.  I can also give some preliminary information on the range of payment options chosen.  For example, 46% paid using debit or credit cards, 15% of people have paid by cheque or single debit authority, 27% have opted for direct debit, 5% have opted for voluntary deduction at source and 7% have opted to pay through the external service providers.  These percentages were reasonably constant, even when numbers increased.<\/p><p> As I mentioned, the next steps in this project include activating the various payment options chosen, including by sending files to employers and Departments.  After that we will be moving into compliance mode and we have already begun to identify non-engagers for follow-up action.  We owe no less to all the compliant taxpayers who have voluntarily filed their returns in such large numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369838400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Each of the main spokespersons will have ten minutes and there will be five minutes for others, as there are many members who would like to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900004#C00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1369838400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Feehily and her colleagues.

The committee will consider this on a wider scale at a later stage but it would be appropriate at the end of the meeting.<\/p><p>  I do not want to rehash the old ground or go into the issues around the figures.  The CSO's estimate of permanent dwelling houses in this State is probably the most accurate.  The CSO's 2011 report is handy for Revenue because it states \"It is a fact there are 1,994,845 permanent dwelling houses in the State\" and it breaks it down into how many are holiday homes and so on.  I take Ms Feehily's point that some of those may be involved in trade or be exempt.  Mobile homes or demountables are excluded from those figures.  These would be citizens who would register their own properties.  Returns have not been made in the case of almost 300,000 dwellings.  How will Revenue continue to focus in on the 100,000?  What will happen to the other figure?  The census is the most accurate version of what is there but there are other sources also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900006#E01400","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369839600,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Obviously, we have looked at that.  The problem is that its definition is not the same as ours, or the definition in legislation.  For example, it counts bed-sits but we do not.  They are not liable.  There were 230,000 vacant properties on census night, so one is down to enumerators making decisions about what they were and what they were not.  A significant number of people classified themselves as living in a property rent free.  We do not know if they are liable or someone else is the owner.  I am not in any way disagreeing.<\/p> <p>Experts differ but I have no problem accepting that the number is somewhere north of 1.9 million.  It could be 1.95 million.  That is our take on that issue and we have been working with the CSO to ensure that we fully understood the data it had and what did not apply to us.  <\/p><p> To return to what I said earlier when I was discussing the numbers with Deputy McGrath, whatever the number is, we have a compliance rate of over 80%.  There is no other way to look at this.  Whether it is 1.9 million or 2 million, we have a very high compliance rate.  For me that is really important, because we do not like - despite what people might think - to be in the enforcement business.  We much prefer to be dealing with voluntary compliance.  We will have a clearer picture when we get the full schedules from the local authorities and so forth and when we get whatever number of returns that are filed tonight.  As I said, we have about 40,000 stock-in-trade.  The Collector General has about 150,000 work items, some of which will be people who actually filed a return on the basis that they did not have a property ID on paper.  So that is why I am saying I think we have another considerable proportion of that under control.  I only see a risky number of approximately 100,000.  That is my logic.  We have 1.72 million properties on the register.  We have a different 1.72 million that are voluntarily compliant.  It is unfortunate that the numbers are the same, which makes it somewhat confusing.  If we take the register that we have of properties that we know or think we know, and add the local authorities to that, we get to 1.88 million.  Therefore the gap, no matter how one cuts it and even if the census is absolutely accurate, is not much more than the 100,000 that I mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900006#E01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369840200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>The figure for deferrals and exemptions is 3%.

We very much value their time.  Nobody, especially politicians, likes to be in a position of imposing taxes on people as we are aware of the burdens and difficulties they face.  I compliment the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and her staff on the way in which the issue has been dealt with.  If it has to be done it is worth doing well.  It also addresses a question we have asked ourselves as a people.  The Irish people are tax-compliant.  Reference was made by another Deputy to the \"No\" side but that is a small number of people.  In those compliments I include the agents who acted on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners.  There was to be an item on the agenda today about a company from Cork but it has not been mentioned by any of the questioners.  That incident, if it is a serious one, has to be investigated.  In the scheme of things, given the 1.6 million applications, it reflects well on the Revenue Commissioners and the agents it has used.<\/p><p>  May I ask a few specific questions?  First, there is a gap between the number of people who are paying the local property tax and the number who paid the household charge.  A couple of hundred thousand people will become customers of the Revenue Commissioners in the coming months.  It may be fair to say in many cases that because people have paid the local property tax they are mindful of being tax-compliant.  Will the same methods of payment through employers and over terms be applied to those who, to date, have not paid the household charge?  Second, all Members of the Oireachtas have had genuine people call who would like to pay but do not have access to the Internet.  There has been a peak in that regard in recent days.  I was interested to hear the witnesses' comments to the effect that if they get in quickly they will not be late.  Perhaps that issue could be teased out a little more, bearing in mind that this will probably be broadcast on the \"Nine News\" or \"Oireachtas Report\", by which time the deadline will have expired.  My own sense is that there are still a large number of people who would like to pay.  However, they would like to know whether, if they pay reasonably quickly, they will have the same facility to pay at source and over the same spread-out period and what penalties, if any, will be imposed.<\/p><p>  My third brief question is specific.  Already I have heard from a person who wished to change the form he or she had submitted.  The person had deferred and later worked out that it would cost &euro;2 per week and decided not to defer.  When we made contact, it was unclear how the person could pull back into the non-deferral system.  How can that be done?  I appreciate that the valuation on the house is for three years and that appears to be fairly firm.  In Cork there are areas that have been affected by, for example, flooding events.  As circumstances may change and the value of houses may fall, will people be able to change the valuations of their houses in exceptional circumstances?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900010#J02100","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369842000,"counter":247,"content":"<p>On the first question about the &euro;200 household charge, it is a source of some disappointment to me.  I still think people should pay it to the Local Government Management Agency, because it is considerably cheaper, at &euro;144, if they pay before 1 July.  It is better if they do that because it will be &euro;200 when it comes to us in July.  That is my advertisement.  It is really important.  I take the Deputy's point.  If people have paid the local property tax but not the household charge and they have a mind to be compliant, they should be compliant at the cheaper rate in their own interest.  If they leave it over, we will give them the same phased payment arrangements.  If they wish to have it deducted from their salaries and so on, that is fine; we will do that.<\/p><p>  With regard to people who want to withdraw a deferral, they can do it through the helpline.  We hope that people who want to change their minds may wait until we get past the peak of today and tomorrow.  I was going to say they could write in but Mr. Gladney says they will be able to do it on the telephone. If they phone the helpline we can lift their deferral applications.  Self-assessment means that their deferral is accepted at face value.  They have chosen a deferral option.  We will check a handful of them, as we always do, proportionally on a risk basis in due course.  The deferral option is available, and if they want to lift it that is fine.  When we get past the peak we will probably provide options for people to make some changes to their filing online on a self-assessment basis.<\/p> <p>That is for the autumn, though, because we have to get past this peak yet.<\/p><p> The valuation question is trickier because in the legislation the valuation date is 1 May.  Therefore, we have been operating on the basis that the property market, generally speaking, will either stabilise or go slightly up.  Keeping the valuation at 1 May for three and a half years was seen as somewhat beneficial.  The 1 May date was fixed and the idea of varying the valuation within the three and a half year period was simply not in the legislation, unless someone made a major mistake.  Certainly, there are opportunities to correct errors.  If a person discovers she has made a major error in a panic, running in to us yesterday, there is room for discussion, but the valuation date is May 2013, not May 2014, 2015 or 2016.  Therefore, if something happens it is not provided for in the legislation for a valuation to go downwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900010#J02200","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369842600,"counter":249,"content":"<p>We must move on to the next speaker because time is running out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900011#K00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1369842600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Feehily and welcome her.

I am sorry for giving such a glib answer.  I disagree, respectfully.  This is voluntary compliance.  It is the same as any other tax.

That is voluntary compliance in the context in which the law provides consequences.  This phase is the same phase that occurs with any other tax in a self-assessment system when people comply.  Often they comply because they do not like the alternative, but it is no different to other taxes.

I am sorry Deputy Fleming is not here because he gave me grief at the PAC about this issue.  If we begin later they will have fewer weeks and months over which to spread the payment.  That is the reason we are starting with people in the PAYE sector and the occupational pension sector.  The reason the social welfare category comes next is that anyone whose only income is a social welfare payment is, by definition, entitled to a deferral and we will be reminding them of that fact.  That is simply a fact of the numbers.  If a person's only income is a social welfare payment of any kind then, by definition, she is entitled to a deferral.  While we are moving at one level to deal with PAYE workers, we will be reminding people whose only income is social welfare that they should have claimed a deferral.  That is the categorisation.  The reason I maintain it is about right is that the self-assessed are not left to the end.

We cannot comment nor do we comment on cases.<\/p><p>  However, I have noted the Government position that there are no special deals on tax with any company.  This has been confirmed by a statement from Tim Cook this morning, as I understand.  I can certainly assure the committee that Revenue does not do special deals on tax rates for any company of any size.  I am speaking in general and not about any company in particular.<\/p> <p>Our tax system is statute-based and transparent.  I have no role in changing it.<\/p><p> Global businesses and global tax arbitrage comprise an extremely complex area of work for us.  It is an area which raises complex policy issues and complex global political issues which need to be considered in the first instance at the policy and political levels, long before they reach us as tax administrators.  In my view - the Government has said this, but I wish to give members my perspective - these issues can only be resolved by direct engagement at OECD and EU level.  Reference has been made in the commentary to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, BEPS, report.  The work on that report is supported by Revenue officials in numerous working parties in the OECD.  We are working closely with people from other tax administrations in this regard.  The Forum on Tax Administration is where tax commissioners meet under the auspices of the OECD.  The week before last, 55 of us met in this capacity under my chairmanship, where we considered what our role as tax commissioners should be in the context of the BEPS report.  We announced in our final <i>communiqu&eacute;<\/i>that we stand ready to implement the action plan whenever it emerges from the policy considerations that are to come.<\/p><p> In summary, our position in regard to global tax compliance is that it is a global issue.  Countries on their own cannot resolve it, not even if, in Ireland's case, we had 1 million people working in Revenue.  We stand absolutely ready, however, to implement any of the actions that are decided on by the OECD.  Information, particularly third-party information, is the lifeblood of tax administration.  We have very strong exchange of information arrangements with other tax authorities.  I expect the United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, FATCA, will prove useful to us in this regard.  I welcome the move by the European Union, under the Irish Presidency, towards greater exchange of information that will give us access to data.  This is in a different space entirely to the other issue; it is not about BEPS but about evasion.  At the meeting I referred to and which I chaired, the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom announced that they have put together something like 400 GB of data which they intend to share with us under treaty arrangements.  We are very active globally with our administration colleagues once the policy issues have been resolved and are passed down to us to deal with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900013#M04900","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369844400,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Feehily.

I am not convinced there is a special arrangement for particular companies in the manner reported in the media.  Our taxation code has been designed in a way that allows for companies - I am not singling out any particular organisation - to avoid paying tax on profits.  They are able to do so in a legal way.  It is not that individual companies are being charged a lower rate but that they are able to fit into the code in such a way that it allows them not to pay.<\/p><p>  In 1999, following a report by the Department of Finance, there was a closure of significant loopholes for Irish incorporated companies that were non-tax resident in this jurisdiction.  There were serious questions in regard to a number of those companies, with some possibly being involved in criminal activity.  I am not making those accusations; the information comes from a note by the Department.  The 1999 changes dealt with part of this problem.<\/p><p>  In that context, while I agree that tax evasion must be tackled at the global level, is it not also the case that loopholes can be closed on a state-by-state basis?  Does Ms Feehily subscribe to the notion that a company incorporated in this State and non-tax resident in this jurisdiction which is also non-tax resident in any other country in the world should, by default, become tax resident here as a result of its incorporation?  In other words, if a company wants to be non-tax resident and incorporated here, it would have to show that its management control is outside of this State.  What I am proposing here is that there should be an additional clause such that a company must show it is tax resident in another country and, if not, the process of incorporation in this State would mean it is automatically tax resident here.  That would close down a loophole for companies whose multiple billions of euro in profit are swilling in and out of coffers in this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900014#N00500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369844400,"counter":347,"content":"<p>The Deputy answered the question himself by asking whether I subscribe to the view he articulated.

They have in place, therefore, a veil of impermeability and the Revenue cannot remove funds from their PAYE revenues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900015#O00200","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369845000,"counter":366,"content":"<p>We can issue section 214 letters and liquidate them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900015#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1369845000,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I know that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900015#O00400","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369845000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>When we carry out audit interventions, the businesses we audit would not recognise the Deputy's description I suspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900015#O00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1369845000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Let us not discuss that matter now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900015#O00600","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1369845000,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Another matter to which I wish to refer relates to the incorporation of companies which seem to hover outside jurisdictions-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900015#O00700","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1369845000,"counter":371,"content":"<p>We are running over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900015#O00800","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1369845000,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I just wish to make one point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900015#O00900","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1369845000,"counter":373,"content":"<p>No, the Deputy may not do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900015#O01000","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1369845000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Would it be technically possible-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900015#O01100","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1369845000,"counter":375,"content":"<p>It is the same every week with the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900015#O01200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1369845000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>-----to introduce a 1% levy in respect of all the money which flows through incorporated companies that might not, by current definition, be resident here for tax purposes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900015#O01300","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1369845000,"counter":377,"content":"<p>That is an issue for the Minister rather than the Revenue Commissioners.

The purpose of the meeting is to mark Africa Day, 25 May, by focusing on aspects of Ireland's long-standing relationship with the continent.  Africa Day falls on the anniversary of the establishment of the African Union and is a day designated by African leaders to highlight African unity.  The Government's Africa strategy which was launched by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in 2011 drew attention to the fact that Africa was undergoing significant and rapid change.  Despite the development challenges, many sub-Saharan African countries have experienced greater economic growth, more trade, more investment, fewer wars and greater democratic participation than ever before.<\/p><p>  Alongside its long-standing development co-operation relationship, Ireland is moving towards a more balanced and mature set of relationships with African countries, reflecting the views of African countries that job creation, foreign direct investment, trade and private sector development are the drivers of future growth and development.  Trade and investment are very important elements of the route out of poverty for developing countries and essential for sustainable development.  This is recognised clearly in One World, One Future, the Government's policy on international development which was launched recently.  In that policy document Irish Aid sets out a clear strategy for helping the least developed countries to increase trade with a view to achieving sustainable economic growth.  In that context, it is appropriate that we will discuss the development of trade and investment in Africa with two NGOs whose work is focused on this area.  Value Added in Africa facilitates sustainable trade links between businesses in Africa and those in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe.  Traidlinks aims to build links between the Irish and business communities and the Irish Aid programme in developing countries, with a particular focus on Uganda, with the objective of promoting poverty relief and the advancement of education.<\/p><p>  Our first guest is Mr. Conall O'Caoimh, director of Value Added in Africa, who is very welcome.  The usual warning prevails.  If he is directed by the Chairman to cease making remarks in a particular fashion, he must do so.  Only evidence on the subject matter of the meeting is to be given and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Other than this, he has free rein.<\/p><p>  I remind members to switch off their mobile phones or place them in an area beyond the scope of the broadcasting equipment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900003#B00300","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369834200,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman for inviting me and greatly appreciate the opportunity to address the joint committee.  We are delighted to celebrate Africa Week and note that the committee is hosting this meeting as part of the events of that week.  The chairperson of Value Added in Africa and some of my colleagues are in the Visitors Gallery.  Ours is an Irish-initiated fair trade organisation and a registered charity.  We started in 2008 just as the economy started to plummet.  Therefore, we came along at a challenging time in introducing new products.  As a result of the recession and because of the size of the market here, we started to look to Britain where Value Added in Africa is registered as a not-for-profit organisation to help African producers to find larger markets.<\/p> <p> We are funded by our own fund-raising events, including by a number of families who give us very generous support for which we are grateful, by a small bit of commission we get on any sale we facilitate and by Irish Aid, Tr&oacute;caire, Concern and Electric Aid.  <\/p><p> The reason we set up the organisation connects very strongly with Ireland and with its experience of beef exports.  The members will know very well the story of exporting Irish beef on the hoof, the cattle walking onto the ship bound for Britain and somebody there making the money on that trade and selling the product back to us.  That moment of realisation or light-bulb moment is where many of the African countries are at.  An example of that in the case of coffee is shown in the presentation.  Kenya earns three times more when it sells its coffee roasted, packaged in an attractive bag and meeting all the food safety standards - we are delighted that the Kenyan ambassador is here today - than when it sells the raw beans to Nestl&eacute; or whichever other company wishes to buy them. That price difference is what will be a significant driver of economic development and poverty reduction.<\/p><p> African producers are beginning to move up the value chain, it has had a traditional sector of primary commodity production and now an emerging sector, which is still small and fragile, is beginning to process and achieve world standards.  Those in that sector are also supplying to the local market.  We come into that chain in the middle as a link, linking them to importers and distribution companies who will bring that product through to the market in order that the value goes back to both the primary producers and the people in the factories who make those products.  Our mission is to create a channel for African goods to come into the market.  There is a lack of information among business people here.  There is a bias against African products coming in here; people are afraid of this trade.  There is a network of institutional practices that make it very difficult for African producers, particularly small ones, to sell good products into the market.  That is why we are there as a link, a facilitator or a matchmaker which brings the two sides together.<\/p><p> This week we want to draw attention to the One World, One Future policy, and I thank the Vice Chairman for his comments on that policy at the outset.  We strongly welcome the policy document.  It opens with the very first sentence referring to moving beyond aid and we need to do that.  The question then is - what will this thing after aid be like?  The Africa strategy comments on that being an equal and mature partnership.  That will involve a range of actors, including NGOs but not only NGOs.  There will be quite a range of other actors and the private sector will have role in that.  The commercialisation of people's produce will also have a very important role in that.<\/p><p> Connecting with Ireland's other foreign affairs interests is an issue that comes across very strongly in the paper.  We can well understand that in looking to the taxpayer to support an aid programme, it is very important to appeal not only to people's moral sense of obligation but also to the public interest where there can be synergies, to use the term that is mentioned in the paper.  The paper leaves a number of questions wide open around what happens next and that is the area in which we are particularly interested.  There is no mention in the paper of value addition.  It strongly refers to allowing people to move to trade and build trade relationships but there is no mention of processing, moving up the value chain and producers capturing more of the value.  There is none of that language in the report and that is quite a concern for us.  When it comes to the next stage of fleshing out what is to happen, we would like significant attention to be given to fleshing out that.  We have the examples of Irish beef or the coffee example which show that poverty reduction will not be achieved by just increasing trade.  <\/p><p> Some later slides in the presentation are graphs setting out the commodities exported from African countries which show that the prices that one gets for raw materials have been steadily declining since the time of the industrial revolution.  Primary producers will produce more to get a better income but the more they produce the more it pushes the price down. That is what we refer to as the trade trap. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conall O'Caoimh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369834500,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I beg your pardon, the trade what?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900004#C00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369834500,"counter":393,"content":"<p>The trade trap.  The more producers produces the more the price goes down and, therefore, the more they have to produce to keep their income at a constant level.<\/p><p>  I accessed the freshest data from the EUROSTAT database last week.  Deputy O'Sullivan was present a few years ago when we a launched a big report that Irish Aid commissioned us to do on examining Ireland's trade with the programme countries.  The EUROSTAT data show that in the 1990s in an average year we sold seven times more than we bought from the six programme countries, but in the past five years that ratio is now 43:1.  The paper refers to a mature relationship with Africa.  The Africa strategy refers to two-way trade and yet when we examine the trade that has happened, we have gone from a ratio of 7:1, which was bad enough, to 43:1.  Ireland, for very good reasons, wants to grow its exports to Africa.  If we are to do that and want to have a two-way trade relationship, we need to put in significant effort to grow the trade in the opposite direction.  The new aid policy, One World, One Future, is very good but a good deal of work needs to be done now to identify how are we going to achieve that two-way trade relationship.  That is something that will need to be monitored in the coming years to see how that progresses.<br \/> The paper refers to no tied aid and that is very good.  A number of European countries have pretty poor practice in that respect, therefore, it is very good to see Irish Aid committing to that.  However it refers to synergies and finding, where we can, synergies between the aid programme and Irish business interests.  I can understand that very well and the committee will have a role in devising a mechanism for ensuring that searching for synergies does not become a criterion alongside poverty reduction.  Poverty reduction must be the criterion in deciding where our aid money goes.  If synergies are a by-product fair enough, but they should not be a criterion in the decision making around where aid would go.<\/p><p>  I suggest the next steps are that we would decide on a few key objectives underneath the heading of two-way trade.  What do we mean by that?  What is it in a five-year or ten-year framework that we want to achieve in regard to building two-way trade?   What are some of the interim steps?  Let us do a data analysis and find the baseline in terms of what is happening.  I have set out some headline figures but we need to examine this on a country by country basis to see in which sectors will it be most possible to make some ground, how we will find that out, and then track that progress.  We should examine what other counties are doing.  The Netherlands, in its enlightenment, has had an organisation, CBI, established for a good number of years and members can check its website, <i><i>cbi.eu<\/i><\/i>.   CBI is a government agency of the Netherlands and its task is to grow the Netherlands' imports from developing countries.  We collaborate actively with CBI in Kenya and in a few other countries.  That agency actively seeks to promote imports from developing countries and this is to ensure that the Netherlands lives up to its rhetoric about two-way trade.  DANIDA, the Danish programme, and UK Aid both have strategies for a start - they are documented strategies - and they also have budgets for the areas that can ensure that two-way trade means something.  There is a policy, a strategy and a budget, which is where such trade starts to happen.  We need those three components to be in place.  <\/p><p>  We need to prioritise some areas where Ireland has a particular expertise and where it will be of particular interest to developing countries.  Food processing, packaging, food safety and marketing would be some of those areas.<\/p> <p>The other slides contain background information for members of the committee.  However, I might mention the final two.  One contains a table showing a supply chain from one producer with whom we work and who was in Ireland recently.  This is a co-op run mostly by a group of women farmers near Mount Kenya.  When they process their fruit and sell it as jam rather than fresh fruit, the local rural economy earns 19 times more than the pittance it gets when they export their fresh fruit.  The final slide is another Kenyan example.  The woman shown on the slide taught me how to pick tea leaves.  She is a shareholder in her co-operative, which is Fairtrade certified.  Her tea is on sale in Marks &amp;amp; Spencer as a fully finished teabag from Africa which consumers here can buy.  There are no middle people between her and Marks &amp;amp; Spencer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conall O'Caoimh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369835100,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Caoimh for his presentation, which was interesting.  It is heartening that we are moving away from the emphasis on aid that existed in the past and are talking about trade, development and investment in Africa, a continent of 50-plus countries.  I was somewhat alarmed to hear of a bias against products coming from Africa.  We have international trading rules.  The World Organisation for Animal Health, OIE, has standards that must be achieved for food that is internationally traded.  Perhaps he would elaborate on that issue.  I mentioned the World Trade Organization previously in a different context.  There is a need for a need for a plenary session and a new deal for developing countries.  That is one issue that has gone off the political agenda throughout the developed world, or at least that is how it appears to me from the outside.  It is an area on which there should be a greater emphasis in the different forums and by NGOs in all countries.<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Caoimh also mentioned the huge disparity in the export-import ratio.  His presentation showed that between 2008 and 2012 the ratio increased from 7:1 to 43:1.  Was this due to additional exports or was there a fall-off in imports?  Were there some particular products, such as pharmaceuticals, medical appliances or whatever, that resulted in that huge disparity?<\/p><p>  I am not familiar with Mr. O'Caoimh's work but I compliment Irish Aid, Tr&oacute;caire and other NGOs on giving him some assistance.

I did not read the second handout but worked off the earlier briefing notes.  Perhaps he will assist me in understanding exactly what he does.  From reading his notes, it appears he is targeting work that has already been done by the producers.  In other words, he said he targets groups that already have a proven high-quality product and, in fact, are export-ready.  He also said he works with companies that are already achieving a presence in other European countries.  His use of the name \"Fairtrade\" threw me in the context of what he said, which was that he is targeting the marketing of goods and produce from established groups.  As we all know, Fairtrade starts practically in the womb.  The farmers produce goods where there is a collective agreement and a specific policy on fertilisation, child labour and redistribution of profits to the community or the bringing in of a water supply.  In order that I do not confuse this with Fairtrade, Mr. O'Caoimh is targeting those producers of goods who already have a proven record in terms of quality and have already possibly penetrated the European market.  That is excellent.  It is great that we can look at Africa in this light and that we are not thinking of it as a continent that needs financial assistance to help the starving.  This is progressive and it is the way forward, but there is confusion as to whether Fairtrade plays a role in Mr. O'Caoimh's organisation.  Is that accidental?  Already, Fairtrade Ireland has been working with people who produce good-quality produce ready for the market.  Is it the case that Mr. O'Caoimh gives it a helping hand to perhaps package it more effectively?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900005#D00400","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1369835100,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I compliment Mr. O'Caoimh on his clear and lucid presentation.  There are elements of hope in it.  Deputy Brendan Smith has already raised a question about which I was concerned, but I would like to explore it a little further.  I am talking about political bias.  What is the nature of the bias?  What measures can be taken to overcome that bias?  Is there a way in which the committee can assist?  He instanced particular products that were involved.  Can he say something about the chocolate industry, which been a concern for this committee for some time?  Personally, I have been very concerned about it.<\/p><p>  It is staggering that in a short space of time the balance of trade has disimproved so drastically, with the export-import ratio increasing from 6:1 to 43:1.  I do not think the majority of people, even politically aware people, understand that.  Certainly, I was not aware that it was quite so dramatic.  His explanation was about the paradox of what he described - accurately, I believe - as the trade trap, whereby, as producers make more raw goods, the prices of these goods decrease.  This is something that needs to be addressed, and perhaps the committee could take it up.<\/p><p>  I might broaden things out a little.  I appreciate that both presentations are about trade.  The intention is humanitarian and it is to make life better for people.  Mr. O'Caoimh invokes the One World, One Future document.  One of my concerns about that document is a complete absence of any reference to population policy.  This committee needs to keep an eye on that and ensure this is under review.  In particular, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade said on 21 February that the issue of gender equality and access to reproductive health care came out strongly in the public consultation on the review of the White Paper and will be addressed in the new policy.  We have not heard the results of that public consultation or any of the submissions, and once again we are avoiding it.  I say that because every year I go to the launch of the UN report on global population.  We never mention population.  We avoid it all the time.  That has an economic impact in Africa.  In case anybody thinks I am biased, may I say that I delight when I hear the population is declining in France, Britain, Germany or Ireland, because we do much more damage.  It is still critical in Africa.  If we adhered to all the millennium development goals to which we signed up in 2000, one of which was to make family planning universally available by 2015 as part of a broad approach to reproductive health and rights, we are doing so under cover.  That would lead to a 27% drop in maternal deaths.  We have wonderful women such as the women who are making jam.<\/p> <p>There is an inarguable case for bringing that in.  Mr. O'Caoimh's organisation is so valuable because it is not trading for profit but seeking a rebalancing in favour of Africa.

There is no doubt that there is an added dimension to our relationship with Africa given the trade issue, but it was alarming to see the import-export imbalance.

I will start with the question on my organisation as my answering it is certainly a preliminary step in understanding some of the other questions.  We consider our organisation to be a fair trade organisation in that we are seeking to make trade fairer.  Members will know the Fairtrade label.  The trade union movement, the credit union movement, the co-operative movement and the groups that lobby the World Trade Organization are all part of a movement.  I was before this committee a number of times during the terms of previous D&aacute;la in that my background involves my having worked on and campaigned on the trade rules.  People who do this and those who watch what the multinationals are doing, including what happened in Bangladesh recently, are part of different branches of a movement that is the fair trade movement.  It has a number of strands.  It is probably the one with the label on the chocolate or coffee that people identify with most, but all are working together to try to achieve fair trade.<\/p><p>  In 1996, I was in Mozambique and that is where I first had the idea for this organisation.  I returned and got a job in Comhl&aacute;mh and later in D&oacute;chas working on the trade rules policy.  While we were working on getting the rules right at the World Trade Organization &ndash; I was in Doha, Hong Kong and Canc&uacute;n processing the rules &ndash; it was acknowledged that African countries and other developing countries need support to actually build the business relationships that will result in trade.<\/p><p>  Our first task is to identify producers.  Michelle Hardiman, my colleague in the Gallery, recently travelled around southern Africa trying to find a fully African T-shirt.  There are T-shirts but the cloth may be imported from India or China.  We are trying to get a fully African T-shirt.  We can get some but we do not know what happens on the farms.  We are trying to get T-shirts that have full certification regarding what happens on the farm.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Fairtrade label that members know, none of the Fairtrade-grown cotton is actually turned into thread in Africa.  It is all taken away to Asia and America to be turned into thread.  Therefore, we have had to examine some of the other systems; otherwise we cannot have a fully African T-shirt.  We are trying to propose to people in the market that they buy a fully African one.  There is the Cotton made in Africa initiative and the Better Cotton initiative, and there is a couple of organic schemes that measure and audit what happens on the farms.  We try to ensure that the factories are ones that pay workers well and which are audited internationally.  That is what we mean by fair trade.  We have beers from four different countries on the market.  That is probably the product I can point members to most easily.  If the bar of the Houses wants to host an event serving the beer, we can arrange for a supply.  We can help to arrange to match-make in that regard.<\/p><p>  Fairtrade does not certify beers, yet the brewery that we link with in Kenya has 970 people employed in the best quality jobs in that country.  They have the best conditions.  There are 5,000 farmers growing the input products and their conditions are the very same as Fairtrade conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900006#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conall O'Caoimh"},{"type":"speech","time":1369835700,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Is that Tuskser beer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900006#E00700","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369835700,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900006#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conall O'Caoimh"},{"type":"speech","time":1369835700,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I have it at home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900006#E00900","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369835700,"counter":407,"content":"<p>There are Fairtrade conditions in terms of trade union representation, guaranteed price, advance payment and agricultural extension but also a guaranteed sale, which Fairtrade does not give.

There are other organisations that help businesses to achieve certain results, such as getting the taste of their roasted coffee right.  There are relatively few in Ireland and most are international.  We are not experts in coffee roasting so we do not try to do that.  We focus on finding a way into markets.<\/p> <p> Deputy Neville asked about information and education.  We have a programme of education in Irish schools, supported by Irish Aid, Tr&oacute;caire and Concern.  We have a pack for transition year students to explain the difference.  We have a university programme, with the same funding and support, which addresses business students in order that they are more open to considering African products in the future.  <\/p><p> That brings us to the point on bias.  Unfortunately, while trade rules are the law when one holds a product in front of a buyer in Musgraves, Dunnes Stores or anywhere else, bias comes into play.  People do not know what is available and there is an information gap.  Everything might be right with a product and it might have international certification, but people are afraid that something will go wrong.  We have had a number of sore experiences which have cost us months of work - we put in a lot of work to prepare a supply chain for a buyer.  One person sat on an aircraft beside a businessman who told him to be careful.  The person concerned telephoned us and said he had to pull back because if anything went wrong he would not be able to afford the sting.  We engaged with the company for nine months and contracted an intern who worked on the product to get the best and strongest options.  A distributor who had significant reach in Irish and European markets was turned back by a conversation on an aircraft.

Ireland has increased its exports exponentially in recent years.  Part of the reason countries are buying a lot more is that they are growing.  It is in the interests of Irish taxpayers that they grow because there will be a bigger market for us to sell into.  What we buy from them has fallen to a quarter of what it was in 1996.  Since the crash of the Celtic tiger, and during it, our imports from the six countries to which we give the most aid collapsed.  Lyons tea bags are no longer made in Ireland.  When Unilever bought it and moved production to Britain, we stopped buying tea from a number of African countries.  When Fruit of the Loom closed we stopped buying cotton from a number of African countries.  As the nature of Irish industry changed, we no longer needed to buy commodities.  Industries collapsed because nothing was done to replace them.  The aid programme has a role in finding replacements as things fall off.<\/p><p>  We have a small operation in the UK.

One of the biggest changes in East Africa in the past number of years has been the introduction of mobile phones.  Money can be sent in Kenya and Tanzania with the bog-standard mobile phone.  While rural banks in Ireland are closing, in east Africa mobile phones have enabled people to leapfrog into a new generation of banking which is not based on an institution.  Formerly, a woman living on a hill had to pay a bus driver to bring her and her products to the market, where she would stand for a day.  If a regular buyer was not there to make purchases she would have to sell her product at a lower price.  She can now text her preferred buyer, agree a price and day, put the product onto a van, text the buyer to tell him or her it is coming and have the money texted to her.  Vodafone is operating in a number of countries and is making money.  Mobile phones have changed the business model.  Transaction costs are reduced and women are able to be productive.<\/p><p>  Significant multinationals are leveraging power.  Tea producers in Kenya and Rwanda currently sell bulk tea.  In the past month they have told us they make tea bags for the local market but cannot sell internationally because big international buyers might leave them if they try to compete with their products.  They are in fear that the multinationals will squeeze them out.  <\/p><p>  Fairtrade is similar to us, but the key difference is that the work it does is on farms, and its system does not reach into factories.  It does not distinguish whether product is turned into chocolate in Europe or Africa.  We are trying to emphasise that we only work with products that are fully processed and ready for consumers at the final stage in Africa. <\/p><p>  The basket of products coming from many African countries is the same as that under the colonial system.

I am afraid my presentation might be somewhat disordered, as I have forgotten my glasses and am unable to read the document I have prepared.  The submission, copies of which have been circulated to members, basically sets out the logic behind how Traidlinks sees the world and how it is evolving.  We describe ourselves as a business-led, not-for-profit organisation.  We are not quite a non-governmental organisation because we are involved in so many private-sector activities.  This causes some confusion in the countries in which we work.  We are a registered charity but prefer the label of \"business-led not-for-profit\" because the whole idea of Traidlinks is about involving and engaging the private sector in international development.  It is about working with governments and businesses.<\/p><p>  As members will see from the list of organisations represented on our board, there would be potential for serious damage to the economy of this country if all of our board members were on the same flight to Uganda.  We have representatives of Bewley's Limited, Barry's Tea, Tullow Oil, United Drug, Bimeda Ireland and Ion Equity.  In addition, Mr. Patrick Bitature, chairman of the Uganda Investment Authority, is a member of the board.  It is a very unusual organisation in that sense, being driven by the private sector and funded by Irish Aid, with additional funding from Tullow Oil and TradeMark East Africa.<\/p><p>  In a nutshell, one can look at Africa in two ways.  On the one hand, we have all the bad news such as the failure to reach targets under the millennium development goals.  Members of the committee will be very familiar with everything that is not being achieved.  On the other side of the coin, as illustrated by the statistics I have included in my submission from a report by the McKinsey Global Institute entitled Lions on the Move, there is enormous potential in the growth of Africa's economies, rising GDP and so on.  Just as there are two ways of looking at Africa, I have often observed that there are two views of the world.  The European view of development is very much focused on health, education and services.  The idea is to build good governance, judicial systems and so on and, coming out of that, we then build an economy.  The Chinese, on the other hand, consider this a novel view for the Europeans to take given that European societies did not themselves develop in that way.  It was the other way around, in fact, with somebody building a raft at a fjord in a river and somebody else opening a shebeen next door.  Before we know it we have a business and then somebody says we must have a church and a school.  That is how it went.  On that basis, the Chinese reverse the European approach and argue that the economy comes first and the services sector will follow.  They wonder why we insist on doing it the other way around in Africa.  It is a simplistic way of looking at the world, but it also presents us with a challenge.  As I have pointed out in the submission, the White Paper could be likened to a Rubik's cube, with each side representing the different areas of action.  The difficulty arises because people tend to focus on one side of the cube, whether health, education, HIV-AIDS or something else.  The trick is to focus on all aspects.  Otherwise, the blues will be lined up but the reds will be all over the place.  That will get us nowhere.<\/p><p>  I recently invited a senior consultant from Accenture, a company renowned for its analytical prowess, to come to Traidlinks.  He asked me a very simple question which, he said, he asked of all international NGOs, large and small.  The question was, since people in Africa tend to be poor because they do not have any money, what is our organisation doing to solve that problem?  He remarked that people often give him lectures about health and education in response to that question, but he always replies that those issues could be solved if the money was there.  It is a simple proposition with a challenging implementation.  The question we are asking ourselves is how we can create wealth and jobs.  It is complex in one sense but simple in another.<\/p><p>  Mr. Conall O'Caoimh observed that trade is essential for Africa, specifically value-added trade.  Africa has been trading forever, from its slaves to its coffee, but there has been no value accruing to the continent.  That is a particular problem.  We in Traidlinks believe in trade, business creation, wealth creation and support for small and medium-sized enterprises.  We position ourselves just above the co-operative level - that is, not getting down to farmer-to-farmer level.  Our main focus is on small and medium-sized business but not necessarily at the micro-finance level, in which lots of people are already involved.  Our challenge, in short, is to help businesses to grow.  In Uganda people often say they need more entrepreneurs.  In fact, that is the last thing the country needs because there are probably 39 million entrepreneurs.  What is actually needed are structured businesses with structured finance.  We need people in those businesses who know about marketing, communications, technology and business processes.  This is the dynamic in which we see Traidlinks positioning itself.  We are not operating as an NGO, coming in and saying we will set up programmes.  Rather, we are working on a partnership model with key institutions.  Our key interlocutors in Uganda are the Uganda Export Promotion Board and the Uganda Investment Authority, which are the equivalent, respectively, of An Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland.  They are, however, very weak institutions.  The Uganda Export Promotion Board, for example, has a budget of some &euro;300,000 to promote exports from a country of 39 million people.  Compare this with An Bord Bia, which has a budget of &euro;45 million to promote food products from Ireland and within Ireland.  That is a good example of the structural problems within the business sector in Africa.  There are, in fact, very few business support services or Government institutions of any weight.  This is to some extent a symptom of development, in that whatever resources are available are going into education, health and so on.  The business sector, on the other hand, and the institutions that support it have been neglected.  Those institutions are simply not in a fit state to help companies to get established and grow.  Hence we have had the flood of commodities out of the country through the various extractive industries and the Chinese coming in and taking whatever there is to be taken.<\/p><p>  Traidlinks has done a significant amount of work in this country in marketing African products.  We created a brand called Heart of Africa and imported large numbers of products into Ireland which were sold in Tesco, Superquinn, SuperValu and so on.  This project hit a wall for two reasons, the first being the recession.  I am sure Mr. O'Caoimh spoke about how difficult it is to get products into economies that are experiencing recession.  The second factor was supply.  People in Uganda were delighted to have a container of dried mango ready to ship to Ireland.<\/p> <p>However, we explained that they needed to send another one the week after and another the week after that, but they said they had no money.  When one examines the business, one realises it is not a money problem but another issue, that is, a management problem.  Some people always say it is a money problem.  That is what has come out of Traidlinks.<\/p><p> Our core function was to regroup and rethink.  We realised we should get companies to focus on regional trade, that is, trade between Uganda and Rwanda, between Uganda and Tanzania and between Tanzania and Kenya.  How do we help them to do this?  It is an easier step because the destination is next door and they speak the same languages and so on.  We have set up a market link programme funded by Irish Aid and, increasingly, TradeMark East Africa.  It is working well.  A trade mission from Uganda is in Rwanda.  It was organised by Traidlinks and the Uganda Export Promotion Board.  The group is in Rwanda trading everything from women's cosmetics, cables and plastic jerry cans to foam mattresses.  It is basic stuff, but all of it is cross-border and has been produced in Uganda.<\/p><p> The programme is expanding to become a regional programme.  The Rwandans like it and want to have it the other way around also.  We have run a pilot scheme in Rwanda and are now working with TradeMark East Africa.  I draw the attention of committee members to the group in case they are unaware of it.  It is a new grouping of donors driven by the British, the Danes, the Dutch, the Swedes and the Finns.  It is only four years old, but it has a budget of approximately $500 million.  They are creating economic corridors in east Africa, deepening ports, developing infrastructure, cross-border trading, information technology systems and figuring out how to bring the barriers down.  If it takes a container 17 stops to get from Mombasa to Kampala, what are the 17 stops?  There are two official stops along the route and 15 for corruption.  The question is how to stop this and iron it out of the system.<\/p><p> This is what TradeMark East Africa is doing.  In one sense, it is doing macro stuff.  We are working with the organisation because we believe Ireland has a particular niche in this regard at firm level.  I am referring to when the rubber hits the road.  I put it to representatives of TradeMark East Africa that they could build infrastructure, carry out macro projects, deepen ports and so on, but the question is whether this is providing a platform for imports or a launching pad for exports.  If a trader cannot get a label on his or her product or cannot secure the correct safety regulation, certificate of origin or certificate of compliance for the European Union, he or she cannot export anything.  He or she cannot get beyond first base and add value.  One always ends up with these commodities.<\/p><p> With TradeMark East Africa, we are focusing on the firm, how to improve the quality of the product, how to have people trained and how to build their confidence because much of this is about the confidence of the people concerned to export.  The other major question is whether they are making money.  Many wish to export, but if they are asked whether they are making any money on the product, they say they are unsure.  Why would one want to export something if one is unsure whether it is making money?  These are the practical things we are about as an organisation.  That is what we do with the market link programme and it is expanding.  Our problem is that it is too small.  It should be increased by a factor of ten if we are to be serious about it.  We need to scale and crank it up.<\/p><p> We are working with another unusual partner, that is, the extractive industries in oil and gas production in Uganda.  Much oil has been discovered in east Africa.  It has been discovered in Ethiopia; oil is pouring out of Sudan and there are massive reserves in Kenya.  Reserves of 4 billion barrels have been recognised in Uganda, or between 2 and 4 billion barrels.  As we know in Ireland, one never quite knows the right figure and one is always unsure, but we know it is big figure.  The oil companies are investing between $6 billion and $8 billion in Uganda.  The return on this in terms of revenue streams to the government is in the region of hundreds of billions, or however many hundreds one wishes to put on it.  That is its scale and it will be over a long period.  <\/p><p> We see the oil and gas sector as a catalyst for developing the economy; we do not see it as the economy.  Oil and gas production needs standards and skills and so on at international standards level.  If one is seeking a job as a welder with Tullow Oil or Total in Uganda, one had better have a Lloyds certificate.  One cannot simply suggest one has welded a number of gates and now one is available to weld a pipeline for a company.  That does not work.  Everything will rise.  It is similar to what happened in Ireland when the transnationals came here.  One of the things that happened to us was that standards and the bar were raised.  We see the industry as catalytic, which is why we work closely with it.<\/p><p> We are working with the oil and gas companies on their supply chain because they will employ approximately 15,000 people in the coming years.  This means 15,000 people will need to be trained to international standards.  We are working with them on their sectoral needs, but we are also working with them on agricultural issues and how to get the spin-off from what they are doing to tumble into agriculture.  If an oil or gas company is training a person to fix a JCB, why can it not train the same person to fix a tractor?  Africa is plagued by a lack of technical assistance.  One problem in Africa is that people tend to head to universities before they head to the welding shop.  They want a degree before they have a certificate in welding.  We see the oil and gas sector as a catalyst to make it good for people to believe their future is as a construction worker, a welder or a plumber.  We also believe there is a responsibility on the oil and gas sector.  Africa has been plagued by the resource curse of oil.  It has gone over the top of countries and the economies have benefited little.  We work closely with Tullow Oil on national and local content and how we should progress these aspects.  We discuss how such companies should invest because it is their business to invest in this area and we are there as a partner to help them.  That is where we see ourselves going.  <\/p><p> Those of us involved in Traidlinks know the scale is ridiculously small.  We have a turnover of $1.6 million and it may be $2 million in a couple of years, but we know that is rather small, given the scale of what we need to do.  We have considered the White Paper and made recommendations that members of the committee can read.  If there are six sides to the Rubiks cube, the question is whether they are given equal weighting or is one side given more.  There is a need for a discussion, debate and to have a strategy fleshed out around it because therein lies the future.  Truthfully, if we do this right in Africa, there is a future for Ireland also in engaging with the continent.  Everyone one meets in Africa has been educated by the Irish.  They have health services in place.  I do not normally quote President Musevani, but at a meeting one day he put it to me that the Irish had helped them to build their education and health systems and if the Irish wished to come and do business and help them to build businesses, the door was open.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900008#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Maguinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369837500,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Maguinness for that interesting presentation.

Is that the relationship Tullow Oil has with Traidlinks?  I do not want to be cynical.  I live in hope that it is following in the footprints of the nice Irish Protestant and Catholic missionaries who travelled to Uganda before them.  The educational and health services have been praised by Africans.  Perhaps Tullow Oil is a new pioneer on the African continent.<\/p><p>   The interesting contrast between Mr. Maguinness's talk and the previous one was due to the fact that we in Ireland, as he will know, are  experts in food production and provide high-quality foods.  What is the problem with the two companies involved?  He mentioned the food produced by Out of Africa, although it has hit the wall or whatever.  He mentioned a similar named company, Heart of Africa, but neither seems to have done well, which is sad.  Where have we fallen down?  Are we targeting the wrong produce?

I have vivid memories of travelling on the roads from Ghana to Toga and then home.  I do not know what they are called in this day and age.

I am a certain age and can remember that we had a similar problem here 40 years ago, to which we responded by establishing the Irish Management Institute.  As an incentive companies had to pay a large levy to AnCO but received 90% of the money back if they provided a certain type of training.  That method would not work in Africa but it worked here to some extent.  Companies were legally obliged to pay the levy and IMI blossomed, but it plays a different role today.  IMI was intensively involved in training in various management skills.  One cannot transplant what happened here to Africa, but has such an initiative been considered?  Has the IMI been asked to examine the African situation, particularly the problems outlined by Mr. Maguinness regarding organising and managing businesses in responding to the needs of international trading?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900010#J00400","speaker":"1056"},{"type":"speech","time":1369838100,"counter":436,"content":"<p>There is no doubt that there are serious issues regarding the role of certain multinational companies in Africa.  I would like to acknowledge the work done by Irish NGOs.

It has worked out that for every &euro;10 given in aid, &euro;15 is lost through tax-dodging.  A major emphasis must be placed on profit-shifting and tax-dodging by multinationals.  Let us face it; every multinational, no matter where it is from, is out to make a profit.<\/p><p>  I wish to comment on labour and workers' rights.

Other donors have also come on board.  TradeMark East Africa has amassed a significant pool of money.  If one looks underneath its skin one can see that it is managed by KPMG.  There is a trend for large donors to move away from NGOs and international organisations and towards the private sector for possible solutions.  TradeMark East Africa works hand in glove with the State.  It operates inside the revenue authorities and assists with revenue collection and custom duties.  It has a good philosophy, which is worth examining.  It focuses on capacity-building by the state but is motivated by profit.  It sort of says, \"If you do this right, you will get money into your exchequer and be able to pay for services.\"  That is the mentality that TradeMark East Africa has adopted in order to deal with problems.  That is its thrust.<\/p><p>  Education is key.  We have a lot of knowledge on education and have many links with different places.  We work with the food technology section at Makerere University in Kampala.  Truthfully, it is not even close to where Teagasc and Traidlinks are here.  Members will have read the note at the end of my submission.  We need structural links at that level but it is not just Traidlinks that should be trying to achieve this.  Teagasc and Bord Bia should talk to their counterparts in these countries.  That is what I mean by strategic engagement, and Traidlinks has done its bit.<\/p><p>  A person from the Uganda Export Promotion Board and one from the Uganda Investment Authority attended a course by International Development Ireland, IDI, on exporting.  The IDI is an IDA spin-off.  It is a private consultancy company and runs courses on exporting for developing countries.  The Irish embassy in Kampala city said it would fund the attendance of one person if we could fund the other person, and that is what we did.  To me, such courses are only dealing with the tip of the iceberg, and we need a much more structured approach.  We need deliberations to flesh these strategies out.  It is fine to include it in the White Paper, which can act as the skeleton, but we must put meat on the bones.  <\/p><p>  We have a link with the Smurfit Business School.  Professor Damien McLoughlin, head of international marketing at Smurfit Business School, designed our market link programme with us and provided guidance on how to build the programme.  The school helped us develop the programme and is still open to helping us.  Irish institutions have shown great goodwill towards these initiatives.<\/p> <p>Smurfit has helped us to develop that and are still open to it.  I must acknowledge the goodwill of institutions in Ireland towards these kinds of initiative.  They bend over backwards to help.  We have had many Irish private sector companies come to look at what we are doing and they have all paid their own way.  We pay nothing.  They pay their air fares, hotel bills and everything else.  Someone from one company alone has spent perhaps &euro;50,000 on travel to Uganda to go down and help.  He has no significant business interest there but feels he has a great deal of knowledge to impart.  Knowledge is key.  As set out in my recommendations, a new Africa agricultural alliance network is trying to get off the ground in Dublin.  It is being spearheaded by Self Help Africa, a very interesting NGO in Ireland.  It is trying to create a knowledge-sharing network.<\/p><p> The issue of oil and gas industries was raised.  I have had a long career in development having worked for Concern for almost 30 years and have quite a sceptical view of extractive industries myself.  Their track record in Africa has been very spotty to say the least.  Traidlinks spent the first six months dealing with the corporate social responsibility staff in Tullow Oil and we indicated that we wanted to move away from that.  We do not want this to be a charitable engagement.  We look at this simply as a core business issue.  The company is operating in a landlocked country and if it wishes to export billions of barrels of oil, it must build a pipeline across some of the most inhospitable territory in Africa.  That may be from Uganda to Mombasa, or whichever port is decided on.  Forget about philanthropy; this is about business interest.  Is it cheaper to buy a banana from the local corner shop or to import it from Brazil?  I spoke to a brewing company in Kampala which spent $15,000 to fly a welder from South Africa to fix a pipe.  It took him an hour.  No one locally had a certificate from Lloyds to carry out the weld.  It is a practical issue.  Investing in the vocational training of Africans is not only the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do.  One would be stupid to do otherwise.  One thing I have noted about the oil companies is that they are not stupid.<\/p><p> There is a genuine attempt to do this which is why we have chosen to engage.  We will not be hurlers on the ditch in this particular game.  We have our vision, ethics, mission and morality as an organisation and we will engage with these companies.  We reserve all our rights given the nature of who we are to point out where things are going wrong.  I have pointed out to companies building clinics and maternity centres that they are building something completely unsustainable.  Who is going to sustain those facilities when the company has left?  It is better to give a contract to local farmers for the food being eaten in camps and to pay a premium to allow them to build the clinic.  We are very businesslike in Traidlinks and work with supply chain people in oil companies rather than with the corporate social responsibility people.  We are not looking for a cheque.  It is not about that.  Our relationship with Tullow Oil is contractual.  We built and are running an enterprise centre, the capital costs of which Tullow Oil funded.  It pays us a fee to run the centre.  This is not Tullow Oil saying it thought this was a good idea and would give Traidlinks money to do something nice.  This fits into its strategy as an oil company.  I take Deputy Byrne's point.  While he is right to be sceptical and to ask the hard questions, our experience thus far has been that there is a real intent to do this and we are going along on the journey.<\/p><p> I was asked if we had picked the wrong products, etc., for the heart of Africa.  While some of these things are fine, there are structural issues to consider.  Some of the things we have been trying to do have been too small and the scale must be increased.  They need processing plants and the ability to add value in Africa, which is where the private sector can help.  It can get in at strategic level to make a significant investment.  It is happening.  Glanbia has invested &euro;180 million in west Africa.  People said to me initially \"Shock, horror, they are taking milk powder to west Africa\".  While it would have been a horror story a few years ago, Glanbia is taking the milk powder in, selling it and building myriad businesses off the back of it, which are all indigenous to Nigeria.  They are making yogurts, creams and products for bakeries.  Consequently, a dairy industry is being formed in Nigeria as there is now a market for Nigeria milk.  Tastes are changing.  There is a middle class and people like yogurt and cream.  There can be win-win situations.  The bigger guys like the Irish Dairy Board and Glanbia understand Africa.  They do not need a Traidlinks to tell them what to do there.  They are very strategic, business-oriented people who know what they are about.  We see an opportunity for smaller Irish companies to get engaged and we can help them to do that.<\/p><p> Deputy Neville referred to management skills, which are absolutely necessary.  It is why I say \"Too many entrepreneurs, not enough managers\".  More managers are required in Africa.  The issue is to build skills at an institutional level albeit it is not about taking Africa to where we are now.  There is no point in taking the example of large company like Keelings, which can grow fruit by the hectare with two or three workers.  Africa needs the technology we had 20 or 30 years ago.  The institutional development we had 20 to 30 years ago is what they need.  They need an AnCO or a F&Aacute;S, though that body may be bad news here.  They need those kinds of institutions.  These were the building blocks that built our economy and we should interface with Africans on the basis of what we have learned as a nation.  Those are the kind of things they should be doing rather than to try to copy what we are doing now.  What we are doing now is not the answer in all instances and they should be looking at the steps we took to get here.  Glanbia started with 15 people in a room who formed a co-operative and is now the largest food and nutrients company in the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900010#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Maguinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369838700,"counter":440,"content":"<p>As did Kerry Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900011#K00200","speaker":"1056"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369838700,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Yes.

The Deputy is correct that there should be international transparency agreements with these companies.  People should be paying taxes somewhere.  They should pay tax in these countries, which need the revenue, not least as a form of anti-corruption measure.  Where a government demands taxes of the private sector, over time it will iron out some of the corruption.  It will become an expectation that if a company wants to operate, it pays taxes.

Each and every one has contributed significantly to the group&rsquo;s research, preparations and deliberations.<\/p><p> While we await the outcome of the Government&rsquo;s decision on what will happen next, I understand some of the many tasks which have been undertaken by the group on a collaborative basis include an analysis of the circumstances of those who have benefited from the schemes; an analysis of how mobility supports for people with disabilities are provided in other countries; and the collation of significant detail on the range of transport supports and developments across the wider State-funded sector.  A large amount of consultation has also taken place, including a broad public consultation, several in-depth focus groups and a detailed survey of a significant percentage of existing recipients.<\/p><p> Given the short time available to the group, it is important to acknowledge the contributions made by all to this work.  This has not only involved those who are directly members of the group, but was also supported by those in organisations such as the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Centres for Independent Living and the Disability Federation, which have provided invaluable assistance, particularly with focus groups; staff of the National Disability Authority, NDA, who have done research, helped with consultations and facilitated the focus groups; and those in Departments and other agencies such as Pobal, the Citizens' Information Board and the Health Service Executive, HSE, which have dedicated time and resources to bringing all of this together.  I am confident the data gathered will aid the Government significantly in coming to conclusions on what it should do next to address these mobility and transport needs as well as looking at wider longer-term issues of transport for people with disabilities.<\/p><p> It is important to reiterate that the funding allocated to the two schemes remains committed to whatever solution the Government may decide to implement following consideration of the review group&rsquo;s report.  The Minister for Health and the Minister of State are very conscious, as is my Department, that the payment of the mobility allowance to current recipients will continue until the end of June and that many people are concerned about what will happen after that.  It will be a matter for the Government to make decisions in its own time but, should the Government decide to assign any tasks to my Department or the HSE, I will ensure they are prioritised and implemented as soon as possible.<\/p><p> I will now address the wider context referred to in the committee&rsquo;s invitation to attend today.  I am aware that the Ombudsman raised a number of issues with this committee at a presentation on 6 December which were not related to the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grant.  In doing so, the Ombudsman made a number of points about the Department and the Minister for Health relating to the overall state of relations between the Ombudsman and the Department and the Minister.  Many of the issues referred to by the Ombudsman are now dealt with and in the past.  However, as with many matters, I feel the important thing now is that we, as the Department of Health, reflect on these experiences and draw meaningful lessons from them. I hope to demonstrate that we have, to the best of our ability, tried to use the Ombudsman&rsquo;s reports and our experiences in dealing with her office to put in place a better system for dealing with the clients who, after all, are the reason we are all working in this Department.<\/p><p> At a hearing before this committee on 6 February, I disputed the Ombudsman&rsquo;s points and briefly addressed the three examples given by her.  Now, with the benefit of additional time, I will provide further detail on the issues.  The Ombudsman had raised the matter of the 1993 subvention regulations and the assessment of the means of adult children to contribute towards their parents' care.  This matter had already been corrected and compensation paid to those affected.  I note that the Ombudsman has acknowledged this.  The Ombudsman also outlined the history of the wrongful charging of public patients in long-stay care but acknowledged that steps to address this matter had been taken - notably, the establishment of the health repayment scheme.  The State has already acknowledged the error in assessing adult children with regard to the 1993 subvention regulations as well as the wrongful charging of public patients in long-stay care and has already taken steps to correct the wrongs of the past.<\/p><p> The third issue raised by the Ombudsman during her appearance last December was the Who Cares? report.  As I have previously informed this committee, there is a fundamental difference between my Department and the Ombudsman with regard to the interpretation of the 1970 Health Act.  I do not agree with the position advanced by her.  Her position is that since 1970, health boards have had an obligation to provide long-stay care for older people without limit.  The Department of Health, and the many Ministers who have served in the Department since that time, have never agreed with that position.  The essential argument made in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report is that the statutory duties imposed on the HSE, and its predecessor health boards, under the 1970 Health Act regarding inpatient services, including nursing home services, are not subject to any resource limitation.  She stated that adequate resources had never been provided to honour these obligations in a transparent and accountable way.<\/p><p> The Government is not aware of any other country where health and personal social services are provided without some form of prioritisation which reflects the reality of resource limitations.  The reality is that access to health services has always been determined by a combination of clinical and other professional judgments within an overall resource availability envelope.  Although people may be eligible to receive inpatient services under section 52 of the Health Act 1970, any entitlement to receive those services in a particular case has always been subject to, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the availability of adequate resources.  The obligation to provide services prescribed in legislation enacted by the Oireachtas is clearly subject to the resources made available by the Oireachtas to provide those services.  I appreciate that the Ombudsman has formed a completely different view of the requirements of the legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.  However, this is the genuine view of this Department and of the Government.  I do not believe anyone could argue with the principle that it is a matter for the Government to determine the manner in which resources are to be prioritised and allocated.<\/p><p> It is only fair to also point out that this investigation was based on complaints received over 25 years, with 48 complaints a year on average.  This must be seen in the context of an average nursing home population of more than 20,000 people in recent years.  While we all accept that on principle even one complaint is one too many, I would argue that for the majority we do, in spite of very constrained resources at times, manage to provide a high level of service.<\/p><p> Regarding the Ombudsman&rsquo;s views concerning the non-co-operation of the Department, it is true that the Department expressed serious concerns about the Who Cares? report and the manner in which it was undertaken.  However, I must in all honesty take issue with one of the most serious allegations in the report - namely, that the Department refused to co-operate with this investigation by the Ombudsman.  The correspondence published by the Ombudsman and by the Department shows conclusively that we always made it clear that we were willing to fully co-operate with any investigation by the Ombudsman that was conducted within the parameters of the Ombudsman Act 1980.  However, we did have concerns about the Ombudsman&rsquo;s jurisdiction in certain matters in light of the provisions of the Ombudsman Act 1980, as amended.  Once we expressed concern about the Ombudsman's jurisdiction in dealing with the issues raised, there was no subsequent meaningful engagement by the Ombudsman with the Department on the investigation.  The Department at all times sought to balance co-operation with the Ombudsman with the limitations of the jurisdiction assigned to her by the Oireachtas under the Ombudsman Act 1980.  We were particularly concerned that this should not affect the right of the State to defend itself in any litigation.<\/p><p> In response to the issue of litigation facing the Department, and the Ombudsman&rsquo;s repeated requests for information on how this litigation is being managed, I wish to make the following points.  In defending litigation, a Minister is not discharging administrative powers but rather exercising the Executive power of the State and the inherent constitutional right that every litigant enjoys to defend litigation commenced against him or her.  The Ombudsman&rsquo;s jurisdiction is confined, very clearly, by the Ombudsman Act 1980 to the investigation of &ldquo;any action taken ... in the performance of administrative function&rdquo;, not an executive function.  It is our firm view that the Ombudsman has no jurisdiction to investigate or seek or demand information in the litigation being managed by or on behalf of the State.  Quite apart from the fact that these matters are outside the remit of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s jurisdiction, it would be fundamentally unfair if a defendant in any litigation were compelled to make his or her legal advice freely available to third parties and to openly discuss the management of his or her litigation in public forums.  To do so could fundamentally undermine the defence of his or her litigation.<\/p> <p> A relatively small number of legal actions have been taken by people seeking compensation for private nursing home costs incurred by them or their deceased relatives. These cases are being vigorously defended.  We have always acknowledged that there have been a number of settlements based on legal advice which had regard to the particular circumstances of the individual cases.  There is nothing unusual or untoward about this.<\/p><p> I would not wish for this particular matter to forever colour the relationship between my Department and the Ombudsman.  I acknowledge that the very nature of any process where an organisation is scrutinised by an outside agency can lead to its own tensions.  However, I assure the committee that my Department fully appreciates the invaluable role of the Ombudsman in the overall structure of accountability for this State.<\/p><p> In that context, I highlight the many advances we have made in the area of long stay care for older people and wish to take a few moments to talk about the introduction of fair deal and the very significant improvements we have made in recent years.  Indeed, the interventions of all three holders of the office of Ombudsman over the years have had a part to play in the shaping of where we are today.<\/p><p> The nursing homes support scheme commenced on 27 October 2009.  Prior to its commencement, there were four stated objectives: to put in place an infrastructure of high quality and sustainable long-term residential care services for older people; to equalise State support for public and private long-term residential care recipients; to render private long-term residential care affordable and anxiety-free and ensure that no-one had to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for their care; and to remove the incentive to avail of public rather than private long-term residential care.  The legislation underpinning the scheme includes a principle of resident choice.  Individuals can choose to enter any nursing home, subject to it being able to meet their particular care needs and having an available bed.  Importantly, individuals contribute on the same basis, irrespective of whether they choose a public, private or voluntary nursing home.  Consequently, any financial incentive for people to avail of public nursing home care has been removed.  The scheme has also eliminated the financial uncertainty that older people and their families faced.  No longer do people have to worry about how they will fund their nursing home care.  The scheme is very clear about the basis upon which people contribute towards the cost of their care.  This makes it possible for people to plan ahead, safe in the knowledge that their nursing home care will be affordable.<\/p><p> Entering long-term nursing home is a hugely significant decision for any person.  It is one thing to know that one will be able to afford the care.  Equally important is the quality of that care.  We have to ensure the highest standards of care are provided to residents in a safe and secure environment and that we meet the needs of those who require our services in the very best way possible.  Residents, their families and the public need to be reassured that the care people receive is monitored.<\/p><p>On 1 July 2009, statutory responsibility for inspecting and registering nursing homes was given to the Health Information and Quality Authority's chief inspector of social services.  This is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising the Health Act 2007, care and welfare regulations and the national quality standards for residential care settings for older people in Ireland.  All nursing homes, whether public, private or voluntary, are subject to the same core standards in respect of quality and safety.  HIQA carries out inspections across the nursing home sector to ensure these standards are being met and that residents are receiving the best possible care.  Inspection reports for every nursing home are available on the Health Information and Quality Authority website.<\/p><p> To go back to the nursing homes support scheme, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after it had been in operation for three years.  This process commenced last year.  The Department of Health called for submissions to inform the review.  A summary report of the submissions received was published on the Department's website in December.  The review will examine the sustainability of the scheme and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating and setting prices.  It will also consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community-based services and the extension of the scheme to patients with disabilities and mental health disorders.  It is expected that the review will be completed in 2013.<\/p><p> In short, under successive Governments, the landscape for nursing home care in Ireland has been reshaped and redefined over the past five years.  We now have a national legislative framework for access and financial support for nursing home care together with an independent quality assurance and inspection function residing in the Health Information and Quality Authority.  We in the Department are very proud of the advances we have made in this area and acknowledge the many stakeholders who assisted us along the way, including the Ombudsman through the many complaints and reports over the years.<\/p><p> I am very conscious that this committee, and indeed others, have expressed in public concerns about the overall nature of the relationship between the Ombudsman and my Department.  I hope that I have in some way allayed those fears today.  However, since I took over as Secretary General, I have also decided to proactively foster a better working relationship with the Ombudsman.  I have undertaken a series of practical measures, including the appointment of a senior official in my Department to act as Ombudsman liaison, and this official will also report regularly to my management advisory committee on any issues of concern or trends emerging with the Ombudsman in order that they can be dealt with at a very early stage.<\/p><p> I will never shy away from placing and accepting blame where needs be.  I must ask that everyone acknowledges that for a large number of people, we do get it right and meet the needs of our population.  There is still work to be done but we cannot allow the past to overshadow our ongoing work and our plans for the future.  Where mistakes have been made, they have been acknowledged and it is time to move on and focus on the future.<\/p><p> My Department is now in the middle of the most radical and far-reaching health reform initiative since the foundation of the State.  At the centre of this reform will be each and every citizen who deserves to live the healthiest life possible.  I know that the same citizen is at the centre of the Ombudsman's concerns and I know that if we both work together, the citizens of Ireland will benefit.<\/p><p> I believe the Ombudsman carries out an important and valuable function.  It is regrettable that the relationship between her office and the Department of Health has deteriorated in recent years, and I want to assure the committee that my officials and I are committed to rebuilding that relationship and ensuring we can all work together in a productive and respectful manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013052900003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369840500,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McLoughlin for his presentation.

We appreciate them being here.  I also commend the fact that they are in the process of restructuring the Department and have made that appointment as a liaison point for the Office of the Ombudsman.  All of us present would agree that improving relationships between the Department and the Office of the Ombudsman is key and is, in effect, why we are here.  No one on this committee chooses to pull out anything here, as it were.<\/p><p>  As a committee, we are responsible for responding to the observations made by the Ombudsman when she appeared here in December.  I am sure the Secretary General will have read very clearly the statement the Ombudsman made that day.  She was not disputing the progress that has been made in respect of the care given and the reforms the Department may be making.  Her concern was the lack of care she felt the Department showed towards the law.  As Dr. McLoughlin will recall, she went through three examples of she believed was the Department's tradition of care that was not so good.  I know Dr. McLoughlin noted the three things in his response today and has given us the good side of that.  If one reads the Ombudsman's explanations and observations, one can see an entirely different picture.  She talks about legal advice being reiterated by the Minister's legal advisers and how the Department gambled for six years that it would get away with something it knew was illegal.  In respect of the Travers report, the Ombudsman makes it very clear that the breach that occurred cost the State &euro;500 million.  I accept that is in the past and Dr. McLoughlin said his ambition is to improve that, which is good.<\/p><p>  In respect of the Who Cares? report, the Ombudsman said this was a continuing case and while there may have been 48 complaints per year, they had accumulated to more than 1,000.  That adds up to a lot of people who complained because they did not receive the care they believed should have been provided to them by the health boards or the HSE.  In her investigation, the Ombudsman decided that this was the case but she did not say that they should all be compensated.  As I understand it, she recommended a much smaller form of redress.  In her statement, she said that this was ignored or not responded to, which I thought rather odd because Dr. McLoughlin repeatedly made the point that the Ombudsman does not seem to understand the cost of this to the State.<\/p> <p>She stated clearly that she understands the larger compensation matter would cost the State an enormous amount of money but when she offered a form of redress she did not receive a response.  The witnesses may be able to clarify that.<\/p><p> I refer now to a point which appears to have caused a particular problem in respect of the litigants.  Dr. McLoughlin indicated that he was reluctant to discuss this issue.  I do not know who is right or wrong but the Ombudsman stated clearly to this committee that she inquired specifically about the various cases.  She wanted to know how many cases are awaiting settlement and how many were settled out of court, how much they cost and why they were settled.  She stated that the Department was obliged to disclose this information to the Ombudsman.  That is her interpretation but I doubt she would have come here just to have a go at the Secretary General.  The Ombudsman is a serious office, as Dr. McLoughlin has acknowledged.  We are still in the dark on these questions.  I understand that 30 cases have been settled at an estimated cost of approximately &euro;3 million.  A footnote to one of the Department's documents suggests that 347 cases are awaiting settlement.  That is not a small number and these cases are serious matters for those who are waiting to fight for what they believe they should have been given.  The Ombudsman offered them an opportunity for redress but that was not followed through and they are now bogged down in a legal system which we all know is exhausting and lengthy.  If the Department is not obliged to disclose this information to the Ombudsman, to whom is it obliged to disclose it?  As far as I am aware, it is not the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Who is aware of the amount of money spent on this matter and how much we may spend on it?  After all, this is taxpayers' money.  <\/p><p> The Ombudsman went further to ask whether the Department was being obstructive in its approach.  She suggested this in her 2010 report but by 2012 she became more clear about it, stating that the approach appeared to involve intentional tactics to delay cases coming to a hearing.  She also stated that when a particular case reaches the point where an order of discovery is made, the State side offers a settlement which is subject to a confidentiality clause.  On the one hand, we know nothing about these cases in terms of their quantity, quality or amount of money involved and, on the other, the Ombudsman accuses the Department of Health of obstructive tactics.  That is a serious allegation and this committee is obliged to ask Dr. McLoughlin and his officials what on earth is going on.<\/p><p> Ultimately, they need to improve their relationship with the Ombudsman.  However, the Department appears to be calling into question her role and her right to investigate.  She received more than 1,000 complaints, but the Department argues she does not have the right to go about her business in this way.  They cannot both be right.  She argues that she is obliged under her statutory remit to ask those questions and to investigate, but the Department disagrees.  That is the crux of the matter.  The position is untenable into the future but I do not know how it can be resolved.  It would be more appropriate for the Ombudsman to fold her tent and leave if she cannot ask those questions.  I am sure she has taken serious legal advice on the nature of her remit and is not acting on a whim.  Clearly, she believes she is acting within her statutory remit.  While all of us would wish this to be part of the past, for those who are still awaiting a settlement it is very much in the present.  The matter is still on the Ombudsman's desk and she saw fit to raise it with this committee on 6 December 2012.  I am afraid it is very much a live matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013052900005#E00300","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369841100,"counter":457,"content":"<p>As the Senator raised a range of issues, I ask her to summarise her questions for clarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013052900006#F00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1369841100,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I would like to know the number of cases involved.

We report to the Minister on it and I am sure the Ombudsman would recognise my duty of care for the resources of the State.  These are the taxpayers' resources and I cannot and will not create precedents which would subsequently expose the State to high levels of payments that could not be justified.<\/p><p>  To the best of my knowledge, approximately 240 cases relate to fees paid on private nursing homes.  I understand we are predominantly dealing with the estates of individuals rather than actual clients.  The clients or their estates are entitled under the Constitution to pursue cases and once they do so, we are in an adversarial system.  My Department must act prudently and properly in line with the advice of the Attorney General.  Before engaging in such litigation, we brief our Ministers fully and both the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, are fully aware of these matters from a legal perspective.<\/p><p>  We are dealing with different cases and expectations differ on the part of the various litigants.  We have to consider each case on its merits to decide on the best defence.  In the current economic climate, if we were to open the floodgates the consequences for the basic operation of our health service could be serious.  The Department is funded by the Exchequer and the Oireachtas funds the health system.  Whenever we are faced with legal challenges that have financial consequences, we are required to exercise a duty of care in respect of the State.  We do that through the Attorney General's office.  It is a matter for the committee and the Oireachtas to decide how much to spend on the health service and I am accountable as Secretary General for ensuring these matters are dealt with in accordance with the best evidence-based governance practices.<\/p><p>  We have, however, provided a considerable amount of information in response to parliamentary questions.  Since the litigation commenced in 2005, for example, we have already reported on a total of 33 cases involving fees paid to private nursing homes which were settled at a cost of &euro;1.2 million.  I face serious constraints when it comes to discussing legal fees.  I cannot provide details on legal costs, but we are represented in the usual way by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General.  The Department fully complies with all financial and accounting procedures, including those required by the Comptroller and Auditor General.

He is very busy, but it is a matter of grave importance that we tease these issues out.  I am returning to the Ombudsman's statement to us.  She felt she should inform the committee that:<blockquote><br \/>The Department of Health has a long history of, to put it mildly, carelessness with regard to the law.  This has been the case irrespective of which political party or coalition has been in government.<\/blockquote>She is not the only one who said that.  She and her predecessor as Ombudsman have seen this at close quarters and she recalled a number of different issues.  She also said, and I will tie these up together:<blockquote>It seems clear that the Department is involved in a careful strategy of risk management.  This risk would not exist if the Department had had proper regard to the legal obligation on health boards to provide long-stay care.  If, by any chance, one or more of these cases comes to a hearing and judgment in the High Court and if ... that judgment goes against the State parties, the financial implications would be truly horrendous in terms of the amount of compensation likely to be payable to thousands of claimants.<\/blockquote>In her final comment she said:<blockquote>As the Department represents it, the recommendations I have made are almost reckless from the perspective of the public finances ... What I am pointing out is that the Department of Health - because of what appears to be a culture of prevarication, disregard for the law and an inability to take hard decisions - has already caused the State to incur enormous costs and looks set to continue on that path.<\/blockquote>  We have had a number of Ombudsmen in here and they are very careful with their words.  My understanding of this Ombudsman is that she is very careful and would not say something like that very lightly.  It is very hard to match what the Department of Health and the Ombudsman are saying, but it is clear, and Dr. McLoughlin said this, that there were fundamental differences of opinion and because of resource limitations the Department could not implement what the Ombudsman said.<\/p><p>  The specific cases alluded to and talked about do not affect this committee.  This committee's role is to examine systemic issues.  We are asking what are the powers and role of the Ombudsman <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> the Government and the Departments under it.  That is the fundamental issue here.  There has been a similar situation with An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, with whom we have had hearings, and the Department of Social Protection, where it has said it is not going to follow the Ombudsman's advice because its legal advice says differently.  We need clarity on that.<\/p><p>  Under the Ombudsman Act, what is Dr. McLoughlin's understanding of the Department of Health's situation if it does not agree with the Ombudsman's ruling?  Can the Department challenge that in the High Court?  Under the Official Languages Act, if a Department does not agree with the ruling of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, who is an ombudsman, the next step to take is to challenge it in the High Court.  No Department has ever challenged that.  What is the situation with the Department of Health and the Ombudsman if the Department does not agree with a ruling?  Under the Act what is the next step of redress?  Is it non-engagement, choosing not to agree, and making statements to committees like ourselves that the Department does not agree with it and non-implementation the Ombudsman's findings?<\/p><p>  Some of the cases go back 20 or 30 years and I understand the view of the Department and the Government is totally different from that of the Ombudsman.  This is a wider situation.  The Attorney General and Government have been involved.  Decisions have been made by numerous Governments.  Did officials in the Department in any of the cases the Ombudsman cited suggest changes to the legislation so they would be in compliance with the Ombudsman's rulings?  Have officials suggested changes to each of the three different schemes so the Department would be in compliance?<\/p><p>  I was going to ask about the cost of settlements but that has been addressed.  I appreciate that Dr. McLoughlin said he wants to move forward.  Can he outline the mechanisms that have been put in place so that this cannot happen again?  Most of the issues raised relate to the Equal Status Acts and equality.  What equality-proofing measures has the Department in place that were not in place that will ensure this does not happen again?  When a piece of legislation comes before the Department is it being equality-proofed?  If so, who is doing that?  What measures is the Department using?  Is it the nine grounds of equality?  From what I read, the Ombudsman's advice is that a piece of legislation that was brought forward created a potential liability on the State.  She outlined what she saw as flaws in that legislation, which were not addressed.  How can we ensure that does not happen again?  What mechanisms does the Department have, or what changes have been put in place, to ensure that does not happen in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013052900007#G01600","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369841700,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I will let Ms Fitzpatrick deal with the issues around the Ombudsman's legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013052900007#G01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369841700,"counter":477,"content":"<p>In the Who Cares? report there were no formal recommendations.

The Euro-Mediterranean aviation agreement between the European Union and its member states and the State of Israel has been negotiated by the European Commission for the past few years.  The Council granted the Commission a negotiating mandate to do so in April 2008.  The agreement was initialled on 30 July 2012 and will be signed at a ceremony on the margins of the Transport Council in Luxembourg on 10 June.<\/p><p>  Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution states the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge on public funds unless the agreement has been approved by the D&aacute;il.  This agreement does not give rise to significant expenses for the State.  However, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that article 23 of the agreement which outlines the dispute resolution and arbitration procedures could potentially create small expenses for the State.  On that basis, the advice is that the approval of the D&aacute;il is required prior to the signature of the agreement next week.  That is what has given rise to the urgency of the matter.  We had not anticipated this and I apologise for any inconvenience caused to members. <\/p><p>  The European Commission has consulted stakeholders throughout the negotiating process, in particular through the consultative forum comprising representatives of member states, air carriers, airports and labour organisations.<\/p> <p>Negotiations took more than three years, involving eight negotiation rounds and numerous EU preparatory meetings.<\/p><p> Air services between the European Union and the State of Israel currently operate on the basis of bilateral agreements between individual member states and Israel, including an agreement between Ireland and Israel made in 1993.  It is part of the EU's external aviation policy to negotiate comprehensive air services agreements with neighbouring countries, in particular the Mediterranean region, where the added value and economic benefits of such agreements have been demonstrated.<\/p><p> The agreement's aims are: gradual market opening in terms of access to routes and capacity on a reciprocal basis; promoting regulatory co-operation and harmonisation of regulations and approaches based on EU legislation in the field of aviation; promoting air services based on competition among air carriers with minimum government interference and regulation; and non-discrimination and a level playing field for economic operators.  This is a mixed competency agreement requiring ratification by each participating member state.  Pending entry into force, the agreement will be provisionally applied from the date of signature.<\/p><p> Ireland is supportive of the European policy of negotiating such agreements with neighbouring countries.  Historically commercial aviation relations between Ireland and Israel have been limited, although as mentioned a bilateral aviation agreement between Ireland and Israel was agreed in 1993.  Various services have been approved over the years under this agreement.  No Irish airline currently operates scheduled services to Israel and one Israeli airline operates a summer-only scheduled service.  Many individual charter flights; between the two countries have been authorised mainly to cater for tourist traffic - mostly for pilgrimages to the Holy Land.<\/p><p> The agreement will gradually open up the entire EU-Israel aviation market to Irish airlines, which may well have an interest in servicing Israel from Ireland or indeed other EU member states.

This state, the EU and its member states have spoken out strongly against these abuses and are fully aware of them, but we continually reward Israel with economic agreements and deals, unavailable to most states neighbouring the EU.<\/p><p>  In 2001 Israel destroyed Yasser Arafat International Airport in Gaza.  The airport, run by the Palestinian Authority, opened in 1998 was bombed by the Israeli Army.  The airport was built with funding from EU member states, as well as other countries, and the total cost was $86 million.  Israeli bulldozers cut the runway apart in January 2002.  After the destruction of Gaza airport by the Israeli Army, the International Civil Aviation Organization condemned Israel for the destruction of a civilian airport and navigational devices used for civilian purposes only.  Israel's justification was that it might be attacked from this airport, as it was the best equipped in Gaza.  The only remaining runway in Gaza after 2002 is that of the Gaza airstrip, but an Israeli air blockade of Gaza prevents it from being used.  Israel also controls the airspace.  Why do we reward any country that would block off another, impose severe restrictions on its population and deny the basic right of freedom of movement to another country nearby?  The Palestinians have no proper airport and just a strip that is restricted by the Israelis.<\/p><p>  However, the EU believes it is appropriate to sign an aviation agreement with Israel.  The agreement completely ignores the crimes against the rights of Palestinians to travel freely in and out of their own country.  It also ignores Israel's crimes of destroying civilian transport facilitates in Gaza and the West Bank, facilities which were funded by EU member states.  The agreement will strengthen ties with Israel and create opportunities for industry and consumers, but it ignores the rights it is denying another country nearby.  For that reason, we should not sign up to any agreement that would benefit Israel until it is brought into line with proper international practices and it recognises the rights of the Palestinian people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013052900003#B00200","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1369846800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I recognise Deputy Ellis's comments in this regard.

It is proposed that this joint communication warrants further scrutiny at a further meeting of the committee, in conjunction with COM (2013) 48, as that proposal arises from the joint communication.  It is proposed, therefore, that a letter issue to the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources requesting that when the committee meets departmental officials to consider COM (2013) 48, the Department also brief it on the joint communication.

Agreed.<\/p><p>  COM (2012) 776 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on occurrence reporting in civil aviation, amending Regulation (EU) No. 996\/2010 and repealing Directive No. 2003\/42\/EC, Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1321\/2007 and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1330\/2007.  It is proposed that this proposal warrants further scrutiny by way of a letter to the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport stating the joint committee requests information on the outcome of the consultation process undertaken by the Department, especially in respect of the administrative burdens this proposal may place on the aviation industry, and that the committee would also like to be kept informed of further developments on the proposal.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  COM (2013) 153 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council concerning the notification to the Commission of investment in energy infrastructure projects within the European Union, replacing Council Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No. 617\/2010.  COM (2013) 174 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on multiannual funding for the action of the European Maritime Safety Agency in the field of response to pollution caused by ships and to marine pollution caused by oil and gas installations.  COM (2012) 584 is a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the harmonisation of the laws of the member states relating to the making available on the market of radio equipment.  It is proposed that these proposals do not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p> COM (2012) 772 is a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on maritime equipment, repealing Directive No. 96\/98\/EC.
