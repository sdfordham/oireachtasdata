The strategy prioritises actions to support the provision of Irish-medium education in Gaeltacht areas and schools.  This was further reinforced by the Gaeltacht Act 2012.  In line with the strategy, the Department is committed to providing Gaeltacht students with the opportunity to receive their education through the medium of Irish by implementing a range of measures that aim to improve and enhance Irish generally as well as measures that relate specifically to schools in the Gaeltacht.  To date, the Department has prioritised the implementation of educational actions in the 20-year strategy relating to curriculum, assessment and teacher education.  These measures have been introduced in tandem with the implementation of the national literacy and numeracy strategy, developments in initial teacher education and the reform of the junior cycle.  The Department meets regularly with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to discuss progress on the implementation of the educational measures in the 20-year strategy.<\/p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills also plans to carry out a detailed analysis during the coming school year of the particular challenges facing Gaeltacht schools of varying linguistic profiles, with a view to identifying policy options for Irish-medium instruction in these schools that will be consistent with the needs of Gaeltacht communities.  The findings of this analysis will enable good forward planning of educational provision in Gaeltacht areas.  This analysis by the Department is occurring in a context in which each Gaeltacht community will be expected to prepare a language plan and clarify its status as a Gaeltacht area in accordance with the Gaeltacht Act 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Loftus","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369830900,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I join the Chairman in welcoming Ms N&iacute; Chart&uacute;ir and Ms Ni Mhain&iacute;n as well as Mr. Loftus and his departmental team to discuss this issue.

However, we must recognise that we have got to a stage in education at which there is no potential for any more cuts, as anything that is introduced has a large effect on educational services.  That is no more so the case than in one-, two-, three- and four-teacher schools, and that is particularly visible in the Gaeltacht schools which the our guests are here today to discuss.  They have had to absorb a number of very difficult cuts which have undoubtedly had an impact on the schools.  They have outlined the impact, in particular, on the pupil-teacher ratio.  For Gaeltacht schools, 80% of which have four teachers or fewer, the cuts in the capitation grant and particularly the cut in the minor works grant are having a significant impact.  The value of the minor works grant would be a minimum of &euro;5,000 for any applicant school, regardless of how small, and the cut in the payment of that grant is having an impact.  Last autumn was the first time that grant was not paid.  Research has been done and there is evidence to show that more than half of primary schools are now in deficit and ran a deficit last year.  That grant will not be paid this autumn and it is then we will see a funding cliff for many of our primary schools.<\/p><p>  I recently visited a 70-teacher school that had applied for a minor works grant of &euro;7,000 the year prior to the cutting of the grant for carrying out essential repairs.  The grant was not paid to schools last year and it will not be paid this year.  In the case of that school, it had to fund-raise to gather that &euro;7,000 on top of everything else.  That figure would amount to &euro;100 per pupil, but the families of those pupils would not have the potential to absorb that expense as they are otherwise under exceptional financial stress.<\/p><p>  On the point concerning pupil-teacher ratios, will our guests from the schools division and from the Department outline the genesis of the lower retention rate for Gaeltacht schools?   If we go back to 2011-12, the number of pupils required for the retention of three teachers was 76 for a Gaeltacht school, as opposed to 83 for Gaelscoileanna and for primary schools, and the number of pupils required to retain four teachers was 96 for a Gaeltacht school, as opposed to 115 for Gaelscoileanna and for primary schools.  I am interested in the rationale for a lower retention rate for Gaeltacht schools <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> other schools of a similar size that are English-speaking, and particularly in the reason it applies to Gaeltacht schools but not Gaelscoileanna.  I have no doubt that lower retention rate has made a big difference, but why was it not in place for other schools?<\/p><p>  Focusing on the pupil-teacher ratio that has had to be applied by Gaeltacht schools and other small schools in recent times, from 2012 the ratio for one-teacher schools will increase from 12 pupils to 20 pupils.  Any school that does not have a minimum of 20 pupils this September will lose a teacher the following year.  For two-teacher schools, the figure will increase from 49 to 56 pupils this September and for three-teacher schools it will increase from 81 to 86 this September.  As our guest rightly pointed out, the impact of that change for Gaeltacht schools is even more significant, with the figure increasing from 76 to 86.  Those are significant increases and they will make it difficult for schools to continue to teach students in the way they would like to and have done up to now.  The reason there is a preferential pupil-teacher ratio for smaller schools is that it is more difficult for one teacher to teach a number of classes than it is for a teacher in schools with eight or more teachers to teach one class, although there may be different learning grades within it.  I would like an answer to those questions.  I would like our guests to outline what they want the Department to do on foot of this meeting and what they would request the Minister to do.  I have a good idea what that is but I would like them to specify their requests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900008#G00300","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1369830900,"counter":27,"content":"<p>On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900008#G00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1369830900,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh will ask a few questions in Irish but I have one question in English, if that is in order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900008#G00500","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1369830900,"counter":29,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900008#G00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1369830900,"counter":30,"content":"<p>On the three recommendations that were made, I wish to touch on the third one, the establishment of special board or authority with responsibility for strategic planning and development.

I know Ms N&iacute; Mhain&iacute;n but I have not met Ms N&iacute; Chart&uacute;ir before.  I also welcome the Department officials.  Well over a year ago we attended a public meeting in Dingle and a big crowd came out that night to support the retention of the Gaelscoileanna.  I got a quick lesson that night on the difference between Gaelscoileanna and Gaeltacht schools because when I referred to the Gaeltacht schools as Gaelscoileanna, Ms N&iacute; Mhain&iacute;n was not long about putting me in the picture.  I have not forgotten it.  Can the witnesses indicate when we can have the results of the review for small schools?  Will they be brought to this committee for discussion?<\/p><p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said, doing the review after the job is done is a bit like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  Will Gaeltacht schools close down as a result of these changes?  The Department is a year into the changes and Mr. Loftus said that six posts have been lost.  If Gaeltacht schools do close down will the students be placed in English medium schools or will they be put into Gaelscoileanna where they are taught through the medium of Irish?  This can cause a huge problem, especially if the children go on to be educated through Irish.  I recall somebody saying to me once that they did not send their child to a Gaelscoil because they could not help the child with homework as they did not know the names of the mountains and rivers as Gaeilge.  If children taught for several years through Irish are suddenly landed into an English medium school it will be hard for them, for example, to study geography.  It will be like learning a new language all over again.  I would appreciate if Mr. Loftus could indicate the impact of this on the Gaeltacht schools and whether they will eventually close down, and if so, is it proposed to amalgamate them with English medium schools?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900009#H00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1369831500,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na finn&eacute;ithe.  Mo leithsc&eacute;al nach raibh m&eacute; anseo ar dt&uacute;s.  I appreciate the presentations made here and I take on board the points that have been made.  I am on the record as calling for the measures in the 2012 budget to be reversed.  As late as yesterday I put down several parliamentary questions which unfortunately were not taken in the House because of the lottery system we have for oral answers.  The change in threshold numbers for small schools throughout the country, not just in the Gaeltacht, is regressive.  That there could be 55 children across eight streams in two classrooms, including perhaps children with special needs, is not good enough.  I agree with Mr. Loftus that we cannot put a value on the language and we need to take this matter more seriously.<\/p><p>  As a Government backbencher I will continue to work to see if these measures can be halted or even reversed.  The reasoning behind these thresholds is given as cost-cutting and encouraging amalgamation but there are more proactive ways to encourage amalgamation.  I have not seen any proactive approach from the Department that involves engaging with school communities and showing the benefits that would exist in some cases where amalgamation might be a positive option.  The one-cap-fits-all approach is completely ludicrous.  I find it very frustrating that this is happening over three years.  It needs attention.<\/p><p>  There is also an attitude in the Department to places that are far away.  In my constituency, Corca Dhuibhne, west of Dingle there are seven primary schools.  I saw a television documentary 12 months ago in which officials in the Minister's office found it amazing and ludicrous that there were seven schools west of Dingle.  That, however, made my job in my constituency much easier because people have since told me that now they know what I am dealing with.  There are seven schools west of Dingle because it is a large hinterland and the people there are entitled to their seven schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900009#H00300","speaker":"1051","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369832100,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I will revert to the witnesses and invite Ms N&iacute; Mhain&iacute;n and Ms N&iacute; Chart&uacute;ir to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900010#J00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369832100,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Both Ms N&iacute; Chart&uacute;ir and I might take up the questions.  On the pupil-teacher ratio, up to approximately three years ago, gaelscoileanna had a more favourable retention rate - the Department will be able to clarify this - but then they lost it.  My understanding is the more favourable retention rate was to ensure that, as Ms Anna N&iacute; Chart&uacute;ir already had stated, teachers need to put in more time because there was a lot more work to do, including translation, for schools that were teaching through the medium of Irish.  This is my understanding of it anyway.  There was a lot more work to do in such schools, be they in a Gaeltacht or in a Gaelscoil setting.  Consequently, Gaeltacht schools had a more preferential retention rate until last year, after which it basically was wiped out.<\/p><p>  As for the recommendations we have made, in a nutshell, proper education planning and accounting must happen that would take into account the varying linguistic challenges that lie in each Gaeltacht area.  This must be done by the Department of Education and Skills before making any changes to pupil-teacher ratios or anything else pertaining to education in the Gaeltacht from now on.  This is actually stated in the 20-year strategy for the Irish language, which sets out in black and white what the Department must do.  As for the absence of educational planning, while everyone understands that cuts must be made, why make them and then carry out reviews, value-for-money reports and everything else?  Why always put the cart before the horse?  Could we not for once have proper planning, whereby we approach education in the manner it should be approached, as teachers do in schools?  As they plan their classes, lessons and year, can this not be done at a higher level? <\/p><p>  As for the question the Deputy asked regarding An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, COGG, that recommendation has been made time and again through various studies that have been published from 2005 onwards.  It has been recommended that a separate entity or body be set up to ensure that Gaeltacht schools are fulfilling their statutory regulations under the Education Act but that such a body be separate from the Department.  I believe that had such an entity be set up, we would not be talking about it before the joint committee today.  No planning has been done by the Department of Education and Skills, even though views have been expressed, as well as this, that and the other thing.  However, these are bits and pieces coming year after year or whatever.  This should have been done before any cuts or before anything else.  We should have known what we were talking about and what was going to come in the future.  That basically is the source of this recommendation.  The studies to which I refer primarily are Staid Reatha na Scoileanna Gaeltachta, which was published in 2004, Strucht&uacute;r Oideachais na Gaeltachta, which I think was published in 2007 and an Staid&eacute;ar Cuimsitheach Teangeola&iacute;och ar &Uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, which also was published in 2007.  They are the three primary studies that were published and which recommended that such a separate entity would be set up.<\/p><p>  As for the review, is d&oacute;igh liom gurb &eacute; an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh a d'iarr mar gheall ar an athbhreithni&uacute; at&aacute; le d&eacute;anamh.  Tagaim ar ais go dt&iacute; pointe a rinne an tUasal Loftus mar gheall ar forward planning.  Is iontach go deo an rud &eacute; m&aacute; t&aacute; an Roinn ag f&eacute;achaint ar phlean&aacute;il chun cinn a dh&eacute;anamh maidir leis an oideachas Gaeltachta.  While it would be great if the Department is looking at this review as a means of forward planning for Gaeltacht education, I reiterate the point I have made continuously today, which is it should have been done before any cuts were made.<\/p><p>  Senator Moloney asked whether Gaeltacht schools will close.  I can give her one example of a Gaeltacht school that has closed.  It has not actually closed because of numbers but it closed because their numbers fell too low for the school to remain viable.  However, on the point the Senator made, it was a Gaeltacht school in category B.  In other words, it was neither the weakest nor the strongest but was in the middle of the road.  However, it was a wonderful school that had a wonderful Irish policy and everything else.  The children concerned moved to a Gaeltacht school that teaches through the medium of English and were completely and utterly lost for months.  My organisation carried out a survey from the middle of last month up to the end of the first week of this month, approximately.  However, we then were obliged to call a halt to it even though schools were still responding to us.  To give the Senator an indication in respect of the points she raised, in the eventuality that schools must amalgamate because of the changes in the pupil-teacher ratio, 10% of Gaeltacht schools have indicated to us that they would be amalgamating with English-medium schools.  Moreover, 50% of the schools have indicated they will be under severe pressure to amalgamate because of the changes in the pupil-teacher ratio.  As to whether there would be a category change for the schools, 27% of the schools responded there would be.  Moreover, as has been recognised, this would involve going down the linguistic categories, not going up.  As for whether schools will be threatened with closure, 32% responded they would.  These are the statistics that have come back to us as an indication of the survey we carried out<\/p><p>  I will make two other brief points in response to the last two speakers.  A proactive approach certainly is needed from the Department in respect of amalgamations.  Time and again, the schools have told us they would love the Department to be involved in the process of amalgamation.  They would welcome guidance of some kind or that something was available to them as to how to go about it.  Schools are clueless, as they are there to teach children, not to go through the business of amalgamating, which is another kettle of fish.  As for the one-size-fits-all approach, an interesting point I wish to take up is that time and again, due consideration is not given to the language aspect where Gaeltacht schools are concerned.  This was highlighted the most with Circular 0044\/2007 on language and literacy in infant classes in Irish-medium schools.  While it was withdrawn, I think it is coming back in again and when that happens, will be prescribed in the primary curriculum.  What was good for the goose was good for the gander in this regard because it satisfied Gaelscoileanna to a certain point.  I believe the Department's view is that if it is okay for gaelscoileanna, then it is fine for the Gaeltacht schools.  However, that is not satisfactory at all.  As members themselves have stated today, a proactive approach is needed, as well as a very different attitude towards the Gaeltacht when it comes to education and planning for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Treasa N&iacute; Mhain&iacute;n"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369832100,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I deal with a lot of the staffing side of things in the Department.

I would like to highlight the Department's ultimate commitment to the implementation of the expectations and targets set out in the 20 year strategy, in line with available resources.  The Department has decided to undertake a review of Gaeltacht provision mainly because in the language strategy the Gaeltacht communities are highlighted as being absolutely fundamental to promoting the sustainability of the Irish language and Gaeltacht schools are part and parcel of that provision.  The purpose of the review is to clarify Department policy on educational provision in Gaeltacht communities.  In order to do that it is necessary to examine the primary research that has been undertaken to date nationally and Ms Treasa N&iacute; Mhean&iacute;n and Ms Anna Ni Chart&uacute;ir have referred to some of the studies undertaken by An Comhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscoil&iacute;ochta, COGG, the Educational Research Centre and by various third level institutions.  We will also be examining current international research, studies that have already been conducted, based on communities with similar sociolinguistic conditions, for example, the Basque region, Alberta, Wales and other jurisdictions.  As Ms N&iacute; Mhean&iacute;n and Ms Ni Chart&uacute;ir have highlighted, the Gaeltacht context is very complex for a range of reasons.  We have already mentioned school size, sparse distribution of the population, inward migration, various economic circumstances and unemployment in some cases, and the fact that two-thirds of the Gaeltacht schools are two to three teacher schools with an average enrolment of 77.  The standards for oral competency in the language vary widely and English can be the medium of instruction in some cases.  Parental choice is another issue.  There are many challenges in that sector.  The purpose of the review is to identify options and clarify Department policy to ensure that appropriate provision is made for the future in Gaeltacht communities.<\/p><p>  Senator Moloney asked about the timeframe.  It is planned that this review would be undertaken within this year.  A report will be published in 2014.  The terms of reference have been developed in collaboration with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and those terms of reference will be shared with the various bodies involved in Irish medium education.  Someone referred to the importance of strategic groups.  The Taoiseach chairs the Cabinet sub-committee.  There is also an inter-departmental group and a high level bilateral group involving officials from the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Education and Skills.

This Department and other Departments look at figures and statistics.  The six teaching posts in question are very important because hundreds of children are affected by those six posts.  The entire school communities associated with the six different schools are affected.  There may have been a 1% reduction in the overall staffing levels, but hundreds of children have been affected in their formative years as a result of that policy change.  The appeals mechanism is welcome in that it helps to make a bad situation a little bit better.  However, what it has done is to take the very unfair retrospective element out of the process but it has not really done anything else.  Last year in County Kerry, two posts were lost and five posts were saved through the appeals mechanism.  It is a case of kicking the can a little further down the road because with the increasing thresholds, all the appeals mechanism can do is give the schools a chance at least.  People will say it should not have been retrospective in the first place.  It is very scant consolation.<\/p><p>  The level of actual savings achieved is much less than originally anticipated.  I stand open to correction on the figures.  I asked parliamentary questions on this subject and the reply gave a figure of approximately &euro;2.5 million, which is a very small amount in the overall scheme but it has caused a significant level of upset, anger and frustration.  It is easy to say here that this needs to be reviewed, but there has not been any significant financial saving for the Department.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh touched on this aspect in his contribution.  It would be a different matter if it made up a significant part of the annual savings required by the Department.

I will deal with the questions regarding teacher allocations.  The increases in staffing schedules were introduced in budget 2012 and are being phased over a three-year period.  The decision to do so was not taken lightly.  It was done because the Department had a tight budget to manage, with no additional money available to us, and it was necessary to make difficult choices in order to achieve savings.  This is one of the cost-saving measures that was selected.  It was done as fairly as possible in terms of phased increases and the introduction, for the first time, of an appeals process in respect of projected enrolments.<\/p><p>  This budget measure is designed to achieve total savings of &euro;15 million per annum when fully implemented, yielding 250 posts over a three-year period.  The phased structure means that the projected savings are 100 in the first year, 75 in year two and 75 in year three, giving a total of 250.  For 2012, which is year one of the three-year process, approximately two thirds of the projected savings were achieved.  That number would probably have been closer to the full initial projection if the appeals process was not in place.  We are anxious, however, to ease the picture as best as possible.<\/p><p>  Where posts are lost, teachers are redeployed.  In 2012, as again in 2013, we were working in a climate where no school could be left with a surplus permanent teacher.  We are operating a system of 100% redeployment.  In fact, we are one of the most effective sectors within the public service in terms of staff redeployment.  We achieved our 100% deployment target in 2012 and expect to do the same this year.  Our approach in this regard is that any school vacancy is not fillable until the 100% target is achieved.<\/p><p>  Deputy Brendan Griffin referred to the impact of the loss of six jobs.  Those schools will have teachers remaining, who will have extra pupils in their classes.  One of the greatest impacts we must bear in mind relates to the very significant increases in our demographics.  We want to avoid a situation where in those areas which are experiencing significant demographic growth, there would be classrooms with no teacher because the payroll does not support it.  We are operating in a context whereby overall teacher numbers in our schools, even with the impact of this and other budget measures that affect schools at both primary and post-primary level, will be higher this coming September than they were last September.  The challenge is to balance the requirement for difficult budget decisions against the reality of increasing enrolments.  We are trying to stretch our money as far as we can, and that, unfortunately, necessitates difficult decisions.<\/p><p>  In terms of the number of schools affected, our records show 132, which does not quite match up with the figure of 142 that was mentioned.  We will clarify this issue with our statistics section and come back to the committee.  Some of the information coming through that section is not broken down to the same level of detail for every category of school.<\/p><p>  Senator Marie Moloney asked whether this particular measure could be open to legal challenge.  The reality is that any measure is potentially open to such challenge, in which case it is up to the courts to decide.  We would vigorously defend our position that we have been fair and reasonable in the approach we have taken with this and other budget measures.  We are working with finite resources and cannot do everything we could do in the past.  Some of the historical arrangements we have discussed were introduced at a time when demographics were declining and we had a great deal more money.  We are in the opposite scenario now and must cut our cloth to measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900014#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Loftus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369834500,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I will address the point raised by Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh.

That was not the case because the Department took away the preferential ratio which previously obtained in respect of Gaeltacht schools.  That is the crux of the problem.  I am interested in the thinking behind that move, particularly as the Department seems to be of the view that an English-medium school in a non-Gaeltacht - possibly rural - area and a Gaeltacht school are exactly the same.  We are trying to explain that they are not the same.  Mr. Loftus also stated that there had been 100% redeployment.  If that were the case, where did the savings arise?  The Department is still employing the same number of teachers.  Does what was done involve a bias towards urban schools, which have obtained additional teachers, and rural Gaeltacht schools, which have lost teachers?  If there were such a bias, then I have an issue with it.  The change to the pupil-teacher ratio gave rise to a double whammy for Gaeltacht schools.  Not only did the Department increase the ratio in respect of schools with between one and four teachers, it also removed the preferential rate which applied to Gaeltacht schools.  What would have happened if the preferential rate had been left in place and if the ratio for Gaeltacht schools had been increased by the same number?  Mr. Loftus stated that six posts had been lost.  If the Department had gone halfway, then three posts would have been lost and a further two in the 2013-2014 school year.  I contend that this would not be of major significance in the context of the overall savings made by the Department.  Perhaps it might review the position.<\/p><p>  D&iacute;reach ar an bpointe a rinne Treasa N&iacute; Mhainin - glacaim leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; le r&aacute; aici - t&aacute; knock-on effect ag na ciorruithe sna bunscoileanna ar na me&aacute;nscoileanna.

The standardisation with all other small schools was done as part of the attempt to achieve budget savings.  In that context, it occurred as a result of a policy decision by the Government and I cannot comment upon that.  However, part of that policy decision was to treat all small schools equally.  The only differentiation made was in respect of DEIS band 1 schools, which are the most disadvantaged.  All other small schools were treated in the same way.  I tried to make the point earlier that if one compares this to the type of change that was implemented - via the budgetary process - by the previous Government in respect of gaelscoileanna, which had a more favourable staffing schedule, one will see that this was done in one go and that there was no appeals process.  For the Gaeltacht schools, this was done on a phased basis and an appeals process was put in place.<\/p><p>  Savings relating to redeployment are achieved by way of the Department not being obliged to foot an additional cost for filling teaching vacancies in other schools through the recruitment of new teachers.

The redeployment of these teachers - some of whom came from Gaeltacht schools - saves the Department the additional cost of employing 400 new teachers if it did not redeploy.

What the various budget measures over the years, including this one, have done is to help steady the ship in terms of the number of extra teachers required to cater for changing demographics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052900016#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Loftus"},{"type":"speech","time":1369835700,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I am conscious that the room is needed for another meeting.

It is important to remind ourselves of the background.  At the end of July of last year, the Government decided to introduce a local property tax, LPT, and that, without prejudice to the policy decisions, this would be collected by Revenue.  Together with my Commissioner colleagues, we began to develop an implementation pathway in circumstances in which we were missing key policy decisions, a register, legislation and an IT system.<\/p><p>  Nine months later, by the end of March, two LPT Bills had been drafted and enacted, a register had been compiled and an IT system had been built.  We were more than half way through the issue of LPT returns in respect of more than 1.66 million properties, the first 25,000 returns had been already filed and the first &euro;1 million had been already transferred to the Exchequer.  In other words, we had a fully functioning new tax within nine months.<\/p><p>  Since the register was compiled from several databases, we knew that some people would receive letters in error.  We flagged this from the beginning publicly and in our letters to customers.  We also knew that we would be missing properties.  Given the scale, we knew from the start that Revenue did not have the necessary infrastructure to manage the volume of queries that was inevitable with a new tax.  We made arrangements to manage it with a mix of Revenue and external resources.  We identified risks and put in place contingency plans.  We continued to build the register even as the issue of returns was ongoing.  We issued LPT returns to just over 1.69 million properties either by post or by way of their Revenue Online Service, ROS, inboxes.  We carried out an extensive communications campaign and advised property owners that, if we did not contact them, they still had an obligation to file.  We were supported in our communication campaign by the Citizens Information Services.  I am grateful for its help.<\/p><p>  I will turn to the credit card issue, as the committee asked that I address it specifically.  While we certainly had not foreseen it, the systems and people we had in place ensured that we were able to respond quickly after it happened.  Late on Thursday, 9 May, senior Revenue officials were informed that a member of the public had contacted Revenue's LPT branch via the LPT helpline and reported that unauthorised access to his credit card had been attempted.  He advised that he had recently used the helpline to file his property tax return.  Revenue immediately contacted Abtran, the company that operates the LPT helpline on our behalf.  Using sophisticated call recording technology, Abtran quickly identified the agent who took the call, confirmed to us early on Friday morning that it had identified the individual and reported the incident to the Garda.  Subsequently, Abtran also confirmed that the Garda had met and interviewed the person in question.  Given the fact that the issue is still under investigation, it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further.<\/p><p>  Given the nature of the breach, we reported the issue to the Data Protection Commissioner on the Friday in question.  While we are continuing to work with his office, he has stated publicly that he is satisfied that Revenue acted correctly by reporting the incident and in the way we handled it.<\/p><p>  Over the weekend in question, Revenue officials were in constant contact with Abtran.  It subsequently transpired that the agent had inappropriately obtained the credit card details of 11 customers in total.  We issued a comprehensive public statement on Sunday, 12 May and engaged extensively with the media on Monday, 13 May to reassure the public.  I have already circulated copies of the relevant statements to the committee.<\/p><p>  Most importantly, I can confirm to the committee that, while the individual in question tried to effect transactions using some of the credit card details, he was not successful and no one suffered a loss.  I can also confirm that he was not a member of any payments authorised team within Abtran, had no authority to ask for those details and should not have done so.<\/p><p>  Senior Revenue officials have since met Abtran and conducted a full review of data security and personnel vetting arrangements.  The company, which is accredited to internationally recognised standards, including certification for payments security and ISO 27001, has on foot of its own internal investigations assured us that the incident was an isolated matter involving a single individual.<\/p><p>  Regarding systems and technology, I wish to clarify that no Abtran employee has any access to Revenue's computer systems.  These are fully secure and were not impacted on in any way by this incident.<\/p><p>  Thankfully, the issue does not seem to have had a negative impact on the number of customers choosing to file their property tax returns by telephone.  In fact, one of the reasons we decided to extend the filing deadline until 8 p.m. today was the volume of requests received yesterday to file over the telephone, approximately 8,000.<\/p><p>  The outcome of the voluntary phase of the LPT has been successful to date and I am pleased to be able to advise the committee that LPT returns have been filed in respect of 1.52 million properties, a slight increase on the number cited in the information provided to members.  Returns are being received this morning at the rate of 2,000 per hour.  Next week, when the Department of Finance announces the May Exchequer figures, I expect that it will include more than &euro;100 million of this new tax, transferred by Revenue to the Exchequer.  This result is a credit to the work of teams of people in Revenue and, more importantly, to the taxpayers who responded and shows once again that voluntary tax compliance is high in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369838400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Each of the main spokespersons will have ten minutes and there will be five minutes for others, as there are many members who would like to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900004#C00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1369838400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Feehily and her colleagues.

The only role of the estimate is in default of a return.  Having said that, I will say that indicative value bands were used on our online map and on the PDF documents sent to various offices, which facilitated people in looking up local indicative average values and, by definition, approximately half of them are right.  That is what the trends are showing.  Approximately half are in line with our valuation and the other half are changing the valuations.  Broadly speaking, approximately 11% to 15% are going up and the rest are going down.  These are crude indicative numbers and we have not done the slicing and dicing on them.

That is how Revenue is approaching it.<\/p><p>  The payment date of 1 January 2014 was chosen to enable people to spread the payment over 12 months.  I discussed the date with Deputy Fleming, who has left, in another context at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts recently.  If we had made the payment date 1 March, people would have to spread the payment over nine months.  That is why we picked January so that people can elect, before Christmas, to pay over 12 equal months or 52 equal weeks if they are paid weekly.  <\/p><p>  The legislation says what it says but we can, within reason, manage and schedule payment dates.  Every year Revenue grants a concession when people file their tax returns online.  Within our own care and management, we can make some sensible arrangements around the margins of payment dates.

We very much value their time.  Nobody, especially politicians, likes to be in a position of imposing taxes on people as we are aware of the burdens and difficulties they face.  I compliment the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and her staff on the way in which the issue has been dealt with.  If it has to be done it is worth doing well.  It also addresses a question we have asked ourselves as a people.  The Irish people are tax-compliant.  Reference was made by another Deputy to the \"No\" side but that is a small number of people.  In those compliments I include the agents who acted on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners.  There was to be an item on the agenda today about a company from Cork but it has not been mentioned by any of the questioners.  That incident, if it is a serious one, has to be investigated.  In the scheme of things, given the 1.6 million applications, it reflects well on the Revenue Commissioners and the agents it has used.<\/p><p>  May I ask a few specific questions?  First, there is a gap between the number of people who are paying the local property tax and the number who paid the household charge.  A couple of hundred thousand people will become customers of the Revenue Commissioners in the coming months.  It may be fair to say in many cases that because people have paid the local property tax they are mindful of being tax-compliant.  Will the same methods of payment through employers and over terms be applied to those who, to date, have not paid the household charge?  Second, all Members of the Oireachtas have had genuine people call who would like to pay but do not have access to the Internet.  There has been a peak in that regard in recent days.  I was interested to hear the witnesses' comments to the effect that if they get in quickly they will not be late.  Perhaps that issue could be teased out a little more, bearing in mind that this will probably be broadcast on the \"Nine News\" or \"Oireachtas Report\", by which time the deadline will have expired.  My own sense is that there are still a large number of people who would like to pay.  However, they would like to know whether, if they pay reasonably quickly, they will have the same facility to pay at source and over the same spread-out period and what penalties, if any, will be imposed.<\/p><p>  My third brief question is specific.  Already I have heard from a person who wished to change the form he or she had submitted.  The person had deferred and later worked out that it would cost &euro;2 per week and decided not to defer.  When we made contact, it was unclear how the person could pull back into the non-deferral system.  How can that be done?  I appreciate that the valuation on the house is for three years and that appears to be fairly firm.  In Cork there are areas that have been affected by, for example, flooding events.  As circumstances may change and the value of houses may fall, will people be able to change the valuations of their houses in exceptional circumstances?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900010#J02100","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369842000,"counter":247,"content":"<p>On the first question about the &euro;200 household charge, it is a source of some disappointment to me.  I still think people should pay it to the Local Government Management Agency, because it is considerably cheaper, at &euro;144, if they pay before 1 July.  It is better if they do that because it will be &euro;200 when it comes to us in July.  That is my advertisement.  It is really important.  I take the Deputy's point.  If people have paid the local property tax but not the household charge and they have a mind to be compliant, they should be compliant at the cheaper rate in their own interest.  If they leave it over, we will give them the same phased payment arrangements.  If they wish to have it deducted from their salaries and so on, that is fine; we will do that.<\/p><p>  With regard to people who want to withdraw a deferral, they can do it through the helpline.  We hope that people who want to change their minds may wait until we get past the peak of today and tomorrow.  I was going to say they could write in but Mr. Gladney says they will be able to do it on the telephone. If they phone the helpline we can lift their deferral applications.  Self-assessment means that their deferral is accepted at face value.  They have chosen a deferral option.  We will check a handful of them, as we always do, proportionally on a risk basis in due course.  The deferral option is available, and if they want to lift it that is fine.  When we get past the peak we will probably provide options for people to make some changes to their filing online on a self-assessment basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900010#J02200","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369842600,"counter":249,"content":"<p>We must move on to the next speaker because time is running out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900011#K00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1369842600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Feehily and welcome her.

That is voluntary compliance in the context in which the law provides consequences.  This phase is the same phase that occurs with any other tax in a self-assessment system when people comply.  Often they comply because they do not like the alternative, but it is no different to other taxes.

That is the reason we are starting with people in the PAYE sector and the occupational pension sector.  The reason the social welfare category comes next is that anyone whose only income is a social welfare payment is, by definition, entitled to a deferral and we will be reminding them of that fact.  That is simply a fact of the numbers.  If a person's only income is a social welfare payment of any kind then, by definition, she is entitled to a deferral.  While we are moving at one level to deal with PAYE workers, we will be reminding people whose only income is social welfare that they should have claimed a deferral.  That is the categorisation.  The reason I maintain it is about right is that the self-assessed are not left to the end.

The property will be required to be declared but an exemption will be claimed in the same way as every other exemption is claimed.  The third category comprises properties that are due for demolition as part of an approved regeneration programme.  We are looking at those from the point of view of deeming them not liable and therefore outside the scope of the legislation because they are part of an approved regeneration programme.  We are in discussions with the local authorities about the procedures that will be required to be put in place because the regeneration programme is fixed and well defined with very tight guidelines around the procedures.  However, if the property is simply vacant, it is liable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900013#M00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Vivienne Dempsey"},{"type":"speech","time":1369843800,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Feehily, Ms Dempsey and Mr. Gladney for their attendance.

This has been confirmed by a statement from Tim Cook this morning, as I understand.  I can certainly assure the committee that Revenue does not do special deals on tax rates for any company of any size.  I am speaking in general and not about any company in particular.<\/p> <p>Our tax system is statute-based and transparent.  I have no role in changing it.<\/p><p> Global businesses and global tax arbitrage comprise an extremely complex area of work for us.  It is an area which raises complex policy issues and complex global political issues which need to be considered in the first instance at the policy and political levels, long before they reach us as tax administrators.  In my view - the Government has said this, but I wish to give members my perspective - these issues can only be resolved by direct engagement at OECD and EU level.  Reference has been made in the commentary to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, BEPS, report.  The work on that report is supported by Revenue officials in numerous working parties in the OECD.  We are working closely with people from other tax administrations in this regard.  The Forum on Tax Administration is where tax commissioners meet under the auspices of the OECD.  The week before last, 55 of us met in this capacity under my chairmanship, where we considered what our role as tax commissioners should be in the context of the BEPS report.  We announced in our final <i>communiqu&eacute;<\/i>that we stand ready to implement the action plan whenever it emerges from the policy considerations that are to come.<\/p><p> In summary, our position in regard to global tax compliance is that it is a global issue.  Countries on their own cannot resolve it, not even if, in Ireland's case, we had 1 million people working in Revenue.  We stand absolutely ready, however, to implement any of the actions that are decided on by the OECD.  Information, particularly third-party information, is the lifeblood of tax administration.  We have very strong exchange of information arrangements with other tax authorities.  I expect the United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, FATCA, will prove useful to us in this regard.  I welcome the move by the European Union, under the Irish Presidency, towards greater exchange of information that will give us access to data.  This is in a different space entirely to the other issue; it is not about BEPS but about evasion.  At the meeting I referred to and which I chaired, the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom announced that they have put together something like 400 GB of data which they intend to share with us under treaty arrangements.  We are very active globally with our administration colleagues once the policy issues have been resolved and are passed down to us to deal with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900013#M04900","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369844400,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Feehily.

I am not convinced there is a special arrangement for particular companies in the manner reported in the media.  Our taxation code has been designed in a way that allows for companies - I am not singling out any particular organisation - to avoid paying tax on profits.  They are able to do so in a legal way.  It is not that individual companies are being charged a lower rate but that they are able to fit into the code in such a way that it allows them not to pay.<\/p><p>  In 1999, following a report by the Department of Finance, there was a closure of significant loopholes for Irish incorporated companies that were non-tax resident in this jurisdiction.  There were serious questions in regard to a number of those companies, with some possibly being involved in criminal activity.  I am not making those accusations; the information comes from a note by the Department.  The 1999 changes dealt with part of this problem.<\/p><p>  In that context, while I agree that tax evasion must be tackled at the global level, is it not also the case that loopholes can be closed on a state-by-state basis?  Does Ms Feehily subscribe to the notion that a company incorporated in this State and non-tax resident in this jurisdiction which is also non-tax resident in any other country in the world should, by default, become tax resident here as a result of its incorporation?  In other words, if a company wants to be non-tax resident and incorporated here, it would have to show that its management control is outside of this State.  What I am proposing here is that there should be an additional clause such that a company must show it is tax resident in another country and, if not, the process of incorporation in this State would mean it is automatically tax resident here.  That would close down a loophole for companies whose multiple billions of euro in profit are swilling in and out of coffers in this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052900014#N00500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369844400,"counter":347,"content":"<p>The Deputy answered the question himself by asking whether I subscribe to the view he articulated.

The purpose of the meeting is to mark Africa Day, 25 May, by focusing on aspects of Ireland's long-standing relationship with the continent.  Africa Day falls on the anniversary of the establishment of the African Union and is a day designated by African leaders to highlight African unity.  The Government's Africa strategy which was launched by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in 2011 drew attention to the fact that Africa was undergoing significant and rapid change.  Despite the development challenges, many sub-Saharan African countries have experienced greater economic growth, more trade, more investment, fewer wars and greater democratic participation than ever before.<\/p><p>  Alongside its long-standing development co-operation relationship, Ireland is moving towards a more balanced and mature set of relationships with African countries, reflecting the views of African countries that job creation, foreign direct investment, trade and private sector development are the drivers of future growth and development.  Trade and investment are very important elements of the route out of poverty for developing countries and essential for sustainable development.  This is recognised clearly in One World, One Future, the Government's policy on international development which was launched recently.  In that policy document Irish Aid sets out a clear strategy for helping the least developed countries to increase trade with a view to achieving sustainable economic growth.  In that context, it is appropriate that we will discuss the development of trade and investment in Africa with two NGOs whose work is focused on this area.  Value Added in Africa facilitates sustainable trade links between businesses in Africa and those in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe.  Traidlinks aims to build links between the Irish and business communities and the Irish Aid programme in developing countries, with a particular focus on Uganda, with the objective of promoting poverty relief and the advancement of education.<\/p><p>  Our first guest is Mr. Conall O'Caoimh, director of Value Added in Africa, who is very welcome.  The usual warning prevails.  If he is directed by the Chairman to cease making remarks in a particular fashion, he must do so.  Only evidence on the subject matter of the meeting is to be given and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

The more producers produces the more the price goes down and, therefore, the more they have to produce to keep their income at a constant level.<\/p><p>  I accessed the freshest data from the EUROSTAT database last week.  Deputy O'Sullivan was present a few years ago when we a launched a big report that Irish Aid commissioned us to do on examining Ireland's trade with the programme countries.  The EUROSTAT data show that in the 1990s in an average year we sold seven times more than we bought from the six programme countries, but in the past five years that ratio is now 43:1.  The paper refers to a mature relationship with Africa.  The Africa strategy refers to two-way trade and yet when we examine the trade that has happened, we have gone from a ratio of 7:1, which was bad enough, to 43:1.  Ireland, for very good reasons, wants to grow its exports to Africa.  If we are to do that and want to have a two-way trade relationship, we need to put in significant effort to grow the trade in the opposite direction.  The new aid policy, One World, One Future, is very good but a good deal of work needs to be done now to identify how are we going to achieve that two-way trade relationship.  That is something that will need to be monitored in the coming years to see how that progresses.<br \/> The paper refers to no tied aid and that is very good.  A number of European countries have pretty poor practice in that respect, therefore, it is very good to see Irish Aid committing to that.  However it refers to synergies and finding, where we can, synergies between the aid programme and Irish business interests.  I can understand that very well and the committee will have a role in devising a mechanism for ensuring that searching for synergies does not become a criterion alongside poverty reduction.  Poverty reduction must be the criterion in deciding where our aid money goes.  If synergies are a by-product fair enough, but they should not be a criterion in the decision making around where aid would go.<\/p><p>  I suggest the next steps are that we would decide on a few key objectives underneath the heading of two-way trade.  What do we mean by that?  What is it in a five-year or ten-year framework that we want to achieve in regard to building two-way trade?   What are some of the interim steps?  Let us do a data analysis and find the baseline in terms of what is happening.  I have set out some headline figures but we need to examine this on a country by country basis to see in which sectors will it be most possible to make some ground, how we will find that out, and then track that progress.  We should examine what other counties are doing.  The Netherlands, in its enlightenment, has had an organisation, CBI, established for a good number of years and members can check its website, <i><i>cbi.eu<\/i><\/i>.   CBI is a government agency of the Netherlands and its task is to grow the Netherlands' imports from developing countries.  We collaborate actively with CBI in Kenya and in a few other countries.  That agency actively seeks to promote imports from developing countries and this is to ensure that the Netherlands lives up to its rhetoric about two-way trade.  DANIDA, the Danish programme, and UK Aid both have strategies for a start - they are documented strategies - and they also have budgets for the areas that can ensure that two-way trade means something.  There is a policy, a strategy and a budget, which is where such trade starts to happen.  We need those three components to be in place.  <\/p><p>  We need to prioritise some areas where Ireland has a particular expertise and where it will be of particular interest to developing countries.  Food processing, packaging, food safety and marketing would be some of those areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conall O'Caoimh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369835100,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Caoimh for his presentation, which was interesting.  It is heartening that we are moving away from the emphasis on aid that existed in the past and are talking about trade, development and investment in Africa, a continent of 50-plus countries.  I was somewhat alarmed to hear of a bias against products coming from Africa.  We have international trading rules.  The World Organisation for Animal Health, OIE, has standards that must be achieved for food that is internationally traded.  Perhaps he would elaborate on that issue.  I mentioned the World Trade Organization previously in a different context.  There is a need for a need for a plenary session and a new deal for developing countries.  That is one issue that has gone off the political agenda throughout the developed world, or at least that is how it appears to me from the outside.  It is an area on which there should be a greater emphasis in the different forums and by NGOs in all countries.<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Caoimh also mentioned the huge disparity in the export-import ratio.  His presentation showed that between 2008 and 2012 the ratio increased from 7:1 to 43:1.  Was this due to additional exports or was there a fall-off in imports?  Were there some particular products, such as pharmaceuticals, medical appliances or whatever, that resulted in that huge disparity?<\/p><p>  I am not familiar with Mr. O'Caoimh's work but I compliment Irish Aid, Tr&oacute;caire and other NGOs on giving him some assistance.

I did not read the second handout but worked off the earlier briefing notes.  Perhaps he will assist me in understanding exactly what he does.  From reading his notes, it appears he is targeting work that has already been done by the producers.  In other words, he said he targets groups that already have a proven high-quality product and, in fact, are export-ready.  He also said he works with companies that are already achieving a presence in other European countries.  His use of the name \"Fairtrade\" threw me in the context of what he said, which was that he is targeting the marketing of goods and produce from established groups.  As we all know, Fairtrade starts practically in the womb.  The farmers produce goods where there is a collective agreement and a specific policy on fertilisation, child labour and redistribution of profits to the community or the bringing in of a water supply.  In order that I do not confuse this with Fairtrade, Mr. O'Caoimh is targeting those producers of goods who already have a proven record in terms of quality and have already possibly penetrated the European market.  That is excellent.  It is great that we can look at Africa in this light and that we are not thinking of it as a continent that needs financial assistance to help the starving.  This is progressive and it is the way forward, but there is confusion as to whether Fairtrade plays a role in Mr. O'Caoimh's organisation.  Is that accidental?  Already, Fairtrade Ireland has been working with people who produce good-quality produce ready for the market.  Is it the case that Mr. O'Caoimh gives it a helping hand to perhaps package it more effectively?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900005#D00400","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1369835100,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I compliment Mr. O'Caoimh on his clear and lucid presentation.  There are elements of hope in it.  Deputy Brendan Smith has already raised a question about which I was concerned, but I would like to explore it a little further.  I am talking about political bias.  What is the nature of the bias?  What measures can be taken to overcome that bias?  Is there a way in which the committee can assist?  He instanced particular products that were involved.  Can he say something about the chocolate industry, which been a concern for this committee for some time?  Personally, I have been very concerned about it.<\/p><p>  It is staggering that in a short space of time the balance of trade has disimproved so drastically, with the export-import ratio increasing from 6:1 to 43:1.  I do not think the majority of people, even politically aware people, understand that.  Certainly, I was not aware that it was quite so dramatic.  His explanation was about the paradox of what he described - accurately, I believe - as the trade trap, whereby, as producers make more raw goods, the prices of these goods decrease.  This is something that needs to be addressed, and perhaps the committee could take it up.<\/p><p>  I might broaden things out a little.  I appreciate that both presentations are about trade.  The intention is humanitarian and it is to make life better for people.  Mr. O'Caoimh invokes the One World, One Future document.  One of my concerns about that document is a complete absence of any reference to population policy.  This committee needs to keep an eye on that and ensure this is under review.  In particular, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade said on 21 February that the issue of gender equality and access to reproductive health care came out strongly in the public consultation on the review of the White Paper and will be addressed in the new policy.  We have not heard the results of that public consultation or any of the submissions, and once again we are avoiding it.  I say that because every year I go to the launch of the UN report on global population.  We never mention population.  We avoid it all the time.  That has an economic impact in Africa.  In case anybody thinks I am biased, may I say that I delight when I hear the population is declining in France, Britain, Germany or Ireland, because we do much more damage.  It is still critical in Africa.  If we adhered to all the millennium development goals to which we signed up in 2000, one of which was to make family planning universally available by 2015 as part of a broad approach to reproductive health and rights, we are doing so under cover.  That would lead to a 27% drop in maternal deaths.  We have wonderful women such as the women who are making jam.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900005#D00500","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369835700,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Caoimh for his presentation.

I will start with the question on my organisation as my answering it is certainly a preliminary step in understanding some of the other questions.  We consider our organisation to be a fair trade organisation in that we are seeking to make trade fairer.  Members will know the Fairtrade label.  The trade union movement, the credit union movement, the co-operative movement and the groups that lobby the World Trade Organization are all part of a movement.  I was before this committee a number of times during the terms of previous D&aacute;la in that my background involves my having worked on and campaigned on the trade rules.  People who do this and those who watch what the multinationals are doing, including what happened in Bangladesh recently, are part of different branches of a movement that is the fair trade movement.  It has a number of strands.  It is probably the one with the label on the chocolate or coffee that people identify with most, but all are working together to try to achieve fair trade.<\/p><p>  In 1996, I was in Mozambique and that is where I first had the idea for this organisation.  I returned and got a job in Comhl&aacute;mh and later in D&oacute;chas working on the trade rules policy.  While we were working on getting the rules right at the World Trade Organization &ndash; I was in Doha, Hong Kong and Canc&uacute;n processing the rules &ndash; it was acknowledged that African countries and other developing countries need support to actually build the business relationships that will result in trade.<\/p><p>  Our first task is to identify producers.  Michelle Hardiman, my colleague in the Gallery, recently travelled around southern Africa trying to find a fully African T-shirt.  There are T-shirts but the cloth may be imported from India or China.  We are trying to get a fully African T-shirt.  We can get some but we do not know what happens on the farms.  We are trying to get T-shirts that have full certification regarding what happens on the farm.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Fairtrade label that members know, none of the Fairtrade-grown cotton is actually turned into thread in Africa.  It is all taken away to Asia and America to be turned into thread.  Therefore, we have had to examine some of the other systems; otherwise we cannot have a fully African T-shirt.  We are trying to propose to people in the market that they buy a fully African one.  There is the Cotton made in Africa initiative and the Better Cotton initiative, and there is a couple of organic schemes that measure and audit what happens on the farms.  We try to ensure that the factories are ones that pay workers well and which are audited internationally.  That is what we mean by fair trade.  We have beers from four different countries on the market.  That is probably the product I can point members to most easily.  If the bar of the Houses wants to host an event serving the beer, we can arrange for a supply.  We can help to arrange to match-make in that regard.<\/p><p>  Fairtrade does not certify beers, yet the brewery that we link with in Kenya has 970 people employed in the best quality jobs in that country.  They have the best conditions.  There are 5,000 farmers growing the input products and their conditions are the very same as Fairtrade conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900006#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conall O'Caoimh"},{"type":"speech","time":1369835700,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Is that Tuskser beer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900006#E00700","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369835700,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900006#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conall O'Caoimh"},{"type":"speech","time":1369835700,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I have it at home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013052900006#E00900","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369835700,"counter":407,"content":"<p>There are Fairtrade conditions in terms of trade union representation, guaranteed price, advance payment and agricultural extension but also a guaranteed sale, which Fairtrade does not give.

Ireland has increased its exports exponentially in recent years.  Part of the reason countries are buying a lot more is that they are growing.  It is in the interests of Irish taxpayers that they grow because there will be a bigger market for us to sell into.  What we buy from them has fallen to a quarter of what it was in 1996.  Since the crash of the Celtic tiger, and during it, our imports from the six countries to which we give the most aid collapsed.  Lyons tea bags are no longer made in Ireland.  When Unilever bought it and moved production to Britain, we stopped buying tea from a number of African countries.  When Fruit of the Loom closed we stopped buying cotton from a number of African countries.  As the nature of Irish industry changed, we no longer needed to buy commodities.  Industries collapsed because nothing was done to replace them.  The aid programme has a role in finding replacements as things fall off.<\/p><p>  We have a small operation in the UK.

One of the biggest changes in East Africa in the past number of years has been the introduction of mobile phones.  Money can be sent in Kenya and Tanzania with the bog-standard mobile phone.  While rural banks in Ireland are closing, in east Africa mobile phones have enabled people to leapfrog into a new generation of banking which is not based on an institution.  Formerly, a woman living on a hill had to pay a bus driver to bring her and her products to the market, where she would stand for a day.  If a regular buyer was not there to make purchases she would have to sell her product at a lower price.  She can now text her preferred buyer, agree a price and day, put the product onto a van, text the buyer to tell him or her it is coming and have the money texted to her.  Vodafone is operating in a number of countries and is making money.  Mobile phones have changed the business model.  Transaction costs are reduced and women are able to be productive.<\/p><p>  Significant multinationals are leveraging power.  Tea producers in Kenya and Rwanda currently sell bulk tea.  In the past month they have told us they make tea bags for the local market but cannot sell internationally because big international buyers might leave them if they try to compete with their products.  They are in fear that the multinationals will squeeze them out.  <\/p><p>  Fairtrade is similar to us, but the key difference is that the work it does is on farms, and its system does not reach into factories.  It does not distinguish whether product is turned into chocolate in Europe or Africa.  We are trying to emphasise that we only work with products that are fully processed and ready for consumers at the final stage in Africa. <\/p><p>  The basket of products coming from many African countries is the same as that under the colonial system.  Change has not yet happened, and that is what we are trying to achieve.

I am afraid my presentation might be somewhat disordered, as I have forgotten my glasses and am unable to read the document I have prepared.  The submission, copies of which have been circulated to members, basically sets out the logic behind how Traidlinks sees the world and how it is evolving.  We describe ourselves as a business-led, not-for-profit organisation.  We are not quite a non-governmental organisation because we are involved in so many private-sector activities.  This causes some confusion in the countries in which we work.  We are a registered charity but prefer the label of \"business-led not-for-profit\" because the whole idea of Traidlinks is about involving and engaging the private sector in international development.  It is about working with governments and businesses.<\/p><p>  As members will see from the list of organisations represented on our board, there would be potential for serious damage to the economy of this country if all of our board members were on the same flight to Uganda.  We have representatives of Bewley's Limited, Barry's Tea, Tullow Oil, United Drug, Bimeda Ireland and Ion Equity.  In addition, Mr. Patrick Bitature, chairman of the Uganda Investment Authority, is a member of the board.  It is a very unusual organisation in that sense, being driven by the private sector and funded by Irish Aid, with additional funding from Tullow Oil and TradeMark East Africa.<\/p><p>  In a nutshell, one can look at Africa in two ways.  On the one hand, we have all the bad news such as the failure to reach targets under the millennium development goals.  Members of the committee will be very familiar with everything that is not being achieved.  On the other side of the coin, as illustrated by the statistics I have included in my submission from a report by the McKinsey Global Institute entitled Lions on the Move, there is enormous potential in the growth of Africa's economies, rising GDP and so on.  Just as there are two ways of looking at Africa, I have often observed that there are two views of the world.  The European view of development is very much focused on health, education and services.  The idea is to build good governance, judicial systems and so on and, coming out of that, we then build an economy.  The Chinese, on the other hand, consider this a novel view for the Europeans to take given that European societies did not themselves develop in that way.  It was the other way around, in fact, with somebody building a raft at a fjord in a river and somebody else opening a shebeen next door.  Before we know it we have a business and then somebody says we must have a church and a school.  That is how it went.  On that basis, the Chinese reverse the European approach and argue that the economy comes first and the services sector will follow.  They wonder why we insist on doing it the other way around in Africa.  It is a simplistic way of looking at the world, but it also presents us with a challenge.  As I have pointed out in the submission, the White Paper could be likened to a Rubik's cube, with each side representing the different areas of action.  The difficulty arises because people tend to focus on one side of the cube, whether health, education, HIV-AIDS or something else.  The trick is to focus on all aspects.  Otherwise, the blues will be lined up but the reds will be all over the place.  That will get us nowhere.<\/p><p>  I recently invited a senior consultant from Accenture, a company renowned for its analytical prowess, to come to Traidlinks.  He asked me a very simple question which, he said, he asked of all international NGOs, large and small.  The question was, since people in Africa tend to be poor because they do not have any money, what is our organisation doing to solve that problem?  He remarked that people often give him lectures about health and education in response to that question, but he always replies that those issues could be solved if the money was there.  It is a simple proposition with a challenging implementation.  The question we are asking ourselves is how we can create wealth and jobs.  It is complex in one sense but simple in another.<\/p><p>  Mr. Conall O'Caoimh observed that trade is essential for Africa, specifically value-added trade.  Africa has been trading forever, from its slaves to its coffee, but there has been no value accruing to the continent.  That is a particular problem.  We in Traidlinks believe in trade, business creation, wealth creation and support for small and medium-sized enterprises.  We position ourselves just above the co-operative level - that is, not getting down to farmer-to-farmer level.  Our main focus is on small and medium-sized business but not necessarily at the micro-finance level, in which lots of people are already involved.  Our challenge, in short, is to help businesses to grow.  In Uganda people often say they need more entrepreneurs.  In fact, that is the last thing the country needs because there are probably 39 million entrepreneurs.  What is actually needed are structured businesses with structured finance.  We need people in those businesses who know about marketing, communications, technology and business processes.  This is the dynamic in which we see Traidlinks positioning itself.  We are not operating as an NGO, coming in and saying we will set up programmes.  Rather, we are working on a partnership model with key institutions.  Our key interlocutors in Uganda are the Uganda Export Promotion Board and the Uganda Investment Authority, which are the equivalent, respectively, of An Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland.  They are, however, very weak institutions.  The Uganda Export Promotion Board, for example, has a budget of some &euro;300,000 to promote exports from a country of 39 million people.  Compare this with An Bord Bia, which has a budget of &euro;45 million to promote food products from Ireland and within Ireland.  That is a good example of the structural problems within the business sector in Africa.  There are, in fact, very few business support services or Government institutions of any weight.  This is to some extent a symptom of development, in that whatever resources are available are going into education, health and so on.  The business sector, on the other hand, and the institutions that support it have been neglected.  Those institutions are simply not in a fit state to help companies to get established and grow.  Hence we have had the flood of commodities out of the country through the various extractive industries and the Chinese coming in and taking whatever there is to be taken.<\/p><p>  Traidlinks has done a significant amount of work in this country in marketing African products.  We created a brand called Heart of Africa and imported large numbers of products into Ireland which were sold in Tesco, Superquinn, SuperValu and so on.  This project hit a wall for two reasons, the first being the recession.  I am sure Mr. O'Caoimh spoke about how difficult it is to get products into economies that are experiencing recession.  The second factor was supply.

As an incentive companies had to pay a large levy to AnCO but received 90% of the money back if they provided a certain type of training.  That method would not work in Africa but it worked here to some extent.  Companies were legally obliged to pay the levy and IMI blossomed, but it plays a different role today.  IMI was intensively involved in training in various management skills.  One cannot transplant what happened here to Africa, but has such an initiative been considered?

It has worked out that for every &euro;10 given in aid, &euro;15 is lost through tax-dodging.  A major emphasis must be placed on profit-shifting and tax-dodging by multinationals.

Other donors have also come on board.  TradeMark East Africa has amassed a significant pool of money.  If one looks underneath its skin one can see that it is managed by KPMG.  There is a trend for large donors to move away from NGOs and international organisations and towards the private sector for possible solutions.  TradeMark East Africa works hand in glove with the State.  It operates inside the revenue authorities and assists with revenue collection and custom duties.  It has a good philosophy, which is worth examining.  It focuses on capacity-building by the state but is motivated by profit.  It sort of says, \"If you do this right, you will get money into your exchequer and be able to pay for services.\"  That is the mentality that TradeMark East Africa has adopted in order to deal with problems.  That is its thrust.<\/p><p>  Education is key.  We have a lot of knowledge on education and have many links with different places.  We work with the food technology section at Makerere University in Kampala.  Truthfully, it is not even close to where Teagasc and Traidlinks are here.  Members will have read the note at the end of my submission.  We need structural links at that level but it is not just Traidlinks that should be trying to achieve this.  Teagasc and Bord Bia should talk to their counterparts in these countries.  That is what I mean by strategic engagement, and Traidlinks has done its bit.<\/p><p>  A person from the Uganda Export Promotion Board and one from the Uganda Investment Authority attended a course by International Development Ireland, IDI, on exporting.  The IDI is an IDA spin-off.  It is a private consultancy company and runs courses on exporting for developing countries.  The Irish embassy in Kampala city said it would fund the attendance of one person if we could fund the other person, and that is what we did.  To me, such courses are only dealing with the tip of the iceberg, and we need a much more structured approach.  We need deliberations to flesh these strategies out.  It is fine to include it in the White Paper, which can act as the skeleton, but we must put meat on the bones.  <\/p><p>  We have a link with the Smurfit Business School.  Professor Damien McLoughlin, head of international marketing at Smurfit Business School, designed our market link programme with us and provided guidance on how to build the programme.

Where a government demands taxes of the private sector, over time it will iron out some of the corruption.  It will become an expectation that if a company wants to operate, it pays taxes.

We appreciate them being here.  I also commend the fact that they are in the process of restructuring the Department and have made that appointment as a liaison point for the Office of the Ombudsman.  All of us present would agree that improving relationships between the Department and the Office of the Ombudsman is key and is, in effect, why we are here.  No one on this committee chooses to pull out anything here, as it were.<\/p><p>  As a committee, we are responsible for responding to the observations made by the Ombudsman when she appeared here in December.  I am sure the Secretary General will have read very clearly the statement the Ombudsman made that day.  She was not disputing the progress that has been made in respect of the care given and the reforms the Department may be making.  Her concern was the lack of care she felt the Department showed towards the law.  As Dr. McLoughlin will recall, she went through three examples of she believed was the Department's tradition of care that was not so good.  I know Dr. McLoughlin noted the three things in his response today and has given us the good side of that.  If one reads the Ombudsman's explanations and observations, one can see an entirely different picture.  She talks about legal advice being reiterated by the Minister's legal advisers and how the Department gambled for six years that it would get away with something it knew was illegal.  In respect of the Travers report, the Ombudsman makes it very clear that the breach that occurred cost the State &euro;500 million.  I accept that is in the past and Dr. McLoughlin said his ambition is to improve that, which is good.<\/p><p>  In respect of the Who Cares? report, the Ombudsman said this was a continuing case and while there may have been 48 complaints per year, they had accumulated to more than 1,000.  That adds up to a lot of people who complained because they did not receive the care they believed should have been provided to them by the health boards or the HSE.  In her investigation, the Ombudsman decided that this was the case but she did not say that they should all be compensated.  As I understand it, she recommended a much smaller form of redress.  In her statement, she said that this was ignored or not responded to, which I thought rather odd because Dr. McLoughlin repeatedly made the point that the Ombudsman does not seem to understand the cost of this to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013052900005#E00300","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369841100,"counter":457,"content":"<p>As the Senator raised a range of issues, I ask her to summarise her questions for clarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013052900006#F00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1369841100,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I would like to know the number of cases involved.

These are the taxpayers' resources and I cannot and will not create precedents which would subsequently expose the State to high levels of payments that could not be justified.<\/p><p>  To the best of my knowledge, approximately 240 cases relate to fees paid on private nursing homes.  I understand we are predominantly dealing with the estates of individuals rather than actual clients.  The clients or their estates are entitled under the Constitution to pursue cases and once they do so, we are in an adversarial system.  My Department must act prudently and properly in line with the advice of the Attorney General.  Before engaging in such litigation, we brief our Ministers fully and both the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, are fully aware of these matters from a legal perspective.<\/p><p>  We are dealing with different cases and expectations differ on the part of the various litigants.  We have to consider each case on its merits to decide on the best defence.  In the current economic climate, if we were to open the floodgates the consequences for the basic operation of our health service could be serious.  The Department is funded by the Exchequer and the Oireachtas funds the health system.  Whenever we are faced with legal challenges that have financial consequences, we are required to exercise a duty of care in respect of the State.  We do that through the Attorney General's office.  It is a matter for the committee and the Oireachtas to decide how much to spend on the health service and I am accountable as Secretary General for ensuring these matters are dealt with in accordance with the best evidence-based governance practices.<\/p><p>  We have, however, provided a considerable amount of information in response to parliamentary questions.  Since the litigation commenced in 2005, for example, we have already reported on a total of 33 cases involving fees paid to private nursing homes which were settled at a cost of &euro;1.2 million.  I face serious constraints when it comes to discussing legal fees.  I cannot provide details on legal costs, but we are represented in the usual way by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General.

He is very busy, but it is a matter of grave importance that we tease these issues out.  I am returning to the Ombudsman's statement to us.  She felt she should inform the committee that:<blockquote><br \/>The Department of Health has a long history of, to put it mildly, carelessness with regard to the law.  This has been the case irrespective of which political party or coalition has been in government.<\/blockquote>She is not the only one who said that.  She and her predecessor as Ombudsman have seen this at close quarters and she recalled a number of different issues.  She also said, and I will tie these up together:<blockquote>It seems clear that the Department is involved in a careful strategy of risk management.  This risk would not exist if the Department had had proper regard to the legal obligation on health boards to provide long-stay care.  If, by any chance, one or more of these cases comes to a hearing and judgment in the High Court and if ... that judgment goes against the State parties, the financial implications would be truly horrendous in terms of the amount of compensation likely to be payable to thousands of claimants.<\/blockquote>In her final comment she said:<blockquote>As the Department represents it, the recommendations I have made are almost reckless from the perspective of the public finances ... What I am pointing out is that the Department of Health - because of what appears to be a culture of prevarication, disregard for the law and an inability to take hard decisions - has already caused the State to incur enormous costs and looks set to continue on that path.<\/blockquote>  We have had a number of Ombudsmen in here and they are very careful with their words.  My understanding of this Ombudsman is that she is very careful and would not say something like that very lightly.  It is very hard to match what the Department of Health and the Ombudsman are saying, but it is clear, and Dr. McLoughlin said this, that there were fundamental differences of opinion and because of resource limitations the Department could not implement what the Ombudsman said.<\/p><p>  The specific cases alluded to and talked about do not affect this committee.  This committee's role is to examine systemic issues.  We are asking what are the powers and role of the Ombudsman <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> the Government and the Departments under it.  That is the fundamental issue here.  There has been a similar situation with An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, with whom we have had hearings, and the Department of Social Protection, where it has said it is not going to follow the Ombudsman's advice because its legal advice says differently.  We need clarity on that.<\/p><p>  Under the Ombudsman Act, what is Dr. McLoughlin's understanding of the Department of Health's situation if it does not agree with the Ombudsman's ruling?  Can the Department challenge that in the High Court?  Under the Official Languages Act, if a Department does not agree with the ruling of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, who is an ombudsman, the next step to take is to challenge it in the High Court.  No Department has ever challenged that.  What is the situation with the Department of Health and the Ombudsman if the Department does not agree with a ruling?  Under the Act what is the next step of redress?  Is it non-engagement, choosing not to agree, and making statements to committees like ourselves that the Department does not agree with it and non-implementation the Ombudsman's findings?<\/p><p>  Some of the cases go back 20 or 30 years and I understand the view of the Department and the Government is totally different from that of the Ombudsman.  This is a wider situation.  The Attorney General and Government have been involved.  Decisions have been made by numerous Governments.  Did officials in the Department in any of the cases the Ombudsman cited suggest changes to the legislation so they would be in compliance with the Ombudsman's rulings?  Have officials suggested changes to each of the three different schemes so the Department would be in compliance?<\/p><p>  I was going to ask about the cost of settlements but that has been addressed.  I appreciate that Dr. McLoughlin said he wants to move forward.  Can he outline the mechanisms that have been put in place so that this cannot happen again?  Most of the issues raised relate to the Equal Status Acts and equality.  What equality-proofing measures has the Department in place that were not in place that will ensure this does not happen again?  When a piece of legislation comes before the Department is it being equality-proofed?  If so, who is doing that?  What measures is the Department using?  Is it the nine grounds of equality?  From what I read, the Ombudsman's advice is that a piece of legislation that was brought forward created a potential liability on the State.  She outlined what she saw as flaws in that legislation, which were not addressed.  How can we ensure that does not happen again?  What mechanisms does the Department have, or what changes have been put in place, to ensure that does not happen in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013052900007#G01600","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369841700,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I will let Ms Fitzpatrick deal with the issues around the Ombudsman's legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013052900007#G01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369841700,"counter":477,"content":"<p>In the Who Cares? report there were no formal recommendations.

Fundamentally, we have a duty of care to the resources of the State and we cannot, no matter what are the pressures, treat litigation from any source without having proper regard to the systems laid down for dealing with such matters.  It is an adversarial process.

I oppose the agreement, which ignores many of the problems the State and the EU has had with the behaviour of Israel.  At present Israel continues to occupy Palestine and enforce an illegal blockade on Gaza, making it effectively the largest prison camp in the world.  Israel denies sufficient humanitarian aid thus causing the most horrible deprivation and preventing rebuild following the onslaught of the Israeli Army.  Israel has shown complete disdain and disregard for human rights and international law.  I am not anti-Israeli and I believe Israel has the right to exist.  I also believe the Palestinians have the right to exist.  This state, the EU and its member states have spoken out strongly against these abuses and are fully aware of them, but we continually reward Israel with economic agreements and deals, unavailable to most states neighbouring the EU.<\/p><p>  In 2001 Israel destroyed Yasser Arafat International Airport in Gaza.  The airport, run by the Palestinian Authority, opened in 1998 was bombed by the Israeli Army.  The airport was built with funding from EU member states, as well as other countries, and the total cost was $86 million.  Israeli bulldozers cut the runway apart in January 2002.  After the destruction of Gaza airport by the Israeli Army, the International Civil Aviation Organization condemned Israel for the destruction of a civilian airport and navigational devices used for civilian purposes only.  Israel's justification was that it might be attacked from this airport, as it was the best equipped in Gaza.  The only remaining runway in Gaza after 2002 is that of the Gaza airstrip, but an Israeli air blockade of Gaza prevents it from being used.  Israel also controls the airspace.  Why do we reward any country that would block off another, impose severe restrictions on its population and deny the basic right of freedom of movement to another country nearby?  The Palestinians have no proper airport and just a strip that is restricted by the Israelis.<\/p><p>  However, the EU believes it is appropriate to sign an aviation agreement with Israel.  The agreement completely ignores the crimes against the rights of Palestinians to travel freely in and out of their own country.  It also ignores Israel's crimes of destroying civilian transport facilitates in Gaza and the West Bank, facilities which were funded by EU member states.  The agreement will strengthen ties with Israel and create opportunities for industry and consumers, but it ignores the rights it is denying another country nearby.  For that reason, we should not sign up to any agreement that would benefit Israel until it is brought into line with proper international practices and it recognises the rights of the Palestinian people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013052900003#B00200","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1369846800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I recognise Deputy Ellis's comments in this regard.

It is proposed that this joint communication warrants further scrutiny at a further meeting of the committee, in conjunction with COM (2013) 48, as that proposal arises from the joint communication.  It is proposed, therefore, that a letter issue to the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources requesting that when the committee meets departmental officials to consider COM (2013) 48, the Department also brief it on the joint communication.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  COM (2012) 776 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on occurrence reporting in civil aviation, amending Regulation (EU) No. 996\/2010 and repealing Directive No. 2003\/42\/EC, Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1321\/2007 and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1330\/2007.  It is proposed that this proposal warrants further scrutiny by way of a letter to the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport stating the joint committee requests information on the outcome of the consultation process undertaken by the Department, especially in respect of the administrative burdens this proposal may place on the aviation industry, and that the committee would also like to be kept informed of further developments on the proposal.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  COM (2013) 153 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council concerning the notification to the Commission of investment in energy infrastructure projects within the European Union, replacing Council Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No. 617\/2010.  COM (2013) 174 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on multiannual funding for the action of the European Maritime Safety Agency in the field of response to pollution caused by ships and to marine pollution caused by oil and gas installations.  COM (2012) 584 is a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the harmonisation of the laws of the member states relating to the making available on the market of radio equipment.
