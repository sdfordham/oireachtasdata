I extend a warm welcome to each of them.  Their presentation will provide an opportunity for members to receive a first-hand account of the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan and the aid being provided.  We are all pleased that the protracted peace talks finally culminated in the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement in August and hope it will lead to a way forward in resolving the issues which were the cause of such terrible tragedies in South Sudan.<\/p><p>The joint committee has taken a very keen interest in what has been happening in this region.  When it visited Ethiopia three years ago, it visited a refugee camp on the border with South Sudan.  We spoke to refugees who had fled their homes as a result of the conflict in South Sudan.  At the time we were aware that there was the potential for enormous problems in South Sudan in terms of famine and hunger, but I hope some of them have been avoided.  Perhaps the delegation might update us in that regard.  When I was in Uganda last year, I met the Minister for Foreign Affairs who updated me on the situation there.  We are looking forward to the presentation because sometimes issues such as the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan go off the radar and our television screens as others arise such as what is happening in the Middle East and the migrant crisis.  We are aware that there are real problems in South Sudan.  <\/p><p>After the delegates have made their presentation, I will invite members to ask questions about the work of the ICRC in South Sudan.  We are delighted to have the delegates present.  We have not had a meeting with the ICRC for some time and look forward to further meetings to discuss its work.  It has an important role to play in areas of conflict and dealing with humanitarian issues.  <\/p><p>I remind members, delegates and those in the Visitors Gallery to switch off their mobile phones for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the recording equipment, even when left in silent mode.  I also remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <\/p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are further directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <\/p><p>I invite Mr. Rauchenstein to make his presentation to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015100700002#B00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444208400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members.  <\/p> <p>  South Sudan is the newest nation in the world, having been created in 2011.  Several months after the creation of this new state, an intense power struggle between the two leaders of the country, Riek Machar on one side and President Salva Kiir Mayardit on the other, triggered a conflict that escalated rapidly along ethnic lines.  Today, 20 months after the outbreak of the recent conflict, the situation is South Sudan is dire.<\/p> <p>  As members can see from the map provided, the green area in the north east of the country is called the greater upper Nile region.  After the conflict broke out, many of the hostilities took place in this region, especially in newly inhabited areas of the greater upper Nile and Unity State.  Today, 1.6 million people are internally displaced, mainly in the green area shown on the map.  This is the priority zone for the ICRC and the place where we are most active.  Much of it is inaccessible because it is mainly rural and there are very few roads.  For six months of the year it is swampy; therefore, the transportation of goods and personnel into the area requires helicopters and aeroplanes, which makes humanitarian action very difficult.  <\/p> <p>  Six or seven ceasefire agreements have been concluded so far, but each time hostilities have continued, especially along the front lines in the areas indicated, displacing more people and further displacing those who had already sought refuge in other areas.  Four or five weeks ago a fragile peace agreement was reached, but as events of yesterday and today illustrate, it has not stopped ongoing hostilities.<\/p><p>As we speak, there are clashes in Unity State and more to the south of the country in the Equatorias.<\/p><p> The humanitarian situation is very dire.  As I told the committee, 1.6 million people are displaced in those areas and the primary concern is the food need those people have.  They are agri-pastoralists who base their livelihood on three pillars, namely, fish, planting and cattle, and all three pillars have been affected.  The cattle have been massively depleted, the planting season has not been good as displaced people cannot plant or can only randomly plant, and some have been driven away from river beds where they are normally able to fish.  It is estimated that 60% of the population of South Sudan, especially the displaced in areas that are difficult to access, are highly food insecure and are dependent on food aid as it guarantees their immediate survival.<\/p><p> During the conflict, health structures have been massively destroyed and it is estimated that more than 100 health structures in a country that already had one of the weakest health coverages worldwide have been either looted or destroyed.  Other services are equally very weak or non-existent and the most vulnerable of the displaced are in areas difficult to access, so it is a fight for life and one of the worst humanitarian situations in the world today.<\/p><p> Last year, the ICRC rapidly deployed an emergency response to what happened, especially in these difficult to access areas in the north east.  We established a food pipeline and regular food air drops to ensure the nutrition of many thousands of displaced people.  This, combined with health services to the many wounded due to the fighting, comprises the emergency response of the ICRC and is shown on the slide.  Some 1.3 million food rations have been distributed and non-food items have also been provided, such as tarpaulins for people who have been displaced.  We have always tried to combine food aid with livelihood and resilience activities to create independence for the population, where possible, and we have provided seeds, tools and fishing kits, as well as vaccinating cattle to enhance the resilience of the affected population.  We have worked together with the Ministry of Agriculture, especially in cattle vaccination.  Cattle are very important in South Sudan.  There are more cattle than inhabitants and every family has some cattle, which helps to increase the resilience of the family.  The little children get the milk of the cow and the adults slaughter it when there is no other way to feed the family.<\/p><p> Beside the emergency response, in terms of livelihood and nutrition the medical aspect is very important.  There are numerous war wounded of the conflict and, in the past 20 months, we have mobilised five mobile surgical teams to operate on war wounds on both civilians and weapon bearers in some 14 makeshift clinics in the bush.  In total, 6,500 life-saving surgeries have been carried out in that period, which is a big logistical effort because often the wounded have to be collected by helicopter or aeroplane close to the front line and brought to areas where life-saving surgeries can be carried out.  More comprehensive health care was given in hospitals and in primary health care centres.  The ICRC supported this because health services in those areas are almost non-existent and many people die of common pathologies such as malaria and cholera if not treated immediately.<\/p><p> The third pillar of the ICRC is training and many of the weapon bearers, be they soldiers or fighting for the opposition army, have been trained to better respect international humanitarian law, such as the Geneva Convention.  We established a confidential dialogue with the commanders of each party and accompanied this dialogue with recommendations on how to ensure better respect of civilians.<\/p><p> The outlook for South Sudan is not very positive.  A fragile peace agreement has been concluded but very recent developments show that even if this peace agreement holds, the process will be very long and rocky.  Regardless of that, the humanitarian needs in South Sudan will last for many years to come.  Civilians will not go back to their homes, often to their destroyed villages, and invest in rebuilding if there is not a more solid peace and if there are no positive signs that they can trust in the future.  The role of the international community is very important in the sense that parties to the conflict have to be reminded to respect the civilian population and basic rules of humanitarian law, but financial support is highly necessary.  I thank the Irish Government for its continued support to the ICRC and to humanitarian action on the whole.  I also thank the Irish Red Cross which very recently collected funds for the ICRC.  I express my thanks to the Irish people for their help in alleviating the suffering of the population in one of the worst crises of the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015100700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Franz Rauchenstein","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444208400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Rauchenstein for the update.

South Sudan probably does not have the public awareness that it needs to have of the contributions and assistance of organisations such as the ICRC that are working there in most difficult circumstances.  Following on from the Chairman's question, the establishment of the world's newest independent state was followed two years after by a devastating civil war.

It is my understanding, and maybe the witness will expand on it, that there has been an increase in hostilities recently and there have even been attacks on humanitarian organisations while carrying out their work.  I think there may have been an attack on an ICRC compound in the past few days.  Has the international community been in any way responsive to the need for additional humanitarian assistance?  Mr. Rauchenstein mentioned the difficulty of getting humanitarian aid to the most needy people because of the difficulty in accessing the areas where they live.  Obviously, there are additional costs when the humanitarian aid has to be delivered by plane or helicopter.  Is Mr. Rauchenstein reasonably confident that the majority of the people who are in great need are getting at least some humanitarian assistance?  From the point of view of the ICRC and other organisations that carry out exceptionally good work in those particular areas, is Mr. Rauchenstein confident that there are enough resources to try to meet in some meaningful way the terrible humanitarian disaster facing so many innocent and downtrodden people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015100700002#D00600","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444208400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Smith for this question.  It is a pertinent question because humanitarian action in South Sudan includes the activities of the ICRC and the programmes of the ICRC are among the most under-funded in the world.  Activities have to be prioritised with the means available and prioritisation means reaching out to the most vulnerable exactly in those areas where it is also the most expensive to intervene.  As the Deputy rightly points out, in some areas of Unity, which is the place where the ICRC team had to be evacuated two days ago, several tens of thousands of people are trapped in remote areas.  They cannot leave for a neighbouring country but have to stay there and they have to be assisted.  It is very difficult and very expensive.  The difficulties are multi-sectoral.  One of the difficulties is the lack of respect of the soldiers or weapon bearers for the humanitarian action.  Additional efforts can be made there by the international community on the ground and by the commanders so that humanitarian actors are more respected because that is the <i>conditio sine qua non<\/i>for a humanitarian intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015100700002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Franz Rauchenstein"},{"type":"speech","time":1444208400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan has a question or two.

I am critical of, as I have been in the past and as others have been, the UN and its ability or willingness to deploy itself in situations such as the one that exists in South Sudan.  To my mind, it looks like an ideal location for the services provided by the UN - peacekeeping, in particular; peace enforcement; humanitarian work; or whatever they want to get involved in.

Much of the effort being made by the international community is on the implementation of this peace agreement.  What is the risk?  The risk is that the humanitarian needs that need to be immediately addressed will be forgotten and that people will die of hunger or illness if this humanitarian access, which is especially challenging in the greater upper Nile, is not addressed.  In that sense, I think, the international community has to do more.  It is done also by certain actors on the ground but more has to be done.  We have always insisted that the UN peace-keeping forces go out of their bases and also deploy in opposition-held areas.  Recently there has been a long-term patrol by the UN taking place in Unity.  That was welcomed in the following weeks.  Another temporary operating base in Unity is planned, which is also something that is welcomed by the ICRC and other humanitarian actors because it might calm down the situation in those very sensitive areas.

Accompaniment presence and a certain pressure are absolutely necessary for this peace agreement to advance because it is not an end in itself.

In that regard, the ICRC has always put much effort into having the Geneva Conventions respected and those children demobilised.

While there are some differences in the character of each of these documents they are collectively referred to as &lsquo;standards&rsquo; for the purposes of today's hearing.<\/p> <p>  Standards are generally voluntary but can be made legally binding when referenced as mandatory by legislation.  Of the 1,500 or so national, European and international standards published annually by NSAI an increasing number are used to support legislation by providing the user with means of demonstrating compliance with legal requirements through using the standard.  This type of reference establishes the standard as a preferred route of compliance without it becoming mandatory.<\/p> <p>  In the absence of any legal reference, standards remain voluntary to be used by businesses as a means of demonstrating state-of-the-art or best practice.<\/p> <p>  NSAI develops standards through its network of consultative committees.  Committee members are drawn from industry, government and societal interest groups to work on matters of common interest.  It is NSAI's role to act as a facilitator for that process.<\/p> <p>  There are currently two related consultative committees dealing with domestic heating and plumbing.  These are the Building Services Consultative Committee, and the Water Supply Standards Consultative Committee.  The Building Services Consultative Committee is dealing with the code of practice for domestic hot water and heating, and the Water Supply Standards Consultative Committee is dealing with a similar code of practice for cold water systems.<\/p> <p>  These committees currently comprise representatives from policy makers-regulators, manufacturers, trade associations, local authorities, academia, insurers, private water suppliers, consultants and installers.  The two committees liaise through nominated members to ensure there is no duplication or overlap between their work and the necessary cross-referencing can take place.<\/p><p>There are normally five stages in the standards development process: identifying the needs and benefits of a standard; defining the scope, i.e. identifying the technical, environmental or safety specifications which need to be set; consultation with a view to achieving a consensus; a process of public inquiry; and finally, the publication of the finished standard.  <\/p><p> As a member of the European and international standards organisations, NSAI can only undertake national standardisation work in the absence of suitable standards being published by those organisations.  Furthermore, in the interests of global and EU trade, NSAI is obliged to adopt such European or international standards as national standards and ensure any existing national publications are compatible with their content.<\/p><p> In all European member states, the regulation of supply of drinking water and the quality of drinking water are matters for the appropriate agencies and bodies charged with those responsibilities.  It is a well recognised fundamental design principle when designing, installing or maintaining water supply systems that potable water installations must be protected from contamination, such as backflow from central heating systems, which is the issue in question today.<\/p><p> Several Irish standards, developed through the European system, give guidance on this issue.  They include IS EN 806, which is concerned with the specifications for installation inside buildings conveying water for human consumption.  That standard, broken into five parts, was developed from 2000 to 2012.  Another standard, IS EN 12828, from 2012, with an annex in 2014, addresses heating systems in buildings and the design of water-based heating systems.  A further standard, IS EN 1717, from 2000, with a national annex published in 2011, deals with protection against pollution of potable water in water installations and the general requirements of devices to prevent pollution by backflow.<\/p><p> Both IS EN 12828 and IS EN 806, on the design of water and central heating systems, implicitly recognise that drinking water supplies can become contaminated by backflow, and the standards specify methods for addressing these risks.  Part 2 of IS EN 806 recognises the existence of national or local regulations and requirements and the need to prevent the contamination of water. <\/p><p> The national annex, NA, to IS EN 1717 - I am sorry for quoting all these numbers, but they are important - provides guidance regarding backflow prevention in Ireland, taking account of the low-pressure ventilated mains water systems.  The guidance notes the practice of having an unrestricted air gap to protect the incoming water supply against backflow, unless otherwise expressly permitted in writing by the appropriate responsible water authority.  In other cases it recommends that a risk assessment be carried out in accordance with the standard.<\/p><p> In 2006 the need for an Irish code of practice for plumbers was identified to complement the existing European standards, with the project beginning in earnest in 2008.  This project was aimed at developing a best practice guide for use by the trade, by drawing together the references to relevant standards with useful explanations in an easily readable form.  The project was supported by key stakeholders including the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, which committed funds to support the necessary work.   A first-draft code of practice was published in 2010 for public comment.  This consultation was met with great interest, resulting in the submission of more than 200 observations to NSAI.  The public inquiry draft in 2010 took account of relevant local authority by-laws available at that time.  Those local authorities, in general, required that water systems contain an adequate device or devices to prevent the occurrence of backflow.  The draft code of practice drew together these requirements as best practice.<\/p><p> Following the 2010 public inquiry and further consideration, it was decided to split the very large draft standard into two parts to enable work to proceed more efficiently.  These two parts are titled SR 50-1, for domestic hot water and heating, and SR 50-3, for domestic plumbing for cold water systems.<\/p><p> Due to the level of interest from the various groups involved, the prioritisation of other critical projects and the availability of key stakeholder input and internal resources, work on the project was put on hold until being reactivated earlier this year.  The most recent review has identified a need for further work to address technical developments, changes in building practices, availability of updated European standards and related matters raised by harmonised standards under the EU construction products regulation.  Irish Water, which was established in the interim, is also now engaged as a key stakeholder.  The projects are progressing well, and it is expected that drafts of both documents will be issued for public inquiry during 2016. <\/p><p> As previously stated, standards are voluntary documents unless referenced as mandatory or as conferring a presumption of compliance through legislation.  When the code of practice documents are published by NSAI, the relevant authorities may choose to reference them in whatever way they consider appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015100700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444230000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to assist in its consideration of issues raised in the petition.  I am the senior technical adviser in the architecture and building standards section of the Department.  I am accompanied by my colleagues Eamonn Smyth, engineering adviser, and Martin Vaughan, assistant principal.<\/p> <p>  The subject before the committee is technical in nature and the Department is happy to outline its understanding of the relevant product standards, technical guidelines and regulatory controls at home and abroad that inform consideration of this matter.  I note that the National Standards Authority of Ireland, from which we have just heard, has also accepted the committee&rsquo;s invitation, and I welcome its participation in the discussion.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that with effect from 1 January 2014, Irish Water assumed statutory responsibility for public water services under the Water Service Acts.  Irish Water is now the designated national authority with responsibility for water services, and the quality and integrity of the water supply in general comes within the remit of Irish Water.  As such, any questions from committee members on this aspect of the matter must be directed to Irish Water.  <\/p> <p>  It might be helpful to summarise the existing and proposed regulatory arrangements relevant to the matters raised in this petition.  The petitioner&rsquo;s issue relates to the installation of a sealed primary heating circuit as part of an indirect vented hot water system.  His concerns focus on the method of filling the sealed circuit with water and the potential for backflow contamination.  The sealed primary heating circuit is the pipework that goes from the boiler to a coil in the hot water cylinder.  While sealed circuits have existed for some time in the industry and are used in many jurisdictions across Europe, they are relatively new in Ireland.  Traditionally, hot water systems in Ireland had vented primary heating circuits, which effectively meant there was a dedicated feed and expansion cistern for the boiler in the attic, in addition to the main cold water storage tank.  For a sealed primary heating circuit, the feed and expansion cistern for the boiler are redundant. The sealed system is fitted with an expansion vessel to accommodate the increased volumes.  In terms of supplying a feed to fill this circuit, a temporary connection is typically made to the mains water supply.<\/p> <p>  British Standards have dealt with these systems for some time.  The current British standard is BS 8558, \"Guide to the design, installation, testing and  maintenance of services supplying water for domestic use within buildings and their curtilages.\"  That is complementary guidance to the European suite, EN 806.  This standard outlines the proper procedures for sealed circuits.  It sets out how the connection to the mains water supply may be made by providing a servicing valve, a temporary connecting pipe and an appropriate backflow prevention device.<\/p> <p>  This arrangement presents some risk to the mains supply, and the petitioner rightly refers to this.  Normally, the pressure in a primary heating circuit is less than that of the mains supply pipe.<\/p><p>However, if a fault occurs in a pressure relief valve in the system for example, the pressure in the circuit could rise above the pressure in the mains.  If the servicing valve is left in the open position and the backflow prevention device fails, there is potential for backflow of the fluid in the heating circuit into the mains supply.  This has the potential to cause contamination of the mains supply.  For the avoidance of such backflow and contamination, the temporary connecting pipe must be completely disconnected from the outlet of the backflow device and the connection with the primary circuit after the completion of filling or periodic replenishing.  BS 8558 also provides guidance on the prevention of stagnation associated with this temporary connection.<\/p><p> The petitioner has also raised the issue of the type of backflow devices suitable for these installations.  The standard for backflow prevention devices is IS EN 1717.  This standard deals with the means to be used to prevent the pollution of potable water inside premises and the general requirements of protection devices to avoid pollution by backflow.<\/p><p> The national annex to EN 1717 recommends carrying out a risk assessment if using backflow prevention valves to ensure fitness for purpose.  It also advises that permission should be sought from the water services authority.  Any backflow protection device should be fit for purpose, manufactured in accordance with the relevant product standards and installed by an experienced plumber or technician.  The Registered Gas Installers of Ireland, RGII, includes the above guidance regarding the temporary connection to sealed heating circuits in its installation guides for gas heating systems.  The oil fired heating systems associations, such as OFTEC, provide comparable guidance, and boiler manufacturers highlight this issue and provide explicit installation rules in their manuals.<\/p><p> The relevant legislation dealing with this aspect of water supply is the Water Services Act 2007.  Section 54 provides that the owner of a premises shall ensure the internal distribution system of a premises is sufficient to ensure, and maintained in such condition as to ensure, water intended for human consumption meets prescribed quality requirements at the tap or taps used for such purposes.  Irish Water has powers to issue notices to direct the owner of a premises to undertake remedial action where there is an issue with the quality of the water.<\/p><p> The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, has been developing an Irish code of practice for building services - domestic plumbing and heating.  As Mr. Buckley explained, this has been put out for public consultation and is being reviewed.  The NSAI committees will review and finalise the proposed code of practice for heating systems, hot water systems, cold water systems and, importantly, their interlinkages in the context of the suite of European standards known as EN 806.  This will provide Ireland for the first time with a national standard for plumbing and heating.  The Department is very supportive of this work by NSAI.  The outcome of the work on the code of practice will inform the Department&rsquo;s consideration of any further policy or regulatory proposals that may be necessary in this area.<\/p><p> That completes my overview of the existing and proposed regulatory arrangements relevant to the committee&rsquo;s consideration of this petition.  My colleagues and I look forward to participating further in the discussion or answering any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015100700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444230000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, I have to leave at 5 p.m. to deal with amendments to legislation in another committee and one of my colleagues will take over.

In more recent years, I have seen windmills and heat pumps used.  Does the type of system used for central heating matter?  Most of the central heating systems heat water in the pipes.  I have heard there is more and more emphasis on insulating houses so that we now have warmer houses than we did 20 or 30 years ago.  No matter what system is used, it needs some way to trigger heating the water in the pipes.  In recent years, I have seen solar panels being used.

The risk of contamination we are speaking about is various chemicals and there is no guarantee that boiling the water would alleviate this problem were it to exist.  To take the broader point on the huge range of heating systems, much technology is involved in every aspect of a modern house and, as the Deputy rightly said, insulation has changed.  In the world of standards, we are working very hard at European level and being part of the big European system gives Ireland an advantage with regard to keeping up with all of the changing technologies and having proper standards reflecting the various products and how they are applied.  Approximately 600 or 700 standards are related to the construction products regulation alone, never mind the application of these.  It is tricky to keep these up to date all of the time.  We can do this as members of the EU.<\/p> <p>  The standards are available.  Many of them are adopted and referenced in the building regulations, which makes them legally binding, to answer the earlier question.  If a deficiency is found, it can be addressed immediately.  Even if standards are not directly referenced in the building regulations, they are an indication of best practice.  If a purchaser has a dispute with a developer and the situation is unclear, the courts in Ireland, as elsewhere, will reference the standards as an indication of best practice.  If an installer works in a different way, the onus is very much on him or her to prove the system is safe.  The standards are very valuable in this respect.<\/p> <p>  Even with the increasing sophistication and variations of systems, one must also look at the skills set and training of the people doing the insulation.  This is why bit by bit all of the traditional trades are coming more and more under a structure.  For a number of years, we have had very precise control systems for gas and electricity through the Register of Gas Installers of Ireland and other bodies.  This is very accurately regulated and works well.  We are not yet at this point for other trades, such as plumbing, which is where the standard reference, which began in 2010, comes into its own.  It is the first attempt to pull together all of this technology to have a guidance base for the plumbing profession and apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>  It is great to have the support of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and SEAI, and we work very closely on this.  The industry itself must also come along and must see the need to do this.  Plumbing is a traditional trade, perhaps passed on from father to son.  Society, in general, is trying to balance the need for a greater level of sophistication and controls with keeping the existing infrastructure in place and finding the right timing for this.  These are all complex interrelated matters and any number of technical risks are involved.  We do a lot of work on radon control, for example, which is an issue, insulation systems, as the Deputy mentioned, and water quality, where we have the issues raised in the petition.  There are also concerns about legionnaires' disease and other impurities that can happen in the water system.  All of these are covered by various aspects, and the task at hand is to get a balance between all of these.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015100700002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1444230000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>The idea of zonal heating is something I have heard about only recently, but I am sure it has been around for ages.

Qual-PEX is a flexible pipe made of plastic.  Previously all domestic pipes were of copper.  Copper is dearer and not as pliable and is in short supply worldwide.

Lead is still a standard because nobody has decided to remove lead from thousands of houses in this city.<\/p> <p>  There was reference to Irish Water having the right to instruct householders to fix problems in their houses relating to the water system.

So the question of retrofit does not apply here because the standards exist.<\/p> <p>  It is possible to say what best practice is, and nobody would disagree on what it is.  The problem is where best practice has not been followed.  So retrofit is appropriate in individual developments where it is found that the workmanship was not up to scratch.<\/p><p>We are faced with all of these horrendous issues at the moment - for example, whether developers are still available in order to challenge and chase them for unsafe workmanship?

To date, we have no reports on the instance of failures of double-check or single-check valves.  I will put the statistics to one side and say that all mechanical devices or fittings are liable to fail at any time.  In this situation the double-check valve has the job of preventing  backflow.  The real reduction in risk comes from completely disconnecting the temporary pipe.  It is a safety mechanism that works by only filling the system at the beginning and  replenishes for one reason or another.  It is the primary defence mechanism.  One does not leave the pipe permanently connected to the mains.<\/p> <p>   In terms of standards and retrospective application, I wish to state that regulations do not apply retrospectively and, therefore, it would not be a matter for a retrofit to this standard.  Concerned homeowners may apply best practice in this situation.  As Mr. Buckley has outlined, best practice is available in many sources.  It is very explicit, gives good advice on what to do and is reasonably inexpensive and simple for people to carry out, where necessary.  In terms of the future, once the SR 50 is finalised and published then the Department, comprised of the various sections which range between water services and building regulations and Irish Water, will consider the policies and legislative requirements in this area in order to implement SR 50.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a final general point about home building.  The building regulations cover a large part of the home building functional requirements.  The building control legislation that came into force recently has created a very controlled system whereby the design is signed off by a competent person.  The building process is also inspected on a regular basis by an assigned certifier that is competent in the area.  At the end of the process the builder and the assigned certifier sign off, thus certifying that the project complies with the building regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015100700002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary"},{"type":"speech","time":1444230000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>One of the problems that we have identified, and it is an issue that has been accepted by Ms Neary, is that this can become a problem unless somebody has an understanding that it is a problem or unless somebody inspects it.

I would know if there was a problem and would presume that I could solve it by switching off the water but beyond that my first port of call would be to telephone a plumber.  We all agree that trades that work in this sector need regulation.  One must have faith in the inspection team and one presumes  that a qualified plumber will be able to fix the problem.  Unfortunately, many homes in Ireland were built during a period when there was lax adherence to established standards and that is what happened with Priory Hall, Longboat Quay and other buildings.<\/p> <p>  There is no inspection regime or audit in place.  This week I asked the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste to conduct an audit to identify the problems.  The State may not have the wherewithal to fix the buildings but at least the owner or tenant would have some idea where a problem stems from and thus take remedial action.  People will take a chance and will survive even though they know there may be a problem.  I urge anybody who is aware of problems with their water systems to immediately get them checked out.  I have seen black water come out of radiators in my house.  I do not know what type of stomach aches or whatever would result if that got into a public water system but I am sure it would not be good.<\/p> <p>  Stagnant water in immersions is another problem that was raised by the petitioner.

We have learned that regulation needs to be put in place as soon as possible.  I have put a lot of work on the witnesses and they have competing demands.

Given our experience in the past few years with the building boom where there was widespread disregard of the regulatory requirements, we have moved to put in place a better building control framework.  That involves oversight of the construction project by professionals.  Registered construction professionals must draw up inspection plans, execute them with others and certify the building when it is complete.  We are also investing in oversight by local authorities to support that system.  The points that Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and the Acting Chairman made about the lack of oversight previously are well made.

He suggested that with the dead-leg part, about which we talked earlier, in the hot tank, it could potentially be more than 300,000 houses.  I do not know because, as I said, I am not an expect.  I would have presumed that if somebody flagged a potential issue - the argument is the same with others - somebody needs to do an audit by checking a number of the estates the petitioner has spoken about in his letters to the committee to see whether it is an issue and then one would have some idea.  The petitioner made the point that there is a number of estates in an area in Meath that had the problems identified by him.  I presume that is where he works or worked, and that he came across shoddy workmanship.  That is often the way one identifies the likes of a fire hazard or, in this case, a potential health hazard.  If that is the case, then somebody needs to conduct an audit of those houses and also flag to other plumbers that if they identify this problem when doing work on heating systems throughout the country, they should fix it but refer it to the authorities so that we can audit the rest of the estates concerned.  If a plumber walks into a house in an estate in County Kildare and identifies that nobody has been near the heating system since it was built but there is a problem, that person should inform somebody that there may be a problem in the estate, especially if, potentially, it is of a public health nature.  <\/p> <p>  As I said in regard to other matters, some of it would involve an audit and some of it would involve inspections.  Since the inspections we are talking about are for future builds, somebody somewhere has to look at the existing houses otherwise one will end up with what we have in Dublin with the lead pipes that I mentioned.  The house that I moved out of had lead pipes which had swollen to three times the size.  That was the nature of all of the Dublin City Council houses.  I do not know whether it was a major health hazard but, as far as I know, lead in water is a health hazard.  Maybe drinking that water is why I am a bit mad.  It is something that Irish Water has identified in its documentation to date.

I am referring to the guidance included as the appendix to the briefing material circulated on Monday last.

I can confirm that my Department welcomes the guidelines.  With my colleagues, I have had an opportunity to consider the guidelines of which we are aware, the so-called New Zealand guidelines.  They are welcome in terms of having a baseline for setting output based performance targets.  I know it is the committee's view that should be so.  My officials and I, as Minister, are committed to working with both Oireachtas support staff and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to strengthen the performance indicators that are currently in use.  That can only be a good thing.  We agree that outputs, in general, should cover all significant services and proposed expenditure, that outputs should relate to the goods and services provided to third parties for which the entity is accountable, that clear specific targets should be set and that output performance measures should not relate to internal processes and events.  Obviously, we all need to understand the distinction that requires to be drawn between internal processes and events on the one hand and actual outputs on the other.  Finally, performance measures and targets should be supported by current and historical levels of performance where that is possible and where they are available.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding those general remarks, we have some concerns that moving to a system of performance outputs that focuses on goods and services provided to third parties would not be appropriate in every instance.  It can be challenging to identify appropriate and timely measurement indicators for policy areas.  My Department is largely a policy Department and we have a very broad remit across the communications, broadcasting, energy and natural resource sectors.  That being the case a variety of different metrics is called for.  For example, and we can discuss this if we have an opportunity, perhaps the most striking example, but not the only one, is the national broadband plan.  The broadband plan takes several years to put together and the metrics for the design stages of a project can be very different from appropriate measures to be applied when the project is at full roll-out stage.  There is the developmental phase, planning and so on.  The type of measurements that are appropriate to apply to what we are doing at the moment are somewhat different from the measurements that it would be necessary to apply when the job is done, that is, do people have high quality broadband and is it working.  <\/p> <p>  My Department has commenced a review of performance indicators.  We are committed to bringing forward proposals for discussion with the Oireachtas, the committee and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in regard to the performance measures that it would be appropriate to include in the 2016 Estimates.  Those are my general comments on the outputs and the performance targets approach the committee wishes to take and I support the committee in that regard.<\/p><p>No reallocation of funds has taken place to date within the Vote in 2015, but we are considering reallocations in one or two areas.

My understanding of the New Zealand standards, and thankfully there are now standards, is that each Department is now measured and we are measured as a Parliament on how we scrutinise Departments as to how they spend their money.  I never cease to be amazed by how language is used, and the European Union is probably a past master at this, to describe basic matters such as there is now a system in place to see how well a Department is doing with taxpayers' money or with policies they are trying to drive on behalf of the public.  In every Department, but particularly in the technological side of this Department, it is important to state the facts in plain English rather than in the gobbledygook that comes from some Departments.  I am aware there is a huge volume of work going on in Departments to produce and achieve policy and performance related initiatives, but they must state simply how well they are doing with public money for the public good.

One thing I find frustrating since becoming a Member of the House is the difficulty in measuring personal and occupational progress against targets.  It is difficult to assess whether I as a Deputy and committee member am performing well or badly and it is difficult to know what measurement criteria I should be using to make that evaluation.  It must also be difficult for a Department to state the criteria and targets against which it measures its performance and for it to examine how close or far it is from meeting those.<\/p> <p>  Typically, there are both qualitative and quantitative criteria.  I have noticed that in terms of looking at budgets and expenditure to date, we are good at counting what is easy to count.  However, that tells us very little about how good the public service being provided by the Department is, what plans are in place to improve services and how well or badly we are doing in achieving those.  I am not being critical because I understand it is not an easy process.  In a previous existence, I was haunted by performance indicator measurement and monitoring.  Frankly, I found it a pain in the neck when we started using the measurement system, but as we became accustomed to using performance measurements, they became second nature to us and it was good for me to measure whether I was meeting the outputs set for the projects I was working on.<\/p> <p>  The key issue is whether we can come up with a measurement system, and we have the New Zealand model.  This may need to be tweaked for the Irish context, but there is no question that we need such a system.  I knew but had forgotten that a recent OECD report stated this State's Parliament is 54th out of 60 in a study of parliaments in terms of scrutiny of departmental budgets.  We can all hide behind imprecision and it can be quite fun to have philosophical discussion as to what is happening in a Department.  However, as committee members we are not delivering a good public service unless we can measure whether Departments are delivering on the promises they made.<\/p> <p>  I am glad to hear from the Minister that his Department has accepted that some sort of monitoring is required.  It may well be that further work needs to be done on establishing the criteria for that.  The committee should have some input into the process of deciding what performance measurement will be used.  We also need to consider how we can establish the qualitative rather than quantitative performance of the Department.  Again, I would like the committee to be involved in that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#F00800","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>The Minister said he agrees with the principles but that the issue needs to be teased out.

What the Deputy said is extremely thoughtful.  He is right.  Sometimes it is frustrating for all of us, whether as a Minister or public representative, to try to measure the effectiveness of what we are doing.  We could start work at 6.30 a.m. and work right throughout the day and then ask ourselves how we can measure what we did.  I believe that is what this committee is trying to do in a helpful way.  It is asking whether we can apply some metrics to this process in order that we can have a sense of what has been achieved and in order that it can question me on whether we are satisfying those measures.  That is the question we need to answer.<\/p> <p>  Broadly speaking and just looking at my Department, examples of measurable outputs would be, for example, things such as energy efficiency in homes.<\/p><p>That is objectively measurable to some extent at least.  Similarly, the Department has an objective whereby fossil fuels will be replaced over years or decades with renewable energy.  The question as to whether the Department is achieving this goal is measurable, admittedly over a period of years rather than on a day-to-day basis.  I mentioned broadband and stated the Government will ensure that broadband reaches every home and business in the State by 2020, with 85% reached by 2018, through a mixture of public and private sector investment.  It will not be possible to measure this aim until 2018 to ascertain whether the 85% target was reached and until 2020 to find out whether all areas were covered but it is possible to measure the credibility of what is being done at present to reach those objectives and that can be tested.  As for broadcasting, I do not know.  That perhaps is a quite difficult area in respect of outputs.  One might suggest outputs of hours on air but that is hardly a satisfactory measurement of outputs.  It is certainly not a measurement of quality and is not sufficient.  One might suggest measuring indigenous programming, that is, programming produced in Ireland and that might be a good measurement of the success of the broadcasting policy.  I believe more could be done to enhance the kind of measurement the committee is seeking and I will support the committee in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#F01000","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I presume the Minister's officials will engage with this committee on a continuous basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#G00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#G00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Is there an office, person or people within the Department specifically considering what kind of performance monitoring is required?

In discussions the Minister may have had with the Department in the knowledge the new guidelines were to be discussed, did he meet with some resistance within the Department?  While I accept the Minister's commitment to it, that may not be so forthcoming from certain parts of the Department and I seek to ascertain whether there was resistance in this regard.  Second, I accept the point that some Departments lend themselves well to this type of measurement involving inputs, outputs, impacts and so on.  The Minister noted that the communications portfolio, for example, is very much a policy-driven Department.  However, there are subheads or areas within the departmental Estimate that lend themselves well to inputs, outputs and impacts.  I suggest, one of these is under subhead A3, which deals with the national broadband scheme, MANS networks, schools networks and postcodes.  These are programme-driven or project-driven initiatives within the Department.  The real issue members of the committee have is when they consider the items covered in this review, they look at figures adding up to thousands - under this subhead adding up to just short of &euro;18 million - in a single snapshot that effectively tells them nothing.  The figures tell members what is being spent in a six-month period in the first half of the year, what is the projection for the remainder of the year and that is it.  Were the Department serious or were it attempting to consider how the guidelines could have been displayed to the committee, even today, I suggest it would have been possible to have that type of output measurement in a basic sense on subhead A3, which lends itself well to the new guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#G00700","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>We will take a few more questions before allowing the Minister respond to them.

I am basing my questions on a comprehensive document provided to members on outputs that specifically is to do with broadband and will cite that document because the Minister may be able to clarify a number of issues.  For example, what is the estimated total cost this year of delivering on the fifth measure, which is to deliver on an implementation strategy for the public consultation and proceed to procurement phase, which is the final phase?  Are there other significant and distinct outputs or activities whose costs are to be met from subhead 3?  Under that subhead, the mapping, State aids and procurement stage, leading to State-led investment, was to conclude last year.  In addition, as can be seen from the output targets included in the Estimates for 2013, 2014 and 2015, departmental activity on national broadband service strategy development and implementation has been ongoing for a number of years, is complex and is not calendar-related.<\/p> <p>  In spite of the Minister's remarks in his opening statement to the effect that the system would be delivered by 2020 and that much of it will be in place by 2018, I can remember one of his predecessors in a Fianna F&aacute;il Administration saying much the same thing approximately ten years ago but we still are at the stage we have reached.  Admittedly, there have been considerable improvements since then but sometimes I am a little sceptical about targets that have been put in place without having anything to back up the suggestion they will happen.  The manner in which the questions have been put here suggests there is a need to get clarity on precisely what the Department is doing with the money under the Estimates that have been provided thus far.  The document to hand then makes an important point that in the context of the relevance of measures in this area to annual scrutiny of Estimates and associated performance targets, it is significant that such activity is unlikely to begin to provide an impact in terms of service availability, that is for customers and the public, until well into 2015 at the earliest, and for a period of three to five years thereafter, which is more or less what Deputy Fleming has been saying here.<\/p><p>Those of us who live in rural Ireland do not want the service in three or five years; we want it now.  I must say, however, that I am particularly encouraged by Eircom which has been laying cables just outside my home town of Drumshanbo for the last few weeks.  My understanding is that speeds will increase from the current miserly rate of 7 Mbps to 100 Mbps, which is the rate already enjoyed in Carrick-on-Shannon, Manorhamilton and other towns in Leitrim.  It is counties such as Leitrim that I am concerned about in terms of the performance outputs.  We are being constantly told that it does not really matter where one is located anymore because once one has the technology, one can start up, maintain and improve a business.  <\/p><p> I ask these questions because the information provided to the committee gives no indication as to annual cost of policy development and implementation in this area.  This is important in order to determine whether the activity contributes to meeting guidance No. 2 on maintenance of broadband services.  Finally, the performance information returned by the Department appears to suggest that there has been some drift in terms of achieving targets included in the Estimate.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.  Although it is not clear that there has been drift, the materiality is uncertain.  Equally significant is the fact that the possible drift has only come to our attention as a result of information sought from and provided by the Department in the context of this mid-year review of performance by this committee.  In the case of the 2013 targets, this is at least 18 months after the event.  There are serious questions to be raised about the broadband policy according to the information provided here as to the outputs, performance levels and the actual impact that it is having and will have from now on.  It has not been having much of an impact up to now, I would suggest and there is a need for the Department to up its game.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#G01700","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Deputy Harrington asked whether I found any resistance to this process of scrutinising outputs and applying a measurement of outputs to the work of the Department.  I assure the Deputy that I have encountered no resistance at all.  In fact, on the contrary, I have found that for the officials I work with in the Department, who are very professional people, it actually enhances their own sense of satisfaction and progress on the various areas of work with which they are involved that they would be part of a better regime of outputs scrutiny.  I have found, without exception, that the officials in my Department who are working so hard on issues like broadband, for example, welcome the idea of closer scrutiny and debate, having regard to the measurability of some of the work in which they are involved.  Some of the work with which we are involved is not measurable on a day-to-day basis but is measurable in a broader context, as we have been discussing.  To the extent that we can improve the way we measure these things, that will not just improve and enhance the work of this committee but also of my Department and officials therein.<\/p> <p>  On the figures in head A3, the Deputy asked whether the figures given in the Estimates are, themselves, detailed enough.  My view is that the more detail we can give to the Oireachtas and the public, the better.  These are the Estimates in the form in which they are prepared, in terms of areas like post code, schools broadband, MANs phase one and two and so forth.  These are the amounts that are set out in the Estimates.  If there are questions about how they are broken down and so on, we can deal with those issues in terms of the adequacy of the numbers themselves but on the general question of outputs, this constitutes very significant progress in terms of public policy.  We very much support the approach being taken by the committee.

I am concerned by a number of issues, one of which is broadband, which was already referred to by Deputy Fleming and Senator Mooney.  Where are we at with the broadband project?  I note that &euro;275 million was allocated on the capital side but the Minister's predecessor said that it would cost somewhere in the region of &euro;500 million to do a decent job of connecting everybody to the broadband network by 2018 or 2020.  I have raised with the Minister on the floor of the D&aacute;il the enormous level of concern and frustration with the patchiness of the network.  Nobody seems to be in charge of this and ComReg does not seem to be taking a hands-on approach.  A new mast which was erected recently in Meelin in north Cork to improve broadband services is now interfering with the already patchy broadband services in the area.  This is causing enormous frustration.  Young people are now making decisions about whether to continue living in rural Ireland because of poor broadband coverage, not to mention the issues around planning which seem to have taken on a life of their own.<\/p><p>Anything that can be done to stop people living in rural Ireland is being done but that is a different debate.<\/p><p> What stage is the broadband programme at now?  We were expecting something back from the European Commission in mid-2015 in respect of the state aids programme.  What has happened to that?  What stage are the tendering documents at?  How advanced is the process for State intervention to ensure that 30% of the people in this country have an adequate broadband service?  On Deputy Fleming&rsquo;s point about returning emigrants, people have been used to living with these facilities.  It is almost like people returning in the 1970s, deciding to do so based on whether they would have running water.  That is how serious it is.<\/p><p> It now transpires that &euro;38 million was spent on Eircode rather than &euro;27 million.  Officials from the Department and Eircode and everybody else had confirmed to the committee that it would be &euro;27 million.  Where and how was that allowed to go out of kilter?<\/p><p> There is huge scope and huge challenges in the broadcasting sector.  Various lobby groups from local radio stations have come in looking for their slice of the licensing fee cake.  Is the Minister satisfied that the taxpayer is getting value for money from the licence fee being handed to RTE and for the &euro;58 million which is given through the Department of Social Protection for the free licence for the elderly on top of what is being collected from householders?  The local radio stations really serve their communities in urban and rural Ireland where the national broadcaster has not served anywhere beyond the M50 for several generations.  <\/p><p> I commend the Department's work on the Green Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland.  This committee has discussed the raw material for gas and so forth.  Its cost has dropped in the world market but that is not reflected directly in the price.  Does the Minister think the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, is properly resourced by legislation to adequately address the issues in the energy market?  I believe it is not and a major legislative change is needed.  The Minister mentioned some transfer of funds from one subhead to another for the warmer homes scheme.  It has been very beneficial but a massive amount of work needs to be done on the scheme.  There are certain socio-economic groups which suffer from fuel poverty.  There needs to be a massive concerted effort.  Some local authorities ran pilot schemes with the warmer home scheme for their housing stock but that was on a small scale.  A massive amount of energy and money is being lost.  I encourage the Minister to ensure that the warmer homes scheme is even more adequately funded.<\/p><p> What is the Minister&rsquo;s opinion of solar panel farms such as those used on the Continent?  What kind of money is the Department spending to support research into them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#H00900","speaker":"987","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I would like the Minister to give a definitive response to the representations being made by the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland that there be a fund set up similar to that of sound and vision and that the money be taken from an increased efficiency index from An Post.

The Department must raise serious questions about the manner and alleged efficiency of An Post in collecting this.  It is poor value for the &euro;13 million the Department pays it.

It is not the entire cost that we foresee.  I will not put a specific cost on the plan because we are about to enter into a procurement process involving bidders to ensure we get the best possible deal for the Irish public in respect of the roll-out of high speed broadband.  I can confirm to Deputy Moynihan and the committee that this figure of &euro;275 million set aside in the capital plan will be used for the national broadband plan and that we will see what the bids are when the procurement process opens, which I expect to happen on schedule at the end of this year.  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question as to where we are at in respect of the plan, we have made enormous strides, particularly this year and are absolutely on schedule to go to procurement at the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  It required a huge input.  I can go through the specifics of what we have been doing this year.  The question the Deputy asked me, which he also asked me in the House, was not an unreasonable one.  We have been in detailed discussion with the European Commission and are driving on with all the work we are doing with the private sector, which has contributed enormously to the roll-out of broadband.  There is a great deal happening.<\/p> <p>  It was mentioned that it is patchy in some areas and some people asked is there another way of doing it.  This is relevant to the broader question of measurement of outputs.  I am absolutely convinced that we should do this once and do it right.  Nobody will thank me, wherever I am in five years&rsquo; time, this committee, the Department or anybody else, if we engage in a piecemeal approach to the national broadband plan to achieve what Senator Mooney mentioned earlier and to ensure that every home and business in the State has access to high speed broadband.  On our calculation, something of the order of 30%, perhaps somewhat less, will have to be dealt with through State intervention because the commercial operators will not make a profit in these areas.  It is remarkable that the 30%, or of that order, does constitute something of the order of 96% of the territory of the State.  Practically every farm in the State is in the amber area, I doubt there is a farm in the blue area, and broadband will be of great benefit to farming.  If one was thinking about this as a road building programme, it is equivalent to 100,000 km.  That is a State intervention, which is on a par with the electrification initiative of a previous generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#J00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>It was done in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#J00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>It was not done the way we are doing it, with respect to my colleagues in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>Different approaches are taken and we have stated we want a minimum speed of 30 megabits per second, Mbps.  I want this to be understood because some people believe the speed will be up to 30 Mbps, which not the case.  What we expect to be delivered under the national broadband plan by the successful bidder or bidders is a minimum of 30 Mbps and it needs to be future-proofed.<\/p><p> Under the rules, we cannot select a technology.  Colleagues who are familiar with the issue, of whom there are many, will know that if this is to be done right, the technology must be able to take high-speed broadband into homes and businesses.  We are engaged in achieving this.  It is important to note that we have been working closely with the European Commission on this issue throughout the year and members can go through a schedule of the specific steps we have taken.  I assure the joint committee that the approach we are taking is focused on doing this once and doing it right, rather than in bits and pieces.  To give an example of a step we have taken this year, we addressed the new state aid guidelines which were finalised by the Commission after the national broadband plan was published. <\/p><p> Global demand for data is increasing dramatically throughout the world, including here, and we have increased our ambition in response to this demand.  Members will have noted the introduction of a Vodafone-ESB joint venture, SIRO.  My predecessor in the Department, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, introduced legislation to provide for this development and SIRO is now driving competition.  In addition, investment by industry has increased significantly, partly driven by the State.  The State has an intervention role and the Department is ensuring the private sector is pushing ahead.  Competition in the sector is working. <\/p><p> Members referred to a number of forms of technology.  While we are prevented from selecting a technology, to do this right it is likely that fibre will be a key part of the network build.  It will also be a wholesale network and the minimum requirement, as I stated, is 30 Mbps. <\/p><p> We want the plan to be future-proofed.  To return to the measurement of outputs, it will only ever be possible to measure the real output on the national broadband plan when somebody else is sitting in my seat.  That is the difficulty.  As a politician, I would like to be able to state that last week the State served X number of new premises and so forth.  However, the private sector, working with the State, has significantly increased what is has done and it is being driven by the Government.  For example, the number of homes and premises with access to high-speed broadband has increased from 300,000 in 2010 to 1.3 million currently.  The commercial sector will increase this figure to 1.9 million by 2020.  I accept that these figures are of no benefit to those who do not have access to high-speed broadband.  If, however, the joint committee wants to measure outputs, it should note the substantial increase in the number of homes and premises served by high-speed broadband.  The Department will ensure the current figure of 1.3 million continues to increase. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#J00500","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Has the European Commission approved state aid for the national broadband strategy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#K00200","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":195,"content":"<p>No, the procurement process will hopefully commence at the end of this year and the Commission's decision on final approval will be made in parallel with that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#K00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":196,"content":"<p>My understanding was that Commission approval would be given in mid-2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#K00400","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Pre-notification must be first provided, after which final approval will be given.  As I stated, however, I want to proceed to procurement and I do not have to wait for final Commission approval before doing so.  Both processes will be done in parallel to save time.  The idea of delaying the procurement process until Commission approval is given is not attractive to me as I want to drive on with both processes.<\/p> <p>  On the Eircode project, I have no doubt the report produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General will be dealt with in due course by the relevant committee and the Accounting Officer in my Department.  It is worth commenting, however, on the headline figures of &euro;38 million, which was given by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and &euro;27 million, which I gave as the estimated cost of the project.  During the implementation phase, the cost of the contract was put at &euro;27 million, with &euro;16 million in the first two-year initial roll-out period.  The bulk of this figure - &euro;9.4 million - was spent on encoding public sector bodies' databases, with &euro;1.2 million per annum provided for the remaining years of the contract.  The difference between the figure of &euro;27 million and the figure of &euro;38 million relates to the inclusion of VAT, consultancy costs and internal staffing costs in the latter figure.  This means the cost of the staff who were involved in the project have also been wound into the &euro;38 million figure.  I would not describe staff costs as a notional cost as we have to pay the salaries and wages of staff in the Department but they are among the additional items that make up the gap between the &euro;27 million cost of the contract and the &euro;38 million figure provided by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That explains the difference between the two figures. <\/p> <p>  On the licence fee, we all have our views on value for money for the licence fee.  To return to the measurement of outputs and the need to be objective about these issues, we have an objective system for examining value for money in public service broadcasting, namely, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland five-year reviews.  On foot of the most recent five-year review, NewEra was asked to carry out a assessment of RTE and members will have seen the report NewEra produced.  On any objective reading of the report, RTE emerges well compared with other public service broadcasters in Europe, and in its own right.  There is no doubt that there has been a substantial cost reduction programme in RTE, with several hundred staff positions removed from the organisation during the retrenchment period.  Colleagues may wish to consider the NewEra report when assessing whether RTE provides value for money.  If I were asked directly my view, I would respond that RTE provides value for money, although there is always room for improvement in public service broadcasting.  We should continue to fund public service broadcasting, as every Government since the 1920s has done because they have recognised the value and importance of public service broadcasting. <\/p> <p>  I agree with the comments made on the unacceptable level of television licence fee evasion.  I will shortly make proposals to government to address the issue of compliance regarding the television licence fee.  I accept Senator Mooney's point on the efficiency of the existing collection system.  We can do some work on the database that is used by An Post and I have some proposals to make in that regard.

In the current period, the most important step we can take is to freshen up the database used by An Post and make it more robust.<\/p> <p>  On the commercial broadcasting sector, I dealt with this matter in recent days in discussion with Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, who is present.  We have a sound and vision scheme, which is allocated 7% of the income generated from the television licence.  The commercial sector is meeting a real need, especially in rural areas but elsewhere also.  However, we have never before contemplated - I respect the fact that some members are proposing do so now and I do not want to paraphrase them - the redistribution, as it were, of the licence fee across the board to the commercial sector as well as the public sector.  To do so would, at a minimum, be problematic for the following reason, unless someone has a better or different suggestion.<\/p><p>It would require the assessment of individual programmes and strands of programmes across the board in the commercial sector and, presumably, in the public sector ultimately also to determine whether this or that programme was a public service programme and, if it was, whether it should get some of the licence fee.  As I said in the D&aacute;il the other day and have said elsewhere, there are some programmes that are capable of being categorised on both sides of the ledger.  Sports programming performs a public service but also attracts great commercial interest and value for the broadcaster.  Senator Mooney and I soldiered in the speech programme sector many years ago and the Senator still does.  A speech programme is not necessarily a public service programme in every case, but who is to say?  If the listener is being entertained by it, is it not performing a public service?  The definitional issue is problematic.  That is all I am saying.  Ultimately, it has been the policy of Governments of all persuasions and all colours going right back that the licence fee was largely dedicated to ensuring there was a robust public service broadcaster, in this case RTE and TG4.  If one starts to look at redistributing those supports out of the public service and into the commercial sector on the basis of some kind of definitional approach to programmes or programme strands, one is going to give oneself a huge job of work.  I accept that the fact that it is a job of work is not a good enough reason not to do it, but it seems to me that it would be extremely difficult and raise even more problems than it might solve.  That said, commercial local radio performs a huge job for the listeners and communities across the country and I am prepared, as I have said we should be prepared to do, to look at ways to enhance the financial supports, or financial environment I should say, that those stations operate in, in particular the smaller, more vulnerable ones outside the main cities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#K00700","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>One way it could be done immediately would be by removing the levy and having it absorbed by the licence fee.  In the case of Ocean FM with whom, too declare an interest, I do my programme, it costs &euro;30,000 per year, a sum which would create employment.  Not only that, the Minister knows as I do that the most labour intensive aspect of broadcasting is news, current affairs and sport.  Therefore, Sound &amp;amp; Vision, which started off as a great concept, is now helping the independent production sector and RTE, but is not helping the local radio sector.

I never suggested a redistribution of the television licence.  There is a massive anomaly in public service broadcasting funding.   I do not distinguish between RTE and the rest.  If they are licenced and carrying out a function, they are public service broadcasters.  They provide a service.  The GNLR figures prove that.  I understand that the Minister is saying that going back to the days of 2RN in the GPO, the Government always had a commitment to the public service broadcaster as defined in the legislation, but that has changed since previous Governments introduced the concept of independent broadcasting.  We are way behind the curve in terms of funding.  I would have no difficulty with the television licence being ring-fenced for the current use if there was a level playing field, which there is not.  It is not level because of advertising and things are stacked against the commercial side.  RTE is very aggressively looking for advertising in the market, which it has to do as it has to wash its own face.  However, it is competing with people who do not have the &euro;180 million cushion the Oireachtas votes to RTE by way of the television licence.  That is grossly unfair.<\/p> <p>  We have had the RTE authorities in here and they evaded answering the following question.  As the shareholder of the company and given his responsibility for a suite of semi-State companies from energy to broadcasting, does the Minister believe it is appropriate for a semi-State company funded on a compulsory basis by all of the citizens who are obliged to purchase television licences that there are still people working for RTE whose salaries will not be disclosed by the public service broadcaster?  If it happened in any other element of public administration - the Minister mentioned NewERA - can people imagine the outcry?  There would be wall-to-wall coverage from \"Morning Ireland\" to \"Good night, Ireland\" on RTE.  If the salary of the CEO of Irish Water was not disclosed, there would be consternation, and rightly so.  However, we have this protected species operating out of a &euro;183 million cushion who refuse to give the level of accountability that is expected of me, the Minister and everybody else in the public sector.  People in the commercial radio world and community radio world, not to mention the private sector television companies, are finding it hard to swallow that RTE will only release their salaries three years after contracts have been signed.  If the Minister was to appoint a new CEO of a semi-State company tomorrow and told the D&aacute;il in response to a question from an Opposition Member that he was not going to release that person's salary for three years, he would be walking across the bridge to the Taoiseach's office with a letter in his hand and it would not be tolerated.  I have a simple question.  Why is the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources tolerating that from our public service broadcaster which is funded to that tune by the taxpayer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#L01300","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":213,"content":"<p>There are no plans to change or remove the collection role in respect of the television licence from An Post.

Of course, I already knew the answer to the question before I asked it.  All of the plans relating to the roll-out of national broadband - my PQ referred, in particular, to the roll-out in more rural areas - are predicated on the economy doing well.  People in rural areas are concerned that, once again, the towns and cities will be considered.  However, if China, the US, the EU or some other large nation or bloc hiccups economically, lo and behold, the funding will no longer exist to bring state-of-the-art broadband to the more rural areas.  I have argued all along that rural areas should receive broadband side by side with the cities and towns.  Distrust exists and people are worried that the planned roll-out is predicated on economic performance.<\/p> <p>  We need joined-up thinking when it comes to energy.  The SEAI provides grants in respect of the installation of energy boilers, radiators, etc., but a person can get all of that work done in a house where the doors are hanging off the hinges and the windows are broken.  People often cannot get their doors and windows replaced.  We should do an awful more to improve energy efficiency, particularly for people who cannot afford such measures.  We must examine the true cost of every energy development project for the customer -  the person who will use the energy - and for taxpayers as well.  There is so much energy that everything must be proofed against affordability for the customer in terms of energy.<\/p> <p>  In the context of natural resources, I am sure that the Minister is aware of the many concerns about the EPA's study on hydraulic fracturing.  I am sure he is also aware of the concerns many of us harbour with regard to continuing to let companies hold on to the forlorn hope that fracking will somehow be allowed to take place on this beautiful little island in the Atlantic.  In many cases, we are giving the companies an opportunity to take a legal action against this State and that will cost an awful lot of money.  Such a situation has already arisen in Canada, where energy companies have taken the Government to court on the basis that its policy deprived them of accessing quantified resources.  Ireland is paying to have some of this quantification done for energy companies.  Those companies could use the relevant details to take more money off the Irish people.  That is a major mistake and we need put a stop to what is going on.<\/p> <p>  The final issue to which I wish to refer is inland fisheries.  We have reached the point, in terms of resource allocation to inland fisheries, where access to waterways and amenities is being damaged and perhaps beyond the point where it is economically feasible to repair it.  I know about this matter because I have spoken to a number of people who work in the sector.  The sector does a great deal of work that benefits tourism promotion.  We need to be careful that even while ensuring that there are efficiencies, we do not damage the very product the sector provides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#N00300","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>In terms of consultancy, I have some sympathy with the generality of the remarks the Deputy made in respect of consultants.

I do not travel much but I travel a little and I have spoken to Ministers in other countries about broadband.  No matter what a person's view is, broadband is a major infrastructural project.  That project is being managed within my Department by a relatively small group of highly-motivated and professional people under the leadership of Ms Katherine Licken, the assistant secretary in charge.  These people in my Department plug away, day in and day out, working on this exciting and very important project for the Irish people.  Yes, we must have legal consultancy, economic consultancy, technical consultancy and so on but we keep it to the minimum that is required.  We ensure that we can put together all of the pieces to ensure that the project is delivered for the Irish people.  The project is led and managed by civil servants who are doing a terrific job.  I witness their dedication day in, day out and some of them are here with me today.<\/p> <p>  I wish to comment further on consultants.  Sometimes there are projects that are relatively short lived and that require certain skills.  I might sound a little harsh when I say that they are not skills that will be required after the project has been completed.  In other words, the project requires specific skills and once it is completed, there is no longer a need for the skills.  There is a case for bringing in people, either consultants or otherwise, for that kind of work but demand should be kept to a minimum.  It is policy and our approach to keep the necessity for such people to a minimum.

That is what we are doing.  Were we to leave this to the private sector, rural Ireland would not be serviced because there would be no profit to be made.

We are doing that.  The Deputy stated that the projects should be done side by side.  The national broadband plan, with its 30% or whatever it ends up being and the 96%, is a large undertaking.  It is not realistic to assert that we should be rolling out services in rural areas in parallel with commercial operators' roll-out in cities.  It cannot work that way.  We must undertake this work as a whole project.  We must plan, get our ducks in a row, get state aid approval from the Commission, set up a procurement process and ensure that the legal, economic and technical elements are correct.  We are undertaking this as one project for rural Ireland whereas the operators have different commercial interests.  For example, some are legacy operators that already have kit in the ground.  They operate at different levels and paces whereas we are undertaking one large project.  That is the right way to do it.  Whoever is sitting here in five or even three years' time will not be thanked if this project is not undertaken as comprehensively as we have planned.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy regarding energy poverty.  We have energy poverty.  I attended a good conference on this matter a few mornings ago.  We have the better energy warmer homes scheme.  In terms of energy use, it is important that people's homes be warm and properly insulated.  Retrofitting is a key element in what we need to do.  If it is done right, it only needs to be done once.  It can transform energy consumption in homes.  The Deputy was right in his comments.  He mentioned circumstances in which people had few resources as well as structural issues with their homes' doors, windows, etc.  Such factors must form part of an holistic approach to energy efficiency and eradicating as best we can energy poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#O00700","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Does the Minister propose to do something about that issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#O00800","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

Reference is made in the subhead briefing on A3 to the national broadband scheme.  Is that the old scheme?  What remains of that scheme?  We wait with great interest to see how the procurement process for the new national broadband plan evolves.  We can be certain of a few aspects, but the point to which the national scheme will match what the private sector delivers to homes in terms of high-speed broadband is not clear, given evolving technologies and so on.  It is easy to identify those rural and peripheral areas that the private sector will not touch in even the next 20 years.  I fear that there may be a blurring of lines, in that the private sector might invest in an area in the next three or four years if conditions suit but, in the meantime, we will forge ahead and spend public money to deliver the scheme.  We should identify the most peripheral areas, for example, our islands.  If we are serious about delivering high-speed broadband to every household by 2020, it is a safe assumption that the private sector will not go near the islands.<\/p><p>As such, would it not make sense to start there first, move in and meet the private sector somewhere in the middle?  I understand that the tender process is ongoing and that issues might arise but the matter should still be addressed.<\/p><p> The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has announced the digital strategy for schools and I presume the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will also have an input into that very welcome initiative.  Hopefully, we will see up to &euro;50 million of grant aid being taken up and disbursed among all schools nationally.  Some schools will have a better ability to do it than others, which is a real issue and something that must be examined.<\/p><p> A very specific area mentioned within the document, at subhead A3, is funding set aside for the Galway-Mayo ducting.  I am to correction but I think this refers to a new high-speed transatlantic cable from Killala to Dublin and, perhaps, further afield.  My information is that it is being held up in the Department for longer than should be the case.  I am very keen for the matter to progress to the signing of contracts by local authorities, the Department and the private company delivering the project.  It is a project of significant national importance and it must be expedited.<\/p><p> I refer to the online trading scheme under A5.  I presume that is the online voucher or assistance the Department will provide to companies to upgrade their information systems.  We saw a very good example of how that has worked in conjunction with a community in Skibbereen.  The Minister was present at the launch.  The community, with some assistance from the Department, has plans to be the first 1 GB town at least in Munster and, I think, excluding a pilot project Cavan, in the country.  It is a welcome initiative and one that can act as a driver for other communities with an example of what can be done.<\/p><p> I raise a minor issue on subhead C3 in respect of SEAI grants, which are very welcome.  Is the Minister is satisfied with the ratio in the budget of administrative to grant funding?  There is a budget on the administration side of &euro;7 million for pay and non-pay with grants in the region of &euro;50 million.  While it is a really a matter for the SEAI, does the Department have a scrutiny role in respect of the contractors recommended by the SEAI?  In a very small minority of cases, they are, frankly, not up to the job notwithstanding which they continue to be recommended by the SEAI.  Has the Department engaged in any consultation with SEAI on sanctioning those contractors who have taken public money and failed to deliver a service to the client?<\/p><p> A discussion on the following has been awaited for some time.  Does the Minister have an update on the future of the Whitegate oil refinery?  It is a very significant issue for the country and, in particular, those in the east Cork area.

We can certainly fill out some of the detail on that for the Deputy if he wants, but it is what we are dealing with in respect of the national broadband scheme as opposed to the national broadband plan, which the Deputy then went on to discuss.  The approach of identifying areas which there is no question of the commercial sector ever attending to is exactly the one we have taken.  The mapping exercise we undertook and the map we published in November 2014 showed where we judge it will be necessary for the State intervention to occur.  That refers to the so-called amber area.  On the coloured map, blue will be the private sector in its many manifestations and amber is where we judge we will need to go.  It is important to emphasise that we do not make those decisions based only on the private sector saying \"Hey, this is what we think we will and will not do\".  A big part of our work is assessing that and the validity and reliability of information furnished to us by the private sector on its plans.  I was asked earlier what the Department was doing and that is one of the big things we have to do week in and week out.  We make judgments on it and meet with the commercial sector operators before sending them back to get more information in order to understand all of the information available, apply our own judgment and then map it.<\/p> <p>  We had a public consultation on the map and are now updating it.  People may ask why.  We are updating it to take into consideration new information received or operator announcements that have been made in respect of new plans for 2016 and beyond.  When I was addressing Senator Mooney earlier, we talked about the 30%.  I said there was a possibility that the 30% figure could reduce.  That is the process we are engaged in.  It may not reduce substantially, but we think it might reduce somewhat.  We will then be able to show the committee a somewhat reduced amber area in terms of the State intervention.  When the Deputy says there are areas that could never be the subject of questioning, he is right.  The problem is that this is a whole project that will go to procurement.  There will be a somewhat complex tendering process in terms of how operators will indicate they can deliver this minimum of 30 MB right across the contract area.  As such, it is not really possible for us to do this by dividing it up into small units.  We cannot say we know this particular island is never going to be in the blue area so let us get going with it.

My colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is launching it this morning.  I would have been with her but for the fact that I am here with committee, which I am delighted to be.  My Department has had an extensive involvement in the project with the Department of Education and Skills.  As colleagues will know, we have also been involved previously in a national roll-out of 100 MB to post-primary schools across the country in a very successful project.  We see the necessity of primary schools having the same access, but it is something we must deal with in the context of the project we are engaged in and which we have just been discussing.  Education is an area where huge value can be derived from high-speed broadband.  We recognise that and will ensure that it is provided.<\/p> <p>  We have been progressing the Galway-Mayo project.  There are some issues although not by way of unnecessary delay.  There are some technical and legal questions we are nailing down at present.  I am very conscious of the importance of the project.<\/p><p>As the Deputy knows, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann constructed 130 km of telecommunications duct on our behalf alongside the gas pipeline from Galway to Mayo, and there is another spur to the outskirts of Castlebar and Westport.  We are on to it.  We do not want to see it delayed, as the Chairman will be glad to hear, and we will progress it as soon as we can.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned online trading.  The voucher scheme is working very well.  There has been a great take-up and huge interest in it.<\/p><p> I agree with him about the Skibbereen project, and I was happy to attend its launch in August.  The Deputy is right.  It is a very good example of what can be achieved elsewhere in the country.  It is a real beacon.  I wish them well and we will certainly want to assist them in any way we can.<\/p><p> On the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, there is a quality assurance and disciplinary process in place.  It is managed by the SEAI, not by the Department.  I am advised this process is backed up by an inspections regime that ensures that a minimum of 10% of the works carried out under the programme are inspected for quality control purposes - there cannot be an inspection of it all - and that each contractor who performs work on the schemes is covered.  If the Deputy has concerns they should be relayed to the SEAI, but we do not administer the scheme directly in the Department.<\/p><p> On Whitegate, I met with the owners and management of the Whitegate refinery.  It is a decision for them.  It is a fully commercial body in terms of that refinery.  I have met both the local management and the US management on it.  It would be my earnest hope and desire that they would continue past the cut-off point in the middle of 2016, which they have contracted to do.<\/p><p> There are no proposals for any State investment or supports in regard to Whitegate but I assure the Deputy it is something of which we are very conscious.  It is a very important employer, to say nothing about the strategic implications of Whitegate, and we hope the decisions the company will make next year will be positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#P00600","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  Deputy Calleary raised the installation grants and replacement of windows and doors.  It is fine to insulate a house but as they say down the country, \"You'd winnow oats through some of the doors\".  What is going on is stupid.  Councils are refusing to give grants for the replacement of windows and doors when someone is insulating the rest of the house.  That is defeating the purpose of the scheme, and it must be urgently addressed.  Some councils are providing grants for windows and doors and more are not.  If common sense does not prevail on that, we are achieving nothing.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's comments on An Post because the viability of An Post is very important to rural parts of Ireland, and indeed all parts of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about broadband provision.  I was not long a Member last February or March but it is my understanding, and I do not believe I misheard him, that the Minister said a document was being prepared and would be sent to Europe so that he could be given the go-ahead for subsidising the provision of broadband.  He told us it was going in June.  He informed us also that we would have word in October-November as to the go-ahead for that but, now, the Minister spoke about running things in parallel, which is totally different from what I understood the Minister to say a few months ago.  He is talking about the procurement now and getting the go-ahead from Europe.  That is totally different from what I understood a few months ago.<\/p> <p>  I note from the paperwork the EU target by 2020.  A target does not give one a definition of whether one is delivering or not.  A target is a target.  We want closure on broadband through the country.  We want solid dates at this stage.  I understand it is a large task.  The Minister talked about his new staff being enthusiastic, and it is great to hear that, but did he bring in those new staff within the past year or two because I am not familiar with the position or are they employed ten or 12 years?  What has been done for the past ten or 12 years?  Why has this not been delivered before now?<\/p> <p>  ComReg produced a report during the summer.  I rang ComReg because some of what was contained in it was highfalutin, referencing the great increase in the provision of broadband here and there, but a black spot is a black spot and people in them still do not have it.  That is the simple fact.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the State intervention.  I understand some companies will not move into areas but how will we control that process?  Private companies will tender for this contract.  How will we control that down the road?  We will have put money into this process.  The reality is that people in rural parts of Ireland cannot even get phone coverage.  There is no one to ring.  One can send e-mails to everybody but no one seems to answer them.  How can we ensure in the future that someone who supplies this broadband and is subsidised by the State is accountable to fulfil what they undertook to fulfil at the outset?<\/p> <p>  The Minister said he is trying to do it all together but if someone is building a house, they draw a plan elevation and in view and have a structure in terms of where they are going.  Have we anything to say that this is a hub for the west and this is the way we will cover each and every area, and the same in the east and the south?  The impression I am getting, and I may be picking it up the wrong way, is that we will have private operators who will come in the door and tell us what they intend to do.  We will then look at the parts they will not do and subside that part.  We need a strong plan in terms of where the hub for the west and the east will be located and how quickly that will be provided.  Will the Minister give an undertaking that if there are areas that are black spots, and some area has ten or 15 MGS currently, he will give priority to those black spots because they will never lift off the ground if they are left, as the saying, on the hind teat?<\/p> <p>  On energy, Bord na M&oacute;na made a big announcement during the week that it is moving away from peat for energy but I believe it has no plan.  An announcement has been made and from what I understand, we are looking at palm kernels from South Africa, which will mean money going out of the country again.  What does the Minister intend to do about that?<\/p> <p>  We welcome a budget for inland fisheries.  We welcome the provision of more staff but problems are being kicked around, and I refer to the Asian clam in Lanesboro, and the State agencies are passing the book to someone else and saying it is not their job.  At the end of the day, tourism is taking the hit for that.  I urge the Minister to encourage the inland fishery owners to sit down with different bodies.  There should be joined-up thinking on this matter.  I propose that Department representatives would sit down together at least once a month where they would focus on the same or similar issues and try to work together because in some cases the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#Q00200","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>On the implementation strategy for national broadband, what I said earlier this year, and I want to make it clear, is that all of the timelines we have set regarding the national broadband plan since the middle of last year when I came into this job have been complied with.

The Deputy asked me what has been happening all these years.  One thing we discover when we examine this in detail is that the ambition has been scaled up in terms of what we are doing.  Previous undertakings by previous Ministers were given in good faith based on where they were at the time but they were nothing like as ambitious as what we are discussing now.  We are talking about delivering this to every home and business.  We are talking about high-speed high-quality broadband.  All of the previous undertakings given at various stages were offered in good faith based on the information and the level of technological advancement at the time.  This is the most ambitious that we can conceivably be.  I have discussed the matter with people from other countries and I believe this is the top of the line in terms of what we are going to deliver for the people, particularly the people of rural Ireland.  We need people to keep faith with us.  We must hope that whoever is in the next Government and whoever is in this job will pick up the baton immediately and ensure that this is driven home.  We need the continuity and commitment.  We need the continuity that cross-party support for this project can ensure.  I say as much as a personal point.  We could do without any delays next year, when there will be a change of government.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to controlling the situation.  This is a contract.  People will not be paid until they do the job.  That is how we control it.  Unless a service provider is delivering high-speed broadband the organisation in question is not going to get paid.  That is the best control we can possibly have.<\/p> <p>  Can we prioritise different areas?  Yes, we can.  Let us consider the Chairman's remarks earlier.  In the bidding process we can nail down some of the issues about where the successful bidder will go first or what order of work the successful bidder will plan for.  We can weave into the bidding process a certain amount of prioritisation.  That relates to Deputy Harrington's point earlier as well.<\/p> <p>  There was a question relating to peat and bioenergy.  The Department produced and published a bioenergy plan in 2014.  I have had close contact with Bord na M&oacute;na in respect of its plans.  In fairness, the company has an impressive plan.  The plan is to migrate from the traditional activity, which was the burning of peat, to being a real leader in renewable energy in the areas of biomass, solar and wind.  Bord na M&oacute;na can use its extensive land bank to facilitate the development of the portfolio of renewable energy.  I met representatives of the company recently in Newbridge and I see them regularly.  They keep me informed on their plans.  Under the leadership of the chairman, John Horgan, and the new chief executive, Mike Quinn, I believe they are making great strides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#R00500","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Thank you.
