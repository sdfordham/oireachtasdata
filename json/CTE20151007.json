I am interested in the views of Mr. &Oacute; hAinif&eacute;in, as someone who obviously has a huge passion for the language and is very much intent on securing its future, on a couple of things.  Delegates from An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta were in here a few months ago discussing the very same challenge, which is the challenge we face in retaining our language for the future.  I recall one statistic.  I may have it wrong, but perhaps Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh might know it.  It was something along the lines that less than 50% of the children attending schools in Gaeltacht areas are now using Irish as their first language at home.  I remember Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and I were quite taken aback by the statistic.  I can only speak from my experience as a parent and as someone who has worked on the boards of management of a couple of schools in my locality - normal, English-speaking schools teaching Irish as a subject - and I will be frank, but, in my opinion, and it is one I have been expressing for a number of years, we are failing miserably in this country in teaching the language and, far more important, in retaining a love and passion for the language among our young people.  Some of our primary schools are exceptionally successful in this area, but it appears that in the first one or two years of post-primary education in non-Gaelscoileanna, whatever progress had been made up to that point is lost all of a sudden.  Children, young people and students go backwards instead of forwards in terms of their understanding and grasp of the language.<\/p> <p>  Then those who are fortunate enough to be able to afford it go to the Gaeltacht for three weeks or a month and something transformational happens.  It has happened to a couple of my nephews and nieces and to my son.  They went there and, in the space of a month, a resurgence of an interest in the language was somehow sparked in them.  I suppose this is because of their immersion in the language and the culture associated with it.  More important, however, they saw their peers, young people of their own age, using the language daily in Connemara.  I say Connemara because this is predominantly where they go.  What happens there that is not happening in the school environment?  Is there some way we can recreate it?  Is and has our focus always been on the minutiae of the language?  All of us speak fluent English, yet if we were challenged on the rules of English grammar, I am sure few of us would have the knowledge to be able to explain adequately the rudiments of it.  Yet things like the modh coinn&iacute;ollach and the tuiseal ginideach and all that stuff were hammered into us from day one.<\/p> <p>  There seems to be more of a focus on having our children understand the origins of the language rather than encouraging them to speak it.  If a person wants to go on and learn the language at third level, there should be a focus on those aspects.  However, at leaving certificate level our only ambition should be to be able to take young people from Athenry or Longford, for example, and drop them into Connemara, Donegal or Kerry with the competence to at least have a basic conversation with a young person of their own age who uses Irish as a first language.  We are failing miserably in trying to achieve that.  For me, that should be our only ambition.  If we have young people leaving school with a basic conversational standard of Irish who retain a love of the language because it was not something that was hammered unremittingly into them and is something they feel passionate about, we will have succeeded in educating our young people in terms of our language.  We are not succeeding at the moment.  I know it is a very big question, but where are we going wrong?  Why can we not replicate what happens in the Gaeltacht for that one month, which in my experience is transformational, in the classroom?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015100700002#D00100","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444222800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>M&aacute;s f&eacute;idir liom an ceann deireannach a th&oacute;gaint ar dt&uacute;s, an teagmh&aacute;il leis an teanga n&oacute; an contact time a bh&iacute;onn ag duine leis an teanga sa bhunscoil agus sa mhe&aacute;nscoil is about 1,500 hours thar tr&eacute;imhse 14 bliain.

Mathematic learning support is the free mathematical support that is given to students in addition to their lectures, tutorials and assignments at third level.  It is commonplace across the world at this stage and it is part of the response to what has been documented as the mathematics problem: students entering higher education without the mathematical background they require.  The Irish Mathematics Learning Support Network is a community of practice of academics and others working in the area of mathematics learning support across institutions.<\/p><p>One of the major undertakings we set about, in 2011, was to conduct a survey across as many institutions across the island of Ireland as we could, in order to determine the response of students to mathematics learning support.  Our questionnaire was taken in nine higher education institutes, four institutes of technology and five universities.  The questionnaire was in three sections.  Section A asked for the students&rsquo; background.  Section B was for people who had availed of maths learning support to ascertain their levels of satisfaction and whether they felt it had been helpful.  We were also interested in students who had not availed of maths learning support and wanted to find out why they had not engaged with it and what would encourage them to do so.<\/p><p> The profile of the respondents was very much what we expected.  There was a balance between male and female and the mature student proportion was in line with that of the overall sector at the time.  Respondents came from the fields of science, engineering, business, arts, education and computing.  Approximately 34% of respondents had taken higher level mathematics and the balance had taken ordinary level mathematics for the leaving certificate.  Some of the mature students did not have a leaving certificate, which they did not need to enter third level education above the age of 23.  There was a slightly different mix between universities and institutes of technology, IOTs, with 43% of university students having done higher level mathematics compared with 12% in the IOT sector.  This was what we expected.<\/p><p> The key finding of the questionnaire was that 36% of students were availing of maths learning support, 31% of students felt they did not need the help, and 33% had not engaged with maths learning support for other reasons.  We were particularly interested in finding ways to encourage the latter group to engage.  The key issue for first year students is to succeed and progress to second year.  We discovered from the survey that 22% of students who had used maths learning support had considered dropping out because of issues with mathematics and 63% of those students felt that maths learning support had made a significant impact on them in terms of staying with their studies and continuing on.  Another 3% of students who had not reported themselves as having considered dropping out said the reason they had not considered dropping out was the fact that the maths learning support was there.  Around one in four students who had considered dropping out of higher education because of mathematics difficulties did not do so, and two thirds of those did not do so because of the help they had had from maths learning support.<\/p><p> Arising from our findings, we feel maths learning support should be embedded as a permanent fixture in higher education institutions across the country.  The information that is so useful to students should be communicated to them upon entry into third level.  The benefits and financial savings to the colleges should be highlighted, given that every student who decides not to drop out is a saving on an investment that has been made in the student in first year and beyond.<\/p><p> Typically, maths learning support services offer a drop-in centre where students can come with any question and get help at any stage.  This was the most positively endorsed and most used service.  Revision workshops and support tutorials are also run.  There is also a group of ICT-enabled supports, which were the least used and the least positively endorsed.  The key people in maths learning support are the tutors working in the maths learning centres, and we recommend they be given special training in how to deal with students who come in.  The human interaction is a key factor.  Arising from the report, we have been working on developing strategies around enhancing students' digital literacy skills to ensure they can make the most use of whatever digital support is there.<\/p><p> To a large extent, success in mathematics is contingent on confidence.  Some 56% of students felt availing of maths learning support had had a major impact on their confidence.  A similar percentage felt maths learning support had had a very positive impact on their mathematical performance.  From the point of view of coping with the mathematical demands of their courses, two thirds of students indicated that maths learning support had been very helpful.  It is very important this information be communicated to incoming first years so that they know that engaging with these extra supports can have a very positive impact on their learning in first year.  From a practical point of view, it is very important that there be increased collaboration between lecturing staff and course providers and the people working in maths learning support to try, in a very practical way, to encourage students to avail of maths learning support by ensuring an element of continuous assessment is built in extremely early in the semester, within the first two to three weeks, to try to encourage students to immediately engage with supports.<\/p><p> Some 48% of students who did not engage with maths learning support stated that they did not need help.  There were other practical issues in terms of times not suiting and not knowing where the support was, and these were ranked highly.  Some 40% to 50% of students were giving reasons in those categories.  Maths learning support units can react to this by adjusting their services.  While many students, 29%, said they would go to support centres if they needed support, a significant number referred to better times and more information.  Another issue that is very important from a practical point of view is that maths learning support centres can become very busy at certain times of the year and respondents felt that having more resources and better locations for maths learning support was very important.  Over recent year, one or two maths learning support centres have been moved within the libraries of higher education institutions, as opposed to being in a separate room.  This seems to increase footfall and engagement, which is very positive.<\/p><p> We drilled down into the relationship between prior mathematical achievement and availing of maths learning support and discovered that the stronger the mathematical background, the less likely students were to avail of support.  Among students who had switched from higher level to ordinary level during their leaving certificate years, the longer they had stayed at higher level, the less likely they were to feel they needed maths learning support.  This is very significant in light of the bonus points.<\/p><p> We wanted to focus on mature students, particularly in the IOT sector.  There was a very definite, statistically significant link between adult learners over the age of 23 and engagement with maths learning support.  Adult learners will use every option they have to be successful.  This will have consequences.<\/p><p>If there will be more adult learners engaging with higher education, and the plan is to try to bring that statistic up, mathematics learning support centres must be adequately resourced to deal with that.  From a practical point of view, the tutors within mathematics learning support centres must understand that there are very different motivations on the part of adult learners and traditional learners who may have come from school.  Adult learners will want to know reasons why.  They will want to know about depth and so those different motivations are very important in terms of giving them the kind of support they need.  <\/p><p> The final key fact we noticed is that there was a link between gender and availing of mathematics learning support.  A statistically higher proportion of females availed of mathematics learning support regardless of prior mathematical achievement or disciplines of study.  There was a significant association between gender and the categories that emerged for the reasons given for use of mathematics learning support.  There were differences there but, critically, we discovered that once they had engaged with mathematics learning support, male and female students did not report any difference in their experience or the academic impact of using mathematics learning support.  <\/p><p> In respect of our current work for the network, we were fortunate to receive network funding from the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education.  We are using that funding to build the strength of the network; conduct an audit of the provision of mathematics learning support across the island of Ireland because we operate across the 32 counties and in particular; and try to action some of the recommendations that came from the report, particularly in the area of tutor training.  We have developed a tutor training package that can be used in all the institutes on the island in terms of making it easy to do high-quality mathematics learning support training for the tutors.  <\/p><p> Mathematics learning support is now well established in Ireland but as things grow and develop, funding, including multi-annual and permanent funding, for mathematics learning support can be an issue.  The access office is well established in the fabric and infrastructure of third-level education.  Mathematics learning support needs to be on a similar kind of footing.  Another issue that has a very practical impact is that the fact that funding for postgraduate students in mathematics has reduced.  This has had the knock-on effect of lack of availability of suitable tutors in mathematics learning support centres.  They are two issues that are beyond the control of people working in mathematics learning support but they may need some consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015100700002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444222800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Sullivan for his presentation.

We now putting elements of second-year courses into the first-year courses because we found that students now know the stuff we were teaching in first year.  That is just one small factor relating to statistics, which is approximately one third or one quarter of first-year mathematics.  That is only a small snapshot and I agree with Mr. O'Sullivan that we must wait.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the question about how many tutors we would like, you are going to give someone from Monaghan a cheque.  It is very hard to give a definitive answer because the needs of each institution are different.  There are 22 tutors working in the mathematics support centre in NUI Maynooth, but this ranges.  Some people have one or two hours.  Some are postgraduates while some are undergraduates because we have an issue with sourcing good tutors, so we have to spread it out.  It is a difficult one to answer but we provide something like 127 tutor hours per week.  It is different in the different institutions.

One observation occurred to me as I listened and it is something I do not get.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to it earlier.  On one hand, people maintain that the ICT enhanced supports in place are not effective.  Essentially, they are saying they do not work for individuals.   On the other hand, they maintain access times are somehow not appropriate to their lives in terms of being able to access the supports when they want.  It seems these two issues could be examined in tandem in the interests of addressing a challenge.  If we had some sort of ICT support structure that could satisfy their needs - we can talk about the shape that might take - it is more than likely that we could solve the issue of people's inability to access the support structure at a time that is convenient to them.  The vast majority of these students are carrying ICT devices such as the one I have my hand now.  In 2015 many young people between the age of 20 and 35 years are saying that mathematics tuition or a mathematics support structure delivered on an ICT platform are not working for them.  Let us consider the work of An Cos&aacute;n in Jobstown and what those involved are doing with the online community college.  They are teaching students throughout the country from a centre based in Tallaght.  There is live interaction between the students and the tutor.  What happens is recorded and, as a result, a student can go back the following night and go through the entire class again at his or her own convenience.  Let us consider what ALISON is doing in Galway.  ALISON is now the largest online global educator on the continent of Africa.  A total of 30 people in Galway are teaching an entire continent online, predominantly on a part-time basis.  Let us consider what the Khan Academy is doing.  Two years ago there were 4,000 students using the Khan Academy platform in Ireland.  Now, there are 93,000.  Does the network face a challenge in terms of being able to reach out to students?  Is there a solution to dealing with that challenge and is it the case that we have somehow not managed to bring the two together?  Is that something the network is working towards?  Does Dr. Mac an Bhaird see that as a major tool available to the network in addressing the challenge of mathematics proficiency in third level in future?

In any event, I am keen to know the opinions of our guests.  How have we reached this stage of the problem and why is there a need for this network?  What has happened?  Aside from the obvious, what is the reason we are at this stage?  What is the opinion of the network on why we have got so bad, so quickly in mathematics?  Do the members of the deputation understand my question?  What is their opinion in view of the fact that they now have a school of mathematics and they are meting it out in myriad areas?  Why have we got so bad, so quickly in respect of this problem to warrant the existence of the network?<\/p> <p>  The network is essentially a travelling school of mathematics.  What are our guests' views on awarding points for failure?  That is what we are doing in the leaving certificate now.  If a pupil fails honours mathematics or gets between 30% and 39%, he or she  can pick up between 52 and 56 points.  Perhaps I am not right on the matter, although I see some people nodding their heads.  The representatives of the network can correct me if I am wrong.

I would have thought it unusual not to be joined up through all three levels.

The methods worked even among very weak students.  Going back 20 years, I used to print out the shares from the day's newspaper, give each of the students a fictitious &pound;100 and let them buy shares for the day.  Every week we valued our shares and they found it fascinating.  Some of them were making money and others were losing money.  I imagine some gamblers materialised subsequently from that teaching.

What we strive to do with mathematics support is help students to become independent learners.  That is a major struggle when they reach third level.  They are not used to that type of approach.  One of the problems with mathematics in particular is that students often do not know the terminology for what they cannot do.  It is incredibly difficult for them to use ICT independently.  They can follow a programme, a module or a course where everything has been laid out and they must do tutorial one and tutorial two and there are ICT resources for that programme.  If they struggle to get the correct answer, they do not know which part of the answer at which they have arrived is incorrect, so they do not know the resource to look up to help them.  That is the major problem for students who are really struggling.  They do not know the terminology.  They will often look up the wrong thing and decide the resource was useless because it did not help them with the right thing.  In fact, however, they were looking at the wrong one.  We find that for much of the time we are encouraging them to try to identify and pin down exactly the point at which their understanding breaks down and to come to us to find out what type of terminology we would use for that.  This enables them to use the ICT resources related to that.  However, it still requires person-to-person contact.  The reason that happens to such an extent in mathematics is because so much of it is building blocks.  If one misses one of those, one misses everything afterwards.<\/p> <p>  This addresses a little of what Senator Jim D'Arcy was asking regarding the end in sight for mathematics learning support.  The problem is that there will always be people who were sick for a while previously, who came through a different education system, have dyslexia or have various different challenges and have missed something crucial at some point, sometimes in primary school and sometimes at second level.  Sometimes it has just been a while and they cannot remember certain things.  However, because one might be missing one or two of those crucial building blocks, it affects everything one does afterwards.  We will probably never have a situation where everybody has grasped enough to do just fine without this extra help.  Sometimes we see students who are really struggling in their course, but within half an hour or an hour of spending time with us and solving a few basic problems for them they suddenly find they are able to do the ones that look more complex.  However, they cannot get to that stage without that.  That is a major problem we see.<\/p> <p>  ICT resources would be great and the more we can use them, the better.  We are trying to tailor things as much as possible to the needs of the students.  We still believe, however, that we must be the middle man, as it were, between the student and the ICT resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015100700002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eabhnat N&iacute; Fhloinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444222800,"counter":54,"content":"<p>In terms of ICT, the data for the survey was gathered a few years ago so things have moved on.

We have not done it with primary schools, although perhaps we have in local areas, but at secondary school level, Bill Lynch of Project Maths last year asked us to give the team a list of the most common problems we were encountering with students in first year.  We carried out a quick survey of our colleagues across the country on the topics with which they were having issues.  A training session was held in Drumcondra with the people who were going out to do the training sessions for Project Maths with the teachers.  I and a colleague from Letterkenny went through the common issues we have and as a result they went to the schools to tell the teachers.  That is one small part.<\/p> <p>  Many of us also provide the mathematics support model for secondary schools as well.  It is only on a small basis, but we do some support.  That ties in a little with the question asked by Senator Jim D'Arcy as to whether these students were not capable and needed the support to get through.  Personally, I find it is a confidence issue.  I recall one student who started.  She has now finished her degree but she repeated her leaving certificate to get an ordinary level D3.  She then did a degree in mathematics and got a 2.1.  The first year was probably torture for me because she did not believe.  She thought that this was her level and did not believe.  She just was not approaching it in the right way.  The big issue is that students struggle with mathematics.  It is said in the media that mathematics is difficult.  It is always in media.  As soon as there is bad news about mathematics it is publicised; the good news is never publicised.  However, soon this student realised that getting things wrong in mathematics is key.  One thinks that if one is good mathematics, it is because one is smart.  Of course, I agree with that completely but the point is that students who struggle with mathematics would not see that people who are so-called good at it get it wrong all the time.  The issue is how they react to getting in wrong.  It is like how we learn anything in life - we try it, we fail and we fail better.  That is the idea with mathematics support.  We try to get the students to the point where they realise the process.  In my experience - I am sure it is the same for my colleagues - once one gets them to this point the more motivated ones begin to become more independent.  They actually come in to show one the work they have got wrong and to discuss it.  This is the key, from that point of view.<\/p><p>The question of whether there is an end in sight has already been addressed.  On the competencies that are lacking, key skills is the main issue.  I take on board the point about fractions.  I understand it.  Personally, I would ban calculators.

It is very hard to answer that question.  The question of what level of funding we would require has been raised before.  The main issue from our point of view is the underfunding of third level institutions in Ireland.  When we go to our institution seeking an additional tutor or an additional hour of support per week the response we get from the institution is that it cannot provide it because it is operating within a fixed budget which must be shared out in a particular way.  Increased funding for institutions would, I hope, result in more funding for maths supports.  It would then be up to each network and so on to argue its case.  Another issue is that of head count.  In other words, the number of people that can be employed and the constant watch in that regard.  I do not know how that can be solved.

The definition of &quot;assessment&quot; is too narrow, in that it does not take into account of certain types of estimates that are made by the Revenue Commissioners and that are treated in the same way as tax assessments for the purpose of appeals.  The definition is being broadened to include estimates made in respect of shortfalls in monthly and annual remittances by employers of income tax deducted from employees' wages.  The definition of &quot;tax&quot; takes the meaning given to it by section 960A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  It is considered that adopting section 960A and its list of taxes and duties is not appropriate.  For example, it does not include a reference to customs duties, which are appealable, and it does include a reference to penalties, appeals in respect of which are dealt with by the court and not by the appeals commissioners.  For this reason, the definition is being amended to refer specifically to the full range of taxes and duties under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.  The purpose of the amendment is for clarity in that regard.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 6 is being made to the new section 949E, which provides for the giving of directions by the appeals commissioners to parties to an appeal in respect of information to be provided by them on how the appeal is to be conducted.  In line with the new focus on transparency, and to be consistent with other provisions in the Bill, this amendment requires a party such as Revenue, which applies for a direction from the appeals commissioners, to notify the other party, the taxpayer, of the direction for which it has applied.  Thus, each party is kept informed about the actions of the other party.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 8 inserts an additional paragraph (e) into subsection (2) of the new section 949I, which deals with the notice of appeal a taxpayer is required to submit to the appeals commissioner.  The amendment is intended to allow some flexibility to the appeals commissioners in the design of such a notice where they consider that information additional to that already provided for is warranted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015100700002#B00800","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1444236000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>On amendment No. 8, obviously there is flexibility in this regard, but this creates an open-ended provision whereby the appeal commissioner can decide on any other matters.

This is an issue to which the Minister and his officials have given considerable consideration because, as the Deputy said,  different views have been expressed.The amendments indicate a concern about the holding of hearings on tax appeals in public and the Deputy has highlighted his intention to submit similar amendments on Report Stage.  I want to flag our perspective on this issue and where we are coming from.  <\/p><p>In Chapter 4 of Part 4 section 949Y provides for the default position of public hearings.  This is subject to the right of a taxpayer to a private hearing on request to the appeal commissioners.  It is also subject to the appeal commissioners' discretion on whether to hold a hearing or part of a hearing in private where they consider circumstances specified in subsection (2) of the new section 949Y of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 apply.  These circumstances include, as the Deputy said, the need to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive information, to protect a person's right to respect for his or her private or family life and in the wider interests of justice and the public interest.  The effect of the Deputy's amendments would be that all appeal hearings, without exception, would be held in public, with no allowance being made for appeal commissioners' discretion or the wider interests of justice and the public interest, as outlined.  The Deputy is likely to change this on Report Stage.<\/p><p>The proposal in respect of public hearings was contained in Revenue's submission to the Minister during the public consultation on the reform of the tax appeal system.  The reason given for the proposal was that it would ensure transparency and accountability and enhance public confidence in the tax system.  The public would see that the tax system was being administered in an even-handed way by Revenue and subject to oversight by an independent and impartial tax appeal commission.  Such a move would also be in line with best international practice and other Irish administrative fora in which public hearings are the norm.<\/p><p>Revenue also referred in its submission to the fundamental principle of law enshrined in the Constitution that court proceedings should be held in public.  While justice must be done, it is also important that it be seen to be done.  In this regard, the <i>in camera<\/i>rule in tax cases in the High Court and the Supreme Court was removed in the 1980s.  While the appeal commissioners are an expert tribunal and not a court, it can be argued that the principle of public proceedings should also apply to them.  The Minister was persuaded of the merits of these views and decided to legislate for a system of public hearings that would contain the necessary safeguards to ensure certain matters would not be in the public domain.  <\/p><p>During the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill by the committee, conflicting views on the matter were expressed by various committee members and other parties.  Support for the idea of public hearings was expressed by Deputy Pearse Doherty and also by Revenue and the appeal commissioners.  Other parties, including the Irish Tax Institute and a number of members of this committee, expressed strong views against public hearings, citing such reasons as the reluctance of taxpayers to take an appeal if hearings were to be held in public and the impact on business of the release of commercially sensitive information.  Ultimately, while allowing for the possibility of public hearings, the committee stated in its report to the Minister that it would prefer to give an appellant discretion about the choice of having a public or private hearing.  The Minister's decision to accept the committee's recommendation was influenced by the strong views expressed at the committee's hearings.  He sees the potential benefit of public hearings and would like to see the matter being kept under review as the new appeal system becomes established.  At this time, therefore, he is not prepared to accept Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015100700002#C01300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1444236000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I take on board what the Minister of State has said.  Obviously, we heard from a wide range of opinions, including members of the committee.  It is like a court of law.  It is like saying that if a man was accused of manslaughter or murder, the case should be tried in public but that if he wanted it to be held in private, he could make an application and the courts would have to hold it privately.  We know what would happen in such a case.  In the context of the valid points made, the difference is that many people who will appeal will win their case - we have seen the statistics - whether it be in terms of the additional information required or because the wrong determination was made originally.<\/p><p>The issue of dissuading people from appealling or maintaining the confidentially of commercially sensitive information for businesses is dealt with in subsection (2).  I imagine it relates to commercial information for a business.  That issue is covered in subsection (2)(c), while paragraph (d) covers protecting an individual's right to respect for his or her private and family life.  I do not know how we will review this aspect because if 98 of 100 cases in the next 12 months are held <i>in camera<\/i>, does that mean that we should say this is not working?  My view is that we should do it the other way around because the appeal commissioners should ensure the five provisions set out which allow them to provide for the holding of a session <i>in camera<\/i>should be used.  That would be more beneficial because we would be reviewing subsection (2) as it was originally envisaged.  If it is not working and are cases in which sensitive information should not be released or people request a hearing <i>in camera<\/i>for legitimate reasons, we should review it.

The offices of the appeal commissioners are not a court of law.<\/p><p>I accept that justice proceedings before the courts have to be generally dealt with in public.  The reality is that if it was at the discretion of the appeals commissioners, as provided for in subsection (2), and there was no subsection (3), the taxpayer would be taking the risk that the appeals commissioners would decide that the case should be heard in public.  In practice, that would be a deterrent to people.  Information that I might regard as sensitive might not be regarded as sensitive information by the appeals commissioners.

I refer to the removal of the right to appeal a decision of the appeals commissioners to the Circuit Court.  This issue was considered in some detail during the pre-legislative hearings held by this committee some months ago.  While the Government moved on the issue of holding hearings in public, the Minister has not moved on the issue of removing the Circuit Court appeal.  I would like to make a number of points in this context.  The right of a taxpayer to appeal a finding of fact to the Circuit Court has been in place for almost half a century.  It is associated with the fundamental right of taxpayers to redress.  In my view, the removal of that right would be a huge step that would limit the access of taxpayers to justice.  For many people, appealing on a point of law to the High Court is simply not a feasible option because of the costs associated with it.  In addition, the legal grounds for any appeal to the High Court are very narrow and must relate to a point of law.  The reality is that the vast majority of taxpayers will have no recourse beyond the appeals commissioners.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that the number of cases which go before the Circuit Court having gone through the appeal commissioner system is modest but the latter is an argument for retaining that option for taxpayers who feel they need it.  There have been occasions where the Circuit Court has found in favour of the taxpayer.  If the reason being proffered for the change is the level of delay in the Circuit Court system, it is not a good enough one for changing a fundamental pillar of the administration of our tax system.  If the argument is that some people seek to delay the final adjudication in their cases - which may well be the situation in a small number of instances - the Circuit Court rules provide that the Revenue Commissioners can seek costs against those taxpayers.  No one is arguing that the right of appeal to the Circuit Court should be retained simply to delay the final adjudication of cases.  I am arguing for its retention because taxpayers, having gone through the normal appeals process with the appeal commissioners, deserve the right to have their cases heard before the Circuit Court.  That should be retained.  It should be retained on the basis that misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the facts of their cases, which can often be very complex, should be put before a Circuit Court if the appellant feels the issue is serious enough.  I do not fully understand the logic behind this important change to our taxation regime, which is why I am putting forward the consequential amendments in respect of the substantive issue, namely, retention of the option to appeal to the Circuit Court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015100700002#D03300","speaker":"993","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444236000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I agree completely with Deputy Michael McGrath.  It is a fundamental point in the context of the Bill and it is a fundamental right of an individual to appeal.  I recall the points we made on Second Stage and those that were made by the joint committee.  This is one of the areas in which there was no division among committee members on the question that the right of appeal to the Circuit Court should be maintained for all the reasons set out, including the cost implications and the fact that the High Court only allows appeals on points of law.  This is the right of citizens.  There is no argument for this not to be maintained.  As Deputy Michael McGrath said, there was a strong argument put forward that some people were abusing the system and appealing to the Circuit Court in order to delay the findings of the Revenue.  We had individual cases that went on a number of decades.  That is a system that needs to be fixed and not a matter requiring the removal of the right of every individual to appeal to the Circuit Court.  It is a trend we are seeing in legislation that the right of appeal to the Circuit Court is being stripped away and replaced with the High Court.

Let me put forward the Minister's arguments as to why we are not in a position to accept them.  On amendment No. 26 proposed by Deputy Pearse Doherty, it is clear the Deputy intends that the <i>status quo<\/i>on the Circuit Court stage be retained.  However, it has been pointed out to me that the provisions contained in his amendment appear to be based on the Taxes Consolidation Act as it was first consolidated in 1997 and not on the current version of the Act as amended in the intervening years.  The relevant section, which is section 942, was amended by the Finance Acts 2005 and 2007 in some important respects.  However, I take the substantive point the Deputy is making and I want to address his amendment and the others as presented.  The current appeals process provides for an appeal by a taxpayer against a determination of the appeal commissioners to a judge of the Circuit Court.  This Circuit Court stage is a complete rehearing of the appeal.  The proceedings do not take any account of what may have transpired at the appeal commissioner stage and it is the determination of the Circuit Court judge that prevails.  Prior to taking a matter to the appeal commissioners, taxpayers have the option of looking for a review of a Revenue decision.  This can be sought with either a Revenue officer who was not involved in the decision or an independent external person who has appropriate expertise.  Such reviews are available to all taxpayers who have a dispute with Revenue before the appeal commissioner stage of the process.<\/p><p>I thank, as does the Minister, the Deputies for their contributions on Second Stage but I refute strongly the assertion that there is a policy pattern within Government to remove the right of access to the Circuit Court for citizens and that the intention behind the proposal is to prohibit people from appealing.  Rather, it is the case that the Minister is not persuaded about the necessity of having an appeal to he Circuit Court and considers that the disadvantages significantly outweigh the advantages.  Reforms in the Bill will ensure a more robust, transparent and streamlined procedure under which a route of appeal to the Circuit Court is no longer necessary or one over which the Minister can stand.  The appeal commissioners are a specialist expert tax tribunal and the Minister is determined that this status be acknowledged and strengthened where possible.<\/p><p>Under the new appeals regime, the Public Appointments Service will select candidates for appointment as appeal commissioners based on the specific requirements of the job and will look for appropriate tax and legal expertise, experience and qualifications.  This is absolutely no reflection on the expertise of the current and former appeal commissioners but merely a statement of the strengthened provision to ensure that appellants continue to get high levels of professional service.  All appeal commissioners will require the appropriate tax and legal experience and qualifications, which has not been the case before albeit that being no reflection on the expertise and skills of current or former appeal commissioners.  The Bill contains provisions that will underpin this specialist expertise with a clear independence from Revenue and a fair and impartial appeal proceedings.  The reform is intended to produce a better-resourced, more efficient and transparent appeals commissioner stage.  It will see more flexible and active case management as we have already discussed by appeal commissioners, publication of written determinations in a mandatory fashion, and a streamlined case-stated procedure for appeals to the High Court.  In contrast, the <i>modus operandi<\/i>of Circuit Court rehearings appears anomalous and the continuation of the Circuit Court stage of the appeals process has the potential to undermine much of the proposed reform.<\/p><p>The current tax appeals process is out of step with the procedures of many other expert appellant tribunals.  Some examples of decisions by public bodies that can only be appealed by way of an appeal to the High Court on points of law are decisions made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Financial Services Ombudsman, the Office of the Information Commissioner, the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal, the Labour Court, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, the rent tribunal, the social welfare appeals office, the tenancy tribunal of the Private Residential Tenancies Board and the valuation tribunal in respect of commercial rates.  Unfair dismissals cases were previously appealable from the Employment Appeals Tribunal to the Circuit Court but this process has ceased following the recent establishment of the Workplace Relations Commission.  As such, this is in no way out of step with a number of other expert tribunals and how they interact with our courts system.<\/p><p>I appreciate completely that it can be expensive to take a case to the High Court.  We do not believe it is necessarily as high as the &euro;100,000 minimum mentioned in some quarters.  While I appreciate that the high cost may be a barrier to participation, should the Circuit Court stage be retained, it would be open to Revenue to appeal a Circuit Court determination against it so that taxpayers may find themselves before the High Court in any event.  The Bill is intended to provide for an efficient expert tribunal to address disputes that may arise between taxpayers and the Revenue.  Retaining the Circuit Court stage in a reformed and streamlined process which will be better resourced is not a position over which the Minister can stand.  The appeals process is one of a range of avenues of redress open to taxpayers who feel aggrieved at decisions made by Revenue officials or, indeed, by their behaviour.  Taxpayers also have access to Revenue's internal and external review processes as well as avenues such as judicial review and to the courts, up to an including the Court of Justice of the European Union in relevant cases.  By providing for the recruitment and selection of suitable experts and for streamlined procedures for the making and hearing of appeals, the Bill aims to ensure an efficient and cost-effective use of public resources and, indeed, the costs incurred by a taxpayer in bringing an appeal.  The proposal to allow rehearings before the Circuit Court runs contrary to this objective.  Retaining the Circuit Court stage of the appeals process has the potential to unnecessarily delay the resolution of tax disputes.<\/p><p>A great deal has rightly been made of the importance of transparency.<\/p><p>When matters go before the Circuit Court, no record is created, and a decision or determination is not necessarily published.  In terms of ensuring that specialists with the legal and tax expertise have an opportunity, independent of Revenue, to assess an appeal, that arrangement is in place.  The transparency process is in place.  We therefore do not see the Circuit Court process as necessary in that regard.  It follows a long line, which Deputy Doherty acknowledges or possibly does not agree with, in terms of a number of other expert appeal tribunals which operate in a similar fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015100700002#E00400","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444236000,"counter":167,"content":"<p>We are not going to reach agreement on this.

To establish an expert tribunal and then to allow an appeal by way of full re-hearing in a forum which neither has, nor professes to have, the same expertise in tax matters seems inconsistent with what we are trying to do.  A complete re-hearing can only be justified if there are reasons to suppose that poor decisions on a matter of fact are a particular problem with the appeal commissioner.  There has been no suggestion that this is the case.  Referring a case when we accept the bona fides and expertise of an appeal commissioner to a forum which does not have the same level of expertise is inconsistent.  <\/p><p>I would like to put on record a quotation from the Supreme Court judge in the 1998 case of Henry Denny &amp;amp; Sons (Ireland) Ltd. <i>v.<\/i>the Minister for Social Welfare, which is particularly relevant to the role of courts and expert administrative tribunals:<\/p><blockquote>I believe it would be desirable to take this opportunity of expressing the view that the courts should be slow to interfere with the decisions of expert administrative tribunals.

We have a tradition, in some cases very long standing and in others, due to reforms, less so, where an expert appeal tribunal is put in place in the knowledge that it contains the expertise, independence and legal and tax skills to provide the fair, independent, transparent appeal to which the taxpayer and citizen has a right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015100700002#F00700","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1444236000,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Without going into that debate, I would stress that many citizens have been - I must be careful in terms of my parliamentary language-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015100700002#F00800","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1444236000,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Deputy Doherty is on a roll.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015100700002#F00900","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1444236000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>This is a particularly bad word.

The question posed by the amendment and the issue I am seeking to address is whether the appeal commissioner's report takes account of that decision or accords and reports that decision.

One of the key reforms being introduced, as the Deputy knows, is that the appeal commissioners will be required to publish on the Internet a report of all their determinations.  A report will have to state whether an appellant has requested that a statement of the case be prepared by the appeal commissioners in regard to the making of an appeal to the High Court against the appeal commissioner determination.  This will provide an indication to all that determinations may be revised by the courts at a later stage.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McGrath has proposed that the published reports of the appeal commissioners should also contain whatever determinations a court or courts subsequently make relating to an appeal.  I can see the potential benefit of this proposal in making available the full picture for each appeal.  However, I can also see that it would be impractical to implement and an onerous burden on the appeal commissioners.  The appeal commissioners are responsible for their own stage of the appeals process and, with the limited exception of whether the High Court might refer an appeal back to them for determination, cease to have any involvement in an appeal after it has been determined by them.  It may take several years, as the Deputy would appreciate, for an appeal to be finally determined by the courts.<\/p> <p>  The parties to any court proceedings are the Revenue Commissioners and the taxpayer.  The appeal commissioners are not a notice party to a subsequent appeal to the courts and will not be aware of any subsequent court proceedings or decisions of if the party settled the matter by agreement among themselves.  There is no obligation on the courts to notify the appeal commissioners of their judgment and it is not appropriate that they be required to do so.  In the normal course of events, court decisions are published by the Courts Service and the public has access to the decisions at that stage.  I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment but I reiterate that when the appeal commissioners publish a determination, they will have to indicate at that stage if they have been asked to prepare a case by the appeal commissioners to make an appeal to the High Court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015100700002#G00700","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1444236000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Amendment No. 29 elaborates on the required contents of the document used for the purpose of a case stated for the High Court by introducing two additional matters.  These are an outline of the arguments made by the parties and the case law relied upon by the parties during the appeal commissioner stage of the appeal proceedings.  Arising from the additional material to be included in a case stated for the High Court, it is considered that some additional time should be allowed to the parties to consider the material prepared for the appeal commissioners.  To this end, amendment No. 30 extends the time limit from 14 days to 21 days.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 31 provides a safeguard for an appellant in view of the three-month time limit for the preparation of a case stated for the High Court.  In circumstances where an appellant fails to comply with this time limit through no fault of the appellant, it is likely that the High Court will not decline to deal with the appeal.  However, it is considered prudent to provide specifically for such an eventuality.  Therefore the time limits imposed by section 949AQ are not necessarily absolute and the High Court must consider whether the interests of justice would be served when deciding whether to deal with the case stated appeal where an appellant fails to comply with the statutory time limits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015100700002#G01900","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1444236000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1444236000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 30:<\/p><blockquote>In page 42, line 8, to delete &quot;14 days&quot; and substitute &quot;21 days&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015100700002#G02100","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1444236000,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1444236000,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 31:<\/p><blockquote>In page 42, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:&quot;(8) The High Court shall not decline to hear and determine any question of law arising in a case stated by reason of the fact that a thing referred to in subsection (6) or (7) has not been done within the period specified by subsection (6) or (7), as the case may be, if it determines that, in all the circumstances of the matter, it would not be in the interests of justice to so decline to hear and determine that question.&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015100700002#G02300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1444236000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1444236000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 32 and 35 are related and may be discussed together.

It is proposed that these funds will be used to establish the connectivity fund which will be a sub-portfolio of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, as it is commonly known.  Given that the proceeds came from the sale of the State's stake in a transport asset, the fund will be dedicated to enhancing connectivity both within and for the State.  The decision to use the proceeds from the sale of Aer Lingus for productive investment in connectivity related projects will provide an opportunity to enhance our regional connectivity, improve our attractiveness and competitiveness in the tourism sector and promote investment and enhanced opportunities for growth.<\/p> <p>  In recent years the Government has created an environment of certainty conducive to growth and investment.  It has established certainty around the stability of our financial system.  It has established certainty around our public finances and reaffirmed certainty that Ireland is a growth-friendly environment for both foreign direct investment and local business investment.  The connectivity fund will operate on a commercial basis, providing support for commercial investment projects with a connectivity theme, such as the development of ports or airports, including access to these transport assets.<\/p><p>It will also be open to providing support for projects that involve a wider definition of connectivity, including data connectivity, such as broadband, fibre-optic cables and interconnectors, and energy connectivity, including energy interconnectors and other energy related projects.  These wider connectivity requirements are becoming increasingly important elements of our core infrastructure and will be extremely important to a more balanced regional development.<\/p><p> It has not been a consistent policy of the Government that proceeds from the sale of assets should be used to support and sustain economic recovery and job creation.  However, as members of the committee will be aware, under EUROSTAT rules, the proceeds arising from the sale of the State's share in Aer Lingus - representing the sale of a financial asset - will have no beneficial impact on Ireland's general Government balance and, therefore, will not provide any additional capacity for Government expenditure on a general Government balance neutral basis.  This is why the Government has decided to bring forward the proposal to allocate the proceeds to a special fund that will operate on a commercial basis and will, therefore, not constitute Government expenditure.  However, it will facilitate the reuse of the proceeds for productive purposes in the economy on a general Government balance neutral basis.  The Government proposes to transfer the funds to the ISIF for investment given that it already has the appropriate governance arrangements in place to manage them.<\/p><p> The investment criteria used to assess investment opportunities for the connectivity fund will be entirely consistent with the ISIF&rsquo;s existing mandate, which is to invest on a commercial basis in a manner designed to support economic activity and employment in the State.  The success of the connectivity fund will be measured by both investment returns and economic impact achieved.  The connectivity fund, like the ISIF, will be a long-term fund.  Deployment will be on a phased basis and will be driven by investment opportunities identified.  Returns are likely to accrue over the medium and longer term.<\/p><p> Following the commencement of the relevant section of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014 on 22 December 2014, the assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund became the assets of the ISIF.  The latter recently published its first baseline economic impact report.  Key figures show that as of 30 September 2015, the ISIF has committed &euro;1.8 billion to investments aligned with its mandate.  As of the same date, the market value of the capital drawn down is &euro;909 million.  Some 79 Irish companies and projects with a combined annual turnover of &euro;472 million are benefiting from ISIF investment.  As of 31 December, approximately 8,362 jobs were supported directly and indirectly by ISIF investments.  The funds in which the ISIF invested have had significant engagement throughout the Irish market with 3,573 engagements and 99 completed investments since its inception.  This clearly demonstrates the impact the ISIF has already had and I look forward to learning about the performance of the fund as it progresses in the medium term.  Using the proceeds of the sale of the State&rsquo;s shareholding for investment in the connectivity fund will result in similar economic benefits.<\/p><p> Under section 46 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, I am empowered to bring a resolution before the Houses of the Oireachtas on behalf of the Minister for Finance setting out the proposed payment to the ISIF.

The Government received &euro;335 million from the sale of its shareholding in Aer Lingus.  In the normal course of events - and in the absence of EUROSTAT rules - that money could go into Government coffers and be used for expenditure purposes.  Although EUROSTAT rules do not allow this, the Government can put it into another fund and reuse it for investment.  This is probably a way around EUROSTAT rules to get the money back into the economy.  I have no issue with this.  It is common sense that the funds should be used for productive investment purposes and not current expenditure.  We agree with what is happening.<\/p> <p>  the Minister of State indicated that although at the end of September the fund had committed &euro;1.8 billion, only &euro;900 million had been drawn down.  Many commitments have been made but the money has not been drawn down.  I hope the fund will not sit in the top drawer under the heading \"committed but not drawn down\".<\/p> <p>  I am pleased that the Minister of State is interpreting \"connectivity\" in its broadest sense, namely, that it is not just a matter for transport and airports but includes broadband and related issues.  We all welcome this.  Will the Minister of State consider asking the ISIF to include mobile phone connectivity?  The mobile phone signal is still inadequate.  There are many hills and mountains in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency.  I cannot get a mobile phone signal in my constituency office or village.  While we are all caught up in the broadband debate, we need to take a step back and ensure there is adequate mobile coverage in the country.

Could the Minister of State provide more detail on what the connectivity fund will invest in?  Will it be investment in private sector projects?  Is there any scope for direct public investment of the money?  This would be my preference for all the money if we are to spend it in this way.  I am all for the wider definition of connectivity to include data and energy.

Our constituencies must have similar terrain.  It is a matter for the ISIF.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has said time and again that we encourage promoters to come forward if they have a commercial proposition, regardless of whether it relates to the public or private sector.  The ISIF is open for business and we need promoters.  In our constituencies and communities, let us encourage people to come forward with propositions that may be commercially viable to be considered by the ISIF.  The Deputy correctly highlighted the difference between the amount to which the ISIF has committed and the amount that has been drawn down so far.  We should not necessarily see it as a bad thing.  The ISIF is telling promoters of projects they have the green light for a certain amount of money.  The companies or investors may not require the full amounts.  They may source funding elsewhere or need less than originally thought, or it may take a long time to draw funding down.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Paul Murphy's points, I accept the significant ideological difference on the matter.  While we have different positions on the European rules, they were ratified by the people through the fiscal stability treaty and this is how we find ourselves here.  Even if we did not, the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, and the Government have made the right judgment call in terms of ensuring sustainable economic growth.  The fund will be open to private and public options.  The ISIF will determine the areas in which the connectivity fund will be invested.  Given that the proceeds came from the sale of a State asset in the transport sector, we thought it appropriate to dedicate these funds to enhancing connectivity within and for the State.  While the ISIF will continue to develop and refine the definition, a working definition for the initial stage of deployment is \"a connectivity or those that enhance, develop or sustain the physical and virtual connectivity of Ireland as an island nation\".  The fund will be used to support connectivity projects including domestic and international connectivity.  Connectivity would be broadly defined and taken to include traditional transport projects such as ports and airports but would also take a wider definition of connectivity to include examples such as data and energy connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100700002#B00500","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1444231800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>On one point, I welcome this imaginative use of the money from the minority stake.  In European terms, connectivity has a definite and modern meaning, that is, a broadband connection.  However, it would be a pity if this fund was to be constrained in its definition of connectivity.  Where the commercial sector cannot provide a broadband service, the State must intervene, but DG Competition has required the State to map the country to show where the commercial sector is not able to provide a service.  This has delayed everything by approximately 18 months, having been delayed by the recession before that.  The result is that were it not for the joint venture between the ESB and Vodafone, which will provide industrial strength broadband in areas such those to which Deputy Sean Fleming referred and will narrow the onus on the State in its intervention, we would have been obliged to live with the situation in which one wing of the European Union states one must rush ahead and ramp up connectivity, while DG Competition insists one may not do so until one proves to it there are no state aid implications and so on.  Rather than this money lying in a drawer until ideal plans or projects are brought forward, I urge the Minister of State to give consideration to its use within the wider meaning of connectivity.  For example, the absence of broadband in primary schools is a major issue.  I cannot quite recall what was the total expenditure to ensure every second level school in the country would have quality connectivity, but certainly it is an issue in primary schools and I do not believe it would be wildly expensive.  <\/p> <p>  I urge the Minister of State to give consideration to the issue of connectivity.  There is no golden rule which states that because the proceeds came from a transport asset, they should be restricted to transport assets.  Had that been done in the disposal of the energy dimension of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, one would have restricted the money to energy projects.  As Deputy Sean Fleming has noted, there is no golden rule and a broader definition of connectivity could be helpful in terms of the economic dimension of connectivity in this other meaning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100700002#C00100","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1444231800,"counter":299,"content":"<p>May I respond on a point of clarification?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100700002#C00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1444231800,"counter":300,"content":"<p>As we will obviously not conclude the meeting at 5 p.m. as scheduled, we must change the schedule for the next meeting.

The Government intervened in the matter with the objective, if one likes, of straightening out those difficulties.  The sad reality, however, is that for one group of pensioners - those known as deferred pensioners - matters were not resolved.  In the run-up to this meeting, every Member of the Oireachtas, including the Minister of State, received another communication on behalf of this group of pensioners, many of whom had their pensions cut by as much as 50%.  There are political differences in this room as to whether the sale of the State's stake in Aer Lingus was a wise or prudent decision in the long-term.  I do not believe it was wise, and my party and the Minister of State have set out their different stalls on the issue.  To proceed with the sale while failing to address the issue of the deferred group within the pension scheme was an outrageous decision.  To then come before the joint committee to have a conversation about a connectivity fund, as useful and necessary as such a fund may be, while failing to address this issue, is absolutely off the wall.<\/p><p>If I may, I will read an e-mail I received from one of the person affected, as it delivers a message to the joint committee and, by extension, the Oireachtas.  It reads:<\/p><blockquote>How dare you vote in favour of the sale of Aer Lingus as the cost of the Aer Lingus pensioners.  How can u sit and debate what to do with the proceeds of sale of Aer Lingus when you have cut the pension of people with dementia, cancer and numerous other elderly associated illness.  This is what you have done and just because so many of them are unable to protest because they do not even have the health, energy or strength you have swooped in and robbed them of their pension. <br \/><br \/>When I left the company I was assured and guaranteed a pension and through no fault of mine, my pension has been cut, the fund wound up and at my age I now have to go out looking for work to supplement my pension as it is no longer index linked. <\/blockquote> <p>The message continues in a similar tone.  If he can - I do not believe he can - I ask the Minister of State to justify the Government's decision to leave this group of deferred pensioners out in the cold.  Perhaps he has met some of the people who were affected by the decision.  Many of these individuals had an expectation of a reasonable standard of living in their pension years and are now struggling simply to get by.  As the Minister of State will be aware from his meetings with some of the individuals in question, many of them had long service.  Aer Lingus, at various stages, encouraged and incentivised employees to leave the company and enter the category of deferred pensioners.  The real sickener for those who did so was that they have also been locked out of the discussions and negotiations that to and froed around the fund.  They were, if one likes, nobody's child or nobody's pensioner. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding all that has happened, there is something obscene about the committee discussing the spoils of the sale, regardless of what our views were on the sale, because in the meantime, back at the ranch, deferred pensioners have been shafted.  That is not a word I care for, but it is the only one that adequately describes what has been done to this group.  It appears the Government is happy to motor on and talk up a connectivity fund, how it might work, and its limitations and commercial potential.  Meanwhile, however, people with long service to a semi-state company have been left in the lurch.  Their view - and it is hard to gainsay their position and experience - is that the first thing that needs to be done is to reinstate their pension entitlement.  As the Minister of State is aware, these individuals were prepared to have their pension trimmed.  However, 50% of the pension they expected to receive has gone down the Swanee.  That is some kick in the teeth for the people concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100700002#D00400","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1444231800,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McDonald.  Nobody has a monopoly on concern for this group.  As the Deputy correctly noted, many Members of the Oireachtas have interacted with members of this group, who find themselves in an extraordinary position, one that nobody in the House wants them to be in, as a result of the failures of a pension scheme in a commercial company.  However, we must also be honest in the debate on what we are doing today.  The sale of Aer Lingus has concluded and the funds generated from it have been with the Exchequer since August.  It is now 7 October and we are discussing how these funds can be expended in the interests of the country.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to state, as part of an honest debate about any of the challenges citizens face, including deferred pensioners, how one would solve the problem, because, as I indicated in my opening statement, the fiscal rules for which people voted mean we are limited to a fiscal space of a maximum of &euro;1.5 billion in the budget.  If we were to expend any of the &euro;335 million that we are choosing to invest in the ISIF for investment, rather than creating further fiscal space, it would simply reduce the amount available to the Government, resulting in additional expenditure of &euro;1.65 billion.  It would not be new or additional money.  It is not as if we have an option of spending the &euro;335 million on any form of current expenditure.  It must be spent in the manner we have proposed.  That is the rationale behind this proposal.  <\/p> <p>  We are reliving some of the issues that were debated during the sale of Aer Lingus.

Not all of us wanted the State's shares in Aer Lingus to be sold.  For example, Senator Barrett and I had a shared point of view on the issue.  However, as the Minister of State pointed out, we are where we are.<\/p> <p>  I understand the National Pensions Reserve Fund has invested in the ISIF, which places certain pressures in terms of returns.  I note the Minister of State's comments that applicants to the fund need to demonstrate an ability to deliver a return on investment and an economic return.  I am concerned that, for the sake of argument, there is no concept of a social return.  When we speak of connectivity, we are discussing connectivity between, for example, parts of rural Ireland.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State is aware, there is an issue with crime in rural Ireland and the effect it has on older people living alone in isolated communities.  I would like some element of social return to form part of the criteria for this fund.  For example, I would like money to be ring-fenced for the development of applications which would help to make it more possible for people to live in isolated communities and which would assist in the combating of rural crime.<\/p><p> We need to develop young entrepreneurs and young IT specialists who can come forward with apps, some of which may not necessarily fulfil the commercial investment criteria required by the fund.  The Minister of State indicated that there was a significant engagement in the Irish market by 31 December 2014.  Of those 3,573 engagements, however, only 99 were completed investments.  I am a little concerned that the level of engagement with the fund and the number of competed investments is significantly mismatched.  Has the Minister of State carried out any research in respect of this matter?  Is he in a position to provide details - perhaps at a future date - as to why engagements do not result in completed investments?  Perhaps the bar has been set too high.  I would like to think that we are trying to use the fund to promote indigenous Irish investment - particularly in the IT sector - in a way that pushes connectivity to its widest possible parameters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100700002#D00800","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444231800,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Senator Hayden raises many important issues in respect of which I concur with her.  I would argue that we have other structures in place to address some of the needs that exist.  We need to continue to enhance those structures and ensure they are working.  I refer, for example, to local enterprise offices and the  Enterprise Ireland support for high-potential start-ups, which is helping many young people establish their own businesses.<\/p> <p>  I am very pleased to see the ISIF becoming involved in the provision of venture capital.  In one of the areas for which I have responsibility, namely, the international financial services sector, I am encountering the kinds of people described by the Senator - young individuals who are developing new applications and innovative technologies and who require funding.  It is not necessarily the traditional bank loan that the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland or some other entity can provide, it is actually venture capital that is needed by those to whom I refer.  By way of illustration of asset location across industry sectors, the ISIF indicates that when it is fully deployed, it can look at the area of a very substantial investment in the whole area of venture capital.  This is currently an area in which we are lagging behind other jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referred to lowering the bar.  It is a view that many of us would instinctively share.  We all want to see this money put to use to help as many people as possible.  However in wanting this money to be additional to what Government can spend on-balance sheet, we must keep it off-balance sheet.  This means the ISIF has the balancing job of constantly ensuring the fund will remain a commercial proposition that will not be included on the Government's balance sheet.<\/p> <p>  I know the Senator has a particular interest and expertise in area of social housing and social housing provision.  The ISIF is already getting involved in this area.  The Government's Social Housing Strategy 2020 sets out ambitious social housing delivery targets and references the ISIF as a potential source of capital for the sector.  The ISIF has established the activate capital lending platform and is projecting the building of 11,000 additional houses in Ireland during the next decade, which would equate to the creation of an additional supply of 11,000 Part V social housing units.  I would argue that there is social good that can be done  and many would agree that the best way to ensure social good and social dignity is to ensure people have an opportunity to get a job.  I am encouraged by the fact that we have already seen 8,362 jobs directly supported by ISIF investments.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is correct that many more people have engaged with the ISIF than have completed investments.  I will inquire with the ISIF about this matter and the fund may revert to the committee about it in the future.  The figures may relate to the fact that it is a new structure.  There are a lot of new funding structures, such as local enterprise offices, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, in place.  Many people are making contact initially to find out what is the best vehicle for them, but I will certainly probe that figure in more detail for Senator Hayden.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100700002#E00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1444231800,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I opposed this deal at all stages.  I believe it was extremely misguided on the part of the Government to sell its airline to British Airways, one of the dinosaurs of European aviation.  British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa have done nothing for European aviation.  If we had wanted to sell it &ndash; and I would not agree with the sale &ndash; EasyJet would have been a better purchaser, but the Government chose to give it to British Airways.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that the airline will be run down.  Scotland has no international services on the North Atlantic, we developed nine routes.  Aer Lingus was worth something to this country.  It had an image abroad, particularly in the United States of America, all of which has been thrown away.  Parliament was treated with contempt.  The Aer Lingus board - the members of which have all since resigned - came before this committee.  The Secretary General at the Department of Transport refused to appear because he said he was bound by the Stock Exchange's takeover rules.  Such behaviour would be an affront to any parliament.  There was a media campaign which we won in the opinion polls.<i>The Irish Times-<\/i>Ipsos-MRBI polls showed a majority of more than two to one in favour of retaining Aer Lingus.  With the Ryanair stake, the Government stake and the staff stake, an Irish airline could have been built that could have taken on British Airways in its home market and won.  But this was a conservative decision and I do not know why it was taken.  I received endorsement for Aer Lingus from the late Professor Alfred Khan, one of the leading US experts in this area, but I do not know what got into the Government.<\/p><p>I am not here to accept a consolation prize.  It is deeply ironic that, having sold the airline, the Minister of State is now trying to devise another way to increase connectivity &ndash; an oxymoron if there ever was one.  I am sorry the Minister of State has been given this inhospitable path to tread because mostly I support what he does when he comes into the Seanad.  Allowing an offshore island to sell an airline for &euro;300 million was crazy.  British Airways now has a monopoly to Heathrow and must be laughing all the way to the bank every day at the foolishness of the Irish Government to have done that deal.  So what will we do with the money?  I do not see the point in investing it in airports or sea ports.

The Government gave careful consideration to all elements of the offer relating to the sale of the State's minority shareholding in the airline to IAG in the context of the terms put forward by the latter.  The feeling was that this was the best means of securing and enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity and maintaining a vibrant and competitive air transport industry in Ireland.

The Minister of State has referred to this a number of times.  My understanding of it is that &euro;1.5 billion is 1% but the Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased that the fund is available for projects under the concept of connectivity.  It was always my understanding that connectivity would be related to the transport area as opposed to a wide range of other issues.  I listened with interest to Deputy Rabbitte's contribution on connectivity earlier in which he said the concept of connectivity is much broader at the European level.  That is news to me.  I am not dismissive of it, but it was my understanding that this fund would literally go into connectivity, that is, transport infrastructure, the possibility of upgrading certain State owned facilities and so on.  ISIF's involvement in it is inevitable and I welcome it, although I have a slight concern in relation to the requirement that the projects that will receive funding over the coming years will be required to have a commercial element.  That more or less rules out non-tolled roads and projects, such as infrastructure in and around the airports or ports, where I would have thought the money would have gone.

The definition is, as I have outlined, broader than transport projects but it will be up to ISIF to assess the commercial viability of any proposals.  Again, the proposals have to be commercial because we have to keep it off-balance sheet.  If we do not keep it off-balance sheet, it is of no additional benefit to the economy because it comes out of the limited fiscal space.<\/p> <p>  This is one sub-portfolio of a broader ISIF and the broader ISIF will be getting involved in sectors such as innovation, SMEs, infrastructure, energy, food and agriculture, venture capital, direct private equity.  <\/p> <p>  In relation to the figure of &euro;1.5 billion, that is in agreement with the European Commission.

It is based on the fact that we are entering the preventive arm of the growth and stability pact, where if one has a debt ratio in excess of 60%, one needs to move towards a 0% deficit.

I extend a warm welcome to each of them.  Their presentation will provide an opportunity for members to receive a first-hand account of the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan and the aid being provided.  We are all pleased that the protracted peace talks finally culminated in the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement in August and hope it will lead to a way forward in resolving the issues which were the cause of such terrible tragedies in South Sudan.<\/p><p>The joint committee has taken a very keen interest in what has been happening in this region.  When it visited Ethiopia three years ago, it visited a refugee camp on the border with South Sudan.  We spoke to refugees who had fled their homes as a result of the conflict in South Sudan.  At the time we were aware that there was the potential for enormous problems in South Sudan in terms of famine and hunger, but I hope some of them have been avoided.  Perhaps the delegation might update us in that regard.  When I was in Uganda last year, I met the Minister for Foreign Affairs who updated me on the situation there.  We are looking forward to the presentation because sometimes issues such as the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan go off the radar and our television screens as others arise such as what is happening in the Middle East and the migrant crisis.  We are aware that there are real problems in South Sudan.  <\/p><p>After the delegates have made their presentation, I will invite members to ask questions about the work of the ICRC in South Sudan.  We are delighted to have the delegates present.  We have not had a meeting with the ICRC for some time and look forward to further meetings to discuss its work.  It has an important role to play in areas of conflict and dealing with humanitarian issues.  <\/p><p>I remind members, delegates and those in the Visitors Gallery to switch off their mobile phones for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the recording equipment, even when left in silent mode.  I also remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <\/p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

They are further directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <\/p><p>I invite Mr. Rauchenstein to make his presentation to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015100700002#B00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444208400,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members.  <\/p> <p>  South Sudan is the newest nation in the world, having been created in 2011.  Several months after the creation of this new state, an intense power struggle between the two leaders of the country, Riek Machar on one side and President Salva Kiir Mayardit on the other, triggered a conflict that escalated rapidly along ethnic lines.  Today, 20 months after the outbreak of the recent conflict, the situation is South Sudan is dire.<\/p> <p>  As members can see from the map provided, the green area in the north east of the country is called the greater upper Nile region.  After the conflict broke out, many of the hostilities took place in this region, especially in newly inhabited areas of the greater upper Nile and Unity State.  Today, 1.6 million people are internally displaced, mainly in the green area shown on the map.  This is the priority zone for the ICRC and the place where we are most active.  Much of it is inaccessible because it is mainly rural and there are very few roads.  For six months of the year it is swampy; therefore, the transportation of goods and personnel into the area requires helicopters and aeroplanes, which makes humanitarian action very difficult.  <\/p> <p>  Six or seven ceasefire agreements have been concluded so far, but each time hostilities have continued, especially along the front lines in the areas indicated, displacing more people and further displacing those who had already sought refuge in other areas.  Four or five weeks ago a fragile peace agreement was reached, but as events of yesterday and today illustrate, it has not stopped ongoing hostilities.<\/p><p>As we speak, there are clashes in Unity State and more to the south of the country in the Equatorias.<\/p><p> The humanitarian situation is very dire.  As I told the committee, 1.6 million people are displaced in those areas and the primary concern is the food need those people have.  They are agri-pastoralists who base their livelihood on three pillars, namely, fish, planting and cattle, and all three pillars have been affected.  The cattle have been massively depleted, the planting season has not been good as displaced people cannot plant or can only randomly plant, and some have been driven away from river beds where they are normally able to fish.  It is estimated that 60% of the population of South Sudan, especially the displaced in areas that are difficult to access, are highly food insecure and are dependent on food aid as it guarantees their immediate survival.<\/p><p> During the conflict, health structures have been massively destroyed and it is estimated that more than 100 health structures in a country that already had one of the weakest health coverages worldwide have been either looted or destroyed.  Other services are equally very weak or non-existent and the most vulnerable of the displaced are in areas difficult to access, so it is a fight for life and one of the worst humanitarian situations in the world today.<\/p><p> Last year, the ICRC rapidly deployed an emergency response to what happened, especially in these difficult to access areas in the north east.  We established a food pipeline and regular food air drops to ensure the nutrition of many thousands of displaced people.  This, combined with health services to the many wounded due to the fighting, comprises the emergency response of the ICRC and is shown on the slide.  Some 1.3 million food rations have been distributed and non-food items have also been provided, such as tarpaulins for people who have been displaced.  We have always tried to combine food aid with livelihood and resilience activities to create independence for the population, where possible, and we have provided seeds, tools and fishing kits, as well as vaccinating cattle to enhance the resilience of the affected population.  We have worked together with the Ministry of Agriculture, especially in cattle vaccination.  Cattle are very important in South Sudan.  There are more cattle than inhabitants and every family has some cattle, which helps to increase the resilience of the family.  The little children get the milk of the cow and the adults slaughter it when there is no other way to feed the family.<\/p><p> Beside the emergency response, in terms of livelihood and nutrition the medical aspect is very important.  There are numerous war wounded of the conflict and, in the past 20 months, we have mobilised five mobile surgical teams to operate on war wounds on both civilians and weapon bearers in some 14 makeshift clinics in the bush.  In total, 6,500 life-saving surgeries have been carried out in that period, which is a big logistical effort because often the wounded have to be collected by helicopter or aeroplane close to the front line and brought to areas where life-saving surgeries can be carried out.  More comprehensive health care was given in hospitals and in primary health care centres.  The ICRC supported this because health services in those areas are almost non-existent and many people die of common pathologies such as malaria and cholera if not treated immediately.<\/p><p> The third pillar of the ICRC is training and many of the weapon bearers, be they soldiers or fighting for the opposition army, have been trained to better respect international humanitarian law, such as the Geneva Convention.  We established a confidential dialogue with the commanders of each party and accompanied this dialogue with recommendations on how to ensure better respect of civilians.<\/p><p> The outlook for South Sudan is not very positive.  A fragile peace agreement has been concluded but very recent developments show that even if this peace agreement holds, the process will be very long and rocky.  Regardless of that, the humanitarian needs in South Sudan will last for many years to come.  Civilians will not go back to their homes, often to their destroyed villages, and invest in rebuilding if there is not a more solid peace and if there are no positive signs that they can trust in the future.  The role of the international community is very important in the sense that parties to the conflict have to be reminded to respect the civilian population and basic rules of humanitarian law, but financial support is highly necessary.  I thank the Irish Government for its continued support to the ICRC and to humanitarian action on the whole.  I also thank the Irish Red Cross which very recently collected funds for the ICRC.  I express my thanks to the Irish people for their help in alleviating the suffering of the population in one of the worst crises of the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015100700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Franz Rauchenstein","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444208400,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Rauchenstein for the update.

South Sudan probably does not have the public awareness that it needs to have of the contributions and assistance of organisations such as the ICRC that are working there in most difficult circumstances.  Following on from the Chairman's question, the establishment of the world's newest independent state was followed two years after by a devastating civil war.

It is my understanding, and maybe the witness will expand on it, that there has been an increase in hostilities recently and there have even been attacks on humanitarian organisations while carrying out their work.  I think there may have been an attack on an ICRC compound in the past few days.  Has the international community been in any way responsive to the need for additional humanitarian assistance?  Mr. Rauchenstein mentioned the difficulty of getting humanitarian aid to the most needy people because of the difficulty in accessing the areas where they live.  Obviously, there are additional costs when the humanitarian aid has to be delivered by plane or helicopter.  Is Mr. Rauchenstein reasonably confident that the majority of the people who are in great need are getting at least some humanitarian assistance?  From the point of view of the ICRC and other organisations that carry out exceptionally good work in those particular areas, is Mr. Rauchenstein confident that there are enough resources to try to meet in some meaningful way the terrible humanitarian disaster facing so many innocent and downtrodden people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015100700002#D00600","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444208400,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Smith for this question.  It is a pertinent question because humanitarian action in South Sudan includes the activities of the ICRC and the programmes of the ICRC are among the most under-funded in the world.  Activities have to be prioritised with the means available and prioritisation means reaching out to the most vulnerable exactly in those areas where it is also the most expensive to intervene.  As the Deputy rightly points out, in some areas of Unity, which is the place where the ICRC team had to be evacuated two days ago, several tens of thousands of people are trapped in remote areas.  They cannot leave for a neighbouring country but have to stay there and they have to be assisted.  It is very difficult and very expensive.  The difficulties are multi-sectoral.  One of the difficulties is the lack of respect of the soldiers or weapon bearers for the humanitarian action.

The risk is that the humanitarian needs that need to be immediately addressed will be forgotten and that people will die of hunger or illness if this humanitarian access, which is especially challenging in the greater upper Nile, is not addressed.  In that sense, I think, the international community has to do more.  It is done also by certain actors on the ground but more has to be done.  We have always insisted that the UN peace-keeping forces go out of their bases and also deploy in opposition-held areas.  Recently there has been a long-term patrol by the UN taking place in Unity.  That was welcomed in the following weeks.  Another temporary operating base in Unity is planned, which is also something that is welcomed by the ICRC and other humanitarian actors because it might calm down the situation in those very sensitive areas.

In that regard, the ICRC has always put much effort into having the Geneva Conventions respected and those children demobilised.  South Sudan is also part of the UNICEF plan of action to demobilise child soldiers, so there is enough pressure on the parties to demobilise the child soldiers who are currently deployed.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the sexual violence against women.  Boys are also sometimes victims.  This is a very big concern.  It is very difficult to address in South Sudan as it carries a high stigma.

The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, spoke at the event.  Conor Brady is a former member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and editor of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and is a noted commentator on policing matters.  At the seminar in question, he expressed some concern over the procedure for when there is a dispute between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission or the policing authority and the force in respect of what constitutes a security matter.  Let us suppose someone in the authority requested documentation or information and the Garda Commissioner indicated that she could not provide it on the grounds that it was a security matter.  Rather than the Minister adjudicating on whether it was a security matter - I imagine members would accept that there could be reasonable grounds for that - we recommend it should be done by a member of the Judiciary, as appointed or delegated by the Chief Justice.  We believe that would represent an appropriate independent oversight mechanism to ensure that this conflict is reasonably resolved.<\/p><p>Moreover, it fits the need to ensure that the new policing authority has appropriate oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the need to address the concern with regard to the historical relationship between the Government of the day and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and fears concerning political interference in the work of the force.  If there was an independent adjudicator or a member of the Judiciary, as recommended by the Chief Justice, it would represent a more appropriate mechanism than the Office of the Minister.  It would certainly address the perception and concerns around political interference or the relationship being unhealthily close, as it has been in the past.  Indeed, that is a major part of the reason we are discussing this legislation and the reason we have reached this point today.  That is the reason these amendments have been tabled and we trust they can be accepted.  They are entirely reasonable and come from an eminent contributor, Conor Brady.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015100700002#A01200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1444233600,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also the security service for the State and the Garda Commissioner will continue to be accountable to the Minister and the Government in respect of national security.  This is generally in line with a broad consensus within the Houses that security matters should remain within the remit of the authority.  The Bill provides that in the event of a disagreement between the authority and the Garda Commissioner it would be a question for the Minister to decide whether a matter is a policing or a security matter.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn's amendments would remove the role of the Minister in determining whether a matter relates the security of the State.  The Minister has considered the amendments carefully and is of the view that given that the security of the State is a priority function of the Government, the task of deciding whether an issue relates to policing or security matters should be undertaken by the Minister in her or his capacity as a member of the Government.<\/p> <p>  Overall, it is important to bear in mind that the Bill contains a definition of what constitutes security services in order that the scope of the authority's remit can be properly delineated.  Under section 44, the authority will, in performing its functions, have regard to the importance of the functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na concerning security services.  In the circumstances, the Minister believes that the scope for disagreements between the authority and the Garda Commissioner over whether a particular item is a security or a policing matter will be rather limited.  In addition, discussions to resolve any difficulty will undoubtedly take place between the authority and the Commissioner before any issue is referred to the Minister.  Moreover, I emphasise that before making any decision on whether a policing or a security matter is involved, a Minister will be required to act impartially.<\/p> <p>  The approach adopted in the Bill is in line with similar arrangements on security matters in Northern Ireland.  For example, the PSNI Chief Constable may refer to the Secretary of State a requirement to submit a report to the Northern Ireland Policing Board if it appears to the Chief Constable that a report in compliance with the requirement would contain information which ought not to be disclosed in the interests of national security.  The Secretary of State can then modify or set aside the requirement.<\/p><p>Interestingly, where the information ought not, in the opinion of the Chief Constable, be disclosed on the basis that it is sensitive, personal information or it would, or would be likely to, prejudice proceedings which have been commenced in a court of law, the Chief Constable may refer the matter to the Minister of Justice who can modify or set aside the requirement.  The Minister, therefore, believes that the arrangements proposed in this Bill are appropriate and asks the Deputies not to press these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015100700002#A01500","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444233600,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Mac Lochlainn or other Deputies wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015100700002#B00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1444233600,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I am deeply disappointed with that response.

I would have thought an independent adjudicator, such as a senior member of the Judiciary, a person whom we would respect, put forward by the Chief Justice would fit that role.  In the Bill, we are defining what security is, so it is appropriate for a member of the Judiciary to interpret the law.  That is what we ask the Judiciary to do every day.  I cannot understand why we would not trust a senior member of the Judiciary, which is clearly independent, to look at that area.<\/p><p>The Minister has also referred to the situation in the North.  In Britain, one does not just have a police service dealing with security matters, there is a designated security agency, MI5 or MI6 which deals with those matters and is accountable to a committee in Westminster.  In relation to security matters, there is no accountability to the Oireachtas.  With all due respect, that is a poor comparison to put forward.  <\/p><p>I protest in the strongest terms about this decision.  I will press the amendment and will table it again on Report Stage.  I appeal to the Minister of State and the Minister for Justice and Equality to reflect on this amendment in the spirit it is presented.  <\/p><p>I refer to a suggestion not from Sinn F&eacute;in but from Conor Brady, a respected former Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commissioner and former editor of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, a man respected for his views on policing matters and his proposals are based on his immense experience.  I appeal again to the Minister of State to reconsider my amendments and discuss them with the Minister to see if this can be done on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015100700002#B00300","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1444233600,"counter":428,"content":"<p>Do other members wish to comment?

The proposed legislation sets the Minister as the final arbiter if there is a disagreement over whether an issue is considered a policing or security one.  The Minister could have a self-interest in this categorisation and it is illogical to consider this a safeguard of any sort.

Dr. Vicky Conway made a submission to the justice committee in respect of authority in this area.  It is appropriate and in order to do so.  Respected analysts in the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, have been mentioned.  It is important to take stock of why we are here.  We have had a number of crises and scandals in my county since the Morris tribunal.  The actions of a minority of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na members have dishonoured the service given by the overwhelming majority.  We want to have a police service that is up to modern, international standards, fully independent of political interference and fully accountable.  When the garda&iacute; get up in the morning, or the night, to commence their work, we want them to be proud that they are in a police service of the highest international standard.<\/p> <p>  If we are serious about having a policing authority that is to command the respect and confidence of the public and is to have teeth and real purpose, it must have the ability to appoint, and fire, the Garda Commissioner and deputy commissioner.  It needs the power to examine superintendents and chief superintendents and to have oversight of the promotion process in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  From the sergeant up to the Garda Commissioner, there must be an independent appointment process that is accountable and based on merit from top to bottom.  This is required to give the full confidence to the public and, just as important, to ensure the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na know they have equal opportunity of promotion, taking into consideration no other issue than their ability, service and capacity.  Wherever policing authorities have emerged, including the Northern Ireland Policing Board, this has been the case.<\/p> <p>  This is the objective of my amendments.  They cover the appointments to these positions.  It is not just the issue of the appointment of the Garda Commissioner, deputy commissioner, assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents.  It extends right down.  In my role as justice spokesperson, I have spoken to many garda&iacute; during recent years.  One of the issues they raise is the perception that people have been promoted based on whom they know, not what they know or their ability.  As part of the process of creating the policing authority, it is very important to give the authority oversight.  While the authority might not appoint the sergeant, inspector or superintendent, it should have oversight over the appointment system.  We must have a genuine new departure.

I will take my time.  The Chairman is correct.  I probably should have been more specific.  Amendments Nos. 9 to 21, inclusive, deal with the Garda Commissioner.  Amendments Nos. 23 to 35 refer to the deputy commissioner.  Amendments Nos. 37 to 62 deal with the issue of directly appointing officers from sergeant up to superintendent.  A provision in the Bill allows the Minister to hold, initiate and oversee inquiries into policing matters.  Amendments Nos. 63 to 69 give those powers to the authority.  Amendments Nos. 71 to 73 are technical amendments in line with the power being given to the authority to remove officers.<\/p> <p>  The intention of amendment No. 74 is to give the Garda Commissioner, with oversight from the authority, as opposed to the Minister, the power to appoint garda&iacute;, sergeants and inspectors.  I do not intend that the authority would be directly involved with the many sergeants, inspectors and superintendents who are promoted every year, but that it would have oversight of the process undertaken by the Garda Commissioner.  Amendment No. 77 provides that the Minister's consent is not required for the appointment of civilian Garda staff and gives oversight to the authority in this regard.  Amendment No. 78 provides that the Minister's approval for setting the priorities of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not required.  The authority should, again, be independent in its functions and should be responsible for the oversight.  Amendments Nos. 141, 142, 149, 151 and 152 relate to giving power to the authority rather than to the Garda Commissioner or the Minister.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the powers that the Government would retain under the legislation.  The Commissioner and deputy commissioner would be appointed and removed by the Government.  The Commissioner would be accountable to the Government.  Although it has been stated that the Commissioner would remain accountable to the Government on matters of national security, this is inaccurate.  The original provision on accountability would not be altered.  The Commissioner would remain accountable to the Minister for the performance of his or her functions and those of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This concerns all aspects of policing, not just national security.  Policing plans, strategies and priorities would have to be confirmed by the Government.  The Government would set security priorities and budgets.  The Minister could demand any documents of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and issue written directives to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the authority.  CCTV schemes must be approved by the Minister.  Ministerial consent would be required for GSOC to investigate the Commissioner.  The Minister would decide the number of senior rank positions and consent to the number of civilian staff, the appointment of members to the audit committee and the appointment of the CEO of the authority.  The Minister would decide what constitutes State security.  Government consent would be required for garda&iacute; to work in a police service in another state.  The Minister would authorise the delegation of the Commissioner's functions to the deputy commissioner.<\/p><p>The Minister can appoint someone to inquire into any aspect of policing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015100700002#E01200","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444233600,"counter":479,"content":"<p>We are dealing with a group of amendments which relate to the appointment or removal of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its civilian staff.

Legislation must be fully compatible with the Constitution.  No member would wish that there would be a serious constitutional question over legislation.  Article 28.2 of the Constitution specifically provides for the Executive power of the State to be exercised by or on the authority of the Government.  In the course of the drafting of this Bill, the Attorney General has advised that, as a matter of custom, practice and proper constitutional interpretation, the function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the exercise of the policing power of the State has been interpreted by the courts as a function that is exercised as part of the Executive power of the State.  While an Executive power of the Government under Article 28.2 can be delegated, the advice is that it would not be constitutionally permissible for such a delegation to amount to an abdication of the Government&rsquo;s Executive power.  Within this framework, the Attorney General has advised that any legislative proposal in the establishment of a policing authority should ultimately preserve the power of the Government to appoint or to dismiss the Garda Commissioner.  To address the relevant constitutional concerns, the advice of the Attorney General is reflected in the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.  Due to the importance of their functions, a similar approach has been adopted for Deputy Garda Commissioners.<\/p> <p>  When considering the amendments, it is also necessary to take account of the fact that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the security service for the State.  Under the Bill, the Garda Commissioner will continue to be accountable to the Government in respect of national security.  This is an approach that has a wide measure of support in the Oireachtas.  It goes without saying that national security is a key function of the Government.  In the Minister&rsquo;s view, leaving aside the clear constitutional dimension involved, the appointment of the head of the national security service should not be undertaken by a body other than the Government.  To put the matter at its simplest, in view of the functions involved, the final appointing decision must rest with the Government.  For similar reasons, the Government must continue to have the capacity to remove senior Garda members on security grounds.<\/p> <p>  While there are other issues that I might raise about the Deputies' amendments, I will concentrate on the functions that are being conferred on the policing authority by the Bill in respect of the appointment and removal of Garda personnel.<\/p> <p>  Under the Bill, the authority will have a leading role in a large body of Garda appointments.  This will operate, in particular, at the highest levels of the Garda organisation and it will also have general functions in the areas of Garda appointments and promotions.  With regard to the Garda Commissioner, or a Deputy Commissioner, all future appointments to these posts will be made solely on the basis of a nomination made by the authority, following an open selection process undertaken by the Public Appointments Service.  In exceptional circumstances where the Government is unable for significant reasons to accept a nomination made by the authority, it will have to state its reasons.  When such a situation occurs, the Government will be obliged to ask the authority to nominate another person for the position.  From an international perspective, it is the general practice that governments either make or must approve top-level police appointments.  For example, while the Police Service of Northern Ireland chief constable is appointed by the Northern Ireland Policing Board, the appointment must be approved by the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice.  Similar arrangements are also in place in Scotland, which has a recently established police authority.<\/p> <p>  In the case of Garda personnel between the ranks from superintendent to assistant commissioner, the Bill provides that all the appointments will be made directly by the authority.  Additionally, the authority will appoint persons to positions in the Garda civilian staff which are equivalent to or above the rank of chief superintendent.  With regard to dismissals, and in line with the constitutional and security principles I have already outlined, the Garda Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner will be removed by the Government.  At the same time, the authority will have the power to recommend to the Government that a Garda Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner be removed for policing reasons.  While the Government will not be obliged to adopt such a recommendation, it is difficult to envisage circumstances in which it would not do so.<\/p> <p>  Dismissals of persons between the ranks of superintendent to assistant commissioner for policing reasons will be undertaken by the authority.   It will also be able to suspend a person from duty in advance of a removal decision.  While the Deputies&rsquo; amendments go beyond the appointment and dismissal of Garda personnel, it is important to make clear that the overall approach adopted by the Government to the Bill is that relevant functions should be transferred from the Government and the Minister to the authority where this is permissible and appropriate.<\/p> <p>  However, the transfer process has its limitations and it has to be undertaken against the general constitutional and policy backgrounds which I have highlighted.  Within these frameworks, for example, the Minister cannot, for substantial legal and policy reasons, accept a situation, as proposed in these amendments, where the Minister of the day would not be involved in determining the numbers of persons to be appointed to senior Garda ranks.<\/p> <p>  Overall, the Minister appreciates the approach of the Deputies in their amendments is to remove what they perceive to be a system in which key elements could be the subject of political considerations.  However, she believes the significant reforms and measures provided for in the Bill are fully adequate to address any concerns they might reasonably have and, in particular, substantial powers are being conferred on the new authority which will be independent in the exercise of its functions.<\/p> <p>  The Bill&rsquo;s proposals for the establishment of the independent policing authority will play a vital role in ensuring public confidence will be maintained in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the essential services it provides.<\/p><p>Moreover, as I have indicated, they have been developed to address very important constitutional and policy requirements that arise within both the policing and security areas.  Unfortunately, for reasons I have given, the amendments do not meet these requirements.  We are not in a position to accept them so, accordingly, on behalf of the Minister, I would ask the Deputies not to press the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015100700002#F00400","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444233600,"counter":483,"content":"<p>This is an issue on which our committee did a good deal of work.  We went to the North and to Scotland to examine their models and made recommendations.  One of the issues we engaged with was separating policing from security responsibilities but what has come to pass now is that because An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is unique in the developed world in that its members retain responsibility over policing and security matters, it has led to a situation where, essentially, the Government still retains control policing elements because of the security aspect.<\/p> <p>  The Minster referred to Article 282.  That article states: \"The Executive power of the State shall, subject to the provisions of this Constitution, be exercised by or on the authority of the Government\".  I have to accept that the Minister has been advised by the Attorney General but the interpretation taken is very broad.  There is little case law to aid the interpretation.  It is unclear.  It is a big call to make because regardless of whether we have an independent policing authority, if the Minister interprets Article 28.2, as has been done, as meaning the Minister has to retain control over all security matters in the interests of the State, and because we have a police service that is responsible for policing and security, all policing elements, therefore, are still controlled by Government.  Ultimately, the policing authority has to refer.  That is a big call to make.  The Attorney General is in place because of her considerable legal expertise but there are other people with considerable legal expertise who would take a very different view.  We have an area of conflict here, which is profound.  The Minister has made a call but I believe it needs much more debate, such is the profound nature of the call.<\/p> <p>  In our hearings we debated whether we should have a separate security and policing apparatus in this State that would be accountable to these Houses, as is the case with many security services.  The United States and British security services are accountable to their respective Houses of Parliament.  The response given is very serious in terms of its implications and if the Minister's call is that he is accepting the advice of the Attorney General, and on that basis Article 28.2, it is open to challenge.<\/p> <p>  We will not get agreement on this today but I ask the Minister to take other legal opinions into consideration or at least take legal submissions and then put those legal submissions to the Attorney General.  We will take Report Stage in the near future.  I have another opinion before me from a person I respect in these matters and who has a very different interpretation.  I would be happy to submit that to the Minister, and for the Minister to ask the Attorney General to respond to the issues raised.  I respect the constitutional core role of the Attorney General and the advice that person gives to the Government of the day but these matters are so serious they deserve more deliberation by the Minister, with the Attorney General, based on the submissions that might be received.  <\/p> <p>  I will press my amendments, and I know I will not get agreement on them, but I do not accept the analysis that has been given to the Minister.  It is a serious interpretation to take because it means, essentially, that this is not an independent policing authority because we have a police service that has responsibility for security and policing matters, and that is a serious matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015100700002#G00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1444233600,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Deputy Wallace indicated on these amendments as well.

Given the way we set up An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this State, which reflected times past, we cannot take An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be an independent policing service that is accountable to an independent policing mechanism.  The Minister drew comparisons with Britain and the North but those comparisons are not correct because in Britain, MI5 and MI5 are accountable, as are police constabularies in different regions.  That lends itself to the situation in the North also.  There is a separate policing and security apparatus in the United States, which is accountable also.  Our policing service will not be independently accountable because it also has responsibility for security.  That is the only interpretation I can take if the Attorney General and the Minister continue to take this position.

I have, for example, already drawn the attention of Deputies to the solemn declaration under section 16 of the principal Act which is made by each and every member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before a peace commissioner.  That of itself is a clear declaration of an intention to act and behave ethically.  In addition, the disciplinary process in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a formalised process grounded in regulations.  Under those regulations, less serious actions such as untidiness on duty, more serious actions such as discourtesy to a member of the public and neglect of duty, and extremely serious actions such as criminal activity are all disciplinary matters.<\/p> <p>  On amendment No. 169, section 57 amends section 123 of the principal Act to require the Minister to consult the authority in addition to consulting the Garda Commissioner, GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate prior to making disciplinary regulations.  This provision is particularly necessary in the context of the power of the authority to remove certain senior members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under section 10.  Section 57 also deletes the provision whereby failure to comply with the code of ethics would result in disciplinary action.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is satisfied that it is unnecessary to legislate to make a code of ethics binding and to attach a disciplinary consequence to a failure to comply with the provisions of such a code.  Under the current disciplinary arrangements, the behaviour that would constitute such a failure is in any event already liable to the disciplinary process.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is satisfied that the provisions at section 16 strike the right balance in the context of the existing legislative provisions relating to the behaviour of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and she would therefore ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015100700002#K03300","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1444233600,"counter":664,"content":"<p>If the Minister's argument were correct, then the 2005 Act was wrong in asking that the code of ethics be established by regulation.

The amendments cover the setting of priorities for policing in the State, the approval of a three-yearly strategy statement for the Garda organisation and the adoption of the annual Garda policing plan.  I do not propose to enter into a detailed discussion of what is involved in each of these areas, but it will be clear, on any analysis, that what we are talking about is a set of very significant functions.  In this regard, Deputies will appreciate, in particular, that the setting of priorities for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a matter of the highest importance in determining how the force will operate in carrying out its functions throughout the country.  These priorities, in turn, feed into the Garda strategy statements and annual policing plans, which also play a vital role in directing the Garda.  Furthermore, they are pivotal in terms of the allocation of financial and other resources throughout the Garda organisation.<\/p> <p>  In view of the importance of the functions involved, and on the basis of the legal advice provided by the Attorney General, the Minister is satisfied that it would not be appropriate for the authority to take the final decisions on the matters covered by the Deputy&rsquo;s amendments.  For that reason, the Bill provides that the areas in question will be subject to a co-decision procedure with the authority which will involve approval being given by the Minister.  In the circumstances, the Minister considers that the approach in the Bill is the correct one.  It is also our understanding that similar arrangements apply in other jurisdictions, including in Northern Ireland and Scotland.  Therefore, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, I am not in a position, to accept these amendments and I would ask the Deputy not to press them.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 88 is a Government amendment, the purpose of which is to make statutory provision for the Garda Commissioner to provide the authority with a strategy statement for policing services for the following three years.  This amendment is necessary because the strategy statement for 2016 to 2018 is currently under preparation.  The requirement is that a new strategy statement be provided within six months of the establishment day of the authority and thereafter every three years from the date of the previous statement.<\/p> <p>  The authority will be independent and have a significant body of specific functions, which will include: nominating persons for appointment by the Garda Commissioner to the posts of Garda Commissioner and deputy commissioner; appointments of persons to the ranks of superintendent, chief superintendent and assistant commissioner and their removal for reasons relating to policing services; appointing persons to senior positions within the Garda civilian staff; determining, with the agreement of the Minister, Garda priorities relating to policing services; approving, with the agreement of the Minister, the three-yearly Garda strategy statement; approving, with the agreement of the Minister, the annual Garda policing plan; establishing a Garda code of ethics; promoting and supporting the continual improvement of policing in the State; and exercising the current functions of the Minister regarding joint policing committees, involving local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015100700002#L00900","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1444233600,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I also ask the Minister of State to stay focused on the amendments in question.

I had the privilege of chairing one myself for three years when they were originally piloted and introduced under the late Brian Lenihan.  JPCs now exist in each local authority area and they provide a forum for discussion of policing, safety and quality of life measures in our communities.  They operate under guidelines issued by the Minister for Justice and Equality, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p> <p>  The Bill will transfer the Minister's responsibility for the guidelines to the authority, while retaining a consultative role for the Minister.<\/p><p>Arising from a wide-ranging review process which commenced in 2012, and taking into account the establishment of new local government arrangements, revised guidelines for the operation of JPCs were issued in August 2014.  The revised guidelines emphasise the need for collaborative approaches between all stakeholders to address local issues.  Members of the Oireachtas, of course, have an involvement.  The guidelines also underline the need for enhanced communication between JPCs, which have a strategic co-ordinating role, and the full range of local and community-based fora which can contribute to the enhancement of community safety and support effective policing responses.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 102 would remove the requirement in section 29 of the Bill for the authority to consult with the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government before issuing guidelines concerning the establishment and maintenance of joint policing committees.  To ensure proper co-ordination and avoid duplication of effort it is essential that JPCs align their work with the recently established local authority arrangements and, therefore, the removal of the requirement to consult with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government would be a retrograde step.  The effect of the amendment would be to allow the authority to issue or amend guidelines in an arbitrary manner and with no regard for any concerns arising from the remits of either of the Ministers involved.<\/p><p> This amendment would, in the Minister&rsquo;s opinion, undermine the partnership principle that underpins the approach to joint policing committees and, accordingly, the Minister cannot accept it.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 103 would allow each joint policing committee to elect its chairperson from among all of its members rather than the chairperson being nominated by the local authority elected members of the JPC.  The revision of the present JPC operating guidelines in 2014 was guided by extensive consultations with a broad range of stakeholders, and revising the procedures for the election of the chairperson along the lines suggested in the amendment did not emerge during the consultations as a key concern for those involved.<\/p><p> The essential point is that JPCs are established to enhance communication and co-operation on policing and related local authority functions in each local authority area, and therefore the Minister considers it appropriate that the chairperson should continue to be drawn from the democratically elected members for those communities and local authority areas and, within the political cycle, ultimately be accountable to the local communities for which they be the chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015100700002#M05300","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444233600,"counter":769,"content":"<p>One of the main functions and principles of the policing authorities that have been established around the world is to engage the citizenry a great deal more in policing matters.

According to the petitioner his research indicates that chemicals and bacteria are leaking into the householder's water supply.  The petitioner was before the committee on 25 March 2015, at which meeting it was agreed to write to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, seeking the implementation of sections 9(5)(ii), 9(5)(iii) and 9(6)(4) of the draft code of practice as produced by the National Standards Authority of Ireland and the Department's plans to introduce regulations or legislation to address properties which are possibly already affected by the issue.<\/p><p>It was also agreed at that time to invite representatives of the National Standards Authority of Ireland and officials from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to appear before the joint committee in public session.<\/p><p>Our considerations centre on the establishment of regulations concerning the use of single check non-return valves; whether regulation of the plumbing sector in Ireland exists; whether all EU directives standards regulations have been transposed; and the standards and regulations that exist in Ireland and the EU in regard to ensuring there is no back-flow contamination.  Any related health concerns as identified by the petitioner will be addressed at a future meeting when we will have officials from relevant Departments to address them.  <\/p><p>Before commencing, I must inform you that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, you are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence you give to this committee.

While there are some differences in the character of each of these documents they are collectively referred to as &lsquo;standards&rsquo; for the purposes of today's hearing.<\/p> <p>  Standards are generally voluntary but can be made legally binding when referenced as mandatory by legislation.  Of the 1,500 or so national, European and international standards published annually by NSAI an increasing number are used to support legislation by providing the user with means of demonstrating compliance with legal requirements through using the standard.  This type of reference establishes the standard as a preferred route of compliance without it becoming mandatory.<\/p> <p>  In the absence of any legal reference, standards remain voluntary to be used by businesses as a means of demonstrating state-of-the-art or best practice.<\/p> <p>  NSAI develops standards through its network of consultative committees.  Committee members are drawn from industry, government and societal interest groups to work on matters of common interest.  It is NSAI's role to act as a facilitator for that process.<\/p> <p>  There are currently two related consultative committees dealing with domestic heating and plumbing.  These are the Building Services Consultative Committee, and the Water Supply Standards Consultative Committee.  The Building Services Consultative Committee is dealing with the code of practice for domestic hot water and heating, and the Water Supply Standards Consultative Committee is dealing with a similar code of practice for cold water systems.<\/p> <p>  These committees currently comprise representatives from policy makers-regulators, manufacturers, trade associations, local authorities, academia, insurers, private water suppliers, consultants and installers.  The two committees liaise through nominated members to ensure there is no duplication or overlap between their work and the necessary cross-referencing can take place.<\/p><p>There are normally five stages in the standards development process: identifying the needs and benefits of a standard; defining the scope, i.e. identifying the technical, environmental or safety specifications which need to be set; consultation with a view to achieving a consensus; a process of public inquiry; and finally, the publication of the finished standard.  <\/p><p> As a member of the European and international standards organisations, NSAI can only undertake national standardisation work in the absence of suitable standards being published by those organisations.  Furthermore, in the interests of global and EU trade, NSAI is obliged to adopt such European or international standards as national standards and ensure any existing national publications are compatible with their content.<\/p><p> In all European member states, the regulation of supply of drinking water and the quality of drinking water are matters for the appropriate agencies and bodies charged with those responsibilities.  It is a well recognised fundamental design principle when designing, installing or maintaining water supply systems that potable water installations must be protected from contamination, such as backflow from central heating systems, which is the issue in question today.<\/p><p> Several Irish standards, developed through the European system, give guidance on this issue.  They include IS EN 806, which is concerned with the specifications for installation inside buildings conveying water for human consumption.  That standard, broken into five parts, was developed from 2000 to 2012.  Another standard, IS EN 12828, from 2012, with an annex in 2014, addresses heating systems in buildings and the design of water-based heating systems.  A further standard, IS EN 1717, from 2000, with a national annex published in 2011, deals with protection against pollution of potable water in water installations and the general requirements of devices to prevent pollution by backflow.<\/p><p> Both IS EN 12828 and IS EN 806, on the design of water and central heating systems, implicitly recognise that drinking water supplies can become contaminated by backflow, and the standards specify methods for addressing these risks.  Part 2 of IS EN 806 recognises the existence of national or local regulations and requirements and the need to prevent the contamination of water. <\/p><p> The national annex, NA, to IS EN 1717 - I am sorry for quoting all these numbers, but they are important - provides guidance regarding backflow prevention in Ireland, taking account of the low-pressure ventilated mains water systems.  The guidance notes the practice of having an unrestricted air gap to protect the incoming water supply against backflow, unless otherwise expressly permitted in writing by the appropriate responsible water authority.  In other cases it recommends that a risk assessment be carried out in accordance with the standard.<\/p><p> In 2006 the need for an Irish code of practice for plumbers was identified to complement the existing European standards, with the project beginning in earnest in 2008.  This project was aimed at developing a best practice guide for use by the trade, by drawing together the references to relevant standards with useful explanations in an easily readable form.  The project was supported by key stakeholders including the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, which committed funds to support the necessary work.   A first-draft code of practice was published in 2010 for public comment.  This consultation was met with great interest, resulting in the submission of more than 200 observations to NSAI.  The public inquiry draft in 2010 took account of relevant local authority by-laws available at that time.  Those local authorities, in general, required that water systems contain an adequate device or devices to prevent the occurrence of backflow.  The draft code of practice drew together these requirements as best practice.<\/p><p> Following the 2010 public inquiry and further consideration, it was decided to split the very large draft standard into two parts to enable work to proceed more efficiently.  These two parts are titled SR 50-1, for domestic hot water and heating, and SR 50-3, for domestic plumbing for cold water systems.<\/p><p> Due to the level of interest from the various groups involved, the prioritisation of other critical projects and the availability of key stakeholder input and internal resources, work on the project was put on hold until being reactivated earlier this year.  The most recent review has identified a need for further work to address technical developments, changes in building practices, availability of updated European standards and related matters raised by harmonised standards under the EU construction products regulation.  Irish Water, which was established in the interim, is also now engaged as a key stakeholder.  The projects are progressing well, and it is expected that drafts of both documents will be issued for public inquiry during 2016. <\/p><p> As previously stated, standards are voluntary documents unless referenced as mandatory or as conferring a presumption of compliance through legislation.  When the code of practice documents are published by NSAI, the relevant authorities may choose to reference them in whatever way they consider appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015100700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444230000,"counter":786,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to assist in its consideration of issues raised in the petition.  I am the senior technical adviser in the architecture and building standards section of the Department.  I am accompanied by my colleagues Eamonn Smyth, engineering adviser, and Martin Vaughan, assistant principal.<\/p> <p>  The subject before the committee is technical in nature and the Department is happy to outline its understanding of the relevant product standards, technical guidelines and regulatory controls at home and abroad that inform consideration of this matter.  I note that the National Standards Authority of Ireland, from which we have just heard, has also accepted the committee&rsquo;s invitation, and I welcome its participation in the discussion.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that with effect from 1 January 2014, Irish Water assumed statutory responsibility for public water services under the Water Service Acts.  Irish Water is now the designated national authority with responsibility for water services, and the quality and integrity of the water supply in general comes within the remit of Irish Water.  As such, any questions from committee members on this aspect of the matter must be directed to Irish Water.  <\/p> <p>  It might be helpful to summarise the existing and proposed regulatory arrangements relevant to the matters raised in this petition.  The petitioner&rsquo;s issue relates to the installation of a sealed primary heating circuit as part of an indirect vented hot water system.  His concerns focus on the method of filling the sealed circuit with water and the potential for backflow contamination.  The sealed primary heating circuit is the pipework that goes from the boiler to a coil in the hot water cylinder.  While sealed circuits have existed for some time in the industry and are used in many jurisdictions across Europe, they are relatively new in Ireland.  Traditionally, hot water systems in Ireland had vented primary heating circuits, which effectively meant there was a dedicated feed and expansion cistern for the boiler in the attic, in addition to the main cold water storage tank.  For a sealed primary heating circuit, the feed and expansion cistern for the boiler are redundant. The sealed system is fitted with an expansion vessel to accommodate the increased volumes.  In terms of supplying a feed to fill this circuit, a temporary connection is typically made to the mains water supply.<\/p> <p>  British Standards have dealt with these systems for some time.  The current British standard is BS 8558, \"Guide to the design, installation, testing and  maintenance of services supplying water for domestic use within buildings and their curtilages.\"  That is complementary guidance to the European suite, EN 806.  This standard outlines the proper procedures for sealed circuits.  It sets out how the connection to the mains water supply may be made by providing a servicing valve, a temporary connecting pipe and an appropriate backflow prevention device.<\/p> <p>  This arrangement presents some risk to the mains supply, and the petitioner rightly refers to this.  Normally, the pressure in a primary heating circuit is less than that of the mains supply pipe.<\/p><p>However, if a fault occurs in a pressure relief valve in the system for example, the pressure in the circuit could rise above the pressure in the mains.  If the servicing valve is left in the open position and the backflow prevention device fails, there is potential for backflow of the fluid in the heating circuit into the mains supply.  This has the potential to cause contamination of the mains supply.  For the avoidance of such backflow and contamination, the temporary connecting pipe must be completely disconnected from the outlet of the backflow device and the connection with the primary circuit after the completion of filling or periodic replenishing.  BS 8558 also provides guidance on the prevention of stagnation associated with this temporary connection.<\/p><p> The petitioner has also raised the issue of the type of backflow devices suitable for these installations.  The standard for backflow prevention devices is IS EN 1717.  This standard deals with the means to be used to prevent the pollution of potable water inside premises and the general requirements of protection devices to avoid pollution by backflow.<\/p><p> The national annex to EN 1717 recommends carrying out a risk assessment if using backflow prevention valves to ensure fitness for purpose.  It also advises that permission should be sought from the water services authority.  Any backflow protection device should be fit for purpose, manufactured in accordance with the relevant product standards and installed by an experienced plumber or technician.  The Registered Gas Installers of Ireland, RGII, includes the above guidance regarding the temporary connection to sealed heating circuits in its installation guides for gas heating systems.  The oil fired heating systems associations, such as OFTEC, provide comparable guidance, and boiler manufacturers highlight this issue and provide explicit installation rules in their manuals.<\/p><p> The relevant legislation dealing with this aspect of water supply is the Water Services Act 2007.  Section 54 provides that the owner of a premises shall ensure the internal distribution system of a premises is sufficient to ensure, and maintained in such condition as to ensure, water intended for human consumption meets prescribed quality requirements at the tap or taps used for such purposes.  Irish Water has powers to issue notices to direct the owner of a premises to undertake remedial action where there is an issue with the quality of the water.<\/p><p> The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, has been developing an Irish code of practice for building services - domestic plumbing and heating.  As Mr. Buckley explained, this has been put out for public consultation and is being reviewed.  The NSAI committees will review and finalise the proposed code of practice for heating systems, hot water systems, cold water systems and, importantly, their interlinkages in the context of the suite of European standards known as EN 806.  This will provide Ireland for the first time with a national standard for plumbing and heating.  The Department is very supportive of this work by NSAI.  The outcome of the work on the code of practice will inform the Department&rsquo;s consideration of any further policy or regulatory proposals that may be necessary in this area.<\/p><p> That completes my overview of the existing and proposed regulatory arrangements relevant to the committee&rsquo;s consideration of this petition.  My colleagues and I look forward to participating further in the discussion or answering any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015100700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444230000,"counter":788,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, I have to leave at 5 p.m. to deal with amendments to legislation in another committee and one of my colleagues will take over.

In more recent years, I have seen windmills and heat pumps used.  Does the type of system used for central heating matter?  Most of the central heating systems heat water in the pipes.  I have heard there is more and more emphasis on insulating houses so that we now have warmer houses than we did 20 or 30 years ago.  No matter what system is used, it needs some way to trigger heating the water in the pipes.  In recent years, I have seen solar panels being used.  Is any differentiation made regarding how the water is heated?  Is it still the case that if one is unsure about the water, one boils it?

The risk of contamination we are speaking about is various chemicals and there is no guarantee that boiling the water would alleviate this problem were it to exist.  To take the broader point on the huge range of heating systems, much technology is involved in every aspect of a modern house and, as the Deputy rightly said, insulation has changed.  In the world of standards, we are working very hard at European level and being part of the big European system gives Ireland an advantage with regard to keeping up with all of the changing technologies and having proper standards reflecting the various products and how they are applied.  Approximately 600 or 700 standards are related to the construction products regulation alone, never mind the application of these.  It is tricky to keep these up to date all of the time.  We can do this as members of the EU.<\/p> <p>  The standards are available.  Many of them are adopted and referenced in the building regulations, which makes them legally binding, to answer the earlier question.  If a deficiency is found, it can be addressed immediately.  Even if standards are not directly referenced in the building regulations, they are an indication of best practice.  If a purchaser has a dispute with a developer and the situation is unclear, the courts in Ireland, as elsewhere, will reference the standards as an indication of best practice.  If an installer works in a different way, the onus is very much on him or her to prove the system is safe.  The standards are very valuable in this respect.<\/p> <p>  Even with the increasing sophistication and variations of systems, one must also look at the skills set and training of the people doing the insulation.  This is why bit by bit all of the traditional trades are coming more and more under a structure.  For a number of years, we have had very precise control systems for gas and electricity through the Register of Gas Installers of Ireland and other bodies.  This is very accurately regulated and works well.  We are not yet at this point for other trades, such as plumbing, which is where the standard reference, which began in 2010, comes into its own.  It is the first attempt to pull together all of this technology to have a guidance base for the plumbing profession and apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>  It is great to have the support of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and SEAI, and we work very closely on this.  The industry itself must also come along and must see the need to do this.  Plumbing is a traditional trade, perhaps passed on from father to son.  Society, in general, is trying to balance the need for a greater level of sophistication and controls with keeping the existing infrastructure in place and finding the right timing for this.  These are all complex interrelated matters and any number of technical risks are involved.  We do a lot of work on radon control, for example, which is an issue, insulation systems, as the Deputy mentioned, and water quality, where we have the issues raised in the petition.  There are also concerns about legionnaires' disease and other impurities that can happen in the water system.  All of these are covered by various aspects, and the task at hand is to get a balance between all of these.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015100700002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1444230000,"counter":798,"content":"<p>The idea of zonal heating is something I have heard about only recently, but I am sure it has been around for ages.

All of that needs to be taken together.<\/p> <p>  We in the NSAI and our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government would be of the view that the time has now come to have that reference standard and to feed it into the training systems, the apprentice systems and so on.  As mentioned earlier, that standard is being actively worked on, and we hope to have significant progress on it with hopefully everybody involved.  The committee's efforts might encourage the industry stakeholders to become involved in that work so that we can finalise a high-quality document very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015100700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1444230000,"counter":805,"content":"<p>I welcome that, but I know that sometimes it is difficult to get agreement.  Our job is to ensure that the best standard is set out for all of this.  Regardless of whether there is agreement, we should encourage the NSAI and others to try to get that as quickly as possible before we go through another large phase of house building.<\/p> <p>  Even though I am not that old, I remember when Qual-PEX was not the standard material for domestic use in Ireland.  Qual-PEX is a flexible pipe made of plastic.  Previously all domestic pipes were of copper.  Copper is dearer and not as pliable and is in short supply worldwide.  There are many standards - asbestos was a standard years ago.  Lead is still a standard because nobody has decided to remove lead from thousands of houses in this city.<\/p> <p>  There was reference to Irish Water having the right to instruct householders to fix problems in their houses relating to the water system.  I know of tens of thousands of houses in this city that have within them - not outside, which is the responsibility of the city council or Irish Water - a health hazard as we speak, never mind what the petitioner has argued in terms of the lead within their system, because they are going through lead piping that can be 50 or 60 years old.<\/p> <p>  The standard we set in Ireland, as we have done previously, is often out step with the European standard.  Sometimes they are catching up with us and sometimes we are catching up with them.  I have talked to electricians who have said that the standard in Ireland is higher than in many other European countries.  I do not know; I am not an electrician.  All I want to know is that Ireland has a set standard to ensure the greatest protection for the ordinary Joe or Josephine who buys or rents a house to ensure that the water they are getting in their tap is fit for use.  The quicker that is done, the better.<\/p> <p>  If the NSAI introduces a standard now, would it be retrospective?  That may be a question for the Minister.  If it is retrospective, it means a retrofit.  So we are setting new standards for insulation.  The Government is giving grants for retrofit.<\/p> <p>  I have one more question for the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015100700002#H00400","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1444230000,"counter":806,"content":"<p>I will let the Deputy back in, but first we might get a response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015100700002#H00500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444230000,"counter":807,"content":"<p>To be clear, there are standards now.  There are many standards for all those different aspects of the system and the insulation.  One might argue that at times there are too many standards.  The trick is to provide guidance to navigate around the different systems and know what is appropriate in different areas.  So the question of retrofit does not apply here because the standards exist.<\/p> <p>  It is possible to say what best practice is, and nobody would disagree on what it is.  The problem is where best practice has not been followed.  So retrofit is appropriate in individual developments where it is found that the workmanship was not up to scratch.<\/p><p>We are faced with all of these horrendous issues at the moment - for example, whether developers are still available in order to challenge and chase them for unsafe workmanship?  The standard provides the reference point.  The technical standard has not dramatically changed over time and there has been steady progression.

To date, we have no reports on the instance of failures of double-check or single-check valves.  I will put the statistics to one side and say that all mechanical devices or fittings are liable to fail at any time.  In this situation the double-check valve has the job of preventing  backflow.  The real reduction in risk comes from completely disconnecting the temporary pipe.  It is a safety mechanism that works by only filling the system at the beginning and  replenishes for one reason or another.  It is the primary defence mechanism.  One does not leave the pipe permanently connected to the mains.<\/p> <p>   In terms of standards and retrospective application, I wish to state that regulations do not apply retrospectively and, therefore, it would not be a matter for a retrofit to this standard.  Concerned homeowners may apply best practice in this situation.  As Mr. Buckley has outlined, best practice is available in many sources.  It is very explicit, gives good advice on what to do and is reasonably inexpensive and simple for people to carry out, where necessary.  In terms of the future, once the SR 50 is finalised and published then the Department, comprised of the various sections which range between water services and building regulations and Irish Water, will consider the policies and legislative requirements in this area in order to implement SR 50.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a final general point about home building.  The building regulations cover a large part of the home building functional requirements.  The building control legislation that came into force recently has created a very controlled system whereby the design is signed off by a competent person.  The building process is also inspected on a regular basis by an assigned certifier that is competent in the area.  At the end of the process the builder and the assigned certifier sign off, thus certifying that the project complies with the building regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015100700002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary"},{"type":"speech","time":1444230000,"counter":810,"content":"<p>One of the problems that we have identified, and it is an issue that has been accepted by Ms Neary, is that this can become a problem unless somebody has an understanding that it is a problem or unless somebody inspects it.  I refer to when people leave the temporary connection in place.  I could not tell by looking at the pipework in my house whether the connection worked or not.  I would know if there was a problem and would presume that I could solve it by switching off the water but beyond that my first port of call would be to telephone a plumber.  We all agree that trades that work in this sector need regulation.  One must have faith in the inspection team and one presumes  that a qualified plumber will be able to fix the problem.  Unfortunately, many homes in Ireland were built during a period when there was lax adherence to established standards and that is what happened with Priory Hall, Longboat Quay and other buildings.<\/p> <p>  There is no inspection regime or audit in place.  This week I asked the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste to conduct an audit to identify the problems.  The State may not have the wherewithal to fix the buildings but at least the owner or tenant would have some idea where a problem stems from and thus take remedial action.  People will take a chance and will survive even though they know there may be a problem.  I urge anybody who is aware of problems with their water systems to immediately get them checked out.  I have seen black water come out of radiators in my house.  I do not know what type of stomach aches or whatever would result if that got into a public water system but I am sure it would not be good.<\/p> <p>  Stagnant water in immersions is another problem that was raised by the petitioner.  Stagnant water can result and remain in the water system if the double valve or backflow system fails  Not everybody clears or flushes out their heating system on a regular basis which means that one could have a contaminant in a water system for a while.  <\/p> <p>  The witnesses have identified a potential problem in their presentations.  We have learned that regulation needs to be put in place as soon as possible.  I have put a lot of work on the witnesses and they have competing demands.  The water system is something that each person in a household avails of.  It is for public health reasons, rather than safety reasons, that we should put systems in place that will give people the necessary assurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015100700002#J00300","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444230000,"counter":811,"content":"<p>Mr. Smyth will deal with the stagnation issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015100700002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444230000,"counter":812,"content":"<p>With regard to stagnation in the particular system that the petition showed, it is connected from the actual house storage.

The system should not be connected like that at all, and that is in the event there is backflow.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the stagnation issue, it is always recommended that any connection is done using a very short length of pipe so there is no amount of water within it that would stagnate.  Stagnant water when heated can lead to stomach aches.  The petitioner raised the issue of stagnant water occurring in the hotpress where the temperature might rise above 20&deg; Celsius and start to grow Legionella bacteria, and I agree that is always possible.  As I said to Deputy Kitt, once such water goes into the system it will be heated to above 60&deg; Celsius thus killing Legionella within seconds.  In most cases there is no risk.  I agree with the petitioner that such a situation should not happen.  It is a short way of feeding the system which should be fed from a separate tank and not from the domestic supply at all.

He suggested that with the dead-leg part, about which we talked earlier, in the hot tank, it could potentially be more than 300,000 houses.  I do not know because, as I said, I am not an expect.  I would have presumed that if somebody flagged a potential issue - the argument is the same with others - somebody needs to do an audit by checking a number of the estates the petitioner has spoken about in his letters to the committee to see whether it is an issue and then one would have some idea.  The petitioner made the point that there is a number of estates in an area in Meath that had the problems identified by him.  I presume that is where he works or worked, and that he came across shoddy workmanship.  That is often the way one identifies the likes of a fire hazard or, in this case, a potential health hazard.  If that is the case, then somebody needs to conduct an audit of those houses and also flag to other plumbers that if they identify this problem when doing work on heating systems throughout the country, they should fix it but refer it to the authorities so that we can audit the rest of the estates concerned.  If a plumber walks into a house in an estate in County Kildare and identifies that nobody has been near the heating system since it was built but there is a problem, that person should inform somebody that there may be a problem in the estate, especially if, potentially, it is of a public health nature.  <\/p> <p>  As I said in regard to other matters, some of it would involve an audit and some of it would involve inspections.  Since the inspections we are talking about are for future builds, somebody somewhere has to look at the existing houses otherwise one will end up with what we have in Dublin with the lead pipes that I mentioned.  The house that I moved out of had lead pipes which had swollen to three times the size.  That was the nature of all of the Dublin City Council houses.  I do not know whether it was a major health hazard but, as far as I know, lead in water is a health hazard.  Maybe drinking that water is why I am a bit mad.  It is something that Irish Water has identified in its documentation to date.  It has not come up with a solution other than that the householder will fix that part.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015100700002#L01300","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444230000,"counter":850,"content":"<p>There is a strategy for lead piping in plumbing systems and that is being implemented.

Before going directly to members for questions, I ask the Minister to establish the position on the New Zealand guidance in setting out output based performance targets which, we understand, have been the basis for discussion between the Department and staff of the committee for a number of months.  I am referring to the guidance included as the appendix to the briefing material circulated on Monday last.  We understand the Department may have a number of issues with how the guidance has been applied to the performance measures it has included in the Estimate.  Can we establish whether the Department has any issues with the guidance itself?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#E00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":879,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to appear before it this morning.  I can confirm that my Department welcomes the guidelines.  With my colleagues, I have had an opportunity to consider the guidelines of which we are aware, the so-called New Zealand guidelines.  They are welcome in terms of having a baseline for setting output based performance targets.  I know it is the committee's view that should be so.  My officials and I, as Minister, are committed to working with both Oireachtas support staff and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to strengthen the performance indicators that are currently in use.  That can only be a good thing.  We agree that outputs, in general, should cover all significant services and proposed expenditure, that outputs should relate to the goods and services provided to third parties for which the entity is accountable, that clear specific targets should be set and that output performance measures should not relate to internal processes and events.  Obviously, we all need to understand the distinction that requires to be drawn between internal processes and events on the one hand and actual outputs on the other.  Finally, performance measures and targets should be supported by current and historical levels of performance where that is possible and where they are available.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding those general remarks, we have some concerns that moving to a system of performance outputs that focuses on goods and services provided to third parties would not be appropriate in every instance.  It can be challenging to identify appropriate and timely measurement indicators for policy areas.  My Department is largely a policy Department and we have a very broad remit across the communications, broadcasting, energy and natural resource sectors.  That being the case a variety of different metrics is called for.  For example, and we can discuss this if we have an opportunity, perhaps the most striking example, but not the only one, is the national broadband plan.  The broadband plan takes several years to put together and the metrics for the design stages of a project can be very different from appropriate measures to be applied when the project is at full roll-out stage.  There is the developmental phase, planning and so on.  The type of measurements that are appropriate to apply to what we are doing at the moment are somewhat different from the measurements that it would be necessary to apply when the job is done, that is, do people have high quality broadband and is it working.  <\/p> <p>  My Department has commenced a review of performance indicators.  We are committed to bringing forward proposals for discussion with the Oireachtas, the committee and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in regard to the performance measures that it would be appropriate to include in the 2016 Estimates.  Those are my general comments on the outputs and the performance targets approach the committee wishes to take and I support the committee in that regard.<\/p><p>No reallocation of funds has taken place to date within the Vote in 2015, but we are considering reallocations in one or two areas.

My understanding of the New Zealand standards, and thankfully there are now standards, is that each Department is now measured and we are measured as a Parliament on how we scrutinise Departments as to how they spend their money.  I never cease to be amazed by how language is used, and the European Union is probably a past master at this, to describe basic matters such as there is now a system in place to see how well a Department is doing with taxpayers' money or with policies they are trying to drive on behalf of the public.  In every Department, but particularly in the technological side of this Department, it is important to state the facts in plain English rather than in the gobbledygook that comes from some Departments.  I am aware there is a huge volume of work going on in Departments to produce and achieve policy and performance related initiatives, but they must state simply how well they are doing with public money for the public good.

One thing I find frustrating since becoming a Member of the House is the difficulty in measuring personal and occupational progress against targets.  It is difficult to assess whether I as a Deputy and committee member am performing well or badly and it is difficult to know what measurement criteria I should be using to make that evaluation.  It must also be difficult for a Department to state the criteria and targets against which it measures its performance and for it to examine how close or far it is from meeting those.<\/p> <p>  Typically, there are both qualitative and quantitative criteria.  I have noticed that in terms of looking at budgets and expenditure to date, we are good at counting what is easy to count.

I am not being critical because I understand it is not an easy process.  In a previous existence, I was haunted by performance indicator measurement and monitoring.  Frankly, I found it a pain in the neck when we started using the measurement system, but as we became accustomed to using performance measurements, they became second nature to us and it was good for me to measure whether I was meeting the outputs set for the projects I was working on.<\/p> <p>  The key issue is whether we can come up with a measurement system, and we have the New Zealand model.  This may need to be tweaked for the Irish context, but there is no question that we need such a system.  I knew but had forgotten that a recent OECD report stated this State's Parliament is 54th out of 60 in a study of parliaments in terms of scrutiny of departmental budgets.  We can all hide behind imprecision and it can be quite fun to have philosophical discussion as to what is happening in a Department.  However, as committee members we are not delivering a good public service unless we can measure whether Departments are delivering on the promises they made.<\/p> <p>  I am glad to hear from the Minister that his Department has accepted that some sort of monitoring is required.  It may well be that further work needs to be done on establishing the criteria for that.  The committee should have some input into the process of deciding what performance measurement will be used.  We also need to consider how we can establish the qualitative rather than quantitative performance of the Department.  Again, I would like the committee to be involved in that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#F00800","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":888,"content":"<p>The Minister said he agrees with the principles but that the issue needs to be teased out.

What the Deputy said is extremely thoughtful.  He is right.  Sometimes it is frustrating for all of us, whether as a Minister or public representative, to try to measure the effectiveness of what we are doing.  We could start work at 6.30 a.m. and work right throughout the day and then ask ourselves how we can measure what we did.  I believe that is what this committee is trying to do in a helpful way.  It is asking whether we can apply some metrics to this process in order that we can have a sense of what has been achieved and in order that it can question me on whether we are satisfying those measures.  That is the question we need to answer.<\/p> <p>  Broadly speaking and just looking at my Department, examples of measurable outputs would be, for example, things such as energy efficiency in homes.<\/p><p>That is objectively measurable to some extent at least.  Similarly, the Department has an objective whereby fossil fuels will be replaced over years or decades with renewable energy.  The question as to whether the Department is achieving this goal is measurable, admittedly over a period of years rather than on a day-to-day basis.  I mentioned broadband and stated the Government will ensure that broadband reaches every home and business in the State by 2020, with 85% reached by 2018, through a mixture of public and private sector investment.  It will not be possible to measure this aim until 2018 to ascertain whether the 85% target was reached and until 2020 to find out whether all areas were covered but it is possible to measure the credibility of what is being done at present to reach those objectives and that can be tested.  As for broadcasting, I do not know.  That perhaps is a quite difficult area in respect of outputs.  One might suggest outputs of hours on air but that is hardly a satisfactory measurement of outputs.  It is certainly not a measurement of quality and is not sufficient.  One might suggest measuring indigenous programming, that is, programming produced in Ireland and that might be a good measurement of the success of the broadcasting policy.  I believe more could be done to enhance the kind of measurement the committee is seeking and I will support the committee in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#F01000","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":891,"content":"<p>I presume the Minister's officials will engage with this committee on a continuous basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#G00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":892,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#G00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":893,"content":"<p>Is there an office, person or people within the Department specifically considering what kind of performance monitoring is required?

In discussions the Minister may have had with the Department in the knowledge the new guidelines were to be discussed, did he meet with some resistance within the Department?  While I accept the Minister's commitment to it, that may not be so forthcoming from certain parts of the Department and I seek to ascertain whether there was resistance in this regard.  Second, I accept the point that some Departments lend themselves well to this type of measurement involving inputs, outputs, impacts and so on.  The Minister noted that the communications portfolio, for example, is very much a policy-driven Department.  However, there are subheads or areas within the departmental Estimate that lend themselves well to inputs, outputs and impacts.  I suggest, one of these is under subhead A3, which deals with the national broadband scheme, MANS networks, schools networks and postcodes.  These are programme-driven or project-driven initiatives within the Department.  The real issue members of the committee have is when they consider the items covered in this review, they look at figures adding up to thousands - under this subhead adding up to just short of &euro;18 million - in a single snapshot that effectively tells them nothing.  The figures tell members what is being spent in a six-month period in the first half of the year, what is the projection for the remainder of the year and that is it.  Were the Department serious or were it attempting to consider how the guidelines could have been displayed to the committee, even today, I suggest it would have been possible to have that type of output measurement in a basic sense on subhead A3, which lends itself well to the new guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#G00700","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":897,"content":"<p>We will take a few more questions before allowing the Minister respond to them.

There are communities for which wireless providers have been trying to develop services recently.  As for trying to achieve this by 2020, they need it now and while the Government has stated it hopes to induce emigrants to return to their communities, it has no hope in the present environment.  Many points were made regarding energy efficiency but the electricity providers are conducting insufficient awareness campaigning.

I am basing my questions on a comprehensive document provided to members on outputs that specifically is to do with broadband and will cite that document because the Minister may be able to clarify a number of issues.  For example, what is the estimated total cost this year of delivering on the fifth measure, which is to deliver on an implementation strategy for the public consultation and proceed to procurement phase, which is the final phase?  Are there other significant and distinct outputs or activities whose costs are to be met from subhead 3?  Under that subhead, the mapping, State aids and procurement stage, leading to State-led investment, was to conclude last year.  In addition, as can be seen from the output targets included in the Estimates for 2013, 2014 and 2015, departmental activity on national broadband service strategy development and implementation has been ongoing for a number of years, is complex and is not calendar-related.<\/p> <p>  In spite of the Minister's remarks in his opening statement to the effect that the system would be delivered by 2020 and that much of it will be in place by 2018, I can remember one of his predecessors in a Fianna F&aacute;il Administration saying much the same thing approximately ten years ago but we still are at the stage we have reached.  Admittedly, there have been considerable improvements since then but sometimes I am a little sceptical about targets that have been put in place without having anything to back up the suggestion they will happen.  The manner in which the questions have been put here suggests there is a need to get clarity on precisely what the Department is doing with the money under the Estimates that have been provided thus far.  The document to hand then makes an important point that in the context of the relevance of measures in this area to annual scrutiny of Estimates and associated performance targets, it is significant that such activity is unlikely to begin to provide an impact in terms of service availability, that is for customers and the public, until well into 2015 at the earliest, and for a period of three to five years thereafter, which is more or less what Deputy Fleming has been saying here.<\/p><p>Those of us who live in rural Ireland do not want the service in three or five years; we want it now.  I must say, however, that I am particularly encouraged by Eircom which has been laying cables just outside my home town of Drumshanbo for the last few weeks.  My understanding is that speeds will increase from the current miserly rate of 7 Mbps to 100 Mbps, which is the rate already enjoyed in Carrick-on-Shannon, Manorhamilton and other towns in Leitrim.  It is counties such as Leitrim that I am concerned about in terms of the performance outputs.  We are being constantly told that it does not really matter where one is located anymore because once one has the technology, one can start up, maintain and improve a business.  <\/p><p> I ask these questions because the information provided to the committee gives no indication as to annual cost of policy development and implementation in this area.  This is important in order to determine whether the activity contributes to meeting guidance No. 2 on maintenance of broadband services.  Finally, the performance information returned by the Department appears to suggest that there has been some drift in terms of achieving targets included in the Estimate.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.  Although it is not clear that there has been drift, the materiality is uncertain.  Equally significant is the fact that the possible drift has only come to our attention as a result of information sought from and provided by the Department in the context of this mid-year review of performance by this committee.  In the case of the 2013 targets, this is at least 18 months after the event.  There are serious questions to be raised about the broadband policy according to the information provided here as to the outputs, performance levels and the actual impact that it is having and will have from now on.  It has not been having much of an impact up to now, I would suggest and there is a need for the Department to up its game.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#G01700","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":908,"content":"<p>Deputy Harrington asked whether I found any resistance to this process of scrutinising outputs and applying a measurement of outputs to the work of the Department.

In fact, on the contrary, I have found that for the officials I work with in the Department, who are very professional people, it actually enhances their own sense of satisfaction and progress on the various areas of work with which they are involved that they would be part of a better regime of outputs scrutiny.  I have found, without exception, that the officials in my Department who are working so hard on issues like broadband, for example, welcome the idea of closer scrutiny and debate, having regard to the measurability of some of the work in which they are involved.  Some of the work with which we are involved is not measurable on a day-to-day basis but is measurable in a broader context, as we have been discussing.

These are the amounts that are set out in the Estimates.

I am concerned by a number of issues, one of which is broadband, which was already referred to by Deputy Fleming and Senator Mooney.  Where are we at with the broadband project?  I note that &euro;275 million was allocated on the capital side but the Minister's predecessor said that it would cost somewhere in the region of &euro;500 million to do a decent job of connecting everybody to the broadband network by 2018 or 2020.  I have raised with the Minister on the floor of the D&aacute;il the enormous level of concern and frustration with the patchiness of the network.  Nobody seems to be in charge of this and ComReg does not seem to be taking a hands-on approach.  A new mast which was erected recently in Meelin in north Cork to improve broadband services is now interfering with the already patchy broadband services in the area.  This is causing enormous frustration.  Young people are now making decisions about whether to continue living in rural Ireland because of poor broadband coverage, not to mention the issues around planning which seem to have taken on a life of their own.<\/p><p>Anything that can be done to stop people living in rural Ireland is being done but that is a different debate.<\/p><p> What stage is the broadband programme at now?  We were expecting something back from the European Commission in mid-2015 in respect of the state aids programme.  What has happened to that?  What stage are the tendering documents at?  How advanced is the process for State intervention to ensure that 30% of the people in this country have an adequate broadband service?  On Deputy Fleming&rsquo;s point about returning emigrants, people have been used to living with these facilities.  It is almost like people returning in the 1970s, deciding to do so based on whether they would have running water.  That is how serious it is.<\/p><p> It now transpires that &euro;38 million was spent on Eircode rather than &euro;27 million.  Officials from the Department and Eircode and everybody else had confirmed to the committee that it would be &euro;27 million.  Where and how was that allowed to go out of kilter?<\/p><p> There is huge scope and huge challenges in the broadcasting sector.  Various lobby groups from local radio stations have come in looking for their slice of the licensing fee cake.  Is the Minister satisfied that the taxpayer is getting value for money from the licence fee being handed to RTE and for the &euro;58 million which is given through the Department of Social Protection for the free licence for the elderly on top of what is being collected from householders?  The local radio stations really serve their communities in urban and rural Ireland where the national broadcaster has not served anywhere beyond the M50 for several generations.  <\/p><p> I commend the Department's work on the Green Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland.  This committee has discussed the raw material for gas and so forth.  Its cost has dropped in the world market but that is not reflected directly in the price.  Does the Minister think the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, is properly resourced by legislation to adequately address the issues in the energy market?  I believe it is not and a major legislative change is needed.  The Minister mentioned some transfer of funds from one subhead to another for the warmer homes scheme.  It has been very beneficial but a massive amount of work needs to be done on the scheme.  There are certain socio-economic groups which suffer from fuel poverty.  There needs to be a massive concerted effort.  Some local authorities ran pilot schemes with the warmer home scheme for their housing stock but that was on a small scale.  A massive amount of energy and money is being lost.  I encourage the Minister to ensure that the warmer homes scheme is even more adequately funded.<\/p><p> What is the Minister&rsquo;s opinion of solar panel farms such as those used on the Continent?

It is not the entire cost that we foresee.  I will not put a specific cost on the plan because we are about to enter into a procurement process involving bidders to ensure we get the best possible deal for the Irish public in respect of the roll-out of high speed broadband.  I can confirm to Deputy Moynihan and the committee that this figure of &euro;275 million set aside in the capital plan will be used for the national broadband plan and that we will see what the bids are when the procurement process opens, which I expect to happen on schedule at the end of this year.

This is relevant to the broader question of measurement of outputs.  I am absolutely convinced that we should do this once and do it right.  Nobody will thank me, wherever I am in five years&rsquo; time, this committee, the Department or anybody else, if we engage in a piecemeal approach to the national broadband plan to achieve what Senator Mooney mentioned earlier and to ensure that every home and business in the State has access to high speed broadband.  On our calculation, something of the order of 30%, perhaps somewhat less, will have to be dealt with through State intervention because the commercial operators will not make a profit in these areas.  It is remarkable that the 30%, or of that order, does constitute something of the order of 96% of the territory of the State.  Practically every farm in the State is in the amber area, I doubt there is a farm in the blue area, and broadband will be of great benefit to farming.  If one was thinking about this as a road building programme, it is equivalent to 100,000 km.  That is a State intervention, which is on a par with the electrification initiative of a previous generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#J00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":919,"content":"<p>It was done in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#J00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":920,"content":"<p>It was not done the way we are doing it, with respect to my colleagues in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>Different approaches are taken and we have stated we want a minimum speed of 30 megabits per second, Mbps.  I want this to be understood because some people believe the speed will be up to 30 Mbps, which not the case.  What we expect to be delivered under the national broadband plan by the successful bidder or bidders is a minimum of 30 Mbps and it needs to be future-proofed.<\/p><p> Under the rules, we cannot select a technology.  Colleagues who are familiar with the issue, of whom there are many, will know that if this is to be done right, the technology must be able to take high-speed broadband into homes and businesses.  We are engaged in achieving this.  It is important to note that we have been working closely with the European Commission on this issue throughout the year and members can go through a schedule of the specific steps we have taken.  I assure the joint committee that the approach we are taking is focused on doing this once and doing it right, rather than in bits and pieces.  To give an example of a step we have taken this year, we addressed the new state aid guidelines which were finalised by the Commission after the national broadband plan was published. <\/p><p> Global demand for data is increasing dramatically throughout the world, including here, and we have increased our ambition in response to this demand.  Members will have noted the introduction of a Vodafone-ESB joint venture, SIRO.  My predecessor in the Department, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, introduced legislation to provide for this development and SIRO is now driving competition.  In addition, investment by industry has increased significantly, partly driven by the State.  The State has an intervention role and the Department is ensuring the private sector is pushing ahead.  Competition in the sector is working. <\/p><p> Members referred to a number of forms of technology.  While we are prevented from selecting a technology, to do this right it is likely that fibre will be a key part of the network build.  It will also be a wholesale network and the minimum requirement, as I stated, is 30 Mbps. <\/p><p> We want the plan to be future-proofed.  To return to the measurement of outputs, it will only ever be possible to measure the real output on the national broadband plan when somebody else is sitting in my seat.  That is the difficulty.  As a politician, I would like to be able to state that last week the State served X number of new premises and so forth.  However, the private sector, working with the State, has significantly increased what is has done and it is being driven by the Government.  For example, the number of homes and premises with access to high-speed broadband has increased from 300,000 in 2010 to 1.3 million currently.  The commercial sector will increase this figure to 1.9 million by 2020.  I accept that these figures are of no benefit to those who do not have access to high-speed broadband.  If, however, the joint committee wants to measure outputs, it should note the substantial increase in the number of homes and premises served by high-speed broadband.  The Department will ensure the current figure of 1.3 million continues to increase. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#J00500","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":922,"content":"<p>Has the European Commission approved state aid for the national broadband strategy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#K00200","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":923,"content":"<p>No, the procurement process will hopefully commence at the end of this year and the Commission's decision on final approval will be made in parallel with that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#K00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":924,"content":"<p>My understanding was that Commission approval would be given in mid-2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#K00400","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":925,"content":"<p>Pre-notification must be first provided, after which final approval will be given.

The idea of delaying the procurement process until Commission approval is given is not attractive to me as I want to drive on with both processes.<\/p> <p>  On the Eircode project, I have no doubt the report produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General will be dealt with in due course by the relevant committee and the Accounting Officer in my Department.  It is worth commenting, however, on the headline figures of &euro;38 million, which was given by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and &euro;27 million, which I gave as the estimated cost of the project.  During the implementation phase, the cost of the contract was put at &euro;27 million, with &euro;16 million in the first two-year initial roll-out period.  The bulk of this figure - &euro;9.4 million - was spent on encoding public sector bodies' databases, with &euro;1.2 million per annum provided for the remaining years of the contract.  The difference between the figure of &euro;27 million and the figure of &euro;38 million relates to the inclusion of VAT, consultancy costs and internal staffing costs in the latter figure.  This means the cost of the staff who were involved in the project have also been wound into the &euro;38 million figure.  I would not describe staff costs as a notional cost as we have to pay the salaries and wages of staff in the Department but they are among the additional items that make up the gap between the &euro;27 million cost of the contract and the &euro;38 million figure provided by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That explains the difference between the two figures. <\/p> <p>  On the licence fee, we all have our views on value for money for the licence fee.  To return to the measurement of outputs and the need to be objective about these issues, we have an objective system for examining value for money in public service broadcasting, namely, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland five-year reviews.  On foot of the most recent five-year review, NewEra was asked to carry out a assessment of RTE and members will have seen the report NewEra produced.  On any objective reading of the report, RTE emerges well compared with other public service broadcasters in Europe, and in its own right.  There is no doubt that there has been a substantial cost reduction programme in RTE, with several hundred staff positions removed from the organisation during the retrenchment period.  Colleagues may wish to consider the NewEra report when assessing whether RTE provides value for money.  If I were asked directly my view, I would respond that RTE provides value for money, although there is always room for improvement in public service broadcasting.  We should continue to fund public service broadcasting, as every Government since the 1920s has done because they have recognised the value and importance of public service broadcasting. <\/p> <p>  I agree with the comments made on the unacceptable level of television licence fee evasion.  I will shortly make proposals to government to address the issue of compliance regarding the television licence fee.  I accept Senator Mooney's point on the efficiency of the existing collection system.  We can do some work on the database that is used by An Post and I have some proposals to make in that regard.

In the current period, the most important step we can take is to freshen up the database used by An Post and make it more robust.<\/p> <p>  On the commercial broadcasting sector, I dealt with this matter in recent days in discussion with Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, who is present.  We have a sound and vision scheme, which is allocated 7% of the income generated from the television licence.  The commercial sector is meeting a real need, especially in rural areas but elsewhere also.  However, we have never before contemplated - I respect the fact that some members are proposing do so now and I do not want to paraphrase them - the redistribution, as it were, of the licence fee across the board to the commercial sector as well as the public sector.  To do so would, at a minimum, be problematic for the following reason, unless someone has a better or different suggestion.<\/p><p>It would require the assessment of individual programmes and strands of programmes across the board in the commercial sector and, presumably, in the public sector ultimately also to determine whether this or that programme was a public service programme and, if it was, whether it should get some of the licence fee.  As I said in the D&aacute;il the other day and have said elsewhere, there are some programmes that are capable of being categorised on both sides of the ledger.  Sports programming performs a public service but also attracts great commercial interest and value for the broadcaster.  Senator Mooney and I soldiered in the speech programme sector many years ago and the Senator still does.  A speech programme is not necessarily a public service programme in every case, but who is to say?  If the listener is being entertained by it, is it not performing a public service?  The definitional issue is problematic.  That is all I am saying.  Ultimately, it has been the policy of Governments of all persuasions and all colours going right back that the licence fee was largely dedicated to ensuring there was a robust public service broadcaster, in this case RTE and TG4.  If one starts to look at redistributing those supports out of the public service and into the commercial sector on the basis of some kind of definitional approach to programmes or programme strands, one is going to give oneself a huge job of work.  I accept that the fact that it is a job of work is not a good enough reason not to do it, but it seems to me that it would be extremely difficult and raise even more problems than it might solve.  That said, commercial local radio performs a huge job for the listeners and communities across the country and I am prepared, as I have said we should be prepared to do, to look at ways to enhance the financial supports, or financial environment I should say, that those stations operate in, in particular the smaller, more vulnerable ones outside the main cities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#K00700","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":929,"content":"<p>One way it could be done immediately would be by removing the levy and having it absorbed by the licence fee.

Not only that, the Minister knows as I do that the most labour intensive aspect of broadcasting is news, current affairs and sport.  Therefore, Sound &amp;amp; Vision, which started off as a great concept, is now helping the independent production sector and RTE, but is not helping the local radio sector.

I never suggested a redistribution of the television licence.  There is a massive anomaly in public service broadcasting funding.   I do not distinguish between RTE and the rest.  If they are licenced and carrying out a function, they are public service broadcasters.  They provide a service.  The GNLR figures prove that.  I understand that the Minister is saying that going back to the days of 2RN in the GPO, the Government always had a commitment to the public service broadcaster as defined in the legislation, but that has changed since previous Governments introduced the concept of independent broadcasting.  We are way behind the curve in terms of funding.  I would have no difficulty with the television licence being ring-fenced for the current use if there was a level playing field, which there is not.  It is not level because of advertising and things are stacked against the commercial side.  RTE is very aggressively looking for advertising in the market, which it has to do as it has to wash its own face.  However, it is competing with people who do not have the &euro;180 million cushion the Oireachtas votes to RTE by way of the television licence.  That is grossly unfair.<\/p> <p>  We have had the RTE authorities in here and they evaded answering the following question.  As the shareholder of the company and given his responsibility for a suite of semi-State companies from energy to broadcasting, does the Minister believe it is appropriate for a semi-State company funded on a compulsory basis by all of the citizens who are obliged to purchase television licences that there are still people working for RTE whose salaries will not be disclosed by the public service broadcaster?  If it happened in any other element of public administration - the Minister mentioned NewERA - can people imagine the outcry?  There would be wall-to-wall coverage from \"Morning Ireland\" to \"Good night, Ireland\" on RTE.  If the salary of the CEO of Irish Water was not disclosed, there would be consternation, and rightly so.  However, we have this protected species operating out of a &euro;183 million cushion who refuse to give the level of accountability that is expected of me, the Minister and everybody else in the public sector.  People in the commercial radio world and community radio world, not to mention the private sector television companies, are finding it hard to swallow that RTE will only release their salaries three years after contracts have been signed.  If the Minister was to appoint a new CEO of a semi-State company tomorrow and told the D&aacute;il in response to a question from an Opposition Member that he was not going to release that person's salary for three years, he would be walking across the bridge to the Taoiseach's office with a letter in his hand and it would not be tolerated.

We could consider how to channel funds to commercial operators, whether that is through the existing sound and vision scheme or a new and similar scheme.  Another approach, on the other side of the ledger and as mentioned by Senator Mooney earlier, is to consider funding the regulator directly from the licence fee.  That would mean the commercial and public stations would not be paying the levy.  They are two practical possibilities.

We can all have our views and the Deputy has his view.  The position relayed to me by RTE is that in circumstances where it is operating in what may not be a purely commercial environment - as noted by Deputy O'Donovan - but in the commercial market for talent, to publish the salaries in real time would undermine the company's position and make it difficult to attract and keep staff.  That is the position taken by RTE and related to me.  RTE publishes the salaries <i>post facto<\/i>, and the Deputy is correct in stating that it is done a couple of years down the road.

We must bear that in mind.<\/p> <p>  It appears that Departments are overly dependent on management consultants.  Eircode is an example.

Of course, I already knew the answer to the question before I asked it.  All of the plans relating to the roll-out of national broadband - my PQ referred, in particular, to the roll-out in more rural areas - are predicated on the economy doing well.  People in rural areas are concerned that, once again, the towns and cities will be considered.  However, if China, the US, the EU or some other large nation or bloc hiccups economically, lo and behold, the funding will no longer exist to bring state-of-the-art broadband to the more rural areas.  I have argued all along that rural areas should receive broadband side by side with the cities and towns.  Distrust exists and people are worried that the planned roll-out is predicated on economic performance.<\/p> <p>  We need joined-up thinking when it comes to energy.  The SEAI provides grants in respect of the installation of energy boilers, radiators, etc., but a person can get all of that work done in a house where the doors are hanging off the hinges and the windows are broken.  People often cannot get their doors and windows replaced.  We should do an awful more to improve energy efficiency, particularly for people who cannot afford such measures.  We must examine the true cost of every energy development project for the customer -  the person who will use the energy - and for taxpayers as well.  There is so much energy that everything must be proofed against affordability for the customer in terms of energy.<\/p> <p>  In the context of natural resources, I am sure that the Minister is aware of the many concerns about the EPA's study on hydraulic fracturing.  I am sure he is also aware of the concerns many of us harbour with regard to continuing to let companies hold on to the forlorn hope that fracking will somehow be allowed to take place on this beautiful little island in the Atlantic.  In many cases, we are giving the companies an opportunity to take a legal action against this State and that will cost an awful lot of money.  Such a situation has already arisen in Canada, where energy companies have taken the Government to court on the basis that its policy deprived them of accessing quantified resources.  Ireland is paying to have some of this quantification done for energy companies.  Those companies could use the relevant details to take more money off the Irish people.  That is a major mistake and we need put a stop to what is going on.<\/p> <p>  The final issue to which I wish to refer is inland fisheries.  We have reached the point, in terms of resource allocation to inland fisheries, where access to waterways and amenities is being damaged and perhaps beyond the point where it is economically feasible to repair it.  I know about this matter because I have spoken to a number of people who work in the sector.  The sector does a great deal of work that benefits tourism promotion.  We need to be careful that even while ensuring that there are efficiencies, we do not damage the very product the sector provides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#N00300","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":967,"content":"<p>In terms of consultancy, I have some sympathy with the generality of the remarks the Deputy made in respect of consultants.

I do not travel much but I travel a little and I have spoken to Ministers in other countries about broadband.  No matter what a person's view is, broadband is a major infrastructural project.  That project is being managed within my Department by a relatively small group of highly-motivated and professional people under the leadership of Ms Katherine Licken, the assistant secretary in charge.  These people in my Department plug away, day in and day out, working on this exciting and very important project for the Irish people.  Yes, we must have legal consultancy, economic consultancy, technical consultancy and so on but we keep it to the minimum that is required.  We ensure that we can put together all of the pieces to ensure that the project is delivered for the Irish people.  The project is led and managed by civil servants who are doing a terrific job.  I witness their dedication day in, day out and some of them are here with me today.<\/p> <p>  I wish to comment further on consultants.  Sometimes there are projects that are relatively short lived and that require certain skills.  I might sound a little harsh when I say that they are not skills that will be required after the project has been completed.  In other words, the project requires specific skills and once it is completed, there is no longer a need for the skills.  There is a case for bringing in people, either consultants or otherwise, for that kind of work but demand should be kept to a minimum.  It is policy and our approach to keep the necessity for such people to a minimum.

That is what we are doing.  Were we to leave this to the private sector, rural Ireland would not be serviced because there would be no profit to be made.

We are doing that.  The Deputy stated that the projects should be done side by side.  The national broadband plan, with its 30% or whatever it ends up being and the 96%, is a large undertaking.  It is not realistic to assert that we should be rolling out services in rural areas in parallel with commercial operators' roll-out in cities.  It cannot work that way.  We must undertake this work as a whole project.  We must plan, get our ducks in a row, get state aid approval from the Commission, set up a procurement process and ensure that the legal, economic and technical elements are correct.  We are undertaking this as one project for rural Ireland whereas the operators have different commercial interests.  For example, some are legacy operators that already have kit in the ground.  They operate at different levels and paces whereas we are undertaking one large project.  That is the right way to do it.  Whoever is sitting here in five or even three years' time will not be thanked if this project is not undertaken as comprehensively as we have planned.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy regarding energy poverty.  We have energy poverty.  I attended a good conference on this matter a few mornings ago.  We have the better energy warmer homes scheme.  In terms of energy use, it is important that people's homes be warm and properly insulated.  Retrofitting is a key element in what we need to do.  If it is done right, it only needs to be done once.  It can transform energy consumption in homes.  The Deputy was right in his comments.

Reference is made in the subhead briefing on A3 to the national broadband scheme.  Is that the old scheme?  What remains of that scheme?  We wait with great interest to see how the procurement process for the new national broadband plan evolves.  We can be certain of a few aspects, but the point to which the national scheme will match what the private sector delivers to homes in terms of high-speed broadband is not clear, given evolving technologies and so on.  It is easy to identify those rural and peripheral areas that the private sector will not touch in even the next 20 years.  I fear that there may be a blurring of lines, in that the private sector might invest in an area in the next three or four years if conditions suit but, in the meantime, we will forge ahead and spend public money to deliver the scheme.  We should identify the most peripheral areas, for example, our islands.  If we are serious about delivering high-speed broadband to every household by 2020, it is a safe assumption that the private sector will not go near the islands.<\/p><p>As such, would it not make sense to start there first, move in and meet the private sector somewhere in the middle?  I understand that the tender process is ongoing and that issues might arise but the matter should still be addressed.<\/p><p> The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has announced the digital strategy for schools and I presume the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will also have an input into that very welcome initiative.  Hopefully, we will see up to &euro;50 million of grant aid being taken up and disbursed among all schools nationally.  Some schools will have a better ability to do it than others, which is a real issue and something that must be examined.<\/p><p> A very specific area mentioned within the document, at subhead A3, is funding set aside for the Galway-Mayo ducting.  I am to correction but I think this refers to a new high-speed transatlantic cable from Killala to Dublin and, perhaps, further afield.  My information is that it is being held up in the Department for longer than should be the case.  I am very keen for the matter to progress to the signing of contracts by local authorities, the Department and the private company delivering the project.  It is a project of significant national importance and it must be expedited.<\/p><p> I refer to the online trading scheme under A5.  I presume that is the online voucher or assistance the Department will provide to companies to upgrade their information systems.  We saw a very good example of how that has worked in conjunction with a community in Skibbereen.  The Minister was present at the launch.  The community, with some assistance from the Department, has plans to be the first 1 GB town at least in Munster and, I think, excluding a pilot project Cavan, in the country.  It is a welcome initiative and one that can act as a driver for other communities with an example of what can be done.<\/p><p> I raise a minor issue on subhead C3 in respect of SEAI grants, which are very welcome.  Is the Minister is satisfied with the ratio in the budget of administrative to grant funding?  There is a budget on the administration side of &euro;7 million for pay and non-pay with grants in the region of &euro;50 million.  While it is a really a matter for the SEAI, does the Department have a scrutiny role in respect of the contractors recommended by the SEAI?  In a very small minority of cases, they are, frankly, not up to the job notwithstanding which they continue to be recommended by the SEAI.  Has the Department engaged in any consultation with SEAI on sanctioning those contractors who have taken public money and failed to deliver a service to the client?<\/p><p> A discussion on the following has been awaited for some time.

We can certainly fill out some of the detail on that for the Deputy if he wants, but it is what we are dealing with in respect of the national broadband scheme as opposed to the national broadband plan, which the Deputy then went on to discuss.  The approach of identifying areas which there is no question of the commercial sector ever attending to is exactly the one we have taken.  The mapping exercise we undertook and the map we published in November 2014 showed where we judge it will be necessary for the State intervention to occur.  That refers to the so-called amber area.  On the coloured map, blue will be the private sector in its many manifestations and amber is where we judge we will need to go.  It is important to emphasise that we do not make those decisions based only on the private sector saying \"Hey, this is what we think we will and will not do\".  A big part of our work is assessing that and the validity and reliability of information furnished to us by the private sector on its plans.  I was asked earlier what the Department was doing and that is one of the big things we have to do week in and week out.  We make judgments on it and meet with the commercial sector operators before sending them back to get more information in order to understand all of the information available, apply our own judgment and then map it.<\/p> <p>  We had a public consultation on the map and are now updating it.  People may ask why.  We are updating it to take into consideration new information received or operator announcements that have been made in respect of new plans for 2016 and beyond.  When I was addressing Senator Mooney earlier, we talked about the 30%.  I said there was a possibility that the 30% figure could reduce.  That is the process we are engaged in.  It may not reduce substantially, but we think it might reduce somewhat.  We will then be able to show the committee a somewhat reduced amber area in terms of the State intervention.  When the Deputy says there are areas that could never be the subject of questioning, he is right.  The problem is that this is a whole project that will go to procurement.  There will be a somewhat complex tendering process in terms of how operators will indicate they can deliver this minimum of 30 MB right across the contract area.  As such, it is not really possible for us to do this by dividing it up into small units.  We cannot say we know this particular island is never going to be in the blue area so let us get going with it.  It is just not amenable to being done that way, it must be done as a single project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#P00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":984,"content":"<p>Eventually, when the tender is awarded, there will be a discussion on where to begin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#P00300","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":985,"content":"<p>That is exactly right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#P00400","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":986,"content":"<p>What influence will the Minister of the day have?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#P00500","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":987,"content":"<p>What we want to do is approach it in a way that is technically feasible and economically viable.  As such, we want to hear from the bidders what are their offerings in respect of it.  That will be part of the bidding process.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for what he said about the digital strategy for schools, which is very progressive.  My colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is launching it this morning.  I would have been with her but for the fact that I am here with committee, which I am delighted to be.  My Department has had an extensive involvement in the project with the Department of Education and Skills.  As colleagues will know, we have also been involved previously in a national roll-out of 100 MB to post-primary schools across the country in a very successful project.  We see the necessity of primary schools having the same access, but it is something we must deal with in the context of the project we are engaged in and which we have just been discussing.  Education is an area where huge value can be derived from high-speed broadband.  We recognise that and will ensure that it is provided.<\/p> <p>  We have been progressing the Galway-Mayo project.  There are some issues although not by way of unnecessary delay.  There are some technical and legal questions we are nailing down at present.  I am very conscious of the importance of the project.<\/p><p>As the Deputy knows, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann constructed 130 km of telecommunications duct on our behalf alongside the gas pipeline from Galway to Mayo, and there is another spur to the outskirts of Castlebar and Westport.  We are on to it.  We do not want to see it delayed, as the Chairman will be glad to hear, and we will progress it as soon as we can.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned online trading.  The voucher scheme is working very well.  There has been a great take-up and huge interest in it.<\/p><p> I agree with him about the Skibbereen project, and I was happy to attend its launch in August.  The Deputy is right.  It is a very good example of what can be achieved elsewhere in the country.  It is a real beacon.  I wish them well and we will certainly want to assist them in any way we can.<\/p><p> On the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, there is a quality assurance and disciplinary process in place.  It is managed by the SEAI, not by the Department.  I am advised this process is backed up by an inspections regime that ensures that a minimum of 10% of the works carried out under the programme are inspected for quality control purposes - there cannot be an inspection of it all - and that each contractor who performs work on the schemes is covered.  If the Deputy has concerns they should be relayed to the SEAI, but we do not administer the scheme directly in the Department.<\/p><p> On Whitegate, I met with the owners and management of the Whitegate refinery.  It is a decision for them.  It is a fully commercial body in terms of that refinery.  I have met both the local management and the US management on it.  It would be my earnest hope and desire that they would continue past the cut-off point in the middle of 2016, which they have contracted to do.<\/p><p> There are no proposals for any State investment or supports in regard to Whitegate but I assure the Deputy it is something of which we are very conscious.  It is a very important employer, to say nothing about the strategic implications of Whitegate, and we hope the decisions the company will make next year will be positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#P00600","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":989,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  Deputy Calleary raised the installation grants and replacement of windows and doors.  It is fine to insulate a house but as they say down the country, \"You'd winnow oats through some of the doors\".  What is going on is stupid.  Councils are refusing to give grants for the replacement of windows and doors when someone is insulating the rest of the house.  That is defeating the purpose of the scheme, and it must be urgently addressed.  Some councils are providing grants for windows and doors and more are not.  If common sense does not prevail on that, we are achieving nothing.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's comments on An Post because the viability of An Post is very important to rural parts of Ireland, and indeed all parts of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about broadband provision.  I was not long a Member last February or March but it is my understanding, and I do not believe I misheard him, that the Minister said a document was being prepared and would be sent to Europe so that he could be given the go-ahead for subsidising the provision of broadband.  He told us it was going in June.  He informed us also that we would have word in October-November as to the go-ahead for that but, now, the Minister spoke about running things in parallel, which is totally different from what I understood the Minister to say a few months ago.  He is talking about the procurement now and getting the go-ahead from Europe.  That is totally different from what I understood a few months ago.<\/p> <p>  I note from the paperwork the EU target by 2020.  A target does not give one a definition of whether one is delivering or not.  A target is a target.  We want closure on broadband through the country.  We want solid dates at this stage.  I understand it is a large task.  The Minister talked about his new staff being enthusiastic, and it is great to hear that, but did he bring in those new staff within the past year or two because I am not familiar with the position or are they employed ten or 12 years?  What has been done for the past ten or 12 years?  Why has this not been delivered before now?<\/p> <p>  ComReg produced a report during the summer.  I rang ComReg because some of what was contained in it was highfalutin, referencing the great increase in the provision of broadband here and there, but a black spot is a black spot and people in them still do not have it.  That is the simple fact.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the State intervention.  I understand some companies will not move into areas but how will we control that process?  Private companies will tender for this contract.  How will we control that down the road?  We will have put money into this process.  The reality is that people in rural parts of Ireland cannot even get phone coverage.  There is no one to ring.  One can send e-mails to everybody but no one seems to answer them.  How can we ensure in the future that someone who supplies this broadband and is subsidised by the State is accountable to fulfil what they undertook to fulfil at the outset?<\/p> <p>  The Minister said he is trying to do it all together but if someone is building a house, they draw a plan elevation and in view and have a structure in terms of where they are going.  Have we anything to say that this is a hub for the west and this is the way we will cover each and every area, and the same in the east and the south?  The impression I am getting, and I may be picking it up the wrong way, is that we will have private operators who will come in the door and tell us what they intend to do.  We will then look at the parts they will not do and subside that part.  We need a strong plan in terms of where the hub for the west and the east will be located and how quickly that will be provided.  Will the Minister give an undertaking that if there are areas that are black spots, and some area has ten or 15 MGS currently, he will give priority to those black spots because they will never lift off the ground if they are left, as the saying, on the hind teat?<\/p> <p>  On energy, Bord na M&oacute;na made a big announcement during the week that it is moving away from peat for energy but I believe it has no plan.  An announcement has been made and from what I understand, we are looking at palm kernels from South Africa, which will mean money going out of the country again.  What does the Minister intend to do about that?<\/p> <p>  We welcome a budget for inland fisheries.  We welcome the provision of more staff but problems are being kicked around, and I refer to the Asian clam in Lanesboro, and the State agencies are passing the book to someone else and saying it is not their job.  At the end of the day, tourism is taking the hit for that.  I urge the Minister to encourage the inland fishery owners to sit down with different bodies.  There should be joined-up thinking on this matter.  I propose that Department representatives would sit down together at least once a month where they would focus on the same or similar issues and try to work together because in some cases the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#Q00200","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":990,"content":"<p>On the implementation strategy for national broadband, what I said earlier this year, and I want to make it clear, is that all of the timelines we have set regarding the national broadband plan since the middle of last year when I came into this job have been complied with.

We said that we would then engage in a pre-notification process to the European Commission, and we did.  The Commission is working closely with us.  In fact, my officials have confirmed that the Commission is satisfied with the way we are progressing matters.

The Commission will examine the matter.  It could do so in a period of two or three months or it could be a little longer.  I simply do not know.  We are somewhat in the hands of the Commission in terms of how quickly the officials there get back to us.  I had a schedule with me at one stage, although I do not have it with me today.

We brought a new date into play recently, which is an improvement on what we had been saying.  We are saying everything will be completed by 2020.  In addition to that commitment we are saying that 85% will be done by 2018.  That is an additional milestone - I will not use the word \"promise\".  In this business, we should not use the word \"promise\".  Anyway, that is a realistic target in my view.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate the frustration.  The Deputy asked me what has been happening all these years.  One thing we discover when we examine this in detail is that the ambition has been scaled up in terms of what we are doing.  Previous undertakings by previous Ministers were given in good faith based on where they were at the time but they were nothing like as ambitious as what we are discussing now.  We are talking about delivering this to every home and business.  We are talking about high-speed high-quality broadband.  All of the previous undertakings given at various stages were offered in good faith based on the information and the level of technological advancement at the time.  This is the most ambitious that we can conceivably be.  I have discussed the matter with people from other countries and I believe this is the top of the line in terms of what we are going to deliver for the people, particularly the people of rural Ireland.  We need people to keep faith with us.  We must hope that whoever is in the next Government and whoever is in this job will pick up the baton immediately and ensure that this is driven home.  We need the continuity and commitment.  We need the continuity that cross-party support for this project can ensure.  I say as much as a personal point.  We could do without any delays next year, when there will be a change of government.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to controlling the situation.  This is a contract.  People will not be paid until they do the job.  That is how we control it.  Unless a service provider is delivering high-speed broadband the organisation in question is not going to get paid.  That is the best control we can possibly have.<\/p> <p>  Can we prioritise different areas?  Yes, we can.  Let us consider the Chairman's remarks earlier.  In the bidding process we can nail down some of the issues about where the successful bidder will go first or what order of work the successful bidder will plan for.  We can weave into the bidding process a certain amount of prioritisation.  That relates to Deputy Harrington's point earlier as well.<\/p> <p>  There was a question relating to peat and bioenergy.  The Department produced and published a bioenergy plan in 2014.  I have had close contact with Bord na M&oacute;na in respect of its plans.  In fairness, the company has an impressive plan.  The plan is to migrate from the traditional activity, which was the burning of peat, to being a real leader in renewable energy in the areas of biomass, solar and wind.  Bord na M&oacute;na can use its extensive land bank to facilitate the development of the portfolio of renewable energy.  I met representatives of the company recently in Newbridge and I see them regularly.  They keep me informed on their plans.  Under the leadership of the chairman, John Horgan, and the new chief executive, Mike Quinn, I believe they are making great strides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015100700002#R00500","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1444206600,"counter":996,"content":"<p>Thank you.
