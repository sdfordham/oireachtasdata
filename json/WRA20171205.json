This has included using powers under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act to refer matters to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC). As the Deputy is aware GSOC is a statutory independent body and it is not open to me to intervene in, or comment on, their investigations. <\/p>  <p>  I can say that my predecessor gave an undertaking that should the investigations not address all matters of concern, the establishment of an Inquiry would be examined to address the substance of the allegations. That remains the position.<\/p>  <p>  I am of course anxious that any allegations of wrongdoing by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are properly and independently examined.\u00a0 I can assure the Deputy\u00a0that I am committed to ensuring that persons making disclosures will be supported and protected in the workplace. <\/p>  <p>  There has been significant change in the procedures for members of the Garda&iacute; who wish to report allegations of wrongdoing. In addition to the introduction of the Protected Disclosures Act, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been working with Transparency International Ireland and other external providers to improve their procedures. <\/p>  <p>  All of this points to significant changes in the regime for making protected disclosures by members of the Garda&iacute; and the significant protections afforded to those who make protected disclosures.\u00a0It may be the case that further reforms are necessary to strengthen these protections.

By any standards, this is a significant sum, particularly when compared to the spend in previous years -  &euro;91 million in 2016, &euro;56 million in 2015 and some &euro;37.7 million in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  Further, Budget 2018 provides for just under &euro;100 million in overtime next year.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure that the Deputy will agree that it is incumbent on Garda management to manage these substantial sums effectively for each financial year and I am satisfied that Garda management is acutely aware of the need to utilise the resources being made available to them in the most efficient and effective manner to ensure high visibility policing in our communities. This entails proper budgetary planning to ensure that the overtime requirements for any given year can be met in a managed and coherent way from the available resources.  This House votes the resources available to the Commissioner of the day.  It is his or her job as Commissioner and as Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote to manage those resources prudently.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that all Assistant Commissioners and Executive Directors were requested to ensure that the usage of overtime for the roster ending on 3 December did not exceed the annual budget of &euro;131 million which includes a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;42.5 million. <\/p>  <p>  I am further informed that there was no question of all overtime in the Dublin Metropolitan Region being cancelled for the remainder of 2017 as suggested by the Deputy. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that overtime worked in December actually falls due to be paid from the 2018 budget and, as I have indicated, just under &euro;100 million has been made available for overtime in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  I have also been assured by the Commissioner that any misunderstanding that arose internally in relation to the availability of necessary overtime in the period leading up to Christmas has been clarified by the relevant Assistant Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that overtime cannot be taken in isolation to the other resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  For example, a further 800 Gardai will have been recruited by the end of this year and Budget 2018 also provides for this level of continuing recruitment.

This is an increase of approximately 2% over the allocation for 2017 and includes, as I have stated, almost &euro;100 million for Garda overtime. Some &euro;1.61 billion was allocated to the Garda Vote for 2017 and &euro;1.55 billion in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  This demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. <\/p>  <p>  I am sure that the Deputy will agree that Garda management must continue to deliver on the extensive Garda Reform Programme that is currently underway and extract maximum benefit from the opportunities presented by that Programme, which is supported by unprecedented levels of public funding.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme is being facilitated by the Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  <\/p>  <p>  In particular, the increase in civilians will provide extensive opportunities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to redeploy significant numbers of Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to front-line duties thereby reducing the need for overtime proportionately. <\/p>  <p>  Further benefits will accrue from the proposed increase in the Garda Reserve.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to stress that, while this Government has not been found wanting in providing resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it remains incumbent on Garda management to manage effectively and efficiently the significant resources being made available to them. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will, of course, be keeping all aspects of the Garda Budget under close review in conjunction with Garda Management during the course of 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500065#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Offences","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500065#WRB02100"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[51499\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500065#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will report on anti-social and careless driving instances, including so-called \"boy racing\" and \"joy-riding\" around the country; if he will report on the measures taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat this behaviour, in particular organised gatherings for anti social driving events; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.\u00a0 I am deeply conscious of the serious issue of road safety and of the traumatic impact of road traffic collisions on those directly affected and their families.\u00a0 I am also mindful of the impact of dangerous driving, including anti-social driving, more generally on the quality of life of residents in local communities across the country. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I have no direct role in the enforcement of road traffic legislation, which is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner. I am informed that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as through a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies. Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including dangerous and anti-social driving.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am further informed, that, in addition to responding to all reports of anti-social and careless driving, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na conducts operations on an ongoing basis to target the anti-social activities of young drivers.\u00a0In order to combat this behaviour, intelligence is gathered at local level and areas are targeted as appropriate. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also works closely with local authorities with a view to reducing such incidents and opportunities for joy-riding, anti-social behaviour and public disorder. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to responding to individual anti-social\/joy-riding incidents, local\u00a0Garda management, including Superintendents with regional responsibility for roads policing, have developed specific and dedicated policing initiatives\u00a0to target\u00a0such behaviour, including MIT and rolling road checkpoints, whereby breaches of the Road Traffic Acts and transport regulations are detected; Fixed Charge Notices; criminal proceedings; or inclusion in the Juvenile Diversion Programme.\u00a0An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also gathers intelligence through routine policing patrols, community policing units and through the Divisional Criminal Intelligence Officer.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s National Roads Policing Operations Plan, puts plans, initiatives and operations in place, at national, regional, divisional and district level to protect the public from serious harm and ensure safety on our roads.\u00a0 This is done through a concentrated programme of high-visibility road safety and enforcement operations in partnership with other State agencies, including the Road Safety Authority, in order to meet the commitments contained in the Government's Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020, including the central\u00a0objective of reducing road deaths to no greater than 25 fatalities per million of population by end 2020. This equates to an average of 10.3 road deaths per month and 124 per year by end 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Progress in relation to the actions and outcomes set out in the Strategy are monitored on an ongoing basis by the Road Safety Authority and the other agencies involved, and overseen by a Ministerial Committee on Road Safety. The Committee is chaired by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, and I attend Committee meetings, along with the Attorney General, CEO of the Road Safety Authority (RSA), the Garda Commissioner (or a senior representative) and officials from other relevant bodies.\u00a0The Committee provides a forum for high-level discussion of road safety issues and will meet for the sixth time this year on 11\u00a0December 2017. \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Underpinning road traffic enforcement measures is\u00a0An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme (2016-2021), which\u00a0sets out key strategic objectives for Road Policing and informs and guides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's annual Road Policing plans to 2021. Under the Programme, the Garda Commissioner will undertake a number of road safety traffic enforcement initiatives, including expanding the use of technology and increasing checkpoints. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities as part of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.\u00a0Local policing measures to address the type of issues referred to by the Deputy will undoubtedly benefit from the resources now coming on stream through the Garda recruitment programme. The Government has commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000 so that the Commissioner has the capacity to address the needs of communities throughout the country and into the future.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I might add that, at the Policing Authority's most recent public meeting on 23 November, the Garda authorities reaffirmed\u00a0their commitment to increase the overall strength of Roads Policing Units by 10% prior to the end of 2017 and announced that a further 10% increase\u00a0is planned during the course of 2018. It is proposed to continue to increase the overall strength of Roads Policing Units each subsequent year until full operational strength is restored. <\/p>  <p>  Road safety is a shared responsibility; one which, as you are aware, the Government takes very seriously.\u00a0 Anyone affected by, or with information about, the matters referred to should, of course, contact their local Garda station. Alternatively, information can be provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by way of the Garda confidential line, 1800 666 111, which is a monitored freephone line that allows members of the public to contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with information of a confidential nature.\u00a0Alternatively, members of the public can call Crimestoppers on 1800 25 00 25 to report such\u00a0matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500065#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Service","counter":29,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500065#WRB02400"},{"type":"question","counter":30,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[51617\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500065#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason that services available to prisoners who have served their sentence and have been released are not made available to prisoners who have been exonerated; his plans to address this imbalance; the number of exonerated persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":31,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that there is no statutory basis to provide specific services to persons who have been held on bail but are subsequently released following an acquittal or other wise not convicted beyond that which would be provided to other prisoners, whether on remand, on bail, or upon release.<\/p>  <p>  Part 6 of the Prison Rules 2007 provides for the services which the Irish Prison Service must endeavour to provide for prisoners not serving a sentence.

Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who wish to make a protected disclosure may do so in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\u00a0 The\u00a0Act puts Garda&iacute; in the same position, including receiving the same statutory protections, as others who wish to make a protected disclosure about alleged wrongdoing. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure directly to GSOC.\u00a0 Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC, the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure.\u00a0 It is also open to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\u00a0to make a protected disclosure to me as Minister and I will consider it in the context of my Department's sectorial policy on protected disclosures. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda&iacute; who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.\u00a0 These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure. <\/p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published their Protected Disclosures Policy and all Garda members and civilians have been informed of this policy. In addition the Garda Commissioner has appointed a Protected Disclosures Manager who is supported with a dedicated and properly trained team.  <\/p>  <p>  In light of the public interest in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having robust policies and procedures in place to support and protect whistleblowers and to ensure that their complaints or allegations are fully investigated, my predecessor\u00a0asked the Policing Authority on 2 June 2016 to examine and report on the policies and procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with whistleblowers\/whistleblowing.\u00a0 She\u00a0also asked that they make any recommendations that they consider appropriate in order to ensure that the policies and procedures in place are appropriate and can provide assurance that whistleblowers can make complaints or allegations in a safe environment where their complaints or allegations are properly investigated.  <\/p>  <p>  The Policing Authority completed its review and reported to my predecessor\u00a0on 11 November, 2016.\u00a0 The Report was published on my Department's website and has been laid before both Houses in accordance with the Act. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have since published a revised policy document as result of the Report. <\/p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is committed to providing an environment in which protected disclosures can be made in full knowledge that persons making such disclosures will be supported and protected in the workplace. <\/p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been working with Transparency International Ireland and other external providers to create an environment to ensure that whistleblowers are properly protected and supported.

This will see Garda numbers reach the 14,000 mark by the end of 2018. <\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to\u00a0fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.\u00a0 There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0 We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cork North Division, in the coming years.<\/p><p><b>STRENGTH OF THE CORK NORTH DIVISION 31 OCTOBER 2017<\/b><table><tr><th>DISTRICT<\/th><th>STATION<\/th><th>TOTAL<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>FERMOY<\/td><td>BALLYNOE<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CASTLETOWNROCHE<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>FERMOY<\/td><td>62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>KILDORRERY<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>KILWORTH<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MITCHELSTOWN<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>RATHCORMAC<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>WATERGRASSHILL<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>90<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MALLOW<\/td><td>BUTTEVANT<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CHARLEVILLE<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>DONERAILE<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>GLANTAINE<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>KANTURK<\/td><td>22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>LISCARROLL<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MALLOW<\/td><td>61<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MILFORD<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>NEWMARKET<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>111<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MIDLETON<\/td><td>BALLYCOTTON<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CARRIGTWOHILL<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CLOYNE<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>COBH<\/td><td>36<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>KILLEAGH<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MIDLETON<\/td><td>51<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>WHITEGATE<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>YOUGHAL<\/td><td>23<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>116<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK NORTH TOTAL<\/td><td><\/td><td>317 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500066#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":75,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500066#WRC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[51500\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500066#WRC03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when it is expected that agreement will be reached to reopen Rush Garda station; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1300","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including responsibility for the formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the support of this Government continue to tackle criminal activity. Operations such as Thor and Hybrid have had success in tackling burglary and property crime, including rural crime\u00a0and gangland crime. Concentrated Garda actions\u00a0against criminal gangs have been illustrated by a number of notable\u00a0successes this year with a series of very significant drugs seizures\u00a0valued at over &euro;79.5 million, including the huge haul of illegal cannabis\u00a0valued at &euro;37.5 million seized at Dublin Port on 20 January 2017 and most\u00a0recently a significant seizure on the 15 November 2017 of &euro;7 million. <\/p>  <p>  The dedicated Armed Support Unit\u00a0for the Dublin Metropolitan Region was launched on 14 December 2016, and is now operational on a 24\/7 basis. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has\u00a0introduced new legislation including the Proceeds of Crime Amendment Act 2016 which provided greater powers to CAB in the fight against gangland crime, the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime Bill) 2016 which has been passed by the Oireachtas and I recently introduced the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Bill 2017. In addition the Criminal Justice\u00a0Act 2017 (changed from the Bail (Amendment) Bill 2016), which was enacted in June of this year, strengthens the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.\u00a0  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, the Court will be required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the grant of bail to a person charged with an offence, that carries\u00a0a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more.\u00a0 The Court will also have the power, in certain cases, to hear evidence from the victim of an offence before a decision on bail is taken.  <\/p>  <p>  Where an accused person is granted bail, the Act will provide for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, including the use of curfews,\u00a0strengthen Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail, and introduce electronic tagging for those on bail in certain circumstances where requested by Garda&iacute;.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that there is currently\u00a0an extensive programme of reform underway affecting all aspects of the administration and operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This follows the Government's approval in July 2016 of a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which combines the Government&rsquo;s response to the Garda Inspectorate report 'Changing Policing in Ireland' and the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government aimed at increasing the visibility, effectiveness and responsiveness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  The key structural change under the Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan is the replacement of the current District model of policing with a Divisional model where responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis, subject to modifications to ensure the close relationship with communities is maintained in both urban and rural areas. <\/p>  <p>  The Divisional model is being out on a phased basis starting with a pilot programme. The four Divisions of DMR South Central, Cork City, Galway and Mayo have been selected for the pilot in order to provide a mix of urban and rural policing environments. This new model \u00a0will support the more flexible and effective deployment of Garda\u00a0resources.<\/p>  <p>  The Policing Authority is overseeing the\u00a0implementation of the reform programme and reporting on a quarterly basis. It\u00a0latest progress report - its third which is available on my Department's website -\u00a0indicated positive progress has been made in the development and implementation of the Divisional\/functional model of policing and it is continuing to monitor progress in relation to the pilots, in particular any learnings which could be applied in advance of the national roll-out. The Authority has also indicated that it would like to see this project progressed more rapidly.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the only way to deliver world class policing in Ireland is to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs and that those resources operate in an organisation whose culture is open and responsive and where the best management systems and practices are deployed.\u00a0 I am confident that the reform plan, including the development of a functional model of policing that is being pursued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by the Government and overseen by the Policing Authority, has the capacity to achieve this. \u00a0It will not be done overnight but as I have made clear, the implementation of the ambitious reform programme, including the implementation of the Divisional model,\u00a0must continue and, indeed, must move at a greater pace, to ensure the best possible policing services to the people of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500066#WRC04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Alert Programme","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500066#WRC04100"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[51497\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500066#WRC04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to support community alert schemes from a financial aspect regarding the costs of the text scheme.","asker":"1220","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[51683\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500066#WRC04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to extend to all community groups funding for the text alert and community alert schemes (details supplied) in view of the fact that they play an invaluable service to the community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 101 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputies will be aware, the Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.

Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders.  <\/p><p>Since the Community\u00a0Text Alert scheme was launched in September 2013, it has developed as an important crime prevention mechanism with over 700 local groups involving in excess of 130,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month under the scheme.

Further consideration was also given to the inevitability of legal challenges to such action, the passage of time, and associated retirements, and poor data quality, which would all have additional delay, cost or other implications.  <\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner also informed the Authority that the decision to take a future-focused, restorative approach allowed An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to focus on strategic reforms, changes to culture and embedding the Code of Ethics and performance management system, along with improving data quality. <\/p>  <p>  He confirmed that he will be issuing a personal directive to all members stating that distortion of data quality and data breaches will amount to a serious disciplinary matter and could, at the most serious level, result in dismissal. The Commissioner also indicated that he would be specifically and individually writing to each Divisional manager to highlight their responsibilities in relation to supervision and accountability. <\/p>  <p>  The Government established the Policing Authority to ensure oversight of policing practices, shed light on problems and identify solutions through its structured engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Policing Authority's commentary on the Crowe Horwath report, where the Authority, in relation to this point, stated that \"poor performance on a pervasive scale can seldom be appropriately addressed by disciplinary processes\". The Authority further commented that the focus should be on implementing a meaningful performance management system for both Garda members and civilians in 2018, so that there is a framework for the delivery of policing plans and ensuring accountability.<\/p>  <p>  The Authority went on to indicate that, unless there is prima facie evidence of either a criminal offence or a disciplinary breach having been committed, the core focus for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should now be on rectifying the issues identified permanently across all dimensions, including procedures, technology, training, supervision and accountability.  I fully expect the Commissioner to urgently address the issues highlighted by myself, by Crowe Horwath and by the Policing Authority and I welcome the continuing  oversight of the Policing Authority in this respect. This Government has put in place significant Garda resources, both human and financial, but, as the Policing Authority has emphasised, cultural change within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is of critical importance.   This is why one of the Policing Authority&rsquo;s first acts was to introduce  Code of Ethics. Adherence to that Code must become a fundamental part of our policing.  I previously made clear to the Commissioner that Garda management must ensure that all members are committed to the values the Code sets out. I am confident that he and his colleagues understand the importance of ensuring that cultural change goes hand in hand with systemic improvements.  The Policing Authority has a critical role to play in supporting and overseeing this process. Moreover, it is important to remember that the expert Commission on the Future of Policing is undertaking a comprehensive review of policing in Ireland.  I have no doubt that this report will inform the Commission's work to bring about the transformation of policing in this country. However, I fully acknowledge the vital work undertaken everyday by the women and men of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure the safety and security of the people of Ireland. I remain dedicated to doing everything in my power as Minister, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, to ensure ethical and excellent policing, robust oversight and the modernisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure it can operate effectively and professionally in the public interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500066#WRC05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Magdalen Laundries","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500066#WRC05400"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[51731\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500066#WRC05500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his Department received a list of 107 women in the Galway Magdalen laundry in 1952 from the diocese of Galway in 2014 after being informed of its existence by a person (details supplied); the way in which he will ensure access to material for victims and their representatives as per the recommendation of UNCAT issued 11 August 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>I can confirm that my Department received the document referred to in this Parliamentary Question.

The Group will be drawn from\u00a0the membership of the Taskforce, supplemented by the participation of relevant operational areas in my own Department and in other Departments as required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500067#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":113,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500067#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[51661\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500067#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; in each Garda station in County Kildare as of 1 November 2017; the number of community garda&iacute; in the division; and the number of Garda Reserve and new recruits assigned to the division since recruitment resumed in 2014.","asker":"1323","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":115,"content":"<p>I should say at the outset that the distribution of Garda personnel\u00a0is exclusively the statutory responsibility of the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the Commissioner's responsibility for the distribution of Garda&iacute;, I have provided for the record a breakdown, in tabular form, of the detailed information requested by the Deputy as of 31 October 2017, the latest date for which information is readily available.<\/p><p>The Garda strength of the\u00a0Kildare Division on 31 October 2017 was 354 of whom\u00a04 are Community Garda&iacute;.

The Authority has informed the Inspectorate that the review should take account of: <\/p>  <p>  - the changing environments in rural, developing urban and suburban areas; <\/p>  <p>  - the views of local communities; <\/p>  <p>  - the allocation to and deployment of Garda resources at the local policing level, including the use of the Garda Reserve, Garda facilities and Garda equipment; and <\/p>  <p>  - relevant recommendations made in previous Inspectorate reports. <\/p>  <p>  The review will be comprehensive including a consultative process with local communities. It is the view of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate that the review should be completed within the first half of 2018. <\/p>  <p>  There is also\u00a0currently\u00a0an extensive programme of reform underway affecting all aspects of the administration and operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. As part of its Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government has agreed an overall vision for a Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. This very substantial investment in personnel is driven by our commitment to ensure all citizens have the reassurance of a visible, responsive and effective policing service. <\/p>  <p>  The projected number of 4,000 civilians will effectively double the current figure and represents a medium-term target of a Garda organisation 20% comprised of 20% civilians. That will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently 14% comprised of civilians, more in line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff.<\/p>  <p>  The 20% target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of, firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; and backfilling by suitably qualified civilians where necessary. The Garda Inspectorate has estimated that approximately 1,500 Garda&iacute; may be suitable for re-deployment and\u00a0the Government&rsquo;s plan aims to return as many of these Garda&iacute; as possible to front-line duties over the next five years. Work is in train on the development of a redeployment plan with the first batch of 43 Garda&iacute; to be redeployed already identified with a further 120 in the process of being identified. <\/p>  <p>  Funding for the recruitment of up to 500 civilians was provided in Budget 2017 to facilitate the Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional level.

This total is composed of 1,089 people from Greece, 623 people from Italy and 910 people as yet unallocated.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will meet in full its commitment to Greece.\u00a0 693 of the allocation of 1,089 are already in the State,\u00a0with\u00a0a further 62 persons scheduled for arrival in December 2017.\u00a0 By early 2018,\u00a0it is expected that Ireland will have relocated its entire cohort from Greece (1,089), subject of course to the Greek authorities submitting the small number of remaining case files to Ireland and the ability of local authorities to find homes in communities around Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  However, Italy, unlike Greece, did\u00a0 not permit security assessments to be undertaken by other States on its territory. Accordingly, Ireland has been unable to undertake security assessments in Italy\u00a0of the asylum seeker cohort eligible for relocation to Ireland.\u00a0 It has therefore not been possible for Ireland to take asylum seekers from Italy despite the most intensive efforts by Ireland to resolve the impasse, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the unallocated portion contained in the two EU Council Decisions referred to above, which in the case of Ireland amounts to \u00a0910 persons,\u00a0 Ireland could not access this component because no decision was ever taken at EU level to allocate these numbers as between Greece and Italy.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, by the end of the two-year EU Relocation Programme in September 2017, just 37,000 asylum seekers were eligible and registered for relocation in Italy and Greece out of an total of 160,000 comprehended in the two Council Decisions, of which 78% (approximately 29,000) had been relocated to other EU Member States including Ireland. It should be noted that proportionally Ireland has taken one of the highest numbers under the EU Relocation Programme. Once the final transfers from Greece take place early next year, Ireland will have relocated more than 3% of the EU&rsquo;s total figure. This represents a strong commitment by Ireland to EU solidarity, given that we represent less than 1% of the total population of the EU.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has worked\u00a0to give effect to the EU relocation Decisions and will fill any gaps arising from the relocation instruments using other mechanisms such as pledges for resettlement of\u00a0programme refugees. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the integration and welfare of refugees in the Programme, following their arrival in Ireland, they are for a time\u00a0accommodated in an Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC).\u00a0 As the name suggests, an EROC is largely about reception and orientation for those who are to be subsequently settled around the country. IRPP staff hold regular clinics in the EROCs, often at weekly intervals,\u00a0at which\u00a0individuals and families may discuss their\u00a0needs and requirements. <\/p>  <p>  Some of the key features of supports provided to\u00a0persons under\u00a0the\u00a0Programme\u00a0include:<\/p>  <p>  - IRPP staff and\u00a0interpreters, along with representatives\u00a0of the\u00a0Irish Red Cross, \u00a0meet families and individuals upon arrival at Dublin Airport and accompany them to their accommodation in the\u00a0Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre.<\/p>  <p>  - During the days following arrival in Ireland\u00a0the asylum seekers are registered with the Department of Social Protection for a public services card and receive an exceptional needs payment (ENP).<\/p>  <p>  - IRPP officials provide assistance to ensure that families and individuals receive a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  - IRPP liaise with the local Education and Training Board in each catchment area to ensure that groups receive a Language Training and Cultural Orientation programme.<\/p>  <p>  - Local Service Providers, volunteers and NGOs visit the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres to provide services and\u00a0information and to support and befriend the asylum seekers\/refugees.<\/p>  <p>  - A GP is assigned\u00a0to the individuals and families\u00a0to ensure that that their immediate \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 medical needs are met including referral to dental and optical services.<\/p>  <p>  - Free Childcare is provided wherever possible to allow the adults to attend the Language and Orientation programme in their EROC.<\/p>  <p>  - Education provision is made for school age children by the Department of Education\u00a0and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  - Emergency\u00a0medical matters are followed up while resident in the EROCs.<\/p>  <p>  - Once the asylum\u00a0seekers receive refugee status and when housing is made available with the\u00a0support of the Local Authority, the refugees are resettled in the\u00a0community.  Upon the first movement of a family to a local community, IRPP support workers remain in the area for a number of days to help the family settle in\u00a0and to manage the necessary introductions to various service providers.  Every\u00a0local authority in which a resettlement takes place also appoints an &ldquo;implementing\u00a0partner&rdquo; which is funded by the IRPP and the EU Asylum, Migration and\u00a0Integration Fund (AMIF).  Under this arrangement, each family\u00a0has the support of a full-time Resettlement Support Worker and an Intercultural\u00a0Support Worker to assist with the transition.  Local authorities also\u00a0receive funding to provide for exceptional needs such as counselling,\u00a0\u00a0transport and other supports.<\/p>  <p>  Increasingly, the Programme is focusing on initiatives which assist with labour market activation for refugees and is working with the Irish Red Cross and other bodies to facilitate access to employment. Various initiatives are also developing in the educational sphere.<\/p>  <p>  The current model of integration and support under the Programme is one which will evolve and develop over the coming months and years with a view to offering refugees increasing opportunities to enhance their own lives. \u00a0However, I am very supportive of initiatives such as community sponsorship to support the long-term integration process and my officials are actively working with various NGO groups with the intention of implementing such a programme in 2018.\u00a0 Such a programme has already been highly successful in Canada.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to integration more generally,\u00a0the\u00a0Migrant Integration Strategy which was published on\u00a07 February 2017 sets out the Government&rsquo;s approach to the issue of migrant integration for the period from 2017 to 2020.\u00a0 It envisages a whole-of-Government approach involving actions by all Departments.\u00a0 It is targeted at all migrants, including refugees, who are legally residing in the State.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Strategy sets as its vision that migrants are facilitated to play a full role in Irish society, that integration is a core principle of Irish life and that Irish society and institutions work together to promote integration.\u00a0 Integration is understood to be a two-way process that involves action by migrants as well as by Irish society.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy contains 76 actions under a variety of themes including citizenship and residency, access to public services and social inclusion, education, employment and pathways to work, health, integration in the community, political participation, promoting intercultural awareness and combating racism and xenophobia, volunteering and sport.<\/p>  <p>  It is intended that the actions will be delivered by Government Departments, local authorities, public bodies, local communities, the business sector, sporting and arts organisations and NGOs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500068#WRE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":198,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500068#WRE03000"},{"type":"question","counter":199,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[51493\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500068#WRE03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number and position of garda&iacute; and community garda&iacute; stationed in the Dublin metropolitan region west in each of the years 2009 to 2016, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":200,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013.  The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly some serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. <\/p>  <p>  The \"Programme for a Partnership Government\" includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures.  In line with this the Government has in place a plan to achieve a Reserve strength of 2,000 by 2021.  I am pleased that Budget 2018 will facilitate the strengthening of the Reserve next year with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018 following the undertaking of a recruitment campaign earlier this year.<\/p>  <p>  In conjunction with the major expansion of the Reserve over the next number of years we must ensure that it is used to optimum effect to support effective policing.  To inform future decisions around the use of the Reserve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a strategic review as a matter of priority with a view to completion before the end of this year.  As a first step the Garda Executive has taken a decision to transfer the management of the Reserve from the Human Resource and People Development Directorate to the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for Community Engagement.  This is intended to ensure that its development and deployment is viewed more broadly through a community policing lens.  This is a very welcome step as it is my strong view that the greatest dividend to be gained from the Reserve is in terms of a visible presence on the ground engaging with local communities.<\/p>  <p>  The review will take cognisance of the changed environment in which the expanded Reserve will operate as the major reform programme that is underway is implemented.  These reforms include the\u00a0drive towards a medium term target of 20% civilians by 2021 to boost the management capacity of the organisation and to free up Garda&iacute; to front-line policing duties, and also the phased implementation of the Divisional model of policing to enable resources to be deployed more efficiently to prevent and detect crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500068#WRE04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Data","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500068#WRE04200"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[51752\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500068#WRE04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of asylum and immigration cases that are being held up or pending approval while awaiting the judgment of the appeal to the Supreme Court of the Court of Appeal judgment in a case (details supplied); and the status of those persons waiting for decisions dependent on that appeal.","asker":"1294","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":212,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that persons seeking permission to remain in the State may do so for a number of reasons to various Divisions of the INIS\u00a0under both statutory and non-statutory provisions.\u00a0 As a result, as the Deputy would expect, every case is considered on its own merits in conjunction with the legislation, criteria or guidelines which are directly applicable to the individual case type.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The issues raised in the court case referred to by the Deputy, which is currently before the Supreme Court,\u00a0has the potential to generate further sets of legal proceedings and, as such, the INIS deemed it prudent to postpone decision making in certain immigration cases until the matters before the Courts have been finalised.<\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to quantify the precise numbers of such cases as to do so would require the deployment of a disproportionate level of limited resources to the task.

Releases are published at the same time each day, 11.00 am, and pre-release access is strictly controlled in an open and transparent manner.

for example, sufficient profit levels to absorb credit losses over the credit cycle while still generating capital.\u00a0 In Ireland, the mis-pricing of risks in historical lending continues to be a significant contributor to weak profitability, as evidenced by the continued high level of non-performing loans, prevalence of very low yielding tracker mortgages, and low net interest margins.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the residential mortgage market comprises, inter alia, fixed interest rate, loan to value managed variable rate mortgages, trackers, restructured mortgages of various types, etc.\u00a0 Therefore, the residential mortgage market cannot be assessed by only looking at standard variable rate mortgages, and any assessment would need to consider the large number of different factors that influence interest rate pricing.<\/p><p>The legacy issues, together with other input costs to variable rate mortgage pricing were outlined in a paper provided by the Central Bank to the Minister for Finance in May 2015.\u00a0 These include higher costs from credit losses, higher funding costs, higher levels of capital resulting from regulatory changes, higher required capital per euro risk given the severe loss experience in the crisis, higher operating costs per euro of loans given falling balance sheets and the fixed costs base that comes with the infrastructure requirements of large retail banks.<\/p><p>The Central Bank requires that all mortgages are advertised and sold in accordance with the requirements of financial services legislation (including Central Bank Codes), and that consumers who choose a given mortgage product (or to switch to a new product) are treated in accordance with these requirements in the context of the product they have chosen. <\/p><p>Additionally, the Central Bank has carried out research, which showed the scope for borrowers to save money by switching mortgages and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has launched a mortgage switching tool for consumers (which itself notes the findings of the Central Bank research of cases where borrowers could make savings).\u00a0<\/p><p>The\u00a0Central Bank releases monthly retail interest rate data (Tables B1.1 - B2.1). These statistics satisfy reporting requirements as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1072\/2013 of 24 September 2013 (ECB\/2013\/34) as amended by Regulation of the ECB of 8 July 2014 (ECB\/2014\/30), concerning statistics on interest rates applied by monetary financial institutions (MFIs) to deposits and loans vis-&agrave;-vis households and non-financial corporations.  The most recent statistics are available on centralbank.ie.  <\/p><p>- In addition, following a public consultation process, on 21 July 2016, the Central Bank announced the introduction of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders.  The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, and became effective on 1 February 2017, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase.  The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.<\/p><p>In late 2016, the Central Bank commissioned research into consumer perceptions and attitudes to mortgage switching, as well as the experience of those who had switched.  The Central Bank conducted the research to help identify areas where further action by the Central Bank could assist borrowers who are considering switching their mortgage.  The Central Bank <i>published the report on the research findings in April 2017.  <\/i>The report contained several positive findings from consumers who had switched their mortgage.  However, it also highlighted the need for greater transparency for consumers, both about the potential savings they could make by switching and the switching process itself.<\/p><p>In August 2017, the Central Bank\u00a0published a proposing new measures which would enhance the framework of protections for mortgage holders.  In that consultation the Central Bank proposed new measures to require lenders to:  <\/p><p>- inform consumers about other available mortgage options that could save them money and about the impact of mortgage-related incentives;  <\/p><p>- help consumers to compare their existing mortgage to other mortgage options;  <\/p><p>- provide consumers with standardised switching information; and  <\/p><p>- follow a time-bound switching process.<\/p><p>The consultation period has now ended, and the Central Bank is now analysing the responses it received and is considering next steps.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500070#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Assessments","counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500070#WRG02600"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[51611\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500070#WRG02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the case of a person (details supplied) will be reviewed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":283,"content":"<p>Local Property Tax (LPT) is payable on the market value of residential properties at 1 May 2013.

This is an EU competency and the Government has committed to work with our EU counterparts in seeking to reform this area.<\/p>  <p>  Defibrillators, other than implantable defibrillators, are liable to VAT at the standard rate, which in Ireland is 23%.  Parts or accessories are also liable to VAT at the standard rate.  There is no provision under existing VAT law that would make it possible to apply a reduced rate or zero rate to the supply of such products.  Under the EU VAT Directive, member States may retain the zero rate on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  As such a zero rate cannot be applied to defibrillators.  Any changes to VAT rates outside of what is currently permitted by the EU VAT Directive must be negotiated at EU technical working groups and ultimately agreed by the EU Council of Finance Ministers.<\/p>  <p>   As part of the Action Plan on the future of VAT on 7 April 2016 which sets out the Commission&rsquo;s pathway for modernising the VAT system, the EU Commission is due to publish a proposal on the reform of VAT rates in January 2018.  Earlier in the year, preliminary details of the proposed changes were discussed as part of the EU Commission&rsquo;s Group on the Future of VAT, a forum for consulting VAT experts from member States on pre-legislative initiatives.  Officials from the Department of Finance contributed to these discussions.  With regard to what activity should be subject to a reduced rate of VAT going forward, Ireland specifically recommended to the Commission to include defibrillators and other emergency-medical and rescue equipment. <\/p>  <p>  After the Commission proposal is published, technical and political discussions will commence at EU Council among all Member States and Ireland will take the opportunity to continue to recommend that member States should be able to apply specialised VAT rating to defibrillators and other emergency-medical and rescue equipment.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of any change that might be made at EU level to the VAT rating of defibrillators and other products that pose difficulty for community groups, I am happy to draw your attention to the Budget 2018 announcement of a VAT compensation refund scheme, which will compensate charities for the VAT they occur on their inputs, in recognition of the work undertaken by the charities sector. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme will take effect from 1 January 2018 but will be paid one year in arrears.  That is, charities may make a claim in 2019 for VAT costs arising in 2018. Charities will be entitled to a proportion of VAT based on the level of non-public funding they receive.  A capped fund of &euro;5 million will be available to the scheme in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is very committed to supporting community groups and we will continue to press for a reduction in the VAT rate on defibrillators at EU level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500071#WRH01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500071#WRH01700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Monuments","counter":313,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500071#WRH01600"},{"type":"question","counter":314,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[51827\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500071#WRH01700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when a final response will issue to an interim reply (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":315,"content":"<p>The conservation and presentation of National Monuments in the care of the State is managed by the Office of Public Works.

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.

As with the new DEIS Identification process the verification process was also a scientific exercise which involved checking the school data, as used in the Identification process, in terms of the quality and accuracy of the data supplied.

In addition, as a longer term measure, under my Department&rsquo;s Gaeltacht Policy, an RFT is currently being developed for a new Irish-medium B.Ed. (primary teaching) ITE programme.<\/p>  <p>  In the school year, 2016\/17, circa 950 retired teachers were employed in schools.  The vast majority of retired teachers undertake very short periods of teaching. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24 of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012).  The policy of my Department is to ensure, as far as possible, that the Managerial Authorities of Primary and Post Primary schools give priority to unemployed registered teachers who are fully qualified when filling vacant teaching posts.\u00a0 My Department has issued a number of Circulars addressing this issue in recent years.  Circular 31\/2011 details a cascade of measures for the recruitment of teachers, prioritising registered teachers over retired registered teachers and unregistered people.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>In accordance with the normal arrangements which apply to retired public servants who take up public sector work, abatement applies where the combined earning exceed the pay on which the pension is based.\u00a0 Retired teachers, who undertake casual or intermittent teaching subsequent to retirement are paid at the casual rate generally.  Where they undertake teaching for a more substantial period they are then placed on the 1st point of the post-February 2012 pay scale.<\/p>  <p>  I am currently reviewing with my Department other potential initiatives on teacher supply.  In that context my Department has engaged with the HEA with a view to obtaining baseline data to support future policy decisions in this area.  My Department also intends engaging with other stakeholders, including school management bodies, in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500074#WRL01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":429,"content":"<p>Question No. 192 answered with Question No. 174.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"DEIS Applications","counter":430,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500074#WRL01700"},{"type":"question","counter":431,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[51608\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500074#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason a school (details supplied) located in south-west County Donegal has failed to obtain DEIS status; the way in which each of the feeder schools to the school are designated DEIS but the school is not; if his attention has been drawn to the recent poverty and disadvantage reports into south-west County Donegal which is the catchment area of the school in question; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":432,"content":"<p>We have, for the first time, introduced an objective, statistics based model for deciding which schools merit inclusion in the DEIS Programme, so that all stakeholders can have confidence that we are targeting extra resources at those schools with the highest concentrated levels of disadvantage.<\/p><p>The key data sources used in the DEIS identification process are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.

The Report sets out a number of proposals to develop a long term sustainable funding model.\u00a0I look forward to receiving the Committee's recommendations. This will\u00a0assist in facilitating informed decision-making for the future direction of funding for higher education.<\/p>  <p>  While the Committee are undertaking this important work, I have been working in the interim to secure additional funding for higher education to address, inter alia, rising demographics. This\u00a0commitment is reflected in the recent Budget 2018 announcement\u00a0in which the higher education sector will benefit from a total\u00a0investment package of &euro;60m in additional funding in 2018. This funding is on top of the\u00a0&euro;36.5m that I\u00a0secured for 2017 and which is being provided again in 2018. In total, we will be investing &euro;100m more in higher education in 2018 than in 2016. This additional funding will allow for targeted\u00a0initiatives in higher education and will allow for places to be provided for 2,100 additional students in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, the Government increased Exchequer funding to higher education by &euro;36.5 million and announced a consultation exercise to consider an Employer-Exchequer Investment Mechanism.\u00a0 This reflected the recommendation in the Report of \u00a0the Expert Group on Future Funding of Higher Education that a structured contribution from employers should form a key element of future funding for higher education as employers are major beneficiaries of higher education.<\/p>  <p>  Following a public consultation process on a proposed Exchequer-Employer Investment Mechanism earlier this year , it was announced in Budget 2018 that the National Training Fund levy will be raised by 0.1% in 2018 from 0.7% to 0.8% and by a further 0.1% in both 2019 and 2020. This measure allows for additional expenditure of &euro;47.5 million from the Fund in 2018. The 2019 and 2020 levy increases will be subject to the implementation of the necessary reforms to ensure that employers have a greater role in determining the priorities and the strategic direction of the Fund.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Exchequer will also make an additional investment of &euro;17m in 2018.\u00a0 Together this will facilitate an increase of &euro;64.5 million in the Department&rsquo;s expenditure ceiling.\u00a0 This will be used to fund initiatives in the higher education system including targeted skills programmes, performance and innovation funding, technological university development and apprenticeship costs in the higher education sector.<\/p>  <p>  Also, following the review of the Capital Plan, a total of &euro;357m in capital funding is now available for investment in higher education over the period 2018-2021.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0As set out in the Programme for Government, this comprehensive approach is being taken in order to achieve a sustainable funding model for the higher education sector going forward.

By any standards, this is a significant sum, particularly when compared to the spend in previous years -\u00a0 &euro;91 million in 2016, &euro;56 million in 2015 and some &euro;37.7 million in 2014.<\/p><p>Further, Budget 2018 provides for just under &euro;100 million in overtime next year.<\/p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree that it is incumbent on Garda management to manage these substantial sums effectively for each financial year and I am satisfied that Garda management is acutely aware of the need to utilise the resources being made available to them in the most efficient and effective manner to ensure high visibility policing in our communities.  This entails proper budgetary planning to ensure that the overtime requirements for any given year can be met in a managed and coherent way from the available resources.  This House votes the resources available to the Commissioner of the day.\u00a0 It is his or her job as Commissioner and as Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote to manage those resources prudently.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that all Assistant Commissioners and Executive Directors were requested to ensure that the usage of overtime for the roster ending on 3 December did not exceed the annual budget of &euro;131 million which includes a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;42.5 million.  <\/p><p>I am further informed that there was no question of all overtime in the Dublin Metropolitan Region being cancelled for the remainder of 2017.  <\/p><p>It is important to note that overtime worked in December actually falls due to be paid from the 2018 budget and, as I have indicated, just under &euro;100 million has been made available for overtime in 2018.  <\/p><p>I have also been assured by the Commissioner that any misunderstanding that arose internally in relation to the availability of necessary overtime in the period leading up to Christmas has been clarified by the relevant Assistant Commissioner.<\/p><p>It is also important to note that overtime cannot be taken in isolation to the other resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>For example, a further 800 Garda&iacute; will have been recruited by the end of this year and Budget 2018 also provides for this level of continuing recruitment.  Provision has also been made for significant civilian recruitment which will allow for the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from behind desks to the front-line to do what they have been trained and are being paid to do.<\/p><p>Indeed, some &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018.  This is an increase of approximately 2% over the allocation for 2017 and includes, as I have stated,\u00a0almost &euro;100 million for Garda overtime.  Some &euro;1.61 billion was allocated to the Garda Vote for 2017 and &euro;1.55 billion in 2016.<\/p><p>This demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.\u00a0<\/p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree that Garda management must continue to deliver on the extensive Garda Reform Programme that is currently underway and extract maximum benefit from the opportunities presented by that Programme, which is supported by unprecedented levels of public funding.<\/p><p>The Programme is being facilitated by the Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.<\/p><p>In particular, the increase in civilians will provide extensive opportunities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to redeploy significant numbers of Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to front-line duties thereby reducing the need for overtime proportionately.  <\/p><p>Further benefits will accrue from the proposed increase in the Garda Reserve.<\/p><p>I would like to stress that, while this Government has not been found wanting in providing resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it remains incumbent on Garda management to manage effectively and efficiently the significant resources being made available to them.  <\/p><p>My Department will, of course, be keeping all aspects of the Garda Budget under close review in conjunction with Garda Management during the course of 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500078#WRP02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Data","counter":585,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500078#WRP02400"},{"type":"question","counter":586,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[51856\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500078#WRP02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of freedom of information requests received by his Department to date in 2017;

As I set out below significant issues arose with that mechanism which made it impossible for Ireland to deliver on the numbers allocated to it, primarily because those numbers do not actually exist on the ground in the relevant counties.\u00a0\u00a0Hence, the Government has had to find other mechanisms to deliver on the commitment by Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Under the\u00a0programme refugee resettlement strand of the Programme, 357 persons arrived in Ireland during 2016.\u00a0 Taken together with the previous year's intake,\u00a0Ireland had taken in 519 of its\u00a0original commitment of 520 by the end of 2016, a year ahead of schedule.\u00a0 Last year, the Government doubled its commitment under resettlement to 1,040 and the total to have arrived from Lebanon under refugee resettlement now stands at 785.\u00a0 The balance are expected to arrive in early 2018.  The European Commission recognises Ireland as being one of only seven EU Member States to have fulfilled their resettlement pledges from the July 2015 Agreement.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland committed to accept 2,622 asylum seekers under the relocation strand of the\u00a0IRPP.  This total was composed of 1,089 people from Greece, 623 people from Italy and 910 people that were &ldquo;unallocated&rdquo; by the Commission.  Ireland plans to meet in full its commitment to Greece.\u00a0 Some 693 of the allocation of 1,089 are already in the State,\u00a0with a further 62 persons scheduled for arrival in December 2017.\u00a0 By early 2018,\u00a0it is expected that Ireland will have relocated its entire cohort from Greece (1,089), subject of course to the Greek authorities submitting the small number of remaining case files to Ireland and the ability of local authorities to find homes in communities around Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  However, Italy, unlike Greece, did\u00a0 not permit security assessments to be undertaken by other States on its territory.  Accordingly, Ireland has been unable to undertake security assessments in Italy\u00a0of the asylum seeker cohort eligible for relocation to Ireland.\u00a0 It has therefore not been possible for Ireland to take asylum seekers from Italy despite the most intensive efforts by Ireland to resolve the impasse, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the unallocated portion contained in the two EU Council Decisions referred to above, which in the case of Ireland amounts to \u00a0910 persons,\u00a0 Ireland could not access this component because no decision was ever taken at EU level to allocate these numbers as between Greece and Italy.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, the Deputy may wish to note that by the end of the two-year EU Relocation Programme in September 2017, just 37,000 asylum seekers were eligible and registered for relocation in Italy and Greece out of an total of 160,000 comprehended by the two Council Decisions, of which 78% (approximately 29,000) had been relocated to other EU Member States including Ireland.  It should be noted that proportionally Ireland has taken one of the highest numbers under the EU Relocation Programme.  Once the final transfers from Greece take place early next year, Ireland will have relocated more than 3% of the EU&rsquo;s total figure.  This represents a strong commitment by Ireland to EU solidarity, given that we represent less than 1% of the total population of the EU.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has worked\u00a0to give effect to the EU relocation decisions and will fill any gaps arising from the relocation instruments using other mechanisms such as pledges for resettlement of\u00a0programme refugees.\u00a0 To address the balance of approximately 1,800 people under the IRPP, which arises largely due to the significantly smaller number of asylum seekers eligible and registered under the EU relocation programme, I have recently announced additional resettlement pledges for 2018 and 2019 amounting to an additional commitment of about 945 refugees, and the establishment of a new Family Reunification Humanitarian Admission Programme (FRHAP).  The resettlement pledges are the largest commitments for resettlement that we have made in a calendar year since our national resettlement programme began in 2000.  They have been made in the context of a European Commission\/UNHCR resettlement pledging exercise for 2018\/2019, which aims to provide 50,000 resettlement places across the European Union over the two-year period.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is also aware, following the adoption of the All-Party Motion last November, on the Calais Unaccompanied Minors, a concerted effort has been made to provide a pathway here for such unaccompanied minors who wished to come to Ireland.  The Departments of\u00a0 Children and Youth Affairs and Justice and Equality established the Calais Special Project within Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  Working directly with the French authorities, any unaccompanied minors who have been identified as suitable for relocation here have been accepted and provided with the appropriate supports and no unaccompanied minor who has asked to come to Ireland has been refused.  A total of 30 young persons have been relocated under this programme to date.  There are an additional 11 children who have been assessed and are awaiting security clearance before travel arrangement can be made for them.  In addition to the children that have been brought to Ireland under the Calais Special Project an additional six young people from Syria have been admitted to Ireland under the EU Relocation Programme from Greece.<\/p>  <p>  In all the circumstances,\u00a0I can state that Ireland is making\u00a0every possible effort to meet its commitments, the commitment by Ireland to accept 4,000 persons remains and that Ireland will fill any gaps arising from the relocation instruments using other mechanisms such as pledges for resettlement of\u00a0programme refugees.\u00a0 I am reasonably confident that Ireland will meet its commitments by 2019 in this area now that Ireland can take its own initiatives to achieve the targets set out in the Government Decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500078#WRP03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tribunals of Inquiry","counter":598,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500078#WRP03800"},{"type":"question","counter":599,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[51906\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500078#WRP03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the operation of the Charleton\u00a0liaison committee; his further views on whether it should continue to operate and that it is functioning in a fair manner for all; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":600,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[51907\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500078#WRP04000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on a matter relating to answers to parliamentary questions (details supplied); and if he plans to make changes to those replies.","asker":"1349","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":601,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[51908\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500078#WRP04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the date and the ways in which his attention was drawn to the concerns expressed regarding the operation of the Charleton liaison committee at the Committee of Public Accounts on 23 November 2017; the actions he took regarding these concerns as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[51909\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500078#WRP04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the Garda Commissioner communicated concerns regarding the operation of the Charleton liaison committee recently; if so, when he will act on such concerns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":603,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[52053\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500078#WRP04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on whether the manner in which the Charleton liaison committee was set up was appropriate; and if he will continue to fund its operations.","asker":"1276","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":604,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 256 to 259, inclusive, and 284 together.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly,\u00a0I am aware\u00a0that\u00a0Deputy sought to raise this matter at the Committee of Public Account on Thursday 23 November last.\u00a0\u00a0I understand that while there was\u00a0some discussion at the Committee, this was relatively\u00a0brief.  I also understand that the Chair of the Committee\u00a0concluded that the matter was not appropriate for discussion by the Committee at this time but could arise for discussion next year in the context of the 2017 Appropriations Account.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequent\u00a0to the Public Accounts Committee, the Garda\u00a0Commissioner made a report to me\u00a0under section 41(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005\u00a0on Monday 27 November last.  The report forwarded a document that detailed concerns in relation to the operation of the Tribunal Co-ordination Office.  This is something I treat with the utmost seriousness and in that regard I instructed that the\u00a0contents of the\u00a0report\u00a0be referred to the Disclosures Tribunal.  That was done on Wednesday 29 November.\u00a0The report\u00a0was also referred to the Office of the Attorney General.  The Taoiseach was made aware of the contents of the report\u00a0by\u00a0the Secretary to the Government.  <\/p>  <p>  Since its receipt my Department has been considering the contents of the report.  On foot of that examination I\u00a0intend to write to\u00a0the Commissioner requesting\u00a0a full report addressing each of the issues raised in the document.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's previous parliamentary questions on this matter,\u00a0the replies I have provided are available on the public record.  I have answered all questions put to me fully and accurately based on\u00a0the information available to me at the time.<\/p>  <p>  It is the  Commissioner who has statutory responsibility to carry on and manage and control generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Accordingly, the putting in place of internal structures to service the Tribunal is a matter for the Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  I do not believe it would be proper for me as Minister to prescribe the approach which is taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the Tribunal.\u00a0 Indeed, I would be open to criticism if I were to seek to influence how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fulfil their duties to the Tribunal.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that it is not\u00a0in any way unreasonable that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an organisation should put in place a structure to help meet their obligations to cooperate with the Tribunal, particularly in respect of the discovery of relevant documentation.  Mr Justice Charleton covered the arguments around this principle when he heard applications for representation last March.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to keep in mind that there is nothing in the arrangements put in place by the Commissioner to deny, nor could they, the right of any individual member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make any representations they see fit, relevant to its terms of reference, directly to the Tribunal.\u00a0 This includes any complaint by\u00a0any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the arrangements in place for their representation at the Tribunal.<\/p>  <p>  On a general note I would reiterate that the Government has been anxious to ensure that the Tribunal receives the greatest degree of assistance possible from all parties, not least An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To that end the Government\u00a0was supportive of the former Commissioner, and continues to support the acting Commissioner, in ensuring that the required resources are at the disposal of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to service the Tribunal in a timely and effective manner.\u00a0 The then Commissioner identified that the requirements of the Tribunal could best be met by the re-engagement of a small number of retired persons and my Department approved this in February 2017, subject to formal sanction, which was conveyed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform\u00a0on\u00a05\u00a0May 2017.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The formal sanction provided for the engagement of three persons (i.e. two retired members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and one civilian) for up to\u00a0nine months for the purposes of servicing the Tribunal.  I am advised that the services of two retired senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (one\u00a0retired Assistant Commissioner and\u00a0one retired Chief Superintendent)\u00a0were engaged initially for a period of six months and then for a further period of three months to 30 November 2017 in accordance with the formal sanction.  Their contracts fully complied with pension abatement\u00a0regulations.  Both former officers concerned have now left their posts\u00a0in full compliance with the sanction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500078#WRP04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":606,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500079#WRQ00400"},{"type":"question","counter":607,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[51919\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500079#WRQ00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there has been an assessment or audit of the costs that the almost 2 million false breath tests have had on the Garda budget; if overtime payments were made to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while carrying out the fake breath tests; if there was a reduction in policing services to the public due to the fake breath test scandal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Commissioner informed the Authority that the decision to take a future-focused, restorative\u00a0approach allowed An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to focus on strategic reforms, changes to culture and embedding the Code of Ethics and performance management system, along with improving data quality.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government established the Policing Authority to ensure oversight of policing practices, shed light on problems and identify solutions through its structured engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

This Government has put in place significant\u00a0Garda resources, both human and financial, but, as the Policing Authority has emphasised, cultural change within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is of critical importance.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This is why one of the Policing Authority&rsquo;s first acts was to introduce a Garda Code of Ethics.  Adherence to that code must become a fundamental part of our policing.

I am confident that he and his colleagues understand the importance of ensuring that cultural change goes hand in hand with systemic improvements.  The Policing Authority has a critical role to play in supporting and overseeing this process.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, it is important to remember that the expert Commission on the Future of Policing is undertaking a significant root and branch analysis of policing in Ireland.

In these reports, the Acting Inspector notes\u00a0that she has\u00a0encountered prisoners on various restricted regimes and that\u00a0she recognises the challenge faced by the Irish Prison Service in seeking to keep these prisoners in safe and secure custody.  She also\u00a0states that\u00a0her office\u00a0will continue to monitor the regimes of such prisoners to ensure compliance with the law and their human rights. <\/p><p>The restriction of a prisoner's regime can\u00a0arise is\u00a0a number of circumstances.  Such restrictions are as\u00a0provided for in the 2007 Prison Rules, as amended.  For example, Rule 63 provides that a regime can be restricted so as to provide for the protection of vulnerable prisoners.  In this case the prisoner may either at his own request or when the Governor considers it necessary - \u00a0in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody - \u00a0be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him\/her. <\/p><p>Rule 62 provides a further example of a restricted regime.  This is\u00a0where the Governor may decide, for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that a prisoner or prisoners may have on the general population.A smaller number of prisoners\u00a0may have their\u00a0regimes\u00a0restricted for medical (Rule 64) or discipline reasons (Rule 67). <\/p><p>The Prison Rules 2007 provide that the imposition of\u00a0restricted regimes\u00a0is closely monitored by the Irish Prison Service (IPS).  The IPS Statistics Unit commenced the collation of a Quarterly Census of Restricted Regime Prisoners in 2013 and this is published quarterly on\u00a0its website (<i><i>www.irishprisons.ie<\/i><\/i>).  The Director General of the IPS chairs\u00a0a high level group to look at measures which can be introduced to reduce the number of prisoners held on restricted regimes.

The review group was assembled to review all training in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and included leading members of public and private sector organisations.  It was tasked with recommending ways to improve and reinvigorate Garda training to align to best practice and meet the new challenges of a changing society.<\/p>  <p>  The Review Group conducted best practice site visits at nine international police training facilities.  During these site visits particular attention was given to the training and development of new entrants.  The various models of foundation police training observed internationally were considered in the analysis of the previous training programme, the B.A in Police Studies.  The analysis identified areas for development of that programme and also established methods of enhancing the preparation of Student\/Probationer Garda&iacute; for core operational Garda duties.  It was recommended that the development of a new training programme for student\/probationers be structured over three phases of training.  This modularised programme aims to address core policing skills through blended learning, Increased use of scenario-based practical training, drawing on problem based learning (PBL) methodologies.  The current foundation training programme was developed and was first delivered to new entrants in September 2014.  This new training programme is known as the B.A in Applied Policing programme.  It is accredited by the University of Limerick, which oversees the delivery and quality assurance of the training programme in line with the requirements of Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  I am informed that\u00a0on four occasions each year a Board of Examiners meeting is convened by the University of Limerick to review and ratify results for the B.A in Applied Policing Programme.  At these Board of Examiners meeting, the University of Limerick task external examiners who have international police expertise, to review and make recommendations regarding best practice in relation to the B.A in Applied Policing programme.<\/p>  <p>  I am further\u00a0informed that all instructors involved in the delivery of the BA in Applied Policing Programme have undergone a Certificate in Scholarship and Teaching with the University of Limerick.  A number of instructors in this section are also completing a Level 9 Specialist Diploma in Teaching Learning and Scholarship in partnership with the 3rd Level Institution, University of Limerick.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of leadership, management\u00a0and professional development there is a dedicated\u00a0section attached to the Garda College, which is responsible for developing, delivering and facilitating the leadership and development training for newly promoted personnel.  All programmes delivered underpin the philosophies of the Training Review Report 2009 to achieve a commitment to lifelong learning within the organisation. <\/p>  <p>  To ensure up to date development, substantial elements of the programmes which specifically deal with supervision, leadership and management are tendered out to ensure the organisation gets the best available and up to date external training in this field.  Staff of Leadership Management &amp;amp; Professional Development have level 9 NFQ qualifications in the area of Leadership, Organisation Behaviour, Executive Coaching, and level 8 NFQ in Leadership and Governance.  Staff are also professionally qualified at international level in the area of Emotional Intelligence and Psychometrics, MBTI and 16PF.  Staff also hold practitioner&rsquo;s qualifications in &ldquo;Leadership GRID&rdquo;, an international leadership development programme.  In line with Garda Inspectorate reports LMD have incorporated Coaching and Mentoring in all programmes and have external executive coaches as part of Senior Management Development and 360 feedbacks.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, each year members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na attend international training programmes under the auspices of CEPOL, the European Agency for Law Enforcement Training.

Furthermore, the scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the Courts and the presiding judges who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. <\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the position regarding the waiting times for the various courts is as follows:<\/p>  <p>  Supreme Court<\/p>  <p>  Under the direction of the then Chief Justice, by the end of 2016, the Supreme Court had almost entirely disposed of its retained legacy appeals.  At its peak the total backlog amounted to almost 3,000 appeals with consequential waiting times up to four and a half years in some cases.  The current position in relation to the new jurisdiction appeals in the Supreme Court is as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Average waiting time for applications for leave to appeal from filing of complete documentation to determination - 6 weeks, and<\/p>  <p>  - Average waiting time for appeals from determination of leave application to appeal hearing - 54 weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Court of Appeal<\/p>  <p>  Following the establishment of the Court of Appeal on 28 October 2014 the waiting times for appeals\u00a0reduced significantly and the waiting times at\u00a030 November\u00a02017\u00a0were as follows:<\/p>  <p>  (a) Civil Appeals<\/p>  <p>  - Fast tracked short appeals (requiring less that 2 hours) - 12 months subject to the case being included in the \"short cases\" list and with the possibility of an earlier date, and<\/p>  <p>  - other appeals (requiring more than 2 hours) - the waiting time for these appeals is 18 months.<\/p>  <p>  Urgent appeals such as Hague Convention\/child abduction and refugee asylum cases continue to be accommodated having regard to the degree of urgency demonstrated.  Also civil appeals which have a custody and\/or criminal element are now case-managed in the Criminal Courts of Justice by the panel of 4 judges assigned to deal with the criminal appeal list thus ensuring the degree of priority necessary for hearing of such appeals.  As a result waiting times for these cases are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Article 40\/habeas corpus appeals and bail appeals are usually heard in one month or less;<\/p>  <p>  - European Arrest Warrant cases and Judicial Review cases are heard within the current legal term provided the necessary papers are in order.<\/p>  <p>  (b) Criminal Appeals<\/p>  <p>  Criminal Appeals have a waiting time of 6 months.  This is significantly better than the 18 month waiting time in the Court of Criminal Appeal prior to the establishment of the Court of Appeal.  Hearing dates can now be allocated during the subsequent legal term to the majority of cases included in the List to Fix Dates (held once a term).  An occasional case which requires a full day or in excess of a day, or a case where for various reasons a date during a specific week\/month is requested by the parties and which the court simply cannot accommodate due to the availability of court time, will be allocated a date during the subsequent term. \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Criminal appeals (and civil appeals for hearing in the Criminal Courts of Justice) are actively managed on a weekly basis by the Judge assigned to management of the criminal lists to ensure cases are dealt with as efficiently as possible and delays in moving cases to the List to Fix Dates due to procedural issues arising are kept to a minimum.  Applications for priority may be made at the weekly management list. <\/p>  <p>  Arrangements have been\u00a0made to identify suitable legacy appeals for transfer back to the Supreme Court for hearing, subject to the necessary application being made by a party to the appeal under Article 64 of the Constitution.  This\u00a0recent initiative, agreed between the Chief Justice and the President of the Court of Appeal, has seen a first tranche of 60 legacy appeals (transferred from the Supreme Court) identified for transfer back to the Supreme Court with a view to an early hearing date in that court.\u00a0 As of 5 December 2017 20 of these appeals have been transferred back to the Supreme Court and, of these, 9 appeals are listed for hearing this week and next week in the Supreme Court with the remainder scheduled for hearing in February 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Special Criminal Court<\/p>  <p>  The waiting time for a hearing date in the Special Criminal Courts is now 12 months following the establishment of the Second Special Criminal Court on 6 May 2016.  This compares with up to 24 months prior to the establishment of the Second Special Criminal Court.<\/p>  <p>  High Court<\/p>  <p>  Since 19 October 2017, when High Court waiting times were last advised to the Deputy, a further analysis shows waiting times generally maintained across all court lists and venues.  A significant development has been the reduction in the waiting times for Asylum pre-leave actions from 7 months to\u00a01 week as a result of new case management measures.  The Chancery, Commercial and Family Law Lists each offer hearing dates in the first legal term of 2018.  The only High Court category showing increased waiting times over this period are non-jury actions, including Circuit Court appeals, which have extended from 9 months to 11 months.<\/p>  <p>  Central Criminal Court<\/p>  <p>  The current waiting time in the Central Criminal Court is 12 months.  Prior to securing a fifth Judge in October 2015, the waiting times had extended to 18 months.<\/p>  <p>  Circuit Court and District Court<\/p>  <p>  Circuit and District Courts are courts of local jurisdiction and waiting times vary from venue to venue based on the number, complexity and scheduling of cases.  The data provided in the Courts Service Annual Reports indicates that waiting times are being maintained or reduced across most venues and the categories of cases. \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also informed me that the Presidents of the various courts work together with the Courts Service to achieve improvements in waiting times and continue to arrange additional sittings where possible within the resources available to them to deal with any delays in the hearing of cases and to target judicial resources at the areas of greatest need. <\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that delays in the hearing of cases can occur for a number of reasons, many of which are outside the control of the Courts and the Courts Service, for example, the unavailability of a witness or vital evidence, delays in the furnishing of reports or because the parties and\/or legal practitioners are not ready to proceed on allocated dates.  This gives rise to adjournments which can have a major impact on the time taken to complete the hearing of a case and on the number of cases which can be disposed of in a court sitting.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy\u00a0is aware, a Group to review the administration of civil justice in the State, chaired by the President of the High Court Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, was established recently.  The first meeting of the Group was held on 9 November 2017 and call for submissions to the Group has been advertised with a deadline of 16 February 2018. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Group is to report to me within two years, and will make recommendations for changes with a view to improving access to civil justice in the State, promoting early resolution of disputes, reducing the cost of litigation, creating a more responsive and proportionate system and ensuring better outcomes for court users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500080#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Data","counter":648,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500080#WRR00800"},{"type":"question","counter":649,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[52040\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500080#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of prisoners incarcerated in all facilities throughout the country; the number on parole, special or day release, compassionate release or other; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":650,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that the information requested by the Deputy in relation to number of prisoners in custody in each prison and\u00a0the number on Temporary Release\u00a0is published daily on the Irish Prison Service website www.irishprisons.ie.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that the strength of the Reserve on the 31 October 2017 was 603.  It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013.  The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly some serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. <\/p>  <p>  The \"Programme for a Partnership Government\" includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures.  In line with this the Government has in place a plan to achieve a Reserve strength of 2,000 by 2021.  I am pleased that Budget 2018 will facilitate the strengthening of the Reserve next year with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018 following the undertaking of a recruitment campaign earlier this year. <\/p>  <p>  In conjunction with the major expansion of the Reserve over the next number of years we must ensure that it is used to optimum effect to support effective policing.  To inform future decisions around the use of the Reserve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a strategic review as a matter of priority with a view to completion before the end of this year.  As a first step the Garda Executive has taken a decision to transfer the management of the Reserve from the Human Resource and People Development Directorate to the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for Community Engagement.

The 2016 survey remains the most up to date and accurate source of information on Enterprise Agency job creation until the 2017 figures are published early next year.<\/p><p>EI, IDA Ireland and the LEOs publish their yearly targets as part of the Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) process.  Through the APJ the Government has committed to creating 200,000 new jobs by 2020, with 135,000 of these to be located outside of Dublin. As part of the APJ process the Government aims to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region to be brought within one per cent of the national average.  <\/p><p>Each of the Agencies have their own strategies targeting this ambitious levels of job creation over the coming years.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create 60,000 jobs, while sustaining existing ones, which will make an important contribution to economic growth across all regions of Ireland.  <\/p><p>In January 2017 Enterprise Ireland published its strategy for the period 2017-2020.

Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s employment target for 2020 is to assist clients to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 and to sustain the existing record level of jobs. Enterprise Ireland does not have targets beyond 2020.<\/p><p>As part of its 2015-2019 strategy IDA Ireland aims to create 80,000 new jobs and 900 new investments in the period from 2015 to 2019 &ndash; which would bring total Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) employment in Ireland to 209,000. The LEO 2016 annual jobs survey results highlighted three consecutive years of local jobs growth throughout the country: with a net increase of 3,679 jobs and total direct employment among LEO client companies standing at 34,634.With a similar level of funding in 2017 and 2018 the LEOs hope to support a similar level of job creation in those years.<\/p><p>Through EI, IDA Ireland and the LEOs 70 new jobs are being created per day and over 50,000 new jobs have been delivered in the past two years.

The Deputy may be familiar with the background to the closure of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes in February 2013.  Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.  The Health Service Executive has advised that there are currently 4,133 individuals in receipt of this payment.<\/p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government <\/i>acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Government's legislative programme for 2017 includes the Health (Transport Support) Bill.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that: <\/p><p>- There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation; <\/p><p>- There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme; <\/p><p>- Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and <\/p><p>- The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>The draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill were circulated to other government Departments and have been the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  When the consultation with other relevant Departments has been completed, the next step will be to seek Government approval to the drafting of a Bill for the new Scheme.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.

The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis.  The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:<\/p>  <p>  - Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;<\/p>  <p>  - Price(s) previously charged;<\/p>  <p>  - Local market price; and<\/p>  <p>  - Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.<\/p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  A number of issues have been identified for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.<\/p>  <p>  A Steering Committee has been established to oversee the review of the pricing system for private long-term residential care facilities.  This Steering Committee is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the NTPF, work in this area is ongoing and well advanced.  There are no service providers included on the steering group from either the public or private nursing home sectors.<\/p>  <p>  During the review of the pricing mechanism, key stakeholders were given the opportunity to contribute to the examination.  Nursing Homes Ireland were one of these stakeholders and my understanding is that they availed of this opportunity to contribute.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 NHSS Review also identified the need for a Value for Money (VFM) review of the cost differentials in public and private\/ voluntary residential facilities.  This VFM review has recently commenced and is being lead by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  While consultation is, and always will remain, an important part of the approach my Department takes, it would be inappropriate to delegate elements of public policy, to any consultative forum.  Were such a forum to be established it would create a situation where some of those represented and giving direction will inevitably have a commercially vested interest in the outcome.  Furthermore, organisations including HIQA and the NTPF operate independently and provide a clear and essential service to the sector, this independence could be eroded were they seen to be engaging in collective decision making with representative groups.

The Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to progress this.<\/p>  <p>  The statutory scheme for home care will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to how decisions are made on allocating services.  For that reason, developing a new statutory scheme will be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home care services.  It will also help to improve access to the home care services that people need, in an affordable and sustainable way.  The system of regulation for home care will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided are of a high standard.<\/p>  <p>  A public consultation on home care services was launched by Minister Harris and Minister of State Daly on 6 July and closed on 2 October 2017.

The scale of the task to implement a national electronic health record programme is very large, challenging and requires a complex planning, approval and tendering process. In the business case, a 5 year and a 9 year technology investment programme is outlined but there is flexibility within its scope to stretch out timescales further. The total of all estimated costs including business change elements for a 5 year implementation are in the range of &euro;647m to &euro;875m respectively and the 9 year figure is between &euro;609m to &euro;824m.  <\/p>  <p>  The Electronic Health Record (EHR), as defined in the high level strategic business case, is a multi-annual programme of work and has 4 main elements - the Shared Care Record, the Community &amp;amp; Primary Care EHR, the Acute Operational EHR and the EHR integration suite. An acute EHR component is critical to the functioning of the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital (NCH) and will be the first digital hospital in Ireland. Any capacity to fund future year requests is dependent on approval of the national EHR business case on the basis of a phased implementation consistent with the needs of the NCH.  For a programme of this scale and scope, realistic timescales and funding options are important to ensure that the adoption of both the technology and the business change required by front line staff can be absorbed and managed in a coherent way.  In addition to resourcing the EHR project with substantial manpower and financial resources, experience from other countries demonstrates that the vendor markets supplying many of these services needs to be carefully managed in terms of capacity and capability to deliver working tailored solutions in a satisfactory manner. <\/p>  <p>  As regards progress to date, the HSE has appointed a programme manager to oversee the implementation of the Electronic Health Record in May 2017 and work is continuing with the HSE and my Department on progressing the business case with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The next phase of the EHR programme is to develop detailed business cases for each component, specification of requirements, procurement documentation and support during the procurement process. The HSE sought and received conditional sanction from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to undertake four tenders, utilising the Office of Government procurement framework, to provide them with external support for the programme. The 4 tenders are for the delivery of support for the following four areas: programme office; acute EHR; community EHR; and Shared Care Record and Integration.  <\/p>  <p>  The tender documents were published in August and the tender process closed mid-September.  To date, one contract for this work has been awarded for the acute hospital EHR in view of the requirements for the National Children's Hospital.  In the case of the other two lots, a re-tendering exercise is underway.  The outputs from this work will allow greater clarity on the scope of the individual components for what is being procured and the detailed costings for each of the areas that will make up the electronic health care record. Only when this detailed work is completed can the procurement process be considered for submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and prioritisation assigned to the work.

I am currently considering these recommendations and the actions required to support implementation as part of wider consideration of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  I expect to present a response to the report along with a proposed implementation plan to Government later this month.  This will set out our ambitions for the next decade and concrete plans for the immediate years ahead. <\/p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare report provided costs for a range of actions recommended in the report.  Further analysis of potential future costs, in as far as is possible, is also being undertaken in the context of the development of the Slaintecare implementation plan.  However, it is important to state that the process underway could not, and should not, seek to be definitive in terms of a cost benefit analysis of a full 10 year reform programme.  The reform plans envisaged in the Slaintecare report will be a significant undertaking and need to be translated into a concrete and phased programme of work, supported by strong implementation structures and processes and a clear implementation plan.  A core feature of this plan will be a process that enables detailed costings of actions in advance of implementation and robust monitoring and implementation frameworks to ensure reforms are delivering desired outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  This detailed work will be overseen by a Reform Programme Office.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government agreed to move forward with the establishment of a dedicated programme office during the summer, and specifically the recruitment of a Lead Executive for that Office.  This marks a critical first step in gearing up for a significant programme of reform and demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to this process.  &euro;1 million has been allocated to this Office in 2018 in line with the report's recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  The recruitment process for the Head of this Office is underway and is being managed by the Public Appointments Service.  It is essential that we are positioned to attract candidates of calibre for what will be a considerable reform programme.  An extensive national and international executive search is being undertaken as a first step in this recruitment process, with the aim of attracting very senior candidates with a strong track record in implementing large scale programmes of reform.  This will be followed by a public advertisement process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500087#WRY02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":941,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500087#WRY02200"},{"type":"question","counter":942,"qnumday":379,"qnumall":"[51912\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500087#WRY02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the decision not to provide funding applied for by an organisation (details supplied) for an education and information officer; and the considerations in the new allocation model for SNAs that was given for children with dyspraxia in view of the fact that the new guidelines mean persons with this condition are likely to be overlooked.","asker":"1432","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":943,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

However, sporadic outbreaks can occur, as seen recently in the case of measles, and the Department of Health urges parents to ensure that their children are fully vaccinated and to contact their GP or other health care professional if they have any vaccination concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500088#WRZ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Psychological Assessments","counter":972,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500088#WRZ01500"},{"type":"question","counter":973,"qnumday":391,"qnumall":"[51953\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500088#WRZ01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if children in second level education awaiting psychological assessment can avail of the cross-Border directive to access such an assessment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1218","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":974,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500088#WRZ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":975,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500088#WRZ01800"},{"type":"question","counter":976,"qnumday":392,"qnumall":"[51957\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500088#WRZ01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he expects a person (details supplied) will be called for an appointment at the ENT unit at University Hospital Waterford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":977,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The poor weather resulted in\u00a0cattle being housed earlier than normal in places, it also affected late cut silage making operations.<\/p>  <p>  My Department in conjunction with Teagasc have been closely monitoring the winter fodder situation across the country.  The current position is that there appears to be adequate supplies of fodder in the form of silage and hay available across the country.  However, there are particular areas in the Western and North-Western regions experiencing fodder scarcities as a result of the earlier housing and silage making difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  My Department actively engaged Teagasc to work locally in these areas experiencing fodder difficulties.  Teagasc has been providing support and advice to farmers on fodder budgeting for the winter ahead, including how best to address where stocks are inadequate.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission agreed to my request for an increase in the advance payment of the 2017 Basic Payment Scheme as well as an increase in the advance payments under our Rural Development Programme.  This has been prompted by the\u00a0inclement weather conditions and also market difficulties caused by currency fluctuations.  This means an increase from 50% to 70% in the rate for the BPS to those applicants whose applications were confirmed fully clear and an increase to 85% in the case of RDP schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Issuing of these BPS advance payments commenced\u00a0after the 15th October and balancing payments are issuing this week.  The Roll-out of balancing payments brings the total paid under the Basic Payment Scheme\u00a0to &euro;1.106bn to approximately 121,000 farmers.

The document comes against the backdrop of the Commission White Paper on the Future of Europe published on 1 March 2017, and the public consultation on the future of the CAP carried out in the first half of 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Communication proposes a simpler CAP, with significantly more flexibility for Member States, and a sharper focus on objectives and results, particularly in the environmental area.  The document acknowledges the solid performance of the CAP since 1962, but recognises that further work can be done in certain areas.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently in the process of examining the implications of this communication.  However, we welcome the fact that it recognises the importance of direct payments, that it refers to the importance of EU and other risk management tools, and that a number of important themes , including R&amp;amp; D, technology transfer and investment feature in its analysis.  It is also clear that the CAP of the future will need to be configured to assist member states in meeting their climate change and other environmental obligations and the Commission communication makes it clear that the environment will be a key feature of any reformed CAP.<\/p>  <p>  The communication appears to be a reasonably good platform from which to initiate discussions on the future of CAP.  However, the real detail will only emerge when we see specific legislative proposals, and this is unlikely to happen until mid 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Communication covers many of the key issues and challenges for CAP post 2020.  However in order to be able to deliver on these challenges, a strong CAP budget will be required.  In that regard, I note that the Communication does not address budgetary matters.  This is understandable as proposals under the Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) post 2020 are not due until May 2018.  I will be working closely with my EU counterparts to achieve the best possible outcome on CAP funding in order to provide a solid and effective foundation for the development of the agrifood sector into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500089#WRAA03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"TAMS Applications","counter":1035,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500089#WRAA03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1036,"qnumday":413,"qnumall":"[51773\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500089#WRAA04000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of a TAMS application by persons (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1037,"content":"<p>The applicants submitted an application for\u00a0the Young Farmers Capital Investment Scheme on\u00a0 6 October\u00a02017.

This High Level Objective identifies a number of outcomes for both climate and energy policy objectives under my Department&rsquo;s remit.<font color=\"#0D0D0D\">Implementation on Ireland&rsquo;s climate change commitments can be measured against Ireland&rsquo;s emissions reduction targets under the EU Effort Sharing Decision, the implementation of domestic policy commitments arising from the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 and in the context of related commitments set out in the Programme for Partnership Government. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The 2009 Effort Sharing Decision 406\/2009\/EC established binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005. This will be Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. Ireland&rsquo;s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this Decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg.\u00a0 <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The latest Environmental Protection Agency report on greenhouse gas emissions, published on 27 November, indicates that Ireland complied with its annual limits in the period 2013-2016. However, projections indicate that Ireland is expected to exceed its annual limits from 2017 onwards and that emissions could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020. The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">In order to comply with Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 targets, Ireland will need to avail of a number of flexibilities. These include the carry-over of surplus allowances from earlier in the period as well as the use of credits already purchased through the Kyoto Protocol Flexibility Mechanisms and carried forward from 2008-2012 which can be offset against the deficit. If this does not fully address any potential deficit, further allowances could be purchased if necessary. The final cost of\u00a0purchasing additional allowances will depend both on the quantum and price of allowances to be purchased at the time. <\/font><\/p><p>Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan,\u00a0which I published in July of this year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Plan sets out what Ireland is currently doing, and is planning to do, to further the national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015. <font color=\"#0D0D0D\">This Plan sets out over 70 individual measures and 106 related actions\u00a0to reduce emissions in four key sectors (Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use). \u00a0<\/font>Although this first Plan will not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that Ireland is well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. <\/p><p>I am also currently finalising Ireland&rsquo;s first National Adaptation Framework.\u00a0The Framework\u00a0will provide a clear strategy for Government Departments and the\u00a0Local Government sector\u00a0to prepare and implement adaptation plans and strategies within their own areas. Individual Ministers will be required to develop sectorial adaptation plans for areas under their remit and local authorities will be required to develop local authority climate change adaptation strategies. \u00a0<\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The 2015 Act also requires that I lay before that Houses of the Oireachtas an Annual Transition Statement, no later than 10 December each year, setting out\u00a0progress on the implementation of mitigation and adaption policy measures adopted by Government, details on emissions inventories and projections, and a report on compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under EU law and relevant international agreements.

For some children with special\/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so therefore an allowance was made. Their ECCE place was split over 2 years, e.g. a child may have availed of 3 days ECCE provision in year one and 2 days in year 2. In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been overage for ECCE in the latter year, an overage exemption was approved. This provision of an overage exemption by the DCYA for the ECCE programme was never intended as a mechanism to delay a child&rsquo;s entry to primary education.<\/p>  <p>  Given the extension of the ECCE programme in 2016\/2017, the further extension of the Programme to two full years from September 2018, and the introduction of AIM in June 2016, it is clear that the initial premise for provision of an overage exemption from the upper age limit for the ECCE programme is no longer valid.<\/p>  <p>  AIM is a model of supports designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access the early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  The AIM Early Years Specialists will work with the parents (and guardians), providers, Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) and others (as appropriate) to support the child&rsquo;s transition to primary school. On this basis, no applications for overage exemptions will be accepted for the ECCE programme from the 2018\/2019 Programme Year.  Any concerns with regard to a child's transition to primary school should be referred to the Better Start Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) application process.<\/p>  <p>  Parents, guardians and providers are advised to engage with the AIM process where a concern in relations to a child's transition to primary school is identified.  More detailed information on AIM can be found at www.preschoolaccess.ie.<\/p>  <p>The Department of Education and Skill (DES) also provides for the education of children with special educational needs through a number of support mechanisms, depending on the child's assessed disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500093#WREE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Paediatric Services","counter":1164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500093#WREE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1165,"qnumday":459,"qnumall":"[51843\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500093#WREE01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if correspondence from a group (details supplied) in County Donegal in which a number of concerns are outlined with respect to paediatric diabetes services in the county has been received; if a reply has issued to this correspondence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1166,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that I have received the correspondence in question.

Over time, the age for State pension (contributory) was reduced to 66 years.  However, evidence shows that a significant number of people coming on to SPT in 2012 did not come from work as many were already on other social welfare schemes.    The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the SPT available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028. <\/p>  <p>  We are all aware that people are living for much longer.  Life expectancy at birth has increased significantly over the years &ndash; and is now at 78.4 years for men and 82.8 years for women.  This is very positive.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by approx. &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (although at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, it is anticipated that well over half of that cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been a number of Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 is likely to be in the region of over &euro;80 million, and this is expected to increase over time. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday. Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.<\/p>  <p>  I note the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion that differing State pension ages at different times amounts to discrimination.  However, pension systems evolve over time, and people retiring now receive significantly more generous pensions (in real terms) for longer durations than most of the pensions that they financed as workers when paying PRSI and tax. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500096#WRHH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Benefit Administration","counter":1300,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500096#WRHH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1301,"qnumday":504,"qnumall":"[51889\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500096#WRHH02100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the first and full-year cost of increasing maternity benefit by one to seven weeks, respectively.","asker":"1231","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1302,"content":"<p>Maternity Benefit is paid by my Department and is based on payment of PRSI contributions while working.

In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 14.9% above rent limits provided.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will monitor this data each quarter, taking into consideration other sources of data such as the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) Rent Index and Average Rent Index Reports, which are published on a quarterly basis. The Rent Index Report is compiled by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), and based on the RTB&rsquo;s own register of tenancies, the Rent Index reveals the actual rents being paid for rented properties.<\/p>  <p>  This data indicates that the current rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is currently operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland. My Department will, of course, continue to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500097#WRJJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electoral Register","counter":1334,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500097#WRJJ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1335,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[51507\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500097#WRJJ01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the steps he has taken to ensure that the persons who have been forced into homelessness are registered to vote.","asker":"1235","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1336,"content":"<p>The Electoral Act 1992 provides for the registration of voters where they are &lsquo;ordinarily resident&rsquo;.

These Regulations cover a range of matters including structural condition, ventilation, sanitary facilities and fire safety and include new measures covering heating appliances, carbon monoxide and window safety.  In August, my Department published a guidance document to assist and support local authorities in implementing the new Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  All properties let, or available to let, including where a property has been advertised by a letting agent, must comply with the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations.  All landlords, including those in receipt of Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and management companies where they are also landlords, have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these Regulations.  Responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from a portion of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees, collected by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).  <\/p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the RTB, over &euro;34 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts, including the inspection of rented accommodation.  Over 185,000 inspections were carried out during this period. <\/p>  <p>  However, the Rental Strategy recognises the need for additional resources to be provided to local authorities to aid increased inspections of properties and ensure greater compliance with the Regulations.  Provision has been made for an allocation of &euro;2.5m in 2018, with the intention of providing further increases each year in the period to 2021 to facilitate targeted inspection coverage of 25% of rental properties annually.<\/p>  <p>  It is also my intention to introduce further measures to ensure that landlords meet their obligations in relation to quality, safety and compliance with regulations and standards.  For example, when registering a tenancy with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), I am intending that landlords will be required to certify that the property in question is compliant with regulations relating to standards for rental accommodation, overcrowding and fire safety.  Failure to provide this certification, failure to register the tenancy or the provision of an untrue certification will all constitute offences, prosecutable by the RTB.<\/p>  <p>  The HAP scheme is underpinned by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. Under section 41 of the 2014 Act, local authorities are required to commence the inspection process within 8 months of the commencement of HAP support being provided in relation to a particular dwelling if not already inspected within the previous 12 months. HAP may be provided on a property which is the subject of a subsisting improvement notice under section 18A of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  HAP shall not be, or shall cease to be, provided on a property which is the subject of proceedings or a prohibition notice under section 18B of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  Where a prohibition notice has come into effect, HAP may continue to be paid for 13 weeks from the date of HAP commencing or the notice coming into force, as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  There is no requirement under the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations for a rental property to have a fire certificate in place.  The statutory requirements in relation to Fire Safety Certificates are set out in the Building Control Act 1990, as amended by Part 2 of the Building Control Act 2007, and in regulations made thereunder.  A Fire Safety Certificate is a certificate granted by a local Building Control Authority which specifies that the works or building to which the application relates will, if carried out in accordance with the plans and specifications submitted, comply with the requirements of Part B of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations.  A Fire Safety Certificate is generally required before construction work is commenced in the case of a new apartment block, a new building other than a dwelling or an existing building other than a dwelling undergoing an extension, a material alteration or a material change of use.  A building used as a dwelling other than a flat is exempted from the requirement to obtain a Fire Safety Certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500097#WRJJ04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Waiting Lists","counter":1364,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500097#WRJJ04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1365,"qnumday":525,"qnumall":"[51947\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500097#WRJJ04300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to the findings of a report (details supplied), the number of households that have relinquished their place on the housing waiting list due to the fact they are in receipt of HAP; the number of those that sought to be placed on a housing transfer list; the number of households on this transfer list; the status of the transfer list vis-&agrave;-vis the social housing list, by local authority, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1366,"content":"<p>Following the commencement of the provisions in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is considered to be a social housing support and consequently households in receipt of a HAP payment are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list.

Like other areas within the Public Service, the pay of the Permanent Defence Force was reduced during the financial crisis. The reductions in pay and the introduction of a Pension Related Deduction was on a graduated basis with increased rates of deductions for those on higher earnings. <\/p>  <p>  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009-2015 (FEMPI) and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2018 (Lansdowne Road Agreement) define current pay policy. <\/p>  <p>  The Government recognise the contribution made by all public servants including members of the Permanent Defence Force, during the economic crisis and have taken measures to improve public sector pay, with the focus of the increases weighted in favour of those on lower pay.   <\/p>  <p>  PDFORRA signed up to the Lansdowne Road Agreement in March 2017. The finalisation of negotiations under the agreement allowed for the commencement of the process for the implementation of pay increases and arrears, which have now been applied to the Permanent Defence Force. An increase of 2.5% from 1 January 2016, for annualised salaries up to &euro;24,000 and 1% for annualised salaries between &euro;24,001 and &euro;31,000 was included in the weekly payroll of 5 July 2017. An increase of &euro;1,000 from 1 April 2017, on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 per annum was paid on 19 July 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The pay of general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, has been increased further following an agreement, facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), between the Department of Defence, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and PDFORRA. These improved payscales, have been backdated to 1 July 2016. The payments were made to relevant personnel on 30 August 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Going forward, there is the potential for further increases arising from the recent negotiations on the extension to the Lansdowne Road Agreement.

Under the Army Pensions Acts a disability pension or gratuity may, following retirement, be granted to a former member of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) for permanent disablement due to a wound or injury attributable to military service &ndash; whether at home or abroad &ndash; or to a disease that is secondary to an injury, or that is attributable to or aggravated by, overseas service with a United Nations Force. <\/p>  <p>  The award of a disability pension or gratuity depends on the findings of the Army Pensions Board  The Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Acts consisting of a chairman and two ordinary members (both doctors). The Board&rsquo;s principal function is to investigate applications for pensions, allowances and gratuities under the Acts and to report to the Minister thereon. It is open to the Board, on a case by case basis, to seek additional outside medical opinion, for example, from a relevant specialist or consultant if considered necessary to assist it to reach a finding.    <\/p>  <p>  The Board determines the question of attributability to military service in each case; assesses the degree of disability; and reports its findings to the Department, which then acts on the Board&rsquo;s findings, including informing the applicant of the grant or refusal of appropriate benefits, as the case may be. The findings of the Army Pensions Board in regard to &lsquo;attributability&rsquo; are final and conclusive and binding. However, there is provision for review of awards or refusals subject to certain conditions, for example if additional relevant new information subsequently becomes available and is provided to the Board for its consideration.<\/p>  <p>  Over recent years, there have been a small number (18) of disability pension applications from former members of the   PDF involving claims for Lariam-related illness. One application was subsequently withdrawn by the applicant. Of the 1 5 cases decided by the Army Pensions Board  to date, the Board has not made a finding of disablement attributable to military service as a result of being prescribed Lariam Mefloquine (anti-malarial medication) while serving in the PDF. Consequently, no former PDF members are in receipt of military disability pensions arising from treatment with Lariam.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500099#WRLL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Data","counter":1417,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500099#WRLL01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1418,"qnumday":545,"qnumall":"[51849\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120500099#WRLL01700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of freedom of information requests received by his Department to date in 2017; the number of which that were fully or partially granted; and the number of such requests that were refused.","asker":"1248","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1419,"content":"<p>My Department received a total of 152 FOI requests between 1st January and 30th November 2017 (inclusive).
