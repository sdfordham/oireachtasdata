The long-term unemployment rate peaked at 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling to 4.7% in Q4 2015.  At the latter date, the long-term unemployed accounted for 57.8% of all those unemployed, down from almost 65% in early 2012. <\/p><p>Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate the young unemployed and long-term unemployed back into work.

In this regard there is monthly engagement with young people by case officers to assist young people to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  As part of this process additional supports may be provided, both through existing schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. <\/p>  <p>  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced.  The scheme was designed with a view to ensuring that some people could qualify for contributory pensions immediately and to suit a system where social insurance coverage was limited.  The rate of payment depends upon which band a yearly average falls into.  Those with a yearly average of 48 or more contributions may receive a 100% pension, whereas, for example, those with a yearly average of 20 contributions are in a lower band, and receive a pension at 85% of the maximum rate (plus allowances where applicable).<\/p>  <p>  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced, with six bands replacing the four which were in place up to then.  These new bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that, generally, those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. <\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension (contributory) also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner.  The scheme does not involve the award of credits.  There are no proposals to backdate the scheme to cover periods of homemaking prior to 1994, due to the very significant costs which would be involved. <\/p>  <p>  Work has commenced to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo; where the number of contributions recorded over a work life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legislative, administrative, and technical aspects to be addressed in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes.  The changes will be announced well in advance of introduction, to enable those workers affected to include the new factors into their retirement planning.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund (2012) confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For example, those with a yearly average of only 38% of the maximum may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate. <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500039#WRA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Delays","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500039#WRA02350"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[9345\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500039#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason for the delay in processing an application by a person (details supplied) under the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>The application for carer&rsquo;s allowance in respect of the person concerned was awarded on 27 April 2016 and the first payment is due to issue to the person&rsquo;s bank nominated post office on 19 May 2016.<\/p><p>Arrears of allowance due,  less supplementary welfare allowance paid in the interim, will issue shortly.

A\u00a0Personal Microcredit\u00a0Implementation Group under the Department of Social Protection is progressing this initiative and 30 credit unions from around the country are participating.  The Department of Finance is represented on\u00a0this group.

The most recent Central Bank Quarterly Bulletin reports on this <\/p><p><i>(<\/i><i>)<\/i>.  It notes that Household debt at end September 2015 stood at its lowest level in almost ten years and that overall household debt has fallen by 26 per cent since its peak in the third quarter of 2008.  The\u00a0 Bulletin also notes that debt sustainability also continued to improve in 2015.  Debt as a proportion of total assets has been declining since the second quarter of 2012 and stood at 19.4 per cent at end-September 2015.  Furthermore, over the past year, Irish households have reduced debt as a proportion of disposable income by 24 percentage points, to 160 per cent.  The decline in these indicators reflects falling debt levels, as well as the increase in household total assets and disposable income.  Meanwhile, the cost of servicing outstanding household debt remained broadly stable throughout 2015, as the interest rate on total outstanding loans to households averaged 3.33 per cent over the year.  The equivalent rate for the euro area as a whole was 3.54 per cent over the same period.  Household net worth, calculated as the sum of housing and financial assets minus liabilities, rose to &euro;618 billion, or &euro;133,225 <i>per capita<\/i>at end-September 2015. <\/p><p>In the case of Non-Financial Corporations (NFCs)\u00a0the bulletin notes that NFC debt as a percentage of GDP continued to decline in the third quarter of 2015 (184 per cent).  It also notes that\u00a0 when analysing Irish NFC debt trends, it is important to note that Ireland has substantial multinational corporation (MNC) activities, which have little interaction with the domestic financial system.  Though NFC debt as a percentage of GDP is currently at its\u00a0 lowest level since Q2 2009, it remains high in an international context.  Ireland ranks third highest among European countries in terms of NFC debt to GDP, behind Luxembourg (328 per cent) and Cyprus (231 per cent), both countries that also have relatively large MNC sectors.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, the overall level is high and this is explicitly recognised in the risk table of the recently published Stability Programme Update <\/p><p><i>(<\/i><i>)<\/i>.\u00a0 <\/p><p>As regards SME legacy debt, Chapter 7 (Finance for Growth) of this year's Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) sets out a range of commitments to ensure viable SMEs can access appropriate finance at a reasonable cost from both bank and non-bank sources.  In line with Action 144 of the APJ, officials from my Department continue to collate and examine data from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a monthly basis, including data pertaining to SME legacy debt.  Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector.  In addition, I am informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that, as part of their on-going supervision, the Central Bank, working in conjunction with the European Cental Bank (ECB) as part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), continues to challenge the banks on their strategies, management, measurement and reporting of the resolution and restructuring of all non-performing loans (NPLs) including SME NPLs.  Relevant actions taken by the Central Bank in recent years have been extensive and include, <i>inter alia<\/i>, capital assessment reviews, stress tests, distressed credit operation reviews, balance sheet assessment exercises, SME loan resolution bank specific targets, on-site inspections and ongoing, intensive supervisory engagement with the banks regarding distressed debt.  In 2013 non-public institution specific SME distressed loan resolution targets were set for a number of banks.  The targets required the banks to develop strategies, at borrower level, to resolve their non-performing loans.  The targets ended in Q1 2015 with lenders reporting that they satisfied the requirements set out.  Progress has been made by the relevant institutions in resolving SME NPLs in recent years and NPL trends continue to move in a positive trajectory.  Bank of Ireland has indicated that it has reached resolution in 90% of distressed SME cases and more than 9 out of 10 restructured business banking borrowers continue to meet their agreed arrangements.  AIB has also made significant progress in reducing distressed loan balances with the process of restructuring the group's SME book reaching its latter stages with the majority of offered SME restructures either complete or at the final stages of completion.  Recognising these developments, alongside changes in the supervision of the banks following the introduction of the SSM, the Central Bank's approach to commercial NPL resolution utilises a bank specific approach taking into consideration a number of factors including, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the institution's NPL resolution strategy and operational capability.  The sustainable resolution of distressed SME loans remains a significant priority for the Central Bank and will therefore continue to be central to their supervisory focus throughout 2016 and beyond.  Supervision will continue to be intrusive, supplemented by targeted inspections and enhanced monitoring of performance of the banks in delivery of supervisory objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500039#WRA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[9199\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500039#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"given the Central Bank of Ireland's private debt figure, households and corporations combined, which came to 258% of gross domestic product in the third quarter of 2015, the details of the monetary value of private debt, households and corporations combined, by households, by small and medium enterprises, by multinational corporations, by foreign multinational corporations, by banking and by foreign banking including foreign businesses in the Irish Financial Services Centre, in tabular form.","asker":"1235","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>Please find data provided by the Central Bank of Ireland as follows.<table><tr><th>&euro; millions<\/th><th>Q3 2015 Total Loan Liabilities <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1.

This will ensure that families dependent on fishing can look forward to being part of a vibrant, productive and resilient Irish fishing industry and can expect to continue to achieve a reasonable return for their efforts and investment.<\/p>  <p>  A key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield).  This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.  The introduction of a landing obligation\/discarding ban on a phased basis, as set out in the CFP, also represents a fundamental shift in fisheries policy and fishing practices.  It is expected that over time the landing obligation will lead to an improvement in the state of the stocks of importance to Ireland and will result in increased fishing opportunities for the Irish fishing industry.<\/p>  <p>  I was delighted to launch on 14 January 2016 Ireland&rsquo;s new &euro;240 million EMFF Seafood Development Operational Programme.  This new investment programme will be the source of very significant investment supports for the seafood sector for the period up to 2020.  The Programme represents a doubling of previous support levels.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme aims to support the seafood industry in meeting the challenges of the CFP and in sustainably growing production, value and employment in the seafood industry, in particular the aquaculture and processing sectors.  Some &euro;67 million is being made available for the fishing sector, &euro;30 million for aquaculture and &euro;30 million for seafood processing and marketing.  A further &euro;12 million is being made available to significantly grow the Fisheries Local Action Group initiative to foster economic activity in fishing communities and &euro;10 million for blue growth and marine spatial planning.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme will support the FoodWise 2025 strategy for the seafood sector, in particular its targets of achieving &euro;1 billion in seafood sales and growth of employment of 3,000 by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  A range of schemes under the Programme have already been launched by BIM in 2016 and grant offers are being made at present.

The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services, the establishment of the Permanent Defence Force and available resources. As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment takes place so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels as set out above in accordance with available training capacity. This approach is underlined by the recently announced General Service recruitment campaign, which was launched on 13 April 2016 with a closing date of 22 May 2016. This provides a window of five weeks for an individual to register their interest and apply. I am satisfied that the time period allocated is sufficient and I have no plans to extend it. The processing of applications through the system takes a significant amount of time involving psychometric tests, fitness tests, interview, medical examinations, security clearance etc. We need to move ahead with that process expeditiously in order to have a panel in place from which we can draw recruits later this year. <\/p>  <p>  The upper age limit for enlistment in the Army and Air Corps is under 25 years of age on the closing date for receipt of applications for enlistment, and for the Naval Service it is under 27 years of age on the closing date for receipt of applications for enlistment. These limits are determined on the basis that the essential functions of the Permanent Defence Force requires that its members be composed of able-bodied personnel of an age which is commensurate with the functional requirements of the organisation as a whole. The Defence Forces have an ongoing objective of ensuring an appropriate age profile through continuous recruitment and congruent manpower planning, training and development and career management strategies. Given the health and fitness requirements for Privates and new recruits to the Defence Forces, I do not believe that it would serve the Defence Forces or the individual recruits well to increase the current age limits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500044#WRF00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Deployment","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500044#WRF00850"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[9290\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500044#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if members of the Defence Forces are serving and stationed in Afghanistan.","asker":"1309","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":145,"content":"<p>Currently, there are no members of the Permanent Defence Force serving in Afghanistan.

Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin is the largest provider of scoliosis surgery for children and young people.  Funding was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin.  Capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further.  The 2016 Service Plan specifically provides for support for the new theatre capacity and the continued development of paediatric scoliosis services to address ongoing capacity deficits. <\/p>  <p>  In order to address waiting times in the interim, patients from Crumlin have been transferred to other hospitals where capacity is available and where that is clinically appropriate.  These include Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity has also been identified at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore in the UK.  The Department of Health is continuing to work with the HSE, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and the hospitals themselves to ensure that we continue to make strong progress in addressing this issue and to identify all options to further improve access times.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the specific case raised, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The drug was licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration in July 2015 and by the European Medicines Agency in November 2015. To date, it has not been approved for reimbursement by any public health service in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Each country has its own process for approval. The Irish process is laid down in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. The Act gives the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in the community drugs schemes.  It is appropriate that these should not be political decisions and that a scientific and evidence-based approach is taken to determine the extent to which patients would benefit from treatment with expensive new drugs.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness, and the resources available to the HSE.  The process for approval of new high tech drugs in Ireland involves three steps.  The first step involves a rapid review, which has been completed for Orkambi.  The second involves a full health technology assessment by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  This expert assessment is scientific and objective and evaluates whether the claims made for the benefits of a new drug are valid, and to what extent, including its impact, for example, on life expectancy, quality of life, reducing hospital admissions or reduced need for transplants.  The NCPE also considers which patient groups might benefit, how the drug compares with existing treatments and if it is cost-effective at the price sought by the manufacturer.  I have requested that the NCPE expedite this part of the process.  The Centre hopes to be in a position to issue its recommendation to the HSE in early June, and the HSE may, if it decides to proceed, then engage in price negotiations with the manufacturer.<\/p>  <p>  This process is designed to secure the best value for the HSE for investment in new treatments for Irish patients, and any savings that accrue from the process can be used to fund other health service developments, for example isolation rooms for CF and cancer patients, better ambulance services, home supports for the elderly and safer maternity services.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that it will be possible for Orkambi to be approved for patients who may benefit from it, and at a fair price, but it must go through the normal approval procedure first, like all other high-tech medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500050#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Provision","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500051#WRN00200"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[9293\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500051#WRN00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the proposed new primary care centre in Edenmore in Dublin 5; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>The HSE has responsibility for the provision and operation of Primary Care Centres.

The cost of private health insurance is influenced by a number of factors such as the number of persons in the market, the age profile of those holding private health insurance and ongoing medical innovations. Each of these are contributors to the cost of care, the cost of claims and therefore the cost of premia payable. <\/p>  <p>  Since my appointment as Minister, keeping the health insurance market stable and increasing the numbers taking out health insurance has been one of my key priorities. An increase in the numbers taking out health insurance helps to control premium inflation, thereby keeping health insurance more affordable for everyone. Lifetime Community Rating Regulations came into effect from 1 May 2015 and late entry loadings now apply for people aged 35 and over when taking out health insurance for the first time. This encourages people to take out health insurance at a younger age, thereby avoiding loadings and helping to spread the health costs of older and less healthy people across all insured persons. In addition, 'Young Adult&rsquo; rates of premium, which are based on a sliding scale of maximum chargeable rates up to age 26, also apply from May 2015. These discounts encourage younger members to remain in the insured market. Without these measures, there would be a continued deterioration in the age profile of the insured population, which in turn would contribute to claims inflation and result in higher insurance premiums.<\/p>  <p>  The impact of these initiatives on the market can now be seen, as the number of people now holding private health insurance is 2.126 million, or 45.9% of the Irish population (end-March 2016). This represents an increase of over 95,000 members on the previous 12 months, which contributes positively to keeping health insurance affordable for those who wish to avail of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500051#WRN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services Waiting Lists","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500051#WRN00800"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[9299\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500051#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children listed as waiting for orthodontic treatment; the extent to which the waiting list has fluctuated in each of the past five years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":247,"content":"<p>The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to those who have been assessed and referred for treatment before their 16th birthday.

public expenditure so as to stabilise the country's public finances.  The previous Government decided to reduce the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.  Overall, the removal of qualification allowances had the effect of further reducing the pay of new entrant teachers by between 5 and 7 percent.<\/p>  <p>  The measures above &ndash; which applied to new entrants only and which were in addition to the pay reductions imposed on public servants generally - were implemented at a time of extraordinarily difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.  It is estimated that some 6,700 teachers who entered the profession since 2011 have been affected by the measures.<\/p>  <p>  The Haddington Road Agreement re-aligned the pay scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with that of pre-2011 entrants.

In total the programme is expected to deliver 1,500 social housing units. PPP units take a minimum of 3 years to be delivered. To enable delivery to commence as quickly as possible, the PPP programme is being rolled-out in three bundles. <\/p>  <p>  The first bundle of PPP sites which is to provide over 500 units in the greater Dublin area was announced in October 2015.  The social housing is being developed at these six sites in co-operation with the local authorities in each area. Two of the sites are located in Dublin City with one each in South Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Louth.      <\/p>  <p>  Dublin City Council has been appointed to act as the lead local authority for the delivery of the social housing PPP Programme in respect of this first bundle.  The delivery and governance arrangements for this bundle have now been put in place and the Project Board held its first meeting on 29 April 2016.  The Project Board is chaired by the Chief Executive of the City Council and includes representatives of my Department, the National Development Finance Agency and each of the Local Authorities concerned (in this case, Dublin City Council, South Dublin County Council, Louth County Council, Wicklow County Council and Kildare County Council).     <\/p>  <p>  Site selection for the second bundle is close to finalisation with a third bundle to be finalised by end of 2016.

This sub-group includes representatives of my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the National Development Finance Agency and the Housing Agency.   <\/p>  <p>  The units to be delivered under the programme will use what is termed an &lsquo;availability-based&rsquo; PPP model, in which a private sector company designs, builds, finances and maintains the social housing units in return for a &lsquo;unitary payment&rsquo;.   The &lsquo;availability based&rsquo; model being applied has been used successfully in Ireland for over 15 years to deliver roads, schools and courthouses.\u00a0 It involves the procurement of a consortium to design, build, finance and maintain, for 25 years, social housing units on sites provided by the State.

No expenditure has been incurred to date in respect of the PPP project.   <\/p>  <p>  The relevant local authorities will retain responsibility for tenant management during the contract period. Tenants allocated to PPP units are drawn, in the normal manner, from the local authority social housing waiting list in accordance with that local authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.\u00a0 The tenants are subject to standard arrangements as apply to other social housing allocations, including in respect of the charging of differential rent.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500059#WRV00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1349"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":372,"content":"<p>Question No. 121 answered with Question No. 115.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[9233\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500060#WRW00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the membership of the social housing strategy oversight group; the number of meetings it has held since it was established; and to provide the Houses of Oireachtas, with copies of the minutes of its meetings.","asker":"1215","askee":"1349"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[9234\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050500060#WRW00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the membership of the Dublin social housing delivery taskforce; the number of meetings it has held since it was established; and to provide the Houses of the Oireachtas, with copies of the minutes of its meetings.","asker":"1215","askee":"1349"},{"type":"speech","counter":377,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 123 together.<\/p><p>The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020<\/i>, published in November 2014, targets the provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households mainly through the Housing Assistance Payment.

Within this context, significant progress has been made in respect of delivery.<\/p><p>At the end of March 2016, a total of 2,042 residential properties have been delivered for social housing providers comprising of 1,469 completed properties with a further 573 that have been contracted where completion work is on-going. Of these 1,066 were contracted\/delivered through the mechanism of NARPS. Full information including a breakdown by Local Authority is available on the website of the Housing Agency at \/NAMA and also on the NAMA website .<\/p><p>Local Authorities, particularly those in high demand areas, are continually reviewing the list of available NAMA properties to see if they are suitable to be brought into use as social housing for people on local authority housing lists.

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The provision of electronic communications infrastructure, including the significant investment required to make high speed telecommunication services publicly available, occurs within a fully liberalised market. It is a matter for the competing network providers to decide those areas which can be served on a commercial basis, in the first instance. Intervention by the State is limited to investment or co-investment in those areas of the country the commercial market will not serve. <\/p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services in the last four years, and is continuing to invest. These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available. <\/p><p>On 22 December 2015, I formally launched the procurement process for the State intervention to provide high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland that may not be served through commercial investment.

Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March.

This second stage in the process will be formal Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to shortlisted bidders. <\/p><p>This is scheduled to commence in June and will take place over the Summer.
