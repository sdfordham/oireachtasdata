I will confine my remarks to Vote 38 and to the report on the IBTS pension issues.  I will comment on the children&rsquo;s hospital at the later session.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, Vote 38 for health received Exchequer funding to meet the cost of salaries and expenses incurred by the Office of the Minister for Health, to provide grant funding for a number of bodies under the aegis of the Department of Health, and to meet the cost of certain other services.  Members will be aware that for 2015, the Vote for health includes Exchequer funding for the Health Service Executive.  In 2014, this did not go through Vote 38, the HSE had its own Vote.  As a result, the structure of the Vote for health will be radically different in the future.<\/p> <p>  Gross expenditure of &euro;194.8 million was incurred on Vote 38 in 2014, against an estimate of &euro;205.9 million.  The  underspend of &euro;11.1 million, combined with higher than budgeted receipts of &euro;800,000, resulted in a surrender of &euro;11.9 million to the Exchequer.  By 2014, most Votes had moved to presenting information on a programme basis.  The objective of that format is to try to present financial information in a way that facilitates a focus on the objectives of spending, rather than on inputs or on spending types.  Vote 38 was an exception; grouping spending under headings related to administration, recurring grants, capital grants and a miscellaneous other services category, which accounted for 55% of the overall vote expenditure.<\/p> <p>  At an individual subhead level, the most significant Vote expenditure in 2014 was on: recurrent grants to development, consultative, supervisory, regulatory and advisory bodies for the health sector, totalling &euro;47.8 million; research grants totalling &euro;34.9 million; payments totalling &euro;27.2 million related to ongoing compensation for victims of hepatitis C contamination of the blood supply, and payments totalling over &euro;17 million in relation to inquiries, legal fees and settlements.  Administration costs incurred by the Department totalled &euro;26.9 million.<\/p> <p>  A primary aim of appropriation accounting is to report and explain variances between the sums voted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the outturn.  Explanations for significant variances in expenditure are given in note 3 and for variances in amounts receivable by the Vote in note 4.  The main areas where the expenditure outturn was significantly lower than the amounts provided were in respect of administration costs, which were some &euro;4 million less than the estimate.  Amounts of recurrent grants paid to health sector agencies was &euro;8.8 million lower than budgeted - this was largely due to unfilled posts in agencies, including the Health Information and Quality Authority HIQA and the Mental Health Commission.  The lower than budgeted expenditure in these areas was partly offset by higher than budgeted expenditure of &euro;6.9 million under subhead D, which is provided to cover the cost of inquiries, legal fees and settlements.  The Department noted that the excess on this subhead arose largely as a result of higher than expected payments made under the Lourdes Hospital and symphysiotomy payment schemes, and in relation to medical negligence claims.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a statutory body established in 1965 and operating under the aegis of the Department of Health.  Its primary functions are the collection, processing and supply of blood and blood products.  The safe supply of such products is a critical element in the provision of health services in the State - the importance of this activity is underscored by the number of citizens who in the past suffered serious infection through the blood supply, and the ongoing cost to the taxpayer of compensation payments and of the provision of services to them.<\/p> <p>  The IBTS does not receive State funding by way of an annual grant.  All of its recurring income is derived from charges in respect of the supply and testing of blood and blood products.  The charge out rates are decided by the Minister for Health.  In 2009, IBTS earned income in the region of &euro;118 million.  By 2013, its income had fallen to approximately &euro;66 million, reflecting the transfer of responsibilities to St James's Hospital, changes in demand for certain products and price reductions.<\/p> <p>  The Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2013 includes a chapter in respect of a long-standing dispute between the Department and IBTS about amounts deducted from staff salaries in respect of pension-related deductions.<\/p><p>I should point out here that pension-related deductions are not the same as employee pension contributions.  In effect, the deductions are a salary reduction measure.  The 2009 FEMPI legislation provided for pension-related deductions from the remuneration of public servants from 1 March 2009.  Between 2009 and 2013, IBTS deducted &euro;8.7 million from staff remuneration in this regard, but at September 2014 had not paid over any of these amounts to the Department of Health as provided for in the legislation.  The 2014 financial statements indicate that the amount due to the Department at the end of that year had increased to &euro;10.3 million.  As a result, funding of that amount receivable by the Vote for health has not been received, and the provisions of the FEMPI Act are not being complied with in that regard.<\/p><p> The second issue in dispute relates to IBTS pension funding.  IBTS operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme for its employees, which is contributory.  In common with many other funded defined benefit schemes, the IBTS scheme is a balance of cost scheme.  This means that while the contribution rate for employees is fixed as a percentage of salary, the contribution IBTS, as the employer, is liable to pay into the fund goes up or down as required to ensure that the funding will be sufficient to meet the liabilities when they fall due.  Between 2011 and April 2014, IBTS made additional contributions of &euro;9.3 million to the pension scheme.  Notwithstanding the additional contributions, at the end of 2013 the pension fund deficit was estimated at &euro;42 million.  By end 2014, this had increased to &euro;92 million.  The movement year-on-year illustrates the volatility of pension liability estimation, which can be seen in the accounts of many State bodies.  At the time I reported, discussions were ongoing between IBTS, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the resolution of both of these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100800002#G01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444294800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I am here today to deal with the annual report and appropriation accounts of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of Vote 38, the Department of Health.  I am very happy to be here on my first occasion as Accounting Officer for the Department of Health's Vote.  The Department of Health is relatively small, with 350 staff directly on its payroll.  In 2013 it was responsible for a budget of some &euro;248 million and, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has said, that budget was &euro;206 million in 2014.  The budget covered the salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister and certain other services administered by that office, including grants to research, consultative and advisory bodies.<\/p> <p>  After more than a decade of change in the wider health sector, it is important that the Department of Health redefine its role to take account of these developments and to meet future challenges.  The Department's statement of strategy for the period 2015-2017 identifies the following four main elements to the Department&rsquo;s role: leadership and policy direction for the health sector to improve health outcomes; governance and performance oversight to ensure accountable and high-quality services; collaboration to achieve health priorities and contribute to wider social and economic goals; and the creation of an organisational environment where, on an ongoing basis, high performance is achieved and the knowledge and skills of staff are developed.  A programme of change is under way in the Department and our aim is to create an organisational environment that will position us to fulfil our role and achieve our priorities in the most effective way possible.  This programme of change also includes new assignment of management team responsibilities and the recruitment of new members to the management team, including a deputy secretary general for governance and performance and a deputy secretary general for policy and strategy, together with an assistant secretary for research and development and health analytics. <\/p> <p>  I will turn now to the IBTS pension fund.  When the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 was initially introduced, the IBTS questioned whether its staff should be liable for the pension-related deductions provided for under the FEMPI legislation, as employees of the IBTS are members of a long-standing private pension scheme.  The Department communicated to the IBTS from the outset that its staff were subject to the pension levy and stressed at every opportunity the necessity of remitting the pension-related deductions collected from employees.  The IBTS, which subsequently accepted that the legislation applies to its employees, linked the non-remittance of pension levy funds to the need to address a deficit in the IBTS pension fund.  Various efforts have been made to resolve the issue and considerable progress has been made in recent months.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health are participating in conciliation talks with the IBTS and employee representatives under the auspices of the newly created Workplace Relations Commission with a view to reaching a sustainable conclusion.  In line with the IBTS pension fund's trust deed, any changes in pension arrangements have to be agreed by the employees.  At a Workplace Relations Commission conciliation conference attended by all parties on 2 October 2015, a proposal was put forward by the commission.  This proposal will be considered further by the IBTS and its employees.  However, the proposal is acceptable to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health, and it is the hope of both Departments that it can bring resolution to the matters set out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report.<\/p> <p>  I will now set out the main points of the 2013 accounts as they pertain to Vote 38.  Funding is allocated to the Department of Health under Vote 38.  Through this Vote, funding is also allocated to bodies under the aegis of the Department, such as the Mental Health Commission, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The 2013 provision, current and capital, for Vote 38 was almost &euro;248 million.  The 2013 outturn was almost &euro;220 million, leaving an overall saving of &euro;28 million.  The 2013 provision for current expenditure was &euro;233 million and the outturn was &euro;208 million, giving a saving of &euro;25 million.  In 2013, &euro;20 million of this saving was used to offset the Supplementary Estimate requirement for Vote 39, the Health Service Executive, thereby reducing the call on the Exchequer.  The 2013 provision for capital expenditure was almost &euro;14 million and the outturn was &euro;11 million, a saving of &euro;4 million.  The majority of this saving was due to timing issues on projects, particularly the construction of a clinical research facility at University Hospital Galway, which, I am delighted to say, was recently opened.  The contingency allocation was not required.  Further detail is provided in the opening statement on the breakdown of the appropriation account, and I might skip over that in the interest of time.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, under the provisions of the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014, the Vote of the Health Service Executive is disestablished and funding of the HSE is now provided from the Vote of the Minister for Health, Vote 38, with effect from 1 January 2015.  I look forward in future years to accounting to the committee for this expenditure as part of my Accounting Officer duties.  <\/p> <p>  In my capacity as Secretary General I am seeking to develop the Department&rsquo;s policy and performance oversight of the entire range of complex services falling within total public health expenditure.  I have mentioned the change programme under way in the Department, including the revised management team responsibilities which seek to equip us for this aspect of our role, amongst others.  I look forward to working with the committee, and with the Oireachtas generally, on this objective.  I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100800002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444294800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>My opening statement will deal with the issue of the IBTS pension scheme under four headings: the background to the scheme; pension-related deductions; the funding requirement; and discussions to resolve the issue.<\/p> <p>  The IBTS, formerly the Blood Transfusion Service Board, was established by a statutory instrument, SI 78\/1965, to organise and administer a blood transfusion service.  The pension scheme was set up under indenture, or a trust deed, in 1963.  When the Blood Transfusion Service was established in 1965 to replace the National Blood Transfusion Association, one of the functions of the new body was \"to take over the property (including choses-in-action), assets, rights and liabilities of the Company.\"  This would have included the pension scheme.  <\/p> <p>  The IBTS operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which is a balance of costs scheme.  Under the terms of the trust deed, any increase in contribution required to be paid following an actuarial valuation to ensure that the benefits under the scheme are funded falls to be paid by the employer.  Currently the employer pays 30% of payroll and the employees contribute, on average, 6.3%.  The benefits under the scheme are broadly in line with other public sector models and these have been actuarially evaluated and found to be comparable.  <\/p> <p>  I will now discuss the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 and the pension-related deduction.  The background to the application of the FEMPI Act 2009 is dealt with in detail in the briefing paper.  The FEMPI Act was introduced at a critical point in the consultation process with employees regarding funding of the scheme where the employer was seeking an increased contribution from employees to address the funding issue.<\/p><p>However, it is necessary to reiterate that initially the IBTS was informed that the Act did not apply.  This was subsequently changed to state that the staff in the IBTS were covered by the terms of the Act and should pay the PRD.  The board sought legal advice from senior counsel, which advised that the IBTS pension scheme did not fall within the definition of a public service scheme in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest  Act 2009 and, therefore, the terms of the Act did not apply.  The board decided to deduct the PRD from staff but the moneys were not remitted to the Department of Health.  Since April 2015, the IBTS has remitted the PRD collected from members of the single public service pension scheme and the amount in excess of &euro;10 million in respect of all other staff.  The total amount remitted to 30 June is &euro;1.268 million.  In addition, the IBTS pension scheme was deemed a private pension scheme for the purposes of the Government levy on private pension schemes.  This resulted in &euro;2.44 million being deducted from the value of the assets in the IBTS pension fund.<\/p><p> I refer to the funding requirement.  As with a large number of defined benefit schemes, there is a deficit in the IBTS fund.  The deficit from the most recent actuarial valuation on 1 May 2014 was &euro;27.921 million.  The funding requirement has increased substantially over the past decade.  The following shows the increase in the employer contribution required to fund the current level of benefits: 2005, 14% equation to a value of &euro;2.93 million; 2008, 19.5% or &euro;5.33 million; 2011, 20.7% or &euro;5.74 million; and 2014, 30% or &euro;7.22 million.  This is placing an unsustainable burden on the employer and it is clear that the current situation cannot continue.  The IBTS has recognised this for some time and has been in negotiations with staff on changing the terms of the scheme.  This level of increase is having a serious consequence on the funding of the IBTS.  In the current financial year, the core business is performing well except for the increased cost of the pension contribution which has put the organisation into deficit.  This is a very serious issue and needs to be addressed if the IBTS is to continue to provide a blood supply as safe as we can make it.  This means continuing to be current with technological developments.<\/p><p> The IBTS in the period 2009 to 2014 has, like all public sector bodies, undergone significant change and has reduced its cost base significantly.  This has occurred through a mixture of reductions in pay, controlling and reducing non-pay costs and reducing staff numbers.  In this context, the following reductions-savings have been achieved: pay , &euro;8.578 million or 20.85%; and non-pay, &euro;6.2 million or 18.96%, giving a total of  &euro;14.8 million or 20.1%.  At the same time, there has been a reduction in whole-time equivalents of 89.95 or 15.46%.  These have been achieved at a time the income of the IBTS has reduced by &euro;20.969 million, or 25.7%.  This is primarily as a result of the reduction in the use of blood and platelets.  These have reduced by 13.45% and 14.64%, respectively, in the period 2009 to 2014.  Consequently, the scope for further significant reductions in spending is minimal.  Therefore, the provision of pension arrangements for staff must be addressed In the context of the funding model of the IBTS.<\/p><p> With regard to discussions to resolve the issue, the IBTS has been engaged with staff and their representatives since 2002 on finding ways of resolving the increasing cost of funding the pension scheme.  To prevent the problem becoming worse, the IBTS changed the pension scheme for new entrants after 1 May 2009.  There is now broad recognition by all parties that the current situation cannot continue and that the measure taken in 2009 is not sufficient.  This means there needs to be a change to the benefits for existing members of the scheme.  The current series of negotiations is about finding a solution that will resolve the pension issue and secure the necessary funding for the IBTS into the future.  These negotiations are being held under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform are involved in this process.  Progress has been made and we will all continue to work together to resolve this outstanding issue.  We are hopeful of a successful conclusion to these negotiations and then the proposal will have to be put to a ballot of all members of the pension scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100800002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444294800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly.

The urgency of that, and public concern attaching to it, meant that it was necessary to develop that guideline as a matter of some urgency.  Added to that was the very particular skills set required.  Although in the period since then, we have developed this capability within the Department, this is not an area in which the Department had expertise nor is it an area in which there is a range of providers in the country.  It involves of a mix of specialist clinical and economic skills that are not easily found.  The Department was able to source a person with the requisite skills to conduct that research.  They were not employed by UHG; this was an investigation into UHG.  We provided the rationale for this in the annual report.

Those therapies now have a very good effectiveness in delivering not just improvement in the person's condition but, in some cases, curative.<\/p> <p>  We put in place a &euro;30 million programme in 2015, and that is being rolled out on a clinical basis where consultants identify those most urgent in clinical terms to be treated.  The Government has announced that as a multi-annual programme so I hope in future years to be talking about the money we spent on curing people with hepatitis C rather than compensating people for hepatitis C.

Work was undertaken internationally and in Ireland to try to identify the association between people with narcolepsy, mostly young people, and those who had taken the vaccine.  An association was found.  There was a further requirement to prove causality, which is very hard to do because somebody may take a vaccine but something else may happen at the same time.  That being said, the Health Service Executive has worked with relatively small numbers of people in that category to try to put services in place around their needs.  We have increased the staffing around some of the specialist services that are needed for that and I know that is the case across Government, including in places like the Department of Education and Skills where people in the leaving certificate cycle, for example, have needed extra support with that and at university level.<\/p> <p>  There are likely to be some claims around that issue.

After the organisation was established, the pensions scheme was established in 1963.  There was a pension fund and every three years under the Pensions Act an actuary made a valuation to see what contributions were required to fund the benefits payable under the scheme at the time.  The trustees or the board of trustees, three of whom are appointed by the employer and three by the staff, operate the scheme on behalf of members and it was deemed that there would be a private pensions scheme.  The issue then arose, as there was a deficit in the scheme.  We were in discussions with staff at the time - in 2009 - to make increased contributions to secure their benefits under the scheme.  We were actually involved in conciliation on the day we found out that this scheme did apply.  The conciliation process broke down and they were not willing to pay any more if there was to be a pension-related deduction also.  They were not going to have a PRD of 6% or 7% and pay a further 6% or 7% to secure their benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100800002#M04200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1444294800,"counter":178,"content":"<p>How much money had the organisation collected?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100800002#M04300","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444294800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>At this point we have &euro;10 million in the accounts of the IBTS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100800002#M04400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1444294800,"counter":180,"content":"<p>What gave the board the right to have this discussion in the light of the confirmed position of the Department of Health that the IBTS was subject to the FEMPI legislation?

In the very early stages there was uncertainty, which went on for about two months maximum.  The board sought advice from senior counsel on whether the IBTS pensions scheme fitted the definition of a public service persons scheme within the terms of the FEMPI legislation.  The view of senior counsel was that it did not, that it was not a public service pensions scheme within the terms of the legislation.  Under our scheme, on retirement, the trustees calculate a person's pension based on the final salary given to them by the employer.  An individual member of staff retired and the employer told the trustees that the retirement pension was to be based on final salary which had been cut a number of months earlier.  The person concerned challenged this in the High Court saying, \"If you cut my pay on the basis of FEMPI 2, then that Act should also apply in giving me the benefit of a grace period and retiring on a pension based on pre-cut salary.\"  The trustees said, \"Not according to our trustee rules; therefore, it is to be based on final salary.\"  The person concerned did not accept this and took a case to the Ombudsman.  He supported her case and also determined that we had a public service pensions scheme.  The trustees then had no option but to appeal the decision to the High Court.  Even though he said at the beginning of his judgment that he was not going to deal with the substantive issue, the President of the High Court asked the hypothetical question whether the Oireachtas had intended to exclude the IBTS from the FEMPI legislation when it was brought forward and, using section 5 of the Interpretation Act 2005, decided that it had not been its intention to do so.  He, therefore, decided that it was a public service pensions scheme.

The Act commenced on 1 March.  On 4 March, we corresponded with the Department of Finance, as it was at that stage, in response to a question that was raised about the application of FEMPI to the IBTS and the Department of Finance responded to us.  On 6 April, we gave our definitive position in writing to the IBTS, which was that it needed to deduct the levy and remit it to the Department.  That has been our position ever since.  Predecessors of mine and Ministers have written letters on this issue.  We have maintained that position.  The IBTS has linked the two issues of the FEMPI reductions and the financial position of the pension fund.  I do not underestimate the pension fund issue.  We have actively tried to work on that with the IBTS in the latest manifestation of this process.  In fairness to the IBTS, this is not simply an issue between two organs of the State as there are also employees involved.  The agreement of the employees will be needed if the issues in the pension fund are to be resolved.  The Workplace Relations Commission has been engaged on that part of this piece of work.  I think all of us, including the two Departments and the IBTS, are optimistic that the basis of a resolution is on the table.  That will require employees to sign up to revised pension arrangements.  If that is done, the two Departments have indicated that a contribution towards resolving that can be made in some or in part of the &euro;10 million that is outstanding.

That would be one of the first things that one would try to address in the 2016 Estimate.  One would also seek to put in place something to provide for demography.  I have given the example of &euro;200 million.  One would then adjust it for movements in pay rates.  So, in relation to next year, there would be an increase in pay rates.  In some of the years over this period, that has been a reduction in pay rates and, therefore, one could reduce it down.  One will look at the cost of drugs and we have been successful in reducing the price of drugs, but the volume of drugs that are being prescribed continues to rise as it does in most jurisdictions.

He stated that the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda have made it clear that there are still issues that need to be dealt with.  I am beginning to get worried, though, that the HSE sits on such reports and then redacts them, and it is in the public interest for that to change.

There is the occasion where members of that panel have worked in the HSE because that is by far the biggest provider of health services but a studied eye is given to the composition of the panel, to ensure that it has clear independent status to it.

I am happy with that.<\/p> <p>  What I am deeply concerned about is the fact that the health boards, dating back to their time, and therefore the Department of Health, failed a high number of vulnerable young adults in this State, and probably continues to do that in this case.  Within the organisation of the health services, someone knows what happened in relation to this.  It did not go unnoticed.  A senior social worker and an independent organisation felt strongly enough about it to make a protected disclosure on a number of different occasions, and felt so strong about it that they raised it at a restricted public meeting of employees with the HSE.<\/p> <p>  It also was raised here.  Deputy Deasy and I raised it, and I made a disclosure to Pearse St. Garda station.  This is what annoys me about it.  Some employees of the health board at that time must have known about this and that was said by the whistleblower in greater detail.  I have not heard from the HSE or from the Department of Health to say they have identified the various persons who engaged with this issue at that time.<\/p> <p>  I want to put this on record because of what Mr. Breslin said.  I was asked to attend a meeting in the Garda station some months ago where I was told that the evidence had been presented to the DDP and that no action would be taken.  Mr. Breslin states that he is waiting on the Garda report or the Garda is dealing with it, and I have been told that the Garda has dealt with it.  They either have or they have not dealt with it.  In my opinion, someone is covering up or playing games, and we need to come clean on all of this issue, not only in the interest of accountability, transparency and all of those words that are used nowadays, but in the interest of the families concerned.<\/p><p>Some of those young adults may have continued through their lives being affected by what happened.  I have read some of the reports and, quite frankly, in my time in the public arena I have never read anything so horrifying.  Both the reports and the verbal explanations given to me by the social workers are horrifying.  That is what disturbed me most about this.  We had an exchange here with the HSE on this matter and I must say that its arrogance and stonewalling on the occasion in question was breathtaking.  A bit of truth and a bit of effort would really change things around here and would also the circumstances of the people affected.  In light of what I have been told and in view of the fact that the Department of Health, at some stage in its history, employed people who were directly responsible in this area, there is an onus on the Department to conduct some sort of investigation into both itself and the individuals concerned.  It should not be held back by the report or the information to the effect that there is a Garda report.  The witness can say that I told him there were no prosecutions to happen.  That is what I was told.  I will leave it at that but I could not leave it at the exchange with Deputy Deasy because so much has happened since. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100800002#Q02300","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444294800,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I am happy to do this.

The project management team had incurred expenditure of just over &euro;3.2 million, mainly relating to design costs and &euro;7.6 million had been incurred in respect of administration costs, including salaries.  All of the expenditure incurred had been capitalised and recognised as an asset in the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board's<b><i><\/i><\/b>balance sheet.  The carrying value of the asset was impacted upon by the Government decision on 6 November 2012 to change the location of the hospital.<br\/><br\/>In December 2012, the term of the existing board expired.  Following its appointment in August 2013, the new board undertook a review of asset values, which took account of the extent to which the outputs produced could be used on the project at St James&rsquo;s.  The audit of the 2013 financial statements included a review of the impairment calculation.  The financial statements for 2013 reflect the writing down of &euro;35.5 million of the accumulated expenditure.

On 2 August 2013, the current board was appointed and a new executive recruited.  Total expenditure for 2013 was &euro;1.71 million.  This can be summarised under the following headings: payroll and related costs, &euro;460,000; site clearance cost &euro;260,000; design team fees, &euro;260,000; health planning, &euro;200,000; and administration and other costs, &euro;530,000.  The 2013 balance sheet includes assets valued at &euro;39.98 million at the beginning of 2013 in respect of the planning and development work for the children&rsquo;s hospital planned for the Mater Hospital campus.  This value relates to accumulated expenditure in the period 2007 to 2012.  These details were discussed at a previous Committee of Public Accounts meeting with the NPHDB on 23 October 2014.<\/p> <p>  The current board of the NPHDB was announced in August 2013 and commenced familiarising itself with the overall project details, including the 2012 and 2013 accounts.  On page 14 of the 2013 accounts, note 3 identifies that, arising from the Government decision to change the location of the new children's hospital to the St James&rsquo;s hospital site, the board spent considerable time ascertaining potential reusable value of the accumulated expenditure.  The development board initiated a process in 2014 to review and analyse the asset impairment.  The review was carried out based on guidelines in financial reporting standard, FRS, 11 ensuring any impairment or loss is measured and recognised.  The board has reviewed all expenditure for construction work in progress, identified the deliverables which were supported by that expenditure, set out the sections of the deliverables which can be utilised on the St. James's campus and carried out detailed analysis on the value of the sections of work which can be utilised or modified to provide future value.<\/p> <p>  The impairment analysis comprised detailed examination of all expenditure, divided into separate, distinct components being examined by the staff of the board who have project knowledge of the individual components involved.  The review involved detailed analysis of the costs up to November 2012  - the date of the decision to move to the St. James&rsquo;s campus - and the costs in 2013 that relate Mater site project.  The staff members then reviewed the data to assess what portion of each individual component could be reutilised on the St. James&rsquo;s site.  The review was completed in September 2014.  The proposed impairment was reviewed by the NPHDB audit committee, the board of the NPHDB, the HSE, the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform, the Comptroller and Auditor General as part of the audit process and PricewaterhouseCoopers has reviewed and confirmed that the process is in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP.<\/p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE, as funder, were in agreement with the approach taken by the development board and the Department confirmed to the development board that it had no objection to the write-down in the development board&rsquo;s 2013 accounts.  The review resulted in an impairment of &euro;35,501,586 which related to the provision of services as set out in page 15 of the of 2013 accounts, which were specific to the activities and services supporting the Mater site and cannot be utilised or transferred to the project on the St. James&rsquo;s site.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the current status of the project.  A strategic infrastructure development planning submission for the new children&rsquo;s hospital was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 10  August 2015.  We expect an oral hearing to take place in November 2015.  A planning decision from An Bord Plean&aacute;la is expected on 15 February 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100800002#U01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444294800,"counter":435,"content":"<p>May we publish the statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100800002#V00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444294800,"counter":436,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100800002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock"},{"type":"speech","time":1444294800,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses here to the Committee of Public Accounts.

It was for a 16-storey building which could not accommodate a helicopter landing on the roof.  It was in breach of the Dublin city development plan and the local area plan - two statutory plans.

Previously, it had had a dual remit.  It had to concentrate on delivering the building and the medical-clinical integration of three children's hospitals.  The Government decided to have two boards - our board, that is, the development board, and the group board, which is chaired by Jim Browne from NUI Galway.  The skillsets in our board relate very much to building.  The chairman has 30 years experience in the construction sector.  We have two urban planners who worked with local authorities, one of whom was a member of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Chief Government Procurement Officer is on our board because, given the amount of procurement work we have to do, we also have a lot of financial work to do.  We have an architect who is the chief architect in the Northern Ireland health service.<\/p> <p>  The next thing was to make sure the executive was put in place.  Again, my background is in engineering.  I have worked on health care and building projects for 30 years.  The other members of my team, from the commercial director to our design director, come with engineering and architectural backgrounds; therefore, we know what it takes to deliver a building.  <\/p> <p>  Having these two streams in place, we said the next thing to do was to get in place a world-class design team with experience in designing children's hospitals.  We said we would not accept a design team with no experience of designing a children's hospital.  BDP Architects is leading it.  It delivered Alder Hey Children's Hospital and the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital in Brighton in the United Kingdom.  During the procurement phase the board was making sure we could minimise risk.  When St. James's Hospital was originally proposed as the site of the national children's hospital, a smaller site was offered.  I think we discussed this issue the last time we met.  The site comprises 12 acres of land in the middle of Dublin and three times the size of the site proposed at the Mater Hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100800002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock"},{"type":"speech","time":1444294800,"counter":472,"content":"<p>The site originally proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100800002#W00300","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444294800,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100800002#W00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock"},{"type":"speech","time":1444294800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>It was the site originally proposed, but the second design covered a much broader footprint.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100800002#W00500","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444294800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Correct, but our remit-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100800002#W00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock"},{"type":"speech","time":1444294800,"counter":476,"content":"<p>That is the point.

There are a few things that are fundamentally different in the way we are structured compared to the Mater Hospital.  In the Mater Hospital there was a board which, as Mr. Pollock said, straddled the integration of the hospitals in delivering the project.  In essence, at executive level, much of the work was outsourced to a business services team.  Our structure involves a board the remit of which is to design, build and equip the hospital.

Therefore, the board or whomever gave most of the work to this team, which, presumably, appointed the architects and worked up the plans in the context of making the original application for this 16-storey hospital building.  The decision of the board at that time was to refer essentially all of the elements of this work to a business services team.  I think we need to question that team in the context of what led it to believe that a planning application in respect of a 16-storey building could be successful; whether it examined the city or county development plan, as would be done for a normal site; whether it decided the footprint of the site was such that it would be allowed by the planners; and what analysis was conducted of services on the site and so on.  Is Mr. Costello aware of the analysis carried out by the team in the context of the lead-up to an application being made?

We took on board, where we could, comments and feedback from the locals.  For example, they were concerned about the height of the balconies.  We raised the height of the balconies.  We put screening on it.  We lowered the road to reduce potential overlooking.

At its simplest analysis, traffic is at its worst first thing in the morning and last thing in the evening.  That is when we all are going to and from work.  However, when the children's hospital opens in 2019, there will actually be 240 less car parking spaces for staff than currently exist.  Between now and 2019, a whole change in culture and behaviour will take place within the children's hospitals and within the adults'.  Public transport is there.  It is the best served hospital in the country for public transport.  By forfeiting those 240 car parking spaces off, first thing in the morning and last thing in the evening, that frees up a bit of capacity.
