The relevant provisions are contained in Part 2 of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, to put in place the legislative amendments to the Industrial Relations Acts 2001 and 2004 required to give effect to the Programme for Government commitment to reform the current law on employees' right to engage in collective bargaining (the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001), so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Furthermore, the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 prioritised the enactment of the Collective Bargaining legislation as approved by Government.

There are provisions to ensure cases dealt with are ones where the numbers of workers are not insignificant; provisions to ensure elements of remuneration and conditions of employment are not challenged without regard for the totality of remuneration and conditions of employment; provisions to manage the frequency of reassessment of the same issues. <\/p>  <p>  Crucially, additional protection by way of interim relief is proposed where a trade union member, identified in the course of use of the process under the Act, believes her or his dismissal is a direct consequence of this.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, any determination by the Labour Court may also be enforced by the Circuit Court, should any employer choose not to engage with a trade union or implement a previous recommendation of the Labour Court.   <\/p>  <p>  The new legislation will balance the interests of workers and employers by providing certainty and clarity for businesses while enhancing collective bargaining in workplaces, providing for registered employment agreements to be re-established and sectoral wage rates and conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Integral to the process of drafting the Bill, submissions and presentations were received from a range of interested parties ranging from trade union representatives, employer representatives, State bodies and others.

This is an area where significant mutual gains can be made which will promote trade and job creation. It will be a particular area of interest for Ireland with our large pharmaceutical and medical device sectors, It offers all parties an opportunity to make input into this significant area on the TTIP. The revised regulatory cooperation text was tabled by the EU and is available on the EU Commission website along with a detailed explanation of the EU proposal.   The chapters on Regulation first set out the potential benefits of regulatory cooperation in terms of:<\/p>  <p>  -  Jobs and growth<\/p>  <p>  -  More choice for consumers<\/p>  <p>  -  Stronger regulation, better enforced<\/p>  <p>  -  Greater influence on the international stage <\/p>  <p>  They then demonstrate that such cooperation will not lower existing protection in the EU or in the US. It makes clear that nothing in a TTIP agreement will affect the right of either side to make new regulations, or undermine the procedures through which those regulations are made. <\/p>  <p>  The detailed articles set out the general objectives and principles of cooperation. The key objectives are to facilitate trade and investment by removing unnecessary burden, promoting a transparent and predictable regulatory environment and promoting international cooperation. Some principles of good regulation are enshrined in the cooperation agreement such as early indication of plans, opportunity for consultation, sound impact assessment, development of an annual cooperation programme covering information exchange, identifying the scope for mutual recognition of equivalence, simplification or harmonisation. It also provides for the establishment of a Joint Regulatory Cooperation Body to facilitate their implementation of the cooperation agreement. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, nine specific sectors have been identified as areas on which regulatory cooperation work can be carried out and mutual gains achieved. These are cars, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, cosmetics, engineering, textiles, chemicals, pesticides, ICT. <\/p>  <p>  The EU and US work closely already in a number of areas. Air transport is one example of where common standards for safety and technical requirements are already in place, we have also agreed to recognise each other's organic food standards.  The ultimate objective of these initiatives is to avoid duplication and to find ways to make our systems work more smoothly. <\/p>  <p>  Regulatory compatibility and cooperation recognises the realities of globalisation and will make the trading landscape easier and more predictable.

The Action Plan for Jobs set a target to increase employment by 100,000 by 2016 and we are well on track to achieve that figure this year, ahead of the target. Much work remains to be done however to replace all the jobs lost in the downturn, the target which we have set is to achieve sustainable full employment by 2018.  This will require enhanced focus on developing skills and capability on the competitiveness of our sectors; on new business start-up, on developing new opportunities and on anticipating threats to existing jobs. <\/p>  <p>  With this year&rsquo;s plan (APJ2015) we have embedded a new assessment framework, which will improve monitoring associated with our employment policies. This is in response to a suggestion by the OECD that one area of improvement for APJ was to more clearly link actions to outcomes. For the first time we will be able to assess how actions increase sales, stimulate the domestic economy (retail, construction, tourism, agri-food), improve skills, activation and startups, enhance productivity and R&amp;D, make doing business easier and cheaper, and enhance funding availability for SMEs. A full set of assessment metrics is set out in Annex 2 of APJ2015. As well as helping assess the effectiveness of the APJ, these metrics will also enhance monitoring of the jobs environment with a view to ensuring early detection of areas of risk or indeed opportunity.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices work closely with individual enterprises to identify early warnings of difficulty, to seek to minimise job losses where possible and to develop responses to assist the enterprises get on a firmer footing for the future. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a dashboard of indicators which provide early indicators of changes occurring in areas critical to the developing environment which influences enterprise and jobs.

This has reduced from an average of 79.5 weeks in 2012 and every effort is being made to finalise cases on hand as efficiently as possible. The Tribunal indicate that there are currently approximately 3,500 cases on hand. There is likely to be a small number of cases, which may prove difficult to finalise in the short to medium term, including some cases adjourned, due to parallel High Court proceedings.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the current reform of Workplace Relations Services, the functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be transferred to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and the Labour Court insofar as first instance complaints and appeals respectively are concerned. The Employment Appeals Tribunal will continue to function for a limited period, after the establishment of the WRC, to finalise complaints and appeals which were lodged before commencement of the enabling legislation and will be dissolved on finalisation of those legacy cases.  The decision to extend the period of operation of the Tribunal beyond the establishment of the new framework is predicated on the assumption that complainants and respondents in matters referred to the EAT prior to the establishment of the WRC would have a legitimate expectation of having the case disposed of before a tripartite tribunal, sitting in public and operating with the degree of procedural formality currently applied by the EAT.<\/p>  <p>  With effect from the commencement of the enabling legislation, therefore, no new complaints or appeals will be presented to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which will then be in a position to focus its resources on finalising legacy cases. My objective is to ensure that the Tribunal has the necessary resources to progress these cases to finality in an efficient and effective manner and within a reasonable timeframe.<\/p>  <p>  More efficient and effective receipt, registration and referral of workplace relations complaints has already led to the removal of the hearings backlog in certain cases, particularly in the case of the Rights Commissioner Service.

This injection of economic activity will bring new job opportunities.  Based on EU Commission estimates, about 30 million jobs in the EU depend on sales to the rest of the world, and on average, each additional &euro;1 billion of exports supports 15,000 additional jobs across the EU.

It is critically important to put in place the right policy and regulatory framework to give investors the confidence to commit to long-term projects, and ensure the supply chain has the certainty and tools it needs to deliver effectively.  For example, as part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, I requested Forf&aacute;s to undertake a study to identify changes in the operation of sectoral regulators that would enhance cost competitiveness, which informed the Government Policy Statement on Economic Regulation, published in July 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300041#WRA03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development Supports","counter":57,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300041#WRA03850"},{"type":"question","counter":58,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[18357\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300041#WRA03900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his plans to encourage greater levels of research and development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":59,"content":"<p>All of our agencies have policies in place to encourage greater levels of research and innovation and to build the innovation capacity of our enterprises.

The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot anticipate the outcome of the study or the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the study&rsquo;s findings. However, the Deputy can rest assured that where the evidence points to some adjustment being required to the protections already in place under Irish employment law, these will be brought forward for consideration by Government.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to part-time workers and short-term contracts, Irish employment rights legislation contains strong safeguards for part-time workers. The Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 implemented EU Council Directive 97\/81\/EC into Irish law.  The purpose of the Directive was to implement the Framework Agreement on part-time work concluded by the European cross-industry organisations UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC. The Act provides a wide degree of protection for part-time employees, including the general protection that a part-time employee shall not be treated in a less favourable manner in respect of his\/her conditions of employment than a full time employee.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 13(5) of the 2001 Act contained provisions in relation to the preparation and publishing of a Code of Practice by the Labour Relations Commission in relation to the steps that could be taken by employers for the purposes of Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement. Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement provided that, as far as possible, an employer should give consideration to a request by workers to transfer from full-time work to part-time and vice-versa.  The Labour Relations Commission prepared this Code of Practice, based on the provisions in Section 13 of the 2001 Act, following consultation with the social partners.  It was deemed to be a Code of Practice and implemented, in 2006, by the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Access to Part-Time Working) (Declaration) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 8 of 2006).  Under Section 42(4) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, the Code is admissible in evidence in any proceedings before a Court, the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Equality Tribunal. <\/p>  <p>  The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 provides that fixed-term employees may not be treated less favourably than comparable permanent employees, unless the employer can objectively justify the different treatment. Any justification offered cannot be connected with the fact that the employee is on a fixed-term contract.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2003 Act also establishes a framework to prevent abuses arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts.  The Act provides that where an employee has been on two or more continuous fixed-term contracts, the total duration of those contracts may not exceed four years. After this, if the employer wishes to renew the employee&rsquo;s contract, it must be an open-ended contract unless there are objective grounds justifying the renewal of the contract for a fixed term only. <\/p>  <p>  The Unfair Dismissal Act 1977 as amended contains a provision aimed at ensuring that successive temporary contracts are not used in order to avoid that legislation. It provides that where a fixed-term or specified-purpose contract expires and the individual is re-employed within 3 months, the individual is deemed to have continuous service for the purposes of that Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300042#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1067"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Data","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300042#WRB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[18379\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300042#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will write to the Central Statistics Office to formally request it to compile official statistics regarding zero hour and low hour contracts here.","asker":"1080","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>In accordance with the Statement of Government priorities, I commissioned, last February, the University of Limerick (UL) to carry out a study into the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts and the impact of such contracts on employees.

Increasing entrepreneurial activity is a Disruptive Reform in the Action Plan for Jobs for 2015. Our key priority is driving implementation of the actions in the National Entrepreneurship Statement, which was published in October last year and to achieve the ambitions targets set out for a 25% increase in the number of start-ups and in the scaling and sustainability of new enterprises.    The launch of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) was a major reform delivered in 2014 and the clients of the LEOs increased employment by 4,012 last year to 31,326 jobs throughout the country. In 2015 the LEOs will have ambitious and robust county strategies and targets for start-ups, enterprise engagements and supports to be effective first-stop-shops for enterprise information and supports and launch an Entrepreneur Partnering Programme. <\/p>  <p>  My Department through its agencies will build on the 2014 success of the awards programmes such as Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur with a renewed programme for 2015.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to promoting prosperity through job creation, the role of new entrepreneurs can hardly be overstated, with two-thirds of new jobs created by firms in their first five years. Enterprise Ireland works to increase the number of companies starting-up, succeeding, expanding, exporting and ultimately creating jobs in Ireland. EI&rsquo;s support system for young companies includes help with business planning, mentoring and development advice, feasibility funding and finance, often in the form of equity investment, as appropriate to the founder&rsquo;s ambitions and the company&rsquo;s potential and stage of growth. Enterprise Ireland has set itself an ambitious target of 550 new and early start-ups supported by 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s ten regional offices work closely with entrepreneurs, local development agencies and local representative bodies offering a wide range of supports for entrepreneurship. Building on the success achieved to date on the Competitive Feasibility Funds, EI will launch four targeted funds during the year in the West, Midlands, MidEast, and one sectoral fund. <\/p>  <p>  Early stage companies continue to face difficulties in accessing the necessary funding required to develop and to enable entrepreneur&rsquo;s to achieve their vision for their company. Enterprise Ireland also continues to support the development of the Seed and Venture Capital and Business Angel sectors to increase the provision of early stage funding to support entrepreneurs and early stage companies. A further call for expressions of interest under the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2013-2018 will be issued by the end of Q2. <\/p>  <p>  In many cases the lack of a first reference sale is a key barrier to accessing funding at an early stage.  Early intervention through entrepreneur development programmes such as New Frontiers and others workshops and accelerator programmes helps companies accelerate their business development and to build up the skills and contacts needed to successfully start and grow. EI will support 130 new Entrepreneurs via the New Frontiers programme in 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The launch of the simplified Startup Refunds for Entrepreneurs Scheme (SURE) in 2015 will provide additional finance for entrepreneurs. A range of agricultural related measures are being implemented including steps to maximise available agricultural land with measures to encourage long term leasing. We are also continuing to supporting the tourism sector with retention of 9% VAT rate. More broadly improvements in personal taxation will benefit the self-employed and entrepreneurs and support growth in demand across the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300042#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership","counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300042#WRB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":92,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[18301\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300042#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will report on the current status of Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership; the time-frame the Government is working with this; if an impact analysis of potential negative consequences has been developed along with examining positive outcomes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":93,"content":"<p>The 9th round of the TTIP negotiations took place in New York from 20 &ndash; 24 April 2015.

The objective during these rounds is to make as much progress as possible in all areas of the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  During the last Round, work advanced in all three pillars of the negotiations: market access, regulatory cooperation and rules. On market access, the discussions were technical, aimed at better understanding the respective tariff offers and issues around government procurement.  Regulatory issues took up a lot of the time, with a focus on both horizontal co-operation as well as the 9 specific sectors [cars, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, cosmetics, engineering, textiles, chemicals, pesticides, ICT]. The regulatory discussions are aimed at enhancing transatlantic trade by reinforcing regulatory co-operation in areas of shared interest and cutting out overlapping, unnecessary red-tape.  The discussions in the area of rules included sustainable development, and energy and raw materials.  SMEs were also discussed in the last Round, specifically, how SMEs might benefit from TTIP.  A Report released by the EU Commission at the start of the week of the last Round, which identifies perceived obstacles to trade for SMEs, will inform the EU approach in this area.<\/p>  <p>  The definitive time-frame is difficult to predict but it is expected that there will be substantial progress in these negotiations in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  According to assessments made by the EU Commission, a comprehensive TTIP could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum bringing significant economic gains as a whole for the EU.  This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  Right across the range of issues covered by TTIP, I will ensure we are best positioned to make the most from these and other trade and investment opportunities in order to maximise any potential benefits for Irish companies and citizens.<\/p>  <p>  The study commissioned by my Department estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole. It suggests growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1% and increase in real wages of 1.5%. It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs. It also suggests that Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will be particular beneficiaries.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the TTIP negotiations will be assisted by the indications from this study, which also includes areas of potential sensitivity.  Our priorities include advancing regulatory cooperation and common rules which aim to make trade and investment easier especially for SMEs, and protecting our interests in any sensitive areas, including beef.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports the Commission in these negotiations which aim to achieve an ambitious and comprehensive agreement contributing to growth and jobs both here and the EU.

It recommends that social insurance for the self-employed should be extended on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.

The final phase of the one-parent family payment scheme age change reforms will be taking place on 2 July, 2015, when the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which a one-parent family payment ceases will be reduced to 7 years for all recipients.  Prior to these reforms lone parents could have been on the scheme until their youngest child turned 18 years of age (or 22 years of age if they were in full time education). <\/p>  <p>  However, there is an exemption to these reforms for recipients who are recently bereaved.  In these circumstances the One-Parent Family Payment will be payable for two years from the date of death of the spouse\/civil partner\/co-habitant or until the youngest child reaches age 18, whichever occurs first.  If after the two years has elapsed and the person continues to have an income support need, they will either remain on the one-parent family payment, move to the jobseeker's transitional payment or to the jobseeker's allowance (JA) depending on the age of their youngest child, in the same way as any other lone parent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300042#WRB03900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Back to Education Allowance","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300042#WRB03950"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[18731\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300042#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will change the rules regarding back to education allowance to ensure that persons coming from Youthreach are eligible to qualify for the allowance immediately after they finish their Youthreach programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1198","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":148,"content":"<p>The State pension (contributory) is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. <\/p>  <p>  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  The rate at which a State pension (contributory) is paid at is determined by the average number of contributions paid or credited per year, with tiered rates applying in respect of bands of contributions. For example, to qualify for the maximum personal rate, a person requires a yearly average of 48 or more contributions per year. <\/p>  <p>  While new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced from September 2012, it was already the case that bands existed for different levels of contribution, and that some people qualified for a higher rate of pension on the State pension (non-contributory).  Therefore, this is not a new development.  A person who qualifies for a reduced rate of SPC below the maximum SPNC rate does so because, in addition to their SPC, they have additional means over and above that contributory pension.  If they did not, they would instead be paid the higher SPNC rate.  Accordingly, they are not worse off as a result of paying their contributions and the PRSI system continues to provide good value for such workers.<\/p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the State pension (contributory), men have been more likely to have a complete social insurance record than women, and yet, all of the main poverty indicators show that women over 65 experience poverty at the same or lower levels than men of the same age, despite many women having lower lifetime earnings than men.  This is a result of the social protection system which awards entitlements based on contributions to the Social Insurance Fund by the claimant or his or her spouse, and provides assistance where people have no such PRSI record.  Those with lower earnings and those with lesser contribution histories continue to obtain the best value for money from the Social Insurance Fun, e.g., a person with an average of only 20 contributions per year (i.e. 38% of the maximum) can receive a State pension of &euro;196, i.e., a higher rate than the full rate in 2007. <\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to state to what extent, if any, women were disadvantaged by the changes made in 2012 to new entrants to the State pension (contributory), as most of those whose State pension (contributory) entitlement would have been reduced, and these include both men and women, would have had access to other benefits.  Such benefits would be either derived from their spouse&rsquo;s contribution record, such as the widow&rsquo;s pension (contributory) or qualified adult increase on his pension, or in their own right, such as the State pension (non-contributory). <\/p>  <p>  Over time, there has been a very significant increase in female participation in the workforce, and this will impact on the gender profile of the various benefits claimed under the Irish pensions system.<\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;219, or just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory). Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just less than 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300043#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300043#WRC01550"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[18848\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300043#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will expedite a disability allowance application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry, as all relevant information has been submitted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

understanding of shadow economy (or black market) activity is that it is wide-ranging and it includes, not only illicit activity such as tobacco smuggling, oil laundering and counterfeiting, but also practices (much of which are facilitated within the cash economy) carried out by businesses such as suppressing sales and purchases, keeping cash payments 'off the books' and paying employees under an 'off the books' arrangement.\u00a0 Also within the shadow economy are those who are working while at the same time claiming social welfare benefits. <\/p>  <p>  Individuals and businesses that operate within the shadow economy gain an unfair competitive advantage compared to legitimate, tax compliant businesses and they deprive the Exchequer of much needed revenues.\u00a0 The Deputy will be aware that I have introduced a number of specific measures in recent years aimed at countering the effects of shadow economy activity.\u00a0 These include:<\/p>  <p>  -\tthe licensing regime for auto fuel traders which was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market;<\/p>  <p>  -\ta new licensing regime for marked fuel traders which was introduced in October 2012 and which is designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering;<\/p>  <p>  -\trequirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries to ensure data is available to Revenue assist in supply chain analysis;<\/p>  <p>  -\ta 'reckless trading' provision in Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that makes a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty evaded;<\/p>  <p>  -\tstrengthened provisions in the Finance Act 2014 to permit Revenue to refuse or revoke a mineral oil trader's licence where the trader does not comply with excise law, does not maintain adequate stock management systems and records, or provides false or misleading information. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied as regards Revenue's commitment to tackling shadow economy activity.\u00a0 That commitment is evidenced by the following key statistics for 2014 that were recently published in the Commissioners' Annual Report for that year:<\/p>  <p>  -\tover 437,000 compliance interventions yielding over &euro;610 million;<\/p>  <p>  -\t6,158 drug seizures and seizure of 201,140 litres of illicit fuel;<\/p>  <p>  -\tSeizure if 53.4 million cigarettes and 9,824 kg of tobacco, valued at &euro;25.47 million and &euro;4.22 million respectively.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioners' Annual Report also highlights the significant programme of work that is ongoing and aimed at specific aspects of the shadow economy including detection of fiscal fraud, smuggling and illegal drugs as well as targeting sectors of the economy that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow activity, specifically cash businesses such as the hospitality sector and white collar cash.I am satisfied that there is a high level of co-operation and joint working between the various State agencies who are charged with tackling the shadow economy and that the arrangements in place at an operational level are working effectively.<\/p>  <p>  There is extensive co-operation between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trades of tobacco and oil smuggling and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border groups to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for large proportions of these illicit markets. \u00a0There is also strong collaboration between Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the National Employment Rights Authority as evidenced by joint operations in relevant sectors focusing on compliance in relation to employment taxes.\u00a0\u00a0I am also informed that the Revenue website has recently been extended to include a shadow economy webpage where information to report such activity is provided. \u00a0Any information as regards shadow economy activity can be reported to Revenue, either via the Revenue website or directly (including anonymously) to any Revenue office.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly recently published a report on Cross-border Police Cooperation and illicit trade.\u00a0 The report found that:<\/p>  <p>  -\tthe current level of cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI was excellent with evidence that both police forces worked closely together, formally and informally, on many issues.<\/p>  <p>  -\tthe joint Cross-border Policing Strategy, first launched in 2010, has contributed to the detection of criminal activity and better public safety across the island of Ireland by enhancing the policing capabilities of both police services.<\/p>  <p>  -\tthe Committee welcomed the development of the multi-agency Cross-border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group and the Cross-border Tobacco Fraud Enforcement Group since its last inquiry.<\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the legislative measures in place, the on-going work and focus of the Revenue Commissioners in tackling shadow economy activity in all its manifestations and the significant on-going cross-border cooperation between agencies, I do not propose to establish a special task force to tackle the shadow economy on the lines suggested by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300043#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exchequer

Interest can only be deducted during the period in which the property is let and the deductibility of interest in computing taxable rental income from residential property (insofar as it would otherwise be allowable) is limited to 75% of such interest.Information on interest relief for rental property is based on all claims for such relief in tax returns: Form 11 or Form 12 for individual taxpayers. Interest relief associated with corporate landlords is not captured on the relevant corporation tax CT1 return and is therefore not available.Based on personal income tax returns filed for 2010 to 2012, the latest year available, the estimated amount of tax foregone by allowing a deduction for interest on borrowings to be offset against rental income is as shown in the following table. This includes the cost for both residential and commercial properties. <table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Cost &euro; million<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>672<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>691<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>577<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>These estimates are based on assuming that tax relief was allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% (the applicable rate in the years in question) and the figures provided could, therefore, be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost in respect of those taxpayers. <\/p><p>In respect of Question 18858\/15, it is assumed the Deputy is proposing to increase the 75% limit to 100%. In that regard, the Deputy should be aware that the estimated full year saving arising from the restriction of the interest deduction to 75% when introduced in the April 2009 supplementary budget, was put at &euro;95 million. It is likely, therefore, that the cost of restoration of the deduction to 100%, would be of the same broad order of magnitude. <\/p><p>In relation to Question 18859\/15, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the amount of gross domestic rental income declared on income tax returns was &euro;4.3bn for 2010, &euro;4.1bn for 2011 and &euro;4.0bn for 2012 (returns for tax years 2013 or 2014 are not yet available).

The purpose of the Directive was to implement the Framework Agreement on part-time work concluded by the European cross-industry organisations UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC. The Act provides a wide degree of protection for part-time employees, including the general protection that a part-time employee shall not be treated in a less favourable manner in respect of his\/her conditions of employment than a full time employee.<\/p>  <p>  Section 13(5) of the 2001 Act contained provisions in relation to the preparation and publishing of a Code of Practice by the Labour Relations Commission in relation to the steps that could be taken by employers for the purposes of Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement. Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement provided that, as far as possible, an employer should give consideration to a request by workers to transfer from full-time work to part-time and vice-versa.  The Labour Relations Commission prepared this Code of Practice, based on the provisions in Section 13 of the 2001 Act, following consultation with the social partners.  It was deemed to be a Code of Practice and implemented, in 2006, by the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Access to Part-Time Working) (Declaration) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 8 of 2006).  Under Section 42(4) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, the Code is admissible in evidence in any proceedings before a Court, the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Equality Tribunal. <\/p>  <p>  The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 provides that fixed-term employees may not be treated less favourably than comparable permanent employees, unless the employer can objectively justify the different treatment. Any justification offered cannot be connected with the fact that the employee is on a fixed-term contract.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2003 Act also establishes a framework to prevent abuses arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts.  The Act provides that where an employee has been on two or more continuous fixed-term contracts, the total duration of those contracts may not exceed four years.  After this, if the employer wishes to renew the employee&rsquo;s contract, it must be an open-ended contract unless there are objective grounds justifying the renewal of the contract for a fixed term only. <\/p>  <p>  The Unfair Dismissal Act 1977 as amended contains a provision aimed at ensuring that successive temporary contracts are not used in order to avoid that legislation.  It provides that where a fixed-term or specified-purpose contract expires and the individual is re-employed within 3 months, the individual is deemed to have continuous service for the purposes of that Act. <\/p>  <p>  I have no plans at this time to amend these provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300044#WRD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1067"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NSAI Inspections","counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300044#WRD03350"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[18887\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300044#WRD03400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he is aware of the delays in providing approval from the National Standards Authority of Ireland for products being produced; that these delays are resulting in Irish businesses losing contracts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":236,"content":"<p>The responsibility for the EU Directive 2007\/46\/EC governing motor vehicles type approvals lies with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and its Agency, the Road Safety Authority.<\/p><p>The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the Irish approval authority for this and related Directives. <\/p><p>The NSAI accepts that in the absence of the appropriate approval a business is unable to register a vehicle which impacts on the ability to place the vehicle on the market or complete contracts for delivery.  <\/p><p>The optimum processing and approval time for motor vehicles is two weeks<\/p><p>The processing time reflects the technical nature of the approvals process, the requirement on industry to build in an adequate provision for the automotive approvals timescale and the increased registration of new vehicles at the start of the year and at the mid-year registration cycle also. <\/p><p>These conditions, coupled with resourcing constraints, have led to current approvals times of approximately four weeks. <\/p><p>The timelines are dependent on submission of complete and accurate information accompanying the application.

The services sector is making the largest contribution to the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s target of 100,000 more at work by 2016. Following a number of years of decline in employment from 2007, I am pleased to report that the manufacturing sector has also recorded increases in job numbers since 2011. <\/p>  <p>  According to the CSO Quarterly National Household Survey, as of the fourth quarter of 2014, seasonally adjusted, the number of people at work in industry and services increased by 73,400, and there are 13,400 more people at work in construction, since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs in 2012.   <\/p>  <p>  In relation to agency assisted firms, the net increase in full-time employment since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs to 2014 is 25,665, of which there a was a net increase of 8,051 in manufacturing employment and a net increase of 17,614 in internationally traded services employment.  This equates to just under one-third, or 31 per cent, of the net increase in full-time employment in agency assisted firms was in manufacturing and two-thirds of the net increase was in internationally traded services enterprises, since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs. <\/p>  <p>  Arising from the strategy for the manufacturing sector &lsquo;Making it in Ireland: Manufacturing 2020&rsquo;, prepared by Forf&aacute;s and the report of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs Skills Report on the skills needs for the sector, both of which I launched in 2013, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by my Department and relevant Agencies to drive the Government&rsquo;s jobs targets. <\/p>  <p>  Manufacturing was a Disruptive Reform in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, with a range of measures designed to support industry growth including encouraging entrepreneurship, further improving our skills base, improving access to finance by SMEs and supporting indigenous companies and foreign-owned manufacturing companies to transform their businesses as part of a National Step Change Initiative.

Costs in Ireland have fallen across a range of business inputs since 2009, making Ireland more competitive internationally.  This is reflected in our ongoing ability to successfully compete internationally for trade and investment and in our improving performance across a range of international competitiveness benchmarking reports &ndash; for example, we have moved from 24th to 15th  in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook. <\/p>  <p>  In the longer term, improving our productivity performance must be the vehicle through which we must improve our competitiveness and grow the economy. Relentlessly pursuing productivity growth, driven by investment in talent and innovation, and improving our cost competitiveness remain vital to us as a small, export oriented economy so as to grow jobs and incomes in a sustainable way over the medium and longer term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300044#WRD04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300044#WRD04150"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[18894\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300044#WRD04200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which job creation, in both the manufacturing and services sectors, continues to be spread throughout the regions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>The Action Plan for Jobs since 2012 has set a comprehensive set of measures agreed by Government to promote job opportunities and employment growth in all regions.

The primary objective of the Code of Practice is to set standards and clearly define what is expected of all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds.<\/p><p>Greyhound welfare at Bord na gCon is managed by the Welfare Manager who can call upon three area stipendiary stewards and thirteen control stewards to conduct investigations of stray or mistreated greyhounds, conduct kennel inspections and investigate other welfare related incidents which have been reported to Bord na gCon.  The Welfare Manager, all area stipendiary stewards and all control stewards have been appointed by Bord na gCon as Welfare Officers under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.<\/p><p>The Irish Coursing Club (ICC) has responsibility for the registration of greyhounds in the Stud Book.  The limit on the number of litters a brood bitch may whelp is governed by Article 11 (3) of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  These provisions are enforced in the following manner: when a brood bitch is mated to produce a sixth litter<b><i>,<\/i><\/b>the breeder is informed at that time that they may only have a further two litters provided the brood is certified by a veterinary surgeon as being fit to be mated.  Breeders are further advised when they have reached the seventh litter stage.  The ICC does not register the result of a ninth mating and they have assured me they are in compliance with the provisions of the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300045#WRE03300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Administration","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300045#WRE03350"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[18758\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300045#WRE03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will extend the closing date for receipt of completed applications for the green low-carbon agri-environmental scheme by at least one month, in view of the fact that he has imposed new terms and conditions from 5 May 2015, just 12 days prior to the current closing date, which involves a change in the ranking system for Tier 3 farmers, as a result of which farm planners will be obliged to recheck applications submitted previously, in addition to ongoing attempts to submit new applications into the system on time; if he will recognise that he has imposed additional work on both farmers and farm planners, at the eleventh hour; if he will make allowance for this extra work by extending the application deadline appropriately; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I have received an action plan that addresses both the short and medium term requirements to manage the referrals that were not processed as they should have been as well as the longer term local and national management actions needed to ensure this is not repeated.  <\/p>  <p>  I can take some assurance that this is not a more systemic issue as the child welfare and protection services are subject to the independent inspection regime of the Health Information and Quality Authority.  Since 2013,  HIQA has carried out inspections of the child protection and welfare services in 11 out of 17 of Tusla's administrative areas, of which 7 were carried out in 2014.  The Midlands area has not yet been inspected.  These inspections are on the basis of standards designed to follow a child&rsquo;s journey within the child protection system to ensure that his or her safety and welfare is being protected.  <\/p>  <p>  Inspections consider the full range of Tusla's child protection services, including the service planning, review and monitoring processes with the aim of ensuring that systematic approaches are in place involving good leadership, inter-agency cooperation, skilled and experienced staff, and the effective management and deployment of resources with children at the centre.<\/p>  <p>  Inspection report findings to date show overall a good quality of social work service when cases are allocated.  The issues of concern was the length of time some children were waiting to be allocated a social worker due to staffing issues, and in a small number of areas, concerns were outlined regarding the monitoring of risk of children waiting for an allocated social worker. As HIQA goes about its valuable work, I anticipate they may find other aspects of child protection services which require improvement.  It is for that reason we have an independent inspectorate to identify issues and to apply an improving action plan on the area in question. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has also recently developed the first ever quality assurance programme for child protection services. This programme is identifying areas in need of improvement and is used to address resources and practice issues. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has agreed a  set of performance indicators with Tusla which are reported on monthly and quarterly and allow for a contemporary picture of how areas are managing the demands on their service.

The first step has been to collate all the affected referrals and determine how best to move them forward.

Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has advised that a review of the service, following the absence without authority of two children from the unit, was completed in 2012.  However, this report was not subject of final checks, including checks on confidentiality and fair procedures, that would allow its wider circulation.  Consequently, Tusla has indicated that this report could not be published and it has no plans to do so.  I can confirm that the conclusions were not favourable in respect of the culture, leadership and management of the service provided by the unit.  While the option of closure was considered following the report in 2012, it was decided to implement an action plan to address the operational and management deficiencies and to ensure that the lessons from the incident were learned. <\/p>  <p>  My predecessor, Minister Flanagan, received a copy of a report titled \"Gleann Alainn Special Care Unit:  Report of Deep Learning Process (Serious Incident Oct 2011)\".  The CEO of Tusla commented in a covering letter that those involved with the service accepted that practice at the time of the event fell short of the standards expected of staff and the unit and noted that the subsequent implementation of the action plan had, in the end, proved a valuable learning experience.  <\/p>  <p>  Since the implementation of the action plan, the number of significant events recorded at Gleann Alainn has reduced markedly.  Monitoring of the unit's progress noted that the staff and management of the unit had enthusiastically addressed ongoing IR issues and attended to a significant number of recommendations for the service provided by the unit.  Also, Gleann Alainn was inspected independently by the Health Information and Quality Authority a number of times, most recently in December 2014.  The report of this inspection, which is available on the HIQA website, noted that the centre was well managed with national oversight.  Staff practice in relation to child protection was good.  The inspectors noted that there had been no children absent without authority or missing from care in the previous 12 months.  This was attributed to the improved ethos and culture in the unit.   The HIQA inspections have provided good evidence, following the implementation of the action plan, that the children are receiving a safe and effective service in the Gleann Alainn special care unit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300046#WRF03600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Provision","counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300046#WRF03650"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[18885\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300046#WRF03700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will respond to correspondence (details supplied) and advise on the reason these children, who were referred by the public health nurse, did not receive B and A status, as expected.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":377,"content":"<p>The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community not-for-profit childcare services to enable them to provide childcare<b><\/b>at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  Parents qualify as disadvantaged or low income on the basis of means-tested entitlements. In the case of full day care, parents qualifying for the higher rate of subvention under the CCS programme can have up to &euro;95 (Band A) per week, per child, provided towards the cost of the childcare place. The parent pays the balance of the weekly cost of the childcare place. <\/p><p>Parents whose children are enrolled in a participating childcare service before or during a &lsquo;snap-shot&rsquo; week in October each year can apply for subvention support under the programme.  Eligibility is verified by submitting application details for checking against the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and Health Service Executive (HSE) records.<\/p><p>Eligibility for subvention support can only be confirmed on the verification of the relevant parental application for eligibility. However, participating CCS services have been advised that, if they wish to grant a subvention rate to parents before the verification process has been completed, they should request the parent to provide up-to-date proof of eligibility from the time the child commences in the service.  The eligibility criteria is set out on the DCYA website but T&uacute;sla\/PHN referrals are not included as this referral system is a specific arrangement based on significant circumstances for a child. <\/p><p>The purpose of T&uacute;sla\/PHN referrals (previously known as HSE referrals) is to secure a childcare place for a child deemed by a T&uacute;sla\/PHN Professional to be in significant need of a childcare place. To avoid any obstacles to accessing a childcare place (i.e. costs) the T&uacute;sla\/PHN professional makes a referral to a childcare service under the agreement that as the &lsquo;referring agent&rsquo; the balance of parental fees will be paid by the &lsquo;referrer&rsquo; and the parent is not charged any childcare fees. <\/p><p>The 'referring agent' is therefore applying for the Band A subvention on the basis that the balance of the childcare costs will be funded by them and will not be charged to the parent. As part of the CCS verification\/appeals process the &lsquo;referral letter&rsquo; is reviewed to ensure that it is clear that the parent is not being charged any child care fees. <\/p><p>T&uacute;sla\/PHN referrals must clearly name the child being &lsquo;referred&rsquo; to the service and that the remainder of the childcare fee, following Band A subvention, will be covered by the referring agent.  For the 2014\/15 year, a letter from the service provider stating that the parent is not being charged any childcare fee, is being accepted if the Tusla\/PHN referral does not clarify this.  <\/p><p>In relation to Bunratty Community Childcare Centre, referred to by the Deputy,  the initial CCS application indicated that this service had 5 children, referred by T&uacute;sla\/PHN, seeking specific support under the programme.<\/p><p>In the case of the information attached to the 5 T&uacute;sla\/PHN referrals, none had a confirmation either by the PHN or the service provider, that the parent would not be charged the balance of the parental fee should a Band A place be approved.  In addition, one of the letters from a PHN only provides information as to the status of the child&rsquo;s welfare and does not clarify the need for support, under this provision of the programme, for this child.  The applications were declined for Band A funding approval based on these assessments. <\/p><p>All of the 5 applications have been appealed by the service and further information submitted.  The service will be notified of any further information required to support a T&uacute;sla\/PHN referral.  It must be noted that it appears from the initial assessment of the additional information that the parents are paying childcare fees which would, therefore, result in a decline of these appeals.  <\/p><p>The other service referred to in the correspondence attached to the Deputy's question -  Jigsaw, Darndale \/ Belcamp Integrated Childcare Service - indicated that 23 child registrations in the service are T&uacute;sla (HSE) referrals.  These applications also had insufficient information attached to satisfy the T&uacute;sla\/HSE referral requirement before the verification process was completed.  The service, through the local City Childcare Committee, requested clarification of the information needed to progress their appeals and have since submitted documentation under the appeal process which will be examine in due course. <\/p><p>All of the appeals will be fully evaluated and the outcome will be communicated to the childcare providers in each case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300046#WRF03800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300046#WRF03900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Status","counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300046#WRF03850"},{"type":"question","counter":379,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[18709\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300046#WRF03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when an operation will be provided by the Ear Nose and Throat Department in the Midland Regional Hospital in Tullamore in County Offaly, in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Longford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":380,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Employees are also prohibited from having a financial or other beneficial interest in any company or organisation operating in a sector that the HPRA regulates.<\/p>  <p>  Any employee who previously worked in a regulated company is restricted from all activities relating to that company for a period of time of up to five years depending on their role in that company, seniority of their position, relationships with persons in the company or level of contact with persons in the company, and any other relevant factor. They are also prohibited from ever taking part in any activity relating to a medicinal product, medical device or cosmetic that they helped develop in any previous employment or relating to any competitor products for the same active substance or class of substances.<\/p>  <p>  HPRA policies and procedures govern the declaration of interests, when staff join, on an annual basis and at any time that interests may change (e.g. with respect to a household member). There is a structured evaluation of any declared interest and appropriate outcomes depending on the evaluation. Checking for any restrictions is an integral part of all procedures for assigning work.<\/p>  <p>  All pharmaceutical companies pay fees for their licence applications. The fees are set out in Regulations approved by the Minister for Health. No company may provide financial support to any employee. This is clearly stated in the Conflict of Interest Policy on the HPRA website.<\/p>  <p>  Roaccutane has been closely monitored at both national and European level since it was first authorised, with issues related to its safety highlighted and communicated to healthcare professionals as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA, together with its EU counterparts has worked with the pharmaceutical company to facilitate availability of appropriate product information for Roaccutane, which includes detailed and comprehensive advice regarding the risks associated with its use and recommendations to minimise the occurrence of these risks. The product information has been reviewed and updated since Roaccutane was first authorised for use in Ireland in 1983, as required. The HPRA has also communicated the outcome of regulatory reviews and updated recommendations regarding Roaccutane to healthcare professionals through its Drug Safety Newsletter on a number of occasions, all of which are accessible from the HPRA website  <\/p>  <p>  The product information for Roaccutane highlights the requirement that it should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of physicians with expertise in the use of systemic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and with a full understanding of the risks of therapy and the monitoring requirements associated with its use.<\/p>  <p>  The product information also specifies the circumstances where Roaccutane is contraindicated (i.e. when it should not be used).<\/p>  <p>  The requirements for specific monitoring of the patient to reduce the risk of adverse reactions and to facilitate their early detection and management are described in detail in the product information in relation to psychiatric disorders, severe skin reactions, allergic reactions, effects on liver enzymes, serum lipids and the pregnancy prevention programme. Monitoring in these circumstances is through on-going review of the patient by the prescribing doctor, as part of their clinical practice. <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA and the company have legal obligations to share reports of serious, suspected adverse reactions associated with use of Roaccutane within 15 days of first notification. These reports are in turn submitted to the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organisation to facilitate review in the context of global safety experience and to support early detection of new and emerging reporting trends. <\/p>  <p>  The relevant renewal requirements have changed over time. When Roaccutane was first licensed, companies were required to apply for renewal of their marketing authorisations every five years. Marketing authorisations became subject to one further renewal, following which authorisations remain valid for an unlimited period, unless one additional five-year renewal was considered necessary on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance (drug safety). Roaccutane was last renewed on 10 July 2009 with an unlimited marketing authorisation.<\/p>  <p>  Requirements for renewal application have changed over time. The current requirements are included in the European Commission&rsquo;s &lsquo;Guideline on the processing of renewals in the Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedure&rsquo; and the accompanying &lsquo;EU Application form for renewal of a marketing authorisation.&rsquo;<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA prohibits the acceptance of money as cash, cash vouchers or cash equivalents from any industry or sector regulated by the HPRA. Gifts may not be solicited, directly or indirectly. Only gifts of very modest value are acceptable in limited circumstances or where it is the custom in the country concerned to give such gifts and where to decline may cause offence.

The main focus of the resolution was the setting up of an ad hoc committee to elaborate a binding debt resolution mechanism. Following detailed consideration of the proposal and discussions with our EU partners and other UN members, Ireland, and our EU partners, were unable to support the Resolution.     Ireland fully subscribed to the EU&rsquo;s statement clarifying the important considerations which informed the negotiating approach on the Resolution, as follows:  <\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;The ad-hoc committee must be limited to the elaboration of a non-binding 'set of principles' which builds upon a market-based voluntary contractual approach to sovereign debt restructuring and aims at furthering its implementation and use. Neither the EU nor Member States will participate in discussions aiming at the establishment of a binding multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes.<\/p>  <p>  The ad-hoc committee should reflect the recent and ongoing work on sovereign debt restructuring undertaken in the IMF, subject to the previous considerations, and should take place in close coordination with and with technical support from the Fund.   Discussions should also make reference to the work in other fora on these issues, such as the Paris Club, which has a history of discussing sovereign debt restructuring issues.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  In the event, the Resolution continued to propose the elaboration of a new legal framework and, in these circumstances, Ireland, in common with EU partners, will not be participating in the work of the committee.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is actively engaged in ongoing global processes to address the issue of sovereign debt restructuring. Work being undertaken at other levels, including in the IMF and at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Addis Ababa in July, offer appropriate, established and constructive means for meaningful dialogue on the matter. We are playing our full role, in partnership with our EU colleagues, in working for the success of the Financing for Development Conference in Addis, which is central to the ongoing negotiations on a new framework for global development to follow on from the Millennium Development Goals.
