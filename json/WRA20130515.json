In particular, they are subject to\u00a0external global\u00a0factors such as fuel costs and currency fluctuations. The steady rise in fuel prices has impacted negatively on the shipping industry. In 2011 alone, oil prices rose sharply with bunker prices spiking by 40% over the course of the year. In 2012 oil prices continued to rise, remaining above $100 per barrel for the second year and\u00a0exacerbating already challenging conditions for shipping.\u00a0Currency fluctuations also had a negative\u00a0impact. In 2012 the euro depreciated against both the US dollar and UK pound by 7.6% and 6.5% respectively. <\/p><p>  In addition,\u00a0the shipping industry in EU Member States\u00a0face\u00a0the introduction of new lower sulphur limits in\u00a0marine fuel from\u00a0January 2015 within\u00a0designated Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs).\u00a0Although there is\u00a0no SECA in the seas around Ireland, shipping engaged in voyages to France and other European destinations beyond the Irish sea, will face an increase in the cost of fuel.<\/p><p>  In relation to the costs imposed on the shipping industry by port companies, as the Deputy will be aware port companies are required to operate in a commercial fashion and in competition with each other. This position is re-enforced in the recently published National Ports Policy. <\/p><p>  The Competition Authority\u00a0is currently in the process of carrying out a\u00a0study of the ports sector in Ireland, as part of which\u00a0it is\u00a0reviewing inter and intra-port competition. I expect that\u00a0the Competition Authority will publish the results of this market study in 2013.\u00a0I have committed that my Department\u00a0will deliver a reasoned response to any recommendations made to the Department within six months of publication. <\/p><p>  All shipping companies servicing routes to and from Ireland are independent commercial companies that are\u00a0market driven. Many companies have, over recent years, introduced greater efficiencies to reduce their overall operating costs in order to continue to provide services. Despite the difficulties that the industry faces, Ireland\u00a0offers a diverse range of maritime links to and from the State to facilitate trade and tourism providing vital income streams to the Irish economy.\u00a0Over 90% of Ireland&rsquo;s trade moves by sea and Ireland is also one of the best served countries in Europe for passenger ferry services with links that are frequent and competitive.\u00a0<\/p><p>  There are currently 22 shipping operators providing a mixture of daily to weekly scheduled shipping services from Ireland. This includes 4 companies providing year round scheduled passenger services between Ireland and the UK and France. The Irish Maritime Transport Economist published in April this year by the IMDO is a good source of further information on trade and shipping for those with an interest in this area.<\/p><p>  Subsidising\u00a0international shipping services\u00a0is contrary to EU State Aid and Competition Law, and the principles of free and fair trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500064#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Free Travel Scheme Administration","counter":24,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500064#WRB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[22993\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500064#WRB00500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the discussions, if any, his Department has had with the Department of Social Protection regarding a review of the operation of the free travel scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":26,"content":"<p>The question relates to the review of the operation of the Department of Social Protection's free travel scheme.

All of our main overseas markets have shown growth\u00a0in the first quarter\u00a0with overseas visits from Mainland Europe up\u00a013%, visits from Great Britain up\u00a01.4%, visits from North America up\u00a016.7%, while visits from the rest of the world grew\u00a0by 5.4%.<\/p><p>  The overall target\u00a0 for\u00a0the year of The Gathering was to increase the number of overseas visits by 325,000.  The figures for the first quarter suggest that we are well on target to achieve and even exceed this as the increase to date is over 25% of the total increase targeted.  The overall sentiment for travel to Ireland is good\u00a0\u00a0with\u00a0particularly encouraging signs for visit numbers from Mainland Europe and the USA, supported by\u00a0significant growth in transatlantic air access for the peak summer period.  Tourism Ireland will continue to roll-out a major consumer marketing campaign to promote Ireland\u00a0and &quot;The Gathering Ireland 2013&quot; in\u00a0all our key markets and ensure our targets\u00a0will be achieved. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500067#WRE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":110,"content":"<p>Question No. 41 answered with Question No. 28.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Issues","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500067#WRE01650"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[22866\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500067#WRE01700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the Employment Control Framework figures for each of the agencies under the aegis of his Department at the end of 2012;

However, I believe that the report would have more accurately reflected the Government&rsquo;s extensive assistance to emigrants had the Council sought the views of the Irish Abroad Unit of my Department during their research.  Today, our Diaspora engagement policy has two key strands, namely the Emigrant Support Programme (ESP) and the Global Irish Network.<\/p><p>  The Emigrant Support Programme provides direct assistance to Irish emigrants, both long-standing and new.  Since 2004, Irish groups ranging from those providing front line services to those most at need including the elderly, isolated, vulnerable and new arrivals to those working in the culture and heritage space have received grants of over &euro;100 million under the Programme. At present, we work with almost 200 Irish community organisations in over 20 countries and despite the economic situation, I ensured the ESP budget for 2013 - &euro;11.6 million - remained at the same level as in 2012. <\/p><p>  The programme provides extensive funding to organisations that act as first port of call for new emigrants, including the GAA, the London Irish Centre, the Irish Canadian Immigration Centre in Toronto and several similar groups in Australia. We also support a wide range of business and graduate networks around the world.<\/p><p>  Among the Irish based organisations who receive ESP funding is Crosscare Migrant Project which offers pre-departure services to Irish citizens considering emigration. Crosscare also provide training to mainstream service providers on emigration and returners&rsquo; issues and work in conjunction with Irish welfare organisations abroad (many also funded by ESP) and statutory and voluntary service providers in Ireland including the probation service, Salvation Army and Safe Home.<\/p><p>  Officials from my Department have been in contact with the National Youth Council of Ireland this week to discuss some of the findings and recommendations from their report with a view to seeing if there are areas the NYCI and the Department might be able to cooperate on in future. <\/p><p>The second strand of our diaspora engagement programme is our partnership with the Global Irish Network, a group of over 300 of the most influential Irish connected business figures drawn from almost 40 countries, which provide invaluable advice, facilitation and practical assistance to the Government and Irish companies.  The development of the Global Irish Network has transformed the strategic relationship between Ireland and its Diaspora and I look forward to working with them again at the 3rd Global Irish Economic Forum that will take place in Dublin Castle in October.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500073#WRL00900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consular Services Expenditure","counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500073#WRL00950"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[23167\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500073#WRL01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 48 of 2 May 2013, if he will provide an analysis, by type of allowance, of the &euro;8,709,948 allowances paid to headquarter staff working at diplomatic missions in 2012.","asker":"959","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[23168\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500073#WRL01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 48 of 2 May 2013, in respect of the &euro;8,709,948 allowances paid to headquarter staff working at diplomatic missions in 2012, if he will confirm the total of allowances paid against vouched receipts.","asker":"959","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 97 together.<\/p><p>Foreign Service Allowances are designed to offset the additional costs that arise for officers when they are temporarily posted abroad.

This message is reinforced when meeting with members of the Malian Government in international fora, including at the Donor Conference on Mali which is taking place in Brussels today.  The Council has also emphasised the importance of progress on the political track and the implementation of the transition roadmap which has been agreed by the Malian Government and Parliament.  Especially important will be the holding of free and fair elections in the coming months and implementation of a meaningful national dialogue and reconciliation process.  EU Foreign Ministers have also welcomed the announcement by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court of the opening of an investigation into the situation in Mali.  Ireland engages actively in discussions on Mali at the United Nations.  In this context, we have welcomed the report in February by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which outlined evidence of serious human rights violations by both the Malian military and by militant groups in the north of the country.  The report also highlighted issues which must be addressed in the response to the current crisis in Mali if lasting peace and stability is to be achieved, including, notably, the serious underlying and long-neglected ethnic tensions in the country.<\/p><p>  At the 22nd session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, in March 2013, the Council adopted by consensus a resolution on assistance to the Republic of Mali in the field of human rights.  The resolution was cosponsored by Ireland.  It established a mandate for an independent expert on the situation of human rights in Mali, with a view to assisting the Government of Mali in its efforts to promote and protect human rights, and to act upon the recommendations set forth in resolutions of the Human Rights Council.  The Council repeated its call for an immediate halt to all human rights violations and acts of violence and for strict respect of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.  It also called upon all forces and armed groups present within the territory to ensure that international human rights law and international humanitarian law are strictly respected.  On 22 January 2013, Mali was reviewed under the Universal Periodic Review mechanism of the Human Rights Council.  During this review, Ireland recommended that Mali adopt and implement measures to ensure that international human rights standards are observed by the Malian Armed Forces, in particular the absolute ban on torture and ill-treatment and to ensure that all reports of torture and other ill-treatment are investigated effectively with those responsible being brought to justice.  Ireland also recommended that Mali take all feasible measures to protect children from recruitment by state-allied and non-state armed groups, including contributing information, analysis and recommendations to the UN and other stakeholders to support and strengthen their efforts to ensure that international standards are upheld.<\/p><p>  Recognising the need for human rights training for the Malian army, Ireland is contributing six trainers and two HQ personnel to the EU Training Mission which is working to support strengthening and reform of the Malian army.

The attached table provides an analysis of changes in the amount of levies recouped from industry categories over each of the years 2010 to 2012.<\/p><p>There are number of exceptions to the 50\/50 funding arrangement including  covered credit institutions which fund 100% of the cost of their prudential regulation and 100% of the cost of the PCAR and PLAR reviews and Credit Unions whose levies are capped at 0.01% of their total assets as at 30 September in the previous year.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><\/th><th colspan=\"4\"><b><i>Net Annual Funding Requirements<\/i><\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><b>INDUSTRY CATEGORY<\/b><\/td><td><b>2012 nAFR &euro;000<\/b><\/td><td><b>2011 nAFR &euro;000<\/b><\/td><td><b>2010 nAFR &euro;000<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A<\/td><td>Credit Institutions<\/td><td>&euro;44,900<\/td><td>&euro;53,364<\/td><td>&euro;21,216<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>B<\/td><td>Insurance<\/td><td>&euro;12,013<\/td><td>&euro;9,741<\/td><td>&euro;7,609<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>C<\/td><td>Intermediaries<\/td><td>&euro;2,729<\/td><td>&euro;2,629<\/td><td>&euro;2,506<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D<\/td><td>Securities Firms<\/td><td>&euro;6,591<\/td><td>&euro;5,175<\/td><td>&euro;3,242<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>E<\/td><td>Collective Investment Schemes and Service Providers<\/td><td>&euro;5,538<\/td><td>&euro;4,883<\/td><td>&euro;4,078<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>F<\/td><td>Credit Unions<\/td><td>&euro;1,398<\/td><td>&euro;1,442<\/td><td>&euro;1,440<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>G<\/td><td>Moneylenders<\/td><td>&euro;300<\/td><td>&euro;352<\/td><td>&euro;309<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>H<\/td><td>Approved Professional Bodies<\/td><td>&euro;44<\/td><td>&euro;44<\/td><td>&euro;35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>I<\/td><td>Exchanges<\/td><td>&euro;206<\/td><td>&euro;196<\/td><td>&euro;150<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>J1<\/td><td>Bureaux de Change &amp;amp;                  Money Transmitters<\/td><td>&euro;79<\/td><td>&euro;155<\/td><td>&euro;136<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>K<\/td><td>E-money Providers<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>L<\/td><td>Default Assessment<\/td><td>n\/a<\/td><td>n\/a<\/td><td>n\/a<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>M1<\/td><td>Retail Credit Firms &amp;amp;                 Home Reversion Firms<\/td><td>&euro;107<\/td><td>&euro;146<\/td><td>&euro;236<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>N<\/td><td>Payment Institutions<\/td><td>&euro;985<\/td><td>&euro;837<\/td><td>&euro;684<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><b>&euro;74,890<\/b><\/td><td><b>&euro;78,964<\/b><\/td><td><b>&euro;41,641<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500075#WRN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":280,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[23120\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500075#WRN00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of monetary penalties imposed, including directions to refund or withhold moneys charged or paid, on each regulated body by the Financial Regulator in 2010, 2011 and 2012","asker":"1107","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":281,"content":"<p>A breakdown of the monetary penalties imposed as part of entering into settlement agreements with the Central Bank under Section 33AV of the Central Bank Act 1942 (as amended) is set out in the following table.<\/p><p>There have been no directions issued by the Central Bank to refund or withhold monies charged or paid during the period 2010-2012.

The Government's commitment to the Programme does not, and has not stopped us from seeking and agreeing changes to aspects of the programme. A series of burden reducing measures were negotiated by the Government and have been put in place since early 2011.  First we have achieved a reduction in interest on EFSF and EFSM funds and on bilateral loans.The interest rates on EU funding mechanisms (the EFSF and EFSM) were reduced in 2011 and are now provided at rates close to the cost of funding. The maturities of these loans were extended at the same time. The interest rate reductions for the EFSF and the EFSM have also been reflected in the rates charged on Ireland's bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark. It is estimated that the interest rate reductions on the EU funding mechanisms and the bilateral loans are worth of the order of &euro;9 billion over the initially envisaged 7 &frac12; year term of these loans.  The positive impact of these changes has been significant as demonstrated by the fact that the average interest rate charged on our programme borrowing at the outset of the programme in 2010 was 5.82 per cent, whereas by end-March 2013, the National Treasury Management Agency has estimated that the all-in fixed euro equivalent cost of loans received under the EU\/IMF programme was 3.32 per cent.<\/p><p><br \/>  Second we have achieved an extension of the maturities of the loans. At the Ecofin and Eurogroup meetings in Dublin in April, EU and Euro-area  Finance Ministers agreed in principle, to lengthen the maturities of the EFSF and EFSM loans to Ireland and Portugal by increasing the weighted average maturity of the loans by a further 7 years. The extension will smooth our debt redemption profile and lower our refinancing needs in the post-programme period, improving our long term debt sustainability. <\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore in February 2013 the Government successfully replaced the IBRC Promissory notes which had a weighted average life of c.7-8 years with Government Bonds with a weighted average life of c. 34-35 years at a lower funding cost for the State, resulting in significant annual interest savings.

This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.<\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.<\/p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.

I also intend to publish draft regulations that I plan to make when the Bill is enacted. In bringing forward these proposals, it is not my intention to unnecessarily intrude into how schools do their business. My policy objective is to ensure that every child is treated fairly and that the way in which schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent. As the Bill and the Regulations will be published in draft form, they will also be subject to a lot of detailed scrutiny before becoming law. I will be reflecting carefully on the views expressed in the consultation process to ensure they strike the right balance between school autonomy and fairness in our education system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500077#WRP01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Services Provision","counter":345,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500077#WRP01550"},{"type":"question","counter":346,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[23112\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500077#WRP01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the considerable concern amongst parents of children with down syndrome regarding access for their children to resource hours under the terms of the Special Education Circular 02\/05; if in particular he will address the issue whereby children with Down syndrome who have a mild learning disability currently have no access to resource hours; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":347,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[23126\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500077#WRP01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the supports that are available in mainstream schools for children with Down syndrome; the number of persons with the disorder that are attending mainstream schools in 2013, and the comparative number for 2010, 2011 and 2012 and the cost of special needs assistant support for the same years.","asker":"968","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":348,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[23127\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500077#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason children with Down syndrome removed from the disability category post 2005; and if he has any plans to reverse this decision.","asker":"968","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":349,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[23327\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500077#WRP01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if we will reclassify Down syndrome as a disability in all cases so as to ensure that all children with this condition are provided with resource teaching hours which was the pre-2005 position; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":350,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[23365\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500077#WRP02000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will revisit the lack of resource teaching hours for children with Down syndrome in national schools.","asker":"1017","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":351,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134, 136, 137, 150 and 151 together.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware of this Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including children with Down syndrome, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs. The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.<\/p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability\/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02\/05.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that the introduction of the GAM in 2005 did not change the position in relation to the allocation of supports for children with Down syndrome who had mild general learning difficulty. Prior to the GAM introduction, Circular 08\/02 set out that the level of additional support to be provided for children who present with a particular syndrome e.g. Down Syndrome, Syndrome, will be determined following consideration of psychological or other specialist reports which details the nature and degree of the child's special educational needs. The allocations made were differentiated on the basis of the extent of general learning difficulty of the child.<\/p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability. There is not presently a distinct disability category of Down syndrome for resource allocation purposes.

My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe\/profound general learning disability.  Where school based provision is not feasible, 10 hours per week home based provision may be grant aided to eligible pupils. Therefore the home based scheme is designed to support children who are not in a position to attend school, and it is generally the case that the Tuition is provided at the child's place of residence. In the vast majority of cases therefore, there will be 1 child in receipt of tuition with 1 tutor providing tuition.  However in a small number of cases where there are qualifying siblings, a combined allocation is made. As Home Tuition is intended to compensate for school based provision it is reasonable to reflect the school grouping principle and allocate to siblings accordingly. For example, in a school setting one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils with autism.

One of these placements was in a special classes for autism approved by NCSE. While this placement was identified in September 2011, it did not open until December 2011 as the school needed additional time to prepare itself. In the light of this, Home Tuition was further approved for the child to whom the Deputy has referred until the date that the new class physically opened on the basis that he was unable to access placement during this period. This approval was provided notwithstanding that the child had not been enrolled by then and could not have attended on 14th of October because of this fact.  Enrolment of the child in the school was a matter for the parents of the child and the school's Board of Management. The availability of the school's documented policies to the parent is a matter for the school and the parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500079#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pupil-Teacher Ratio","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500079#WRR00750"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[23325\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500079#WRR00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the concerns of boards of management and parents' associations of smaller fee-charging schools in relation to the increase in the pupil\/teacher ratio; if his attention has been drawn to the serious impact such increases will have on such schools, particularly schools under the patronage of Protestant Churches; his views on whether such schools provide a very important educational resource for many children in rural areas; the proposals, if any, he has to assist such schools remain viable; his views on whether those schools play an important role in the plurality and diversity in educational provision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":384,"content":"<p>The Government has protected frontline services in schools to the greatest extent possible in the recent budget and there will be no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools and in free second level schools for the 2013\/14 school year as a result of the recent budget. The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.  However, at a time of severely reduced resources, priorities have to be made. In an effort to ensure fairness in the education system, the PTR in fee charging second level schools will rise by two points to 23:1 in September 2013.<\/p><p>  However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately.

With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by my Department to the Secondary Education Committee (SEC), an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually.

The overarching theme of the Irish Presidency is the contribution of trade to growth, jobs and economic recovery; consequently I attach great importance to promoting the EU's external trade agenda.  Increasing trade is one of the few ways to bolster economic growth without the necessity of drawing on severely constrained public finances. The contribution of external demand to GDP is the EU's most important source of growth for the moment, as domestic demand components - both public and private - remain weak. In fact, the contribution of trade to GDP in 2012 (+0.9 percentage points) cut the depth of the recession in the EU by a factor of four, helping compensate for the downward pull of other economic variables. The contribution of external demand to economic growth is bound to increase in future, as 90% of global economic growth in the next 10-15 years is expected to be generated outside Europe, a third of it in China alone.  Trade policy is therefore an essential component of the EU's growth compact. More trade is also essential to job creation: About 30 million jobs in the EU depend on sales to the rest of the world, an increase of 10 million since 1995. On average, each additional &euro;1 billion of exports supports between 8,000 to 15,000 additional jobs across the EU.<\/p><p><br \/>  Negotiations underway or planned could boost EU GDP by more than 2% or &euro;250bn -equivalent to the size of the Austrian or Danish economy -- and support an increase of more than 2 million jobs related to trade across the EU.<\/p><p><br \/>  The trade negotiations currently underway are set out below.<\/p><p><b><i>EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  President Obama endorsed the launch of free trade talks with the EU in his State of the Union address on 9 February.

The specific recommendations contained in the South East Employment Action Plan, produced by Forfas, are being progressed by a Forum representing the agencies and key stakeholders in the region.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The unemployment rate in the region has remained stubbornly high and has been consistently above the national average for many years. I believe the problem is particularly pronounced in Waterford County and City. The number of unemployment blackspots in Waterford has remained constant in the period 1996-2006 whereas other urban areas such as Dublin and Cork have seen sharp decreases. It is clear that the solution to this problem requires focused action.<\/p><p><br \/>  A number of positive developments have followed on foot of this initiative including a number of significant jobs announcements for the South East e.g. the Eishtec Call Centre in Waterford city created 280 Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs; a further 65 Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs new jobs were created by Dawn Meats as a result of a 5 year &euro;300m contract with McDonald's restaurants; the two local Waterford City and County Enterprise Boards have created 59 new jobs; and Danone Baby Nutrition in Wexford announced an investment of &euro;20m in its manufacturing facility which will create around 45 new jobs at its plant.<\/p><p><br \/>  I met with the Forum on 28 March last in Waterford to hear about further progress made by agencies and stakeholders in the region, and to discuss how we can move forward on outstanding actions and other challenges.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Notwithstanding the success of this initiative, I consider that it is neither practicable nor effective to establish jobs task forces or specific jobs plans around the country as a general mechanism to address high unemployment.  I believe that to embark on such a course would involve diverting the various State Agencies from their on-going efforts to create jobs. A considerable administrative commitment is involved in servicing any additional committees and groups which may be set up and, given the constrained staff resources facing all public sector bodies at present, I am strongly of the opinion that establishing such additional groups, except in very exceptional circumstances, would not be in the best interests of using the State's resources effectively.<\/p><p><br \/>  Although the county has seen a number of company closures IDA Ireland continues to compete for high quality investments for Kerry.

Depending on the needs of the young individual the steps in the career plan might include personal assessment, job search assistance, skills training, work experience internships, but the objective in all cases will be to lead the young person to employment placement or further education or training. A particular focus of the pilot YGS will be to involve, and build links with, employers in the locality and the immediate hinterland in order to ensure that the guidance and training elements of the YGS are tailored to the needs of the local labour market and also to generate work placement\/experience opportunities for the YGS participants. <\/p><p>  The European Commission is currently evaluating the high number of proposals received for the Youth Guarantee funding call for proposals.

Rather, my intention is that the factors which lead to delays in the processing of cases are dealt with so that asylum seekers spend as little time as is necessary in that accommodation system.<\/p><p>  The direct provision system is not ideal but it is a system which facilitates the State providing a roof over the head of those seeking asylum or seeking other grounds to be allowed, on humanitarian grounds, to stay in the State. It allows the State to do it in a manner that facilitates resources being used economically in circumstances where the State is in financial difficulty.  There are no cheaper alternatives to the Direct Provision system. A key finding in the 2010 Value for Money Report on the Direct Provision system was that if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system.<\/p><p>  There are currently 4,698 persons accommodated in direct provision across 34 centres. I do accept that the length of time spent in direct provision and the complexity of the asylum process itself is an issue which needs to be addressed.  The accommodation system is inextricably linked to the surrounding asylum process. The revised Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I intend to re-publish, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.  <\/p><p>  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing, I am proposing to introduce new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.

The Act sets out the circumstances when temporary release may be provided and what matters must be taken into account.<\/p><p>The granting of temporary release is done by the officials in the Irish Prison Service Headquarters, on my behalf,  and as such individual prisons do not operate their own schemes of temporary release.  On 15 May 2013 there were 732 prisoners on temporary release or 14.2% of the total number of prisoners in the prison system.  Some 131 of these prisoners are participating in the community return programme and 28 are on temporary release from an open centre. In addition, 229 prisoners had been sentenced for failure to pay a court ordered fine and 95 prisoners were serving sentences of less than 6 months.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012-2015 and the recently published Joint Prison Service\/Probation Service Strategic Plan 2013-2015 includes commitments to ensure that all prisoners released early from custody are placed on appropriate structured programme of temporary release.  The Community Return Scheme is a recently introduced initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work such as painting, gardening or graffiti removal in a supervised group setting.  The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups.<\/p><p>The scheme, which was introduced on a pilot basis in October 2011, is applicable to suitably assessed prisoners who are serving sentences of more than one and less than eight years. Those participating are granted renewable temporary release having served at, or after, the 50% stage of their sentence with a condition of their release to undertake supervised community service.<\/p><p>In excess of 510 prisoners have taken part in the initiative since it commenced in October 2011 with 319 prisoners now having completed the programme.  Today there are 131 prisoners on community return, which is the highest total at one time since the Programme commenced.  Compliance has been almost 90%; and the 10% who did not comply with the terms and conditions of their release on community return were re-committed to prison immediately to serve the rest of their sentence in custody.  The Community Return Programme has been a really positive development, and as well as allowing prisoners to complete their sentence by way of performing a service to the community, has significantly helped these prisoners to successfully resettle in their communities.<\/p><p>The Community Return Programme forms part of a wider structured release programme aimed at improving outcomes for prisoners.  In addition to Community Return, the Unlocking Community Alternatives Scheme, UCAS, has been set up in Cork. The primary aim of this Scheme is to reduce the current recidivism rates of short term prisoners by arranging for additional support structures and provide for a more structured form of temporary release. This is a pilot scheme and will be reviewed in 12 months in order to assess whether it has had a positive impact on re-offending rates.<\/p><p>The Joint Prison Service\/Probation service Strategy will also see a focus on working with short term sentenced prisoners - helping with issues such as housing, medical care, substance abuse, training needs, etc. The aim is to increase support to prisoners - prior to their release from prison, upon their release and then for a period after their release in order to help break the cycle of re-offending. Discussions have been ongoing, in this regard, with a number of external agencies and it is hoped that further initiatives will commence in the near future.<\/p><p>A breakdown of those on temporary release, those on  the Community Return Programme and those who have completed the Community Return Programme is set out in the following table.<\/p><p><pli4><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Institution<\/th><th>Temporary release (excluding Community Return)<\/th><th>Temporary Release to Community Return.<\/th><th>No completed Community Return <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Mountjoy (M)<\/td><td><div>107<\/div><\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><div>40<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mountjoy (F)<\/td><td><div>71<\/div><\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><td><div>11<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Training Unit<\/td><td><div>13<\/div><\/td><td><div>11<\/div><\/td><td><div>37<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>St Patrick's<\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><td><div>11<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cloverhill<\/td><td><div>17<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wheatfield<\/td><td><div>82<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><td><div>17<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Midlands<\/td><td><div>41<\/div><\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><div>32<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Portlaoise<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td><div>119<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>21<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick (M)<\/td><td><div>47<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><td><div>26<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick (F)<\/td><td><div>24<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Castlerea<\/td><td><div>48<\/div><\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Loughan House<\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><div>28<\/div><\/td><td><div>32<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey<\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><td><div>33<\/div><\/td><td><div>88<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td><div>601<\/div><\/td><td><div>131<\/div><\/td><td><div>319<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><\/PLI4><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500087#WRZ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Accommodation","counter":575,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500087#WRAA00075"},{"type":"question","counter":576,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[23342\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500087#WRAA00100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide the latest information on the implementation of the cell share risk assessment tool proposed as part of the Irish Prison Service's three year strategic plan; the location at which it is currently operational; if he will provide provide a copy of the policy document on cell share risk assessment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":577,"content":"<p>I am to advise the Deputy that policy on the placement of prisoners in shared accommodation is being developed as part of a comprehensive Standard Operational Policy on Committal Procedures in the Irish Prison Service.

It will be recalled that, in response to budgetary realities, it was decided to re-focus the Scheme, with greater consideration been given to those contributing most to achieving the aims of the Scheme, which are: ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of a viable rural society; maintaining the countryside; maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which, in particular, take account of environmental protection requirements. <\/p><p>  Given the restrictions faced by those farming in recognised Disadvantaged Areas and mindful of the aims of the Scheme, as outlined, it will be readily appreciated that appropriate stocking levels are crucial. In this regard, balance must be struck between the need to ensure that at least the minimum is done to ensure the land is adequately utilised and grazed, while at the same time being sufficiently aware of the natural constraints. In this regard, it is clear that the minimum stocking levels currently set under the Scheme achieve this twin objective.  Thus, the terms of the 2013 Scheme remain as previously announced.

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme.  There has been no change to the Government&rsquo;s over-arching commitment to this goal.  This Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population.<\/p><p>  Having examined the progress made in the universal GP care plan, it became clear to me that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement.  Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness.  The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public.  This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions.  As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition.  While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments.  In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population.<\/p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the delay in the initial step of the roll-out of the universal GP service.  In doing so, it has considered the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay.  No decision has been taken by the Cabinet Committee or by Government on changing the first step of the plan to extend GP care without fees to persons with chronic illnesses.  Instead, it has been agreed that we should prepare and set out a number of alternative options with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  Minister Reilly and I expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future.  As part of this work, consideration will be given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation this universal health service.<\/p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent Budgets.  The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500087#WRFF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Application Numbers","counter":733,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500087#WRFF01550"},{"type":"question","counter":734,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[23331\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500087#WRFF01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will publish in tabular form for the years 2008 to 2012 inclusive the number of new applications for medical cards that were received; the number of these applications that were refused and of these refusals the number granted on appeal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":735,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available.

In response, I have introduced a specific Scheme, the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme, designed to assist towards the transport costs of imported fodder and maintenance of stocking levels. The situation has prompted action by the wider industry and farm bodies, which is very welcome. In keeping the situation under constant review, I decided, given the ongoing shortages in some areas, to extend the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme to 24 May and to double the funding available to &euro;2 million. Simultaneously, my Department&rsquo;s Emergency Welfare System continues to respond to individual emergency situations. <\/p><p>  Mindful of ongoing difficulties, I also decided that a formal request should again be made to the EU Commission seeking agreement to pay an advance from 16 October of the 2013 Single Farm Payment which, being the first day of the new EU financial year is the earliest potential payment date and almost two months ahead of the standard timeline. It will be recalled that my successful approach to Commissioner Ciolos for agreement to making an advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment was prompted by the very wet weather experienced throughout last summer.<\/p><p>  With specific regard to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the 2013 Scheme, as already announced, is focussed on the protection of the smaller and most disadvantaged. It must also be borne in mind that the minimum stocking density requirement is equivalent to one ewe per eligible forage hectare and can not in any way be regarded as onerous. It will be recalled that, in response to budgetary realities, it was decided to re-focus the Scheme, with greater consideration been given to those contributing most to achieving the aims of the Scheme, which are: ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of a viable rural society; maintaining the countryside; maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which, in particular, take account of environmental protection requirements. <\/p><p>  Given the restrictions faced by those farming in recognised Disadvantaged Areas and mindful of the aims of the Scheme, as outlined, it will be readily appreciated that appropriate stocking levels are crucial. In this regard, balance must be struck between the need to ensure that at least the minimum is done to ensure the land is adequately utilised and grazed, while at the same time being sufficiently aware of the natural constraints. In this regard, it is clear that the minimum stocking levels currently set under the Scheme achieve this twin objective.  Thus, the terms of the 2013 Scheme remain as previously announced.  Farmers with genuine fodder-related stocking difficulties may avail of the force majeure provisions of the Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500089#WRBB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Programme Funding","counter":848,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500090#WRCC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":849,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[23293\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051500090#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the schemes that were proposed under the Natura 2000 element of the rural development programme 2007-2013; the reason that there has only been a spend of &euro;89,717,139 out of an allocation of &euro;528,582998 to date; if he intends to spend the balance of the money provided under this heading and if not, if the money has been transferred to other programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":850,"content":"<p>Under the initial Financial Plan for the Rural Development Programme an indicative amount of &euro;528m was allocated to Natura 2000.

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme.  There has been no change to the Government&rsquo;s over-arching commitment to this goal.  This Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population.<\/p><p>  Having examined the progress made in the universal GP care plan, it became clear to me that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement.  Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness.  The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public.  This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions.  As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition.  While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments.  In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population.<\/p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the delay in the initial step of the roll-out of the universal GP service.  In doing so, it has considered the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay.  No decision has been taken by the Cabinet Committee or by Government on changing the first step of the plan to extend GP care without fees to persons with chronic illnesses.  Instead, it has been agreed that we should prepare and set out a number of alternative options with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  Minister Reilly and I expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future.
