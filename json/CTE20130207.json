That is an important part of our work, and perhaps in replying to individuals and groups it should be explained to them that the first step in the process of the work we undertake is to obtain the information from the relevant Department or agency in answer to the query raised and, arising from that, it may be judged by the committee that a more in-depth response is required or that an investigation of one kind or another is necessary.<\/p><p>  No. 4B.3 is correspondence dated 30 January 2013 from Mr. Ray Mitchell, parliamentary and regulatory affairs division, Health Service Executive, re providing information previously requested regarding right of place, to be noted and a copy forwarded to Mr. Thomas W.

It is in the members' correspondence.  Mr. Michael Brosnan was presenting the case on behalf of the farmer concerned.  I draw the members' attention to the fact that while this issue dates back to 1977, it has been ongoing since 1977.  It is my understanding that there was a court case in the middle of this period which Mr. Farrell won, and that some of the information on which he was relying was not made available until he requested it under the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act.  Further correspondence on this was received yesterday and in spite of the fact that the Department would say it has already stated that it does not intend to engage in any further futile correspondence on this matter, and that that remains the position, I believe it is necessary for the Department to provide the information Mr. Farrell has requested because it has a bearing on his case.  There is an exposure to the State in regard to what might be due to Mr. Farrell and, therefore, in my opinion the Committee of Public Accounts should request the documentation necessary for us to make a judgment call on this matter.  Arising from the correspondence, I will ask the Department to furnish the information to us so that, with the other correspondence we received, we can make a call as to whether further action is necessary, but I believe the Department must give us this information and that there is a case to be answered by the Department.  It is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and it is correspondence dated 19 December 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700003#F00650","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1360231200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>At this stage it has been going on for well over-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700003#F00700","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1360231200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Thirty years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700003#F00800","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1360231200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Why has it been ongoing?

In 2011, the Department incurred expenditure totalling &euro;2.3 billion.  Of this, &euro;2.1 billion was spent on transport, with the remainder going to cover tourism, sport and the Department's administration expenses.  The functions in relation to tourism and sport transferred to Vote 32 from the former Vote for the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport during 2011.  The majority of the Department's expenditure is ultimately through other State agencies.  In 2011, the Department paid &euro;1.3 billion to the National Roads Authority.  A further &euro;503 million was paid from the Vote to the National Transport Authority.  The National Transport Authority's 2011 accounts were considered by the committee two weeks ago.  They show that the authority paid &euro;395 million to the CIE group of companies for capital investment and payments under public service obligation agreements.  In 2011, &euro;146 million was also paid directly from the Vote to CIE in regard to capital expenditure, mainly aimed at improving railway safety.<\/p><p>  The financial statements of the National Roads Authority are also before the committee today.  The primary function of the authority is to secure a safe and efficient network of national, regional and local roads.  In practice, this function is largely discharged through the relevant local authorities.  In 2011, the authority had income totalling just under &euro;1.38 billion, and it incurred expenditure of approximately &euro;1.39 billion.<\/p><p>  The authority provides funding to local authorities for road construction and maintenance.  Funding for major multi-annual projects is agreed with the local authorities each year based on amounts committed and expected costs.  Smaller construction and improvement and maintenance projects are funded on the basis of proposals from local authorities, together with the results of an examination of the condition of the road network, which is conducted annually.  In 2011, the authority incurred total expenditure of &euro;865 million in regard to road construction and improvement.  Some &euro;806 million, or 93% of this, was paid to local authorities.  Expenditure levels in 2011 decreased by approximately a quarter by comparison with 2010.  Expenditure of &euro;161 million was incurred in respect of road maintenance and management, with &euro;139 million, or 86%, being paid to local authorities.<\/p><p>  The Government decided in June 2012 to manage the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency to form a new entity incorporating the functions of both bodies and taking on some new functions.  The Accounting Officer and chief executive will be able to provide an update in that regard.  From previous meetings, members will recall that chapter 6 focuses on the Exchequer's financial commitments arising from public-private partnerships, PPPs.<\/p><p>  In the case of the National Roads Authority, expenditure up to the end of 2011 on ten PPP projects totalled just under &euro;1.3 billion.  The outstanding commitment arising from those projects was almost &euro;1.7 billion.<\/p> <p>The chapter draws attention to a dispute in 2011 between the National Roads Authority and the PPP, public private partnerships, company concerning the N6-Galway-Ballinalsoe project.  A mediated settlement was agreed in August 2011.  Under this settlement, the authority agreed to pay an additional &euro;16 million to the company and the company undertook to complete specified works.  Most of the additional payment was made in 2011.<\/p><p> One of the key features of PPP projects is the allocation of project risks between the public and private sector partners, including sharing of risks where appropriate.  The chapter highlights the outturn on risk-sharing regarding certain road projects.  In the case of two PPPs, the M3-Clonee-Kells motorway and the Limerick tunnel, the NRA is now making payments to the PPP company because actual traffic levels on these routes are below a threshold set out in the contract.  When the projects were approved, it was expected such payments would not arise because traffic levels were expected to be significantly higher.  In 2011, the NRA paid &euro;5.2 million under these arrangements.  The chapter demonstrates that even if actual traffic volumes grow by an average of 2.5% each year, the NRA will make traffic&ndash;guarantee payments until 2025 in the case of Clonee-Kells and for the whole duration of the Limerick tunnel contract which runs until 2041.<\/p><p> Risk-sharing has also resulted in payments being received by the NRA.  In 2011, it received just over &euro;1 million from revenue-sharing provisions in other tolled PPP projects and just under &euro;1 million from insurance risk-sharing provisions.  As outturns are different from those projected when the PPP deals closed, post-implementation reviews of the value for money actually achieved are important in identifying lessons that can be learned for future projects.  Such reviews are particularly necessary where there are additional project costs relative to what was originally projected.  Three further road PPP projects have been in development for several years and the Galway city bypass was added as part of the July 2012 PPP-based stimulus package.  The status of these projects in July 2012 is set out in the chapter.<\/p><p> The other chapter for consideration at today&rsquo;s meeting, chapter 26, reviews the systems in place for the collection for motor tax and for the monitoring and deterring of motor tax evasion.  An average of &euro;1 billion a year is collected in motor tax.  Several bodies play a role in the collection, administration and enforcement of motor tax.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the maintenance of the register of vehicles which facilitates the collection of motor tax.  It also has responsibility for the collection of online motor tax.  The other main players are the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government which has responsibility for motor tax policy, local authorities which collect motor tax locally and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which enforces the requirement to display a motor tax disc.<\/p><p> I understand the committee will examine the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Garda at later dates regarding the issues which arose in the chapter.  Accordingly, I will confine my remarks this morning to the matters more closely related to the role of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p><p> There are no formal systems in place to measure and track the extent of motor tax evasion.  It is, therefore, difficult, to assess the overall effectiveness of the collection system.  Analysis of traffic on the M50 on four days during 2010 and 2011 indicated an evasion rate of 5%.  If that applied nationally, it would equate to under collection of motor tax of around &euro;50 million a year.  It is vital the Department&rsquo;s register of vehicles is kept up to date and that non-payment of due tax is identified promptly and followed up.  Analysis of the register identified some 2.6 million registered vehicles which were not taxed.  Of these, 170,000 have never been taxed and 800,000 have not been taxed in over ten years.  It is likely that many of these vehicles are no longer in use and, therefore, their categorisation on the system as current registered vehicles potentially distorts that analysis of evasion rates and impedes follow-up of vehicles that are untaxed.  The chapter recommends there should be a more robust system for dealing with situations where vehicles are declared by owners to be off-the-road and thus exempt from tax.  The Departments have indicated that there will be a legislative response to that recommendation.<\/p><p> If fixed-charge penalties for non-display of a valid disc are to be an effective deterrent, they must result in motor tax arrears being paid and payment kept up to date.  However, one in five vehicle owners issued with fixed-charge notices between 2008 and 2011 had not paid motor tax by April 2012.  Of those who had paid, at least one in four had declared the vehicle to be off-the-road for the period during which they were fined.  Furthermore, around 40% of those detected not displaying a current tax disc had not paid the fixed-charge penalty.  This indicates that the system for the imposition of fixed-charge notices is not changing behaviour in a significant number of cases.  The integrity of the off-the-road declaration system is also undermined.  For this reason, the chapter recommends the need for the review of the effectiveness of fixed-charge notices as a deterrent to the non-payment of motor tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700004#G01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360232400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I am not certain we have got the balance right in terms of the level of detail the committee wants.  I propose to discuss with the committee&rsquo;s secretariat over the coming months some of the models from other Departments which the committee has found to be good practice.<\/p><p>  In 2011, the Department's overall expenditure totalled &euro;2.346 billion of which &euro;1.496 billion was capital expenditure and &euro;850 million was current expenditure.  The overall expenditure outturn was a saving of just under &euro;16 million of the funding allocated by the D&aacute;il.  Of this amount, &euro;8.7 million was carried over to provide for capital expenditure in 2012.<\/p><p>  On the capital side, the main areas of expenditure were road improvement and maintenance, public transport investment, maritime safety, the coast guard, tourism product development and sports.  In 2011 over &euro;1 billion was spent on road improvement and maintenance.  Regional and local roads expenditure accounted for &euro;343 million while &euro;674 million was invested in national roads.  The following projects went to construction stage: the N3-Belturbet bypass; the N4-Downes grade separation; the N5-Longford bypass; the N25-Cork southern ring road interchange upgrades; and the N52-Carrickbridge-Dalystown.<\/p><p>  In 2011, the Department spent &euro;377 million on public transport investment.  This enabled the continued implementation of the third railway safety programme and the completion of the Luas red line extension to Citywest.  Construction and installation works continued on the Dublin city centre rail re-signalling project and works on the road crossing automation programme for 2011 focused on the Galway and Mayo lines.  The Leap Card integrated ticketing project was introduced in the greater Dublin area, GDA, and good progress was made on the roll-out of real-time passenger information signs on the services of Dublin Bus in the GDA.<\/p><p>  A total of &euro;16 million was spent on investments in the maritime area.  The main area of expenditure was on Coast Guard buildings and equipment.  This included the second milestone payment for the helicopter search and rescue services contract of &euro;6.7 million.  This milestone was payable on written confirmation from Sikorsky Ltd of the readiness for delivery to Ireland of a new build S92 helicopter.  In addition, &euro;4.3 million was spent on remedial works at regional harbours.<\/p><p>  In 2011, the total allocation to F&aacute;ilte Ireland to support capital investment in tourism was &euro;25 million.  Notable projects approved for funding included Garnish Island, Killarney House, a further development of the Mayo Greenway and the upgrading of the Book of Kells visitor centre in Trinity College, Dublin.<\/p><p>  A total of &euro;34 million was spent on capital investment in sport and recreation services in 2011.  The main elements were &euro;23 million on grants for sporting bodies and &euro;10 million on provision and renovation of swimming pools.<\/p><p>  In 2011, the Department's current Vote expenditure totalled &euro;850 million.  Current expenditure on roads was &euro;254 million.  This was accounted for by maintenance of regional and local roads of &euro;110 million, maintenance on the national road network of &euro;49 million, PPP operational payments of &euro;81 million and NRA administration costs of &euro;14 milion.<\/p> <p> Expenditure of &euro;278 million on public transport services was mainly accounted for by funding of &euro;265 million provided in State subvention, through the NTA, to the CIE companies.  The rural transport programme accounted for &euro;11 million and the green schools programme accounted for &euro;2 million.<\/p><p> Current expenditure under the tourism heading amounted to &euro;126 million, which comprised of grants of &euro;63 million to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, &euro;17 million to Tourism Ireland and over &euro;46 million to the tourism agencies for the overseas promotion of Ireland as a tourism destination.  Current expenditure on sport amounted to &euro;48 million, which was almost totally the grant to the Irish Sports Council.<\/p><p> The other major areas of current expenditure were maritime safety and the Irish Coast Guard which accounted for &euro;39 million, the road safety agencies which spent &euro;16 million and regional airports which also incurred expenditure of &euro;16 million.<\/p><p> As I have given detailed advanced briefing to the committee on the two chapters from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report about which Mr. McCarthy has spoken, I will not add anything further at this point.  Obviously, I am happy to deal with the various questions that will arise over the course of the morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700005#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360233000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Can we publish Mr. O'Mahony's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700006#J00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360233000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700006#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1360233000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Barry for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700006#J00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360233000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for the invitation to appear before the committee today to discuss the National Roads Authority's 2011 accounts and Chapter 6 of the 2011 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts.<\/p><p>  The year 2011 represented a transition year from completion of the major inter-urban route network, which was achieved in 2010, to focusing on managing and maintaining the road asset already in place and improving safety and removing bottlenecks.  While network improvements will continue and are much needed, the mix of improvements in coming years will see an increasing proportion of single carriageways and an increased focus on the upgrading of the national secondary road network.<\/p><p>  The Government's Infrastructure Investment Priorities 2010-2016 plan acknowledged that the road network should be maintained to a sufficient standard to ensure that the value of the original capital investment does not depreciate prematurely over the coming years.  The Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016 capital spending programme stated \"amongst the main priorities over the medium term will be ensuring adequate maintenance of the national road network in order to protect the value of previous investments and target the improvement of specific road segments where there is a clear economic justification\".<\/p><p>  The replacement cost of the national road network is in the order of &euro;30 billion and on the basis of a 20 to 30 year average life cycle, it would deteriorate to the extent of &euro;1 billion to &euro;1.5 billion per year in the absence of this investment.  With this focus and mindful of the limited funding levels planned for 2012 to 2016, inclusive, the authority's priorities were reviewed in 2011 as follows.<\/p><p>  Priority 1 is asset management, network rehabilitation and network operations.  The first priority beyond existing liabilities is to maintain the asset value of the network and ensure its reliability and functionality.  This is critical to ensure that the network performs efficiently and safely and continues to support national economic competitiveness.<\/p><p>  Priority 2 is national secondary roads improvements, bottleneck improvement projects, safety projects and traffic management projects.  Most of the national secondary network routes are deficient in terms of capacity, safety and alignment.  The authority will seek to implement improvements as funding permits.<\/p><p>  Priority 3 is major improvement projects.  The investment in the national road network in recent years has vastly improved many of the busiest and most strategic national roads.  However, there remain many improvement schemes highly desirable from the perspective of economic benefit, safety, regional growth, competitiveness and quality of life, and these will be advanced as funding permits.  These priorities were reflected in the authority's work programme for 2011, and, indeed, since.<\/p><p>  There are two particularly significant developments since 2011 that should be highlighted.  One is that the planned merger of the NRA with the Railway Procurement Agency is being actively advanced and may well come to fruition this year.  The other is that the Government announced a PPP stimulus programme in 2012 which includes three major roads schemes: the N17-N18 Gort to Tuam, the N25 New Ross bypass, and the N11 Gorey to Enniscorthy.<\/p><p>  We have, as requested, submitted a briefing paper, and will of course be happy to answer the committee's questions.  If the committee has any questions that we cannot answer today, we will, as always, follow up with a written response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700006#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1360233000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Can we publish Mr. Barry's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700006#J00600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360233000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700006#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1360233000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Before calling on the first speaker, Deputy Connaughton, I will respond to correspondence that the committee received on Dublin Waterworld and the incorrect charging of VAT on the issue of the National Aquatic Centre.  I want to put on public record this statement in respect of the issue of the VAT charges on the lease of the National Aquatic Centre which was the subject of a committee report in May 2012 following on from two hearings of the committee in November 2011 and February 2012.<\/p><p>  While the report of the committee to which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has replied would normally mark the end of our consideration of an issue, the fact is that we have received ongoing and extensive correspondence which raises further concerns about how this issue arose and why this issue was pursued through the courts by the State.<\/p><p>  The conclusion we drew in our report was that this VAT case should never have been taken or prolonged by either Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, or its successor, the National Sports Campus Development Authority, NSCDA.  Every piece of evidence that has been supplied to us since our hearings and the publication of our reports lends more weight to that conclusion.<\/p><p>  I will not reopen this issue in detail today.  I understand and accept that VAT law is complex but the line taken before the committee by the Department and by CSID, later NSCDA, that it relied on Revenue guidelines to try to levy the VAT charges on the lease of the National Aquatic Centre, does not stack up.  This is because the evidence recently supplied to the committee shows that the professional adviser of CSID, PricewaterhouseCoopers, was not relying on Revenue guidelines but had correctly interpreted the VAT legislation in late 2002 and realised that VAT could not be charged.  However, as the 2001 Revenue guidelines had not been updated to take account of the 2002 legislative developments, these guidelines were a better fit.  The VAT charge was raised and the case was pursued based on a loose interpretation of these guidelines.<\/p><p>  The correspondence clearly shows that withholding the valuation report from Dublin Waterworld and its professional advisers was a central plank to this strategy.  The fact is that the policy adopted by CSID and NSCDA was fundamentally flawed and those who had an obligation to protect the interest of the taxpayer failed in their duty.<\/p><p>  It is regrettable that the committee was not provided with the 2002 PwC advice from the outset.  This was less than acceptable and a material omission by the Department and the NSCDA in their appearance before the committee.  I note that this information only came to light following the intervention of the Information Commissioner.<\/p><p>  The entire episode is not the way a State company or statutory authority should do its business.  Moreover, as these agents of the State hired and paid with taxpayers' money a multi-million euro team of professional advisers, the correct and common-sense advice from both the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Office of the Attorney General was provided for free but was ignored.<\/p><p>  The committee met yesterday to consider the issue.  While we will not at this time reopen the issue, we will, first, write to the Office of the Attorney General asking that the latest list of documentation be considered by it in the review of the judgments as contained in Recommendation 6 of the committee's report and whether there is an onus on a State company, statutory authority or body to show its full hand, specifically advice that might call into question its position to the Revenue Commissioners, its overseeing Department, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Office of the Attorney General, when, as in this case, these parties become directly involved and have a direct interest in protecting the position of the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  Second, we will write to the Revenue Commissioners in view of the fact that in 2002, CSID and its professional adviser were fully aware that Revenue guidelines were not a perfect fit with the VAT regulations so that this latest correspondence and this statement can be incorporated in the formal review that arises from the acceptance of Recommendation 8 of the committee.  We will also ask the Revenue Commissioners, in light of the doubts that existed about its guidelines in late 2002, whether it would expect a State company or statutory authority to put Revenue on notice of the need to review and update those guidelines and whether Revenue would have expected them to have elaborated on the apparent flaws in its approach to this matter in its correspondence with Revenue.  It is most likely that such notice would have led to a review of the guidelines and, had this happened, so much time, money and resources would not have been wasted on this flawed and needless dispute.  We would also ask the Revenue Commissioners to confirm whether they would have provided the confirmations to CSID and its advisers that it had been made aware of the professional advice held by CSID in late 2002.<\/p><p>  Third, we will write to the Department of Finance asking if it had been made aware of the 2002 advice from PwC to CSID and, if so, would it have advised CSID on the matter in which it did.<\/p> <p>That deals with correspondence and the issues arising from the report.

The construction of any large civil engineering works - the route in question was an enormous project - carry a high degree of risk that actual costs will be ahead of estimated costs.  This is particularly so for construction companies when they are tendering competitively because competitive pressures may constrain their ability to provide fully for contingent risks.  The M6 Galway-Ballinasloe contract transferred most but not all of the construction risks to the PPP consortium.  It transpired that the construction proved exceptionally difficult and the costs were far in excess of the PPP estimates.  Some of the additional costs, to a total of &euro;16 million, were determined to be to our account under the provisions of the contract but most of the cost overruns were paid by the PPP company and its contractors.  In 2010, for example, N6 (Construction) Limited, which was constructing the route, published accounts which recorded cumulative losses of &euro;50 million on its part when it would, of course, have expected a profit.  This was a huge project which gave rise to a variety of difficulties.<\/p><p>  The cost for most of these difficulties stayed with the PPP company but we were responsible for certain matters under the terms of the contract.  There was, for example, extensive flooding in Galway in 2009.  Members may recall that Galway city was virtually cut off from its hinterland, other than for very limited access.  We arranged with the PPP company for sections of the road to be opened earlier to provide access to Galway by land transport.  The cost of this was additional to the contract and we paid extra for it.  There was a dispute with the PPP company as to how much should have been paid, which is why it was included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700007#K01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1360233600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>What was the cost of that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700007#K01200","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360233600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>The payment for it was included in the &euro;16 million.

The committee will recall that by the mid-2000s, PPP tenderers and their funders were beginning to become more risk averse with regard to traffic forecasts than they had been previously.  When we in Ireland were developing the earlier PPP contracts, the companies were willing to assume the entire traffic risk on tolled roads.  By the mid-2000s, that was no longer the case.  When it came to contracting the M3 Clonee to Kells and the Limerick tunnel schemes - both large and complex schemes - tenderers and their funders were unwilling to bid on the basis of them carrying the full traffic risk.  Both PPPs were tendered on the basis that the NRA would take some of the traffic risk by guaranteeing minimum traffic volumes.<\/p><p>  The PPP tenderers did their own traffic forecasts and, in both competitions, all the bidders forecast traffic volumes and revenue well above the NRA guarantee levels.  The circumstances and the fact that we were entering this arrangement was reviewed by the committee in the mid-2000s.  The PPP companies carry risk and cost of traffic being below their forecasts subject to a floor guarantee from the NRA.  The mechanism has worked quite well from a public interest point of view.  While I cannot reveal the individual consortia's precise commercially sensitive information, I can advise the committee that for 2012 the shortfall in revenue based on the PPP consortia forecasts at the time of the tenders was carried roughly two thirds by them and one third by the State.  As a way of sharing the risk, it is working reasonably well.  Of course, we would much prefer that we did not have to pay that money but given the choice was to carry the entire risk or put a risk sharing mechanism in place, as we succeeded in doing, we were better off with the risk sharing mechanism.<\/p><p>  We are, like so many other businesses and enterprises in the country, dependent on the economic situation to improve our own finances as well as everybody else's.  When the economy starts growing, the burden of the traffic guarantees will begin to ease and the payments from the revenue sharing schemes will begin to grow a little, but for as long as the current economic circumstances continue, we will, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has highlighted, continue to make traffic guarantee payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700008#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1360234200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>The payments for those two schemes will continue no matter what.

How much money has the Department spent on it and when does it expect to see movement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700009#M02300","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360234800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I think it may have been &euro;14 million.

The report states that the level of evasion is not being recorded properly.

It is our work that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is on.  Now that we have electronic monitoring of who travels on the M50, we are in a position to carry out this kind of survey.  We can get the registration numbers of cars which are on the road and check those against the numbers in the national vehicle and driver file to establish whether they are taxed.  Our suspicion was that the evasion rate would prove to be about 5%, based on the experience in countries which have had the system we currently have.  Under the current system, it is open to a person to attend a local Garda station and make a declaration to the effect that his or her car has been off the road for a particular period of time.  A garda must witness that declaration but, of course, has no way to verify it.  It is an obvious gap in the system and there are a great many people who exploit it.  We carried out the surveys and they showed that there is an evasion rate of approximately 5%.<\/p> <p>In the UK when they changed from a system under which one could make this type of declaration to a continuous licensing system under which the car must be continuously taxed the evasion rate dropped to below 0.7% or 0.8%.  We expect that the same would happen here.  The Government has agreed to close this loophole and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is preparing the legislation because the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is responsible for motor tax legislation.  I understand that will come before the Oireachtas in the next couple of months and will change the system so that one must make the declaration in advance.

The NTA forgoes a substantial amount of income through the free travel scheme and, as such, has a relationship with the Department of Social Protection in terms of funding in that regard.  That is the situation in respect of current funding.<\/p><p>  On capital funding, the State makes significant investments in the network, particularly the railway.  Maintenance of the rail network requires substantial ongoing capital expenditure to ensure safety and enable service improvements.  The rationale for the State investment is to enable provision of the PSO services.  While the PSO subvention compensates for the operating costs, the capital provision meets the capital cost directly.  In so far as buses are funded by the State through the NTA, there are now legal agreements in place which provide that if any of the services are subsequently taken over by other operators, the NTA can repurchase those buses for a nominal sum.  I think the amount is &euro;1.  This ensures their continued use for the PSO service.   <\/p><p>  In normal circumstances, where CIE is operating smoothly and is not experiencing financial difficulties - which was the case until the recession hit in 2008 - our interaction with it would be satisfying ourselves that from an accounting and management point of view, it is okay.  We would regularly review its compliance with the code of governance and undertake spot-checks and monitoring of capital expenditure and so on.  As I said earlier, the NTA closely monitors its performance on contracts.  However, the situation, financially, over the past couple of years has not been okay.  From 2009 onwards, CIE suffered a succession of knocks, with almost everything with which it dealt going in the wrong direction, including the substantial fall in passenger fare income owing to the deepening recession, the cut in PSO subvention owing to the Government's need to make substantial savings, the significant increase in fuel prices, the abolition of the tax rebate scheme on excise paid on diesel, which previously benefited the company substantially, and the introduction of the carbon tax, which resulted in the company losing a significant amount of money.  The company's response to these hits was to engage in a range of cost cutting measures, including voluntary redundancies, reductions in premium pay and so on.  While a process has been ongoing, the company has continued to lose money.  <\/p><p>  Everything came to a head at the beginning of 2012, when the company \"suddenly\" - I use the word \"suddenly\" because this was a failure of systems in the company, which we have subsequently had to address - discovered that it was going to breach its borrowing limits and would not have funding to meet its commitments, which would have been extremely serious and required the Minister and Department to engage extensively over a long period.  The purpose of this engagement with the company, which has been ongoing for the past nine or ten months, is to ensure that the hole that had emerged could be plugged, that measures would be put in place to enable the company to trade its way out of its difficulties and get back to financial stability and to ensure that financial and other systems in the company change to ensure this type of problem does not recur.  Substantial changes in the company have been made.<\/p> <p>The Government gave a further &euro;36 million to the NTA for PSO subventions.  The NTA, in engaging with companies, was able to establish that the losses being made by them meant that the &euro;36 million in additional PSO payments could be paid without there being any question of a breach of EU regulations.  Companies are allowed to make a small profit on PSO routes, but subventions can only be used to subsidise losses and to ensure a normal rate of return.<\/p><p> The companies involved changed their financial systems and new people and systems have been introduced.  Most significantly in terms of the relationship between the Department and CIE, given that this issue had arisen and with the financial reporting arrangements not fit for purpose, new arrangements were put in place.  The Department has been assisted in this by NewERA, a unit of the National Treasury Management Agency.  The Department engaged Deloitte to examine the companies and cash management arrangements, as well as processes for a recovery plan, treasury and debt risk management procedures, and make an assessment for a reporting framework.  It made a number of recommendations, all of which have been implemented.  We agreed a memorandum of understanding between the Department, CIE and NewERA and now receive weekly updates on CIE's cash position, with representatives of NewERA assisting the Department and providing technical support.<\/p><p> There is a turnaround plan in place which includes the various issues being negotiated through the Labour Court.  There are also issues of budgets, cash flow, the process for disposing of non-core assets and so on.  Apart from ensuring this will put the company back on the route to viability, as well as ensuring it will not again run into unforeseen crises, it will also enable it to engage with banks, as it is now doing.  New credit facilities are being opened.  When the overdraft limits were breached last year, the banks indicated that they would not allow any more breaches or extend the limits, but the company is now engaging with them, with the expectation positive that it will be able to return to normal funding patterns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700013#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360237800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>It is extraordinary that a company would suddenly discover that it had hit its borrowing limit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700014#R00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360237800,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Yes and I would not attempt to defend it.

On the M3, which is being developed and is substantially being paid for by direct payments from the taxpayer - perhaps I should have said this earlier when questions were being asked about the guarantee payments - the primary payments on the M3 are fixed payments.  We made fixed payments during construction and are making fixed operational payments.

My specific question relates to complaints that were made recently on radio about the decision to close Derrynane House in County Kerry, which is the ancestral home of the O'Connells, this summer because of upgrade works.  It was alleged in the radio programme I heard that most of the work which needs to be done is internal work, rather than external work.  Would it not be possible in such a case to do that kind of work outside the summer season?  If a great deal of external work were involved, I appreciate that it may have to be done in the spring or summer.  Given that this is the year of The Gathering, is there anything the Department can do to ensure Derrynane House will be open for the summer season?  It is an important tourist venue in a part of Ireland that is one of this country's most important tourism centres.  If similar works are needed on any other projects, can the Department issue a direction to ensure it will be possible to keep our important tourist venues open to the greatest extent at those times of the year when the greatest number of visitors will be around?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013020700019#W02300","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360240800,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I can give the Deputy good news.

I ask Mr. O'Mahony to check the position, ascertain the precise figure and provide it to me within the next week.<\/p><p>  I return to an issue relating to railway carriages which I raised some weeks ago with Mr. Murphy from the National Transport Authority.  Deputy O'Donnell raised it again today.  Irrespective of whether the number of carriages involved was 21 or ten, in an action that is typical of CIE, the company stuck its head in the sand on the Friday following the committee's meeting with the National Transport Authority and attempted to ignore the content of Mr. Murphy's contribution to the meeting.  Mr. Murphy stated clearly that there were 21 carriages involved, yet a spokesperson for CIE did the rounds of the news programmes to respond to some commentary from this committee and deny some of the facts presented to us by Mr. Murphy.  The spokesperson then attempted to present a story that the carriages in question were being towed around at the end of a train and that they were being used and did not have to be stored.<\/p> <p>Nothing was further from the truth.  That comment annoyed me because it meant denial on the part of the company.  Therefore, I am pleased that you have come before us this morning and have not attempted to deny the facts as presented and have tried to explain the use of the carriages in a constructive way and the possibility that nine of them may have been needed to be used anyway.  I commend you on that.  If the culture within CIE is as demonstrated, I am not surprised it finds itself in difficulty with its accounts, particularly if it ignores the facts presented to us by the National Transport Authority.<\/p><p> With regard to the report we asked for, we asked the NTA to give us all of the facts and figures behind this issue and to liaise with the Department or whoever had those historically, as it is new in the business.  I ask the Department to liaise with Mr. Murphy, likewise, to ensure we get a comprehensive response to the issues raised at this meeting and to the questions that have been raised this morning.   One of the points with which I would take issue with the Department is that during the period when these carriages were being ordered, the National Roads Authority was constructing at speed motorways all over the country, thereby encouraging people to travel by car and other means.  This seems not to have been factored into the consultant's report which supported the business plan for the purchase of the carriages.  Therefore, the plan was flawed from day one.<\/p><p> To move on to the board, can Mr. O'Mahony tell us the salaries of the main players within CIE?

NNI represents 16 national and 25 local and regional newspapers and has canvassed the views and experiences of editors and journalists who have used the Freedom of Information, FOI, Acts to investigate matters that are in the public interest and about which the public have a right to know.  We do so on the basis as set out in international human rights treaties.  We situate our arguments in the context of international standards on FOI, drafted under the auspices of Article 19 in London and endorsed by the UN special rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression and the Organization of American States, OAS, special rapporteur on freedom of expression.<\/p><p>  To summaries our views, I would like to draw attention to the following provisions of some of the nine principles for FOI.  Principle 1 is maximum disclosure.  This principle includes the provision that public bodies include executive, legislative and judicial branches of the state, as well as public corporations and publicly-funded bodies.  NNI welcomes the inclusion of additional public bodies indicated under head 1 and the Schedule but we strongly urge the committee to consider extending the range of bodies included in the Act further to commercial semi-State bodies, as indicated in our submission.  My colleagues will elaborate on this.  Members may have read the piece in the latest edition of <i>The Sunday Times<\/i> written by Mark Tighe, who is on my right, which focused on Irish Water and the need to include it in the Act.  In addition, we urge that consideration also be given to bringing quasi-judicial entities, such as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, under the Act.<\/p><p>  Principle 2 is obligation to publish.  This principle includes the provisions that public bodies should proactively publish and disseminate information, as well as responding to requests.  The volume of information published proactively should increase over time, despite resource limitations.  NNI argues regarding heads 8, 9, 14 and 34 that public bodies should be encouraged to publish and disseminate information proactively, rather than waiting for FOI requests.  We argue in our submission that by proactively publishing information ahead of FOI requests, both the public and public bodies themselves will benefit greatly.  For the public, a great deal of information will thus be made available routinely and save the time and expense of making FOI requests in many cases, while for the public bodies concerned, it will save the time and use of resources needed to process FOI requests, especially as sometimes a considerable number of them may seek the same or related information.<\/p><p>  Principle 3 is the promotion of open government.  This principle includes the following provisions: public officials should be trained; incentives should be provided; annual reports documenting progress should be published; and public bodies should promote better maintenance of records.  NNI makes the case for the training and retraining of staff dealing with FOI requests.  Under head 15, training will be essential for new bodies being brought under the Act.  For bodies currently under the Act, training in the changes proposed to be brought in will be required as well as refresher training in not only the letter of the law but also the spirit of openness and the presumption in favour of openness the law espouses.<\/p><p>  On the issue of incentives as referred to under this principle, journalists have reported many delays and failures to meet the four-week period stipulated in the Act and have suggested that there should be incentives to meet the prescribed deadlines.  It has been brought to our attention also that, in practice, a number of bodies do not make accessible on their websites up-to-date section 15 and 16 manuals.  For example, the HSE provides no such reference booklet, while the Department of Finance has not updated its section 15 and 16 documents since 2004.  A date should be set for the provision and updating of section 15 and 16 manuals in accordance with the new Bill, when enacted.<\/p><p>  Regarding the manner in which records are supplied, journalists report that copies of electronic databases are often provided in PDF format which, in turn, can lead to mistakes in the analysis of the record, as the record must be restored to electronic format for proper interpretation.  There is no valid reason in many cases that a database, or part thereof, could not be copied and provided to a requester in electronic format as allowed for under the legislation.  This would simplify the process for the granting body and cut down on printing costs. <\/p><p>  Principle 4 is limited scope of exceptions.  This principle includes the provision that exceptions to the right to information should be clear, narrow and subject to strict &quot;harm&quot; and &quot;public interest&quot; tests.  NNI welcomes the removal of measures that were added to the range of exceptions and exemptions in 2003 but believes that the exemption for parliamentary briefings-draft parliamentary question, PQ, replies under head 24 should be removed.  This would not adversely impact on accountability of Ministers to the D&aacute;il and there is a significant public interest in this material and the manner in which it has been provided to the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>  Journalists also report that time and time again, while requests are being partially approved, many documents within those requests are often withheld under exemptions allowed in the Act.  For example, in one instance a schedule of documents came back, along with a pile of redacted documents, and all that remained intact was the finalised press statement.  Some examples will be given later.  Providing exemptions that are &quot;clear, narrow and subject to strict 'harm' and 'public interest' tests&quot;, as per the international principles, should help to address this pressing problem.<\/p><p>  We urge in this regard that further consideration be given to the extremely wide range of exemptions envisaged in respect of some of the new bodies coming under the Act, such as the NTMA and NAMA, as set out in the Schedule.  We have instanced some of these in our submission, such as records relating to whether developers are complying with their business plans, disciplinary matters and levels of remuneration within NAMA, and the rate of return on individual developments sold by the agency - all of which are a matter of growing public interest.<\/p><p>  Principle 5 is the process to facilitate access and it includes the provision that requests for information should be processed rapidly and fairly.  We have referred in our submission to constant delays experienced by journalists - often, they say, with a &quot;like it or lump it; appeal it if you like&quot; attitude on the part of officials.  However, in reality, appealing is a lengthy and costly process and journalists, who are working within time constraints on stories, are often forced to abandon such requests because of the red tape involved.  This culture of resistance to releasing records experienced by journalists needs to be addressed through training and so forth.  We have mentioned the possibility of providing incentives to officials to meet the deadlines, rather than the extended period from four to eight weeks provided as an exception in the Act becoming the norm.  We have also suggested a requirement or policy to publish online or otherwise make provision for general public access, after or within a reasonable period, to FOI records previously released in response to individual requests.  This would be in keeping with the spirit of the Act and make for a good management system for records.<\/p><p>  Principle 6 is costs.  This principle includes the provision that individuals should not be deterred from making requests for information by excessive costs.<\/p> <p>With regard to fees under head 47, the NNI takes the view that the up-front &euro;15 fee should be removed and that review and appeal fees, if charged, should be refunded in instances where the request for information has eventually been released having been proven to be in the public interest.<\/p><p> It is of concern that journalists report the onerous fees structure actively used by State agencies and Departments is a deterrent.  Given the pressures on news organisations, often an editorial call is made not to proceed in the absence of any guarantee one will obtain information.  The international principles, while not ruling out fees, note that experience in a number of countries suggests access costs are not an effective means of offsetting the costs of a freedom of information regime.  They go on to say however, that search and retrieval fees should be waived or significantly reduced for requests for personal information or for requests in the public interest, which should be presumed where the purpose of the request is connected with publication.<\/p><p> The biggest problem with fees is inconsistency.  Journalists have detailed their experience on this and other aspects of fees and I will give a few examples.  Journalists have stated there is absolutely no consistency and one Department will reply for free while another will charge hundreds of euro.  A journalist made a simple freedom of information request for which the Department of Justice and Equality attempted to charge &euro;5,116.83.  Naturally this stops the flow of information dead in its tracks.  The standard rate is &euro;20.95 per hour for search and retrieval fees.  The agency or Department in question estimates the number of hours work involved in a request and then issues a bill, of which one must pay 50% up-front without even knowing whether any documents exist.  At one stage a particular journalist was able to get every complaint issued against taxi drivers in Dublin over a 12 month period for &euro;15, but now only figures on how many complaints are made with a sample of ten is provided.  How is the journalist to know these are not the ten least controversial incidents?  A story by an Irish journalist in Ireland was published based on a freedom of information request to the UK Department of Health.  This was done at no cost and with minimum of fuss.  One well-worded e-mail was sent and a month later the journalist had the information sought.<\/p><p> It is also of concern that if a freedom of information request is rejected the cost of any appeal falls upon the applicant regardless of the outcome.  If I make a freedom of information request which is rejected and then successfully I appeal I am liable for the cost of the appeal even if the public body was wrong to force me to appeal in the first place.<\/p><p> While it may be argued that &euro;15 is not an overly burdensome fee, in truth, its presence has certainly acted as a barrier to journalists submitting requests.  What is more controversial is when additional search and retrieval fees are demanded for a request to be processed.  In recent months bills of several hundred euro have been handed to us to finalise requests, and in some cases bills of several thousand euro have been received.<\/p><p> The NNI welcomes the proposed changes to the existing freedom of information regime but urges the committee to give some thought to the concerns and difficulties we have expressed.  I am joined by three very senior journalists who are very familiar with the Act and work with it.  They are very familiar with the issues they confront in making freedom of information requests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020700004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Cullen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360230600,"counter":493,"content":"<p>This is this is not my area of expertise but I have an interest in it and in ensuring Irish society has an open system of government, so I agree with the points made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020700005#D00200","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1360230600,"counter":494,"content":"<p>A mobile telephone is on which is interfering with the sound system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020700005#D00300","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1360230600,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Cullen agree we have had a secretive system of government and progress has been made and that what is intended is further progress?  It is often difficult for an institution to change its culture, and one of the big challenges for the Civil Service, but also for us as a society, is to change this mindset.  I know from making inquiries to Departments that when we ask questions to elicit information it is seen as a distraction from the daily work of Civil Servants rather than is being seen as part of their work.  When we have a shift in culture we will achieve the pro-active maximum publishing of material.<\/p><p>  Deputies often clash with Departments when we ask parliamentary questions because a freedom of information request made at the same time elicits more information than we do.  Perhaps the reverse is also true, where a Deputy gets a better answer to a parliamentary question then is received through a freedom of information request.  I do not know why this is.  Perhaps the freedom of information officer does not speak to the person who writes the parliamentary questions.<\/p><p>  Mr. Cullen mentioned two organisations, the NTMA and NAMA, one of which is not covered by the freedom of information legislation.  He also mentioned that according to the legislation establishing Irish Water, it will not be covered by the freedom of information regime.  Perhaps an amendment can be made.  I know of a few other organisations not covered at present.  Does Mr. Cullen believe other organisations which are not covered at present and which are not intended to be covered should be covered to allow for the model he strives for and for which I strive for also?<\/p><p>  I was interested in the point made that material is not given in electronic form in this day and age.  This is a different problem.  People still have not come to grips with the fact that one can press a button and send material and cut out the delay.  This is not only with regard to freedom of information material.  People requesting their files from the Department of Social Protection have the same problem.  Those appealing social welfare decisions must wait until the physical file is transferred from the Department to the appeals office, but in this day and age most of the material is online.  This is more a comment than a question.<\/p><p>  The witnesses before the committee include journalists who are used to making freedom of information requests, and we have seen the articles they have managed to produce based on information which was hidden from view.  I presume in most cases a freedom of information request is made after having applied to a Department for information in the first instance, and when a blockage is reached a freedom of information request is made.  This comes back to the earlier point that if Departments were proactive they would answer questions honestly and up-front, particularly now they know one can pursue a freedom of information request, which adds to their burden and that of the journalists and the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020700005#D00400","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360230600,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I will make a quick comment after which Ms McDonald will respond.

We welcome the Bill as an attempt to bring us back to where we should be in the international rankings.  The spirit of openness and transparency needs to be led from the Government.

The Freedom of Information Act was originally described as landmark legislation in terms of Ireland paving the way for open government.  The barriers for us as working journalists are well rehearsed if not fully understood by members of the public and, possibly, Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I believe these could be circumvented significantly if not entirely if there was a genuine commitment to transparency and, as described by Mr. Cullen, a proactive approach to open government, including e-Government, as mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.<\/p><p>  The type of barriers we face include upfront fees, including search and retrieval fees, fees in respect of appeals, which act as a deterrent, and a failure of decision making within the prescribed timeframes.  In my experience and that of my colleagues there is a flagrant disregard of the deadlines prescribed in the Act.  Also, there is inadequate training for officials dealing with freedom of information requests and inconsistencies within and across Departments in terms of interpretation of the Act, which leads to huge anomalies, not least in fees.  There is under-resourcing at every level up to and including the Office of the Information Commissioner.  One of my colleagues is currently awaiting a reply from that office in relation to a freedom of information request he lodged in June 2009.<\/p><p>  In my view, taken on their own these types of barriers are a deterrent.  On a cumulative basis, they have a paralysing effect.  If it is the intention of Government that these barriers would act as a deterrent, I can confirm that they are succeeding.  As journalists we must take realistic decisions and weigh up the use of the Freedom of Information Act on a cost benefit analysis basis in terms of the time and money spent.  In my view, the Act has been filleted and contorted to such an extent that it has been in many cases rendered impotent, which is regrettable.  We therefore welcome many of the reforms.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to the culture within Departments.  We have not yet emerged from that culture of secrecy.  It remains the case that the initial instinct on the part of official Ireland is to say nothing at all.  One of my colleagues in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i> describes this as the culture of deter, resist and refuse.  To that I would add, &quot;If all else fails, redact&quot;.  I will provide some specific examples.  One of my colleagues at the <i>Sunday Independent, <\/i>Daniel McDonnell, sought to obtain documents relating to the Government decision to financially assist or bail out CIE to the tune of &euro;36 million.  We in the <i>Sunday Independent <\/i>and elsewhere felt that the documents and memos relating to that decision were matters of huge public interest.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport took a different view.  After extensive liaison all that was released was a significant amount of redacted documents and drafts of a press statement.  CIE is a State owned company.  It operates a near monopoly and has just received a major bailout to plug its deficit.  This type of issue is of huge public interest.<\/p><p>  This leads me on to the issue of public bodies.  We do not yet know what additional public bodies will come under this Act.  There is huge power vested in the Minister to decide that.  We believe there are major weaknesses in respect of the exclusion, for example, of commercial semi-State bodies such as CIE.  Although the inclusion of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the vocational education committees is welcome, it boggles the mind how CIE, from a security perspective or otherwise, is higher up on the list than the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or Central Bank.  There is huge significant public interest in that issue.<\/p><p>  We also believe there are major weaknesses, currently and possibly into the future, in respect of bodies such as the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  I will give an example of what we cannot get access to in respect of NAMA.  Records relating to developers working with NAMA are excluded.  We do not know if developer A is complying with his or her business plan or if developer B is being investigated for not fully disclosing his or her assets.  We have to wait for actions to come before the courts to get information.  In relation to actions before the courts in America, we log on to a website and can get all the required information.  There is a major deficit in this area.  We do not know about disciplinary matters within NAMA, which information is pertinent in respect of court action taken against a named individual in the courts over security concerns about information emanating from NAMA.  We do not know about the remuneration or salary levels of NTMA staff.<\/p><p>  Given the events of last night, I can think of no greater issue facing current and future generations than the operations of NAMA, the Department of Finance and the NTMA.  These are manifestly in the public interest.  While we accept and acknowledge that there should be exceptions, there has been and is abuse of the cry of emergency and of commercial sensitivity in blocking access to information that we as citizens, taxpayers and members of the public already own.  I cannot stress this enough.  The right to freedom of information is, like any other right, not a right if not effective and accessible.  My concern in relation to the reforms, although much desired and welcomed, is that if the spirit of the law is not matched by practical implementation on the ground then it is an ineffective right.<\/p><p>  On culture, as working journalists we often believe the media are being punished for daring to ask questions.  The relationship between the media and the body politic can often be uncomfortable, if not hostile, but we should not be punished for seeking access to information that, as Mark Tighe of <i>The Sunday Times<\/i> will back up, is widely available in other countries.  We believe there is a unique opportunity, in terms of Ireland's Presidency of the European Council and the eyes of the world being upon it, for Ireland to show leadership, not alone in the area of freedom of information but also of open government and e-Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020700006#E00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Dearbhail McDonald"},{"type":"speech","time":1360231200,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses for attending this morning's meeting.  I also thank them for the remarks made earlier about the former Minister, Eithne Fitzgerald, in the context of the introduction of ground-breaking freedom of information legislation.  We often concentrate on the negativity of freedom of information requests, but this can lead to positive change in terms of record keeping and efficiencies in the public service to ensure not only that information is easily accessible when a freedom of information request is made but also that it is easily accessible for the body politic when it needs to review the record.  It is hoped that the spirit of the Act will be upheld.  I hope also that it will impact in the area of responses to parliamentary questions.  Members are also often frustrated by the \"only answer exactly what one is asked\" type attitude.  For this reason many Deputies, including myself, often table a number of parliamentary questions around the same issue.<\/p><p>  I have a couple of questions for the witnesses.  What is their vision in terms of incentivisation to meet deadlines in relation to freedom of information requests?  I would welcome if they could put some meat on that vision.  A user group system was previously operated in respect of freedom of information requests.  Have the witnesses participated in it or would they consider it a positive move to put a structure around the user group through which a real method of engagement would be available?<\/p><p>  We heard submissions yesterday on the format and PDFs, which ensures easy access to information.  I acknowledge the point that the exemptions must be clarified.  I welcome that the NTMA and NAMA are to come within the scope of this legislation.  We will need to wait and see how this goes and to expand on it later, if necessary.  The issue of appeal fees is causing huge frustration.  There is a need to reduce appeal fees and not only in respect of freedom of information requests.  For example, members of the public are often frustrated when they take up a matter with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, carry the fees, win the appeal and yet are at a loss financially.  I believe that all non-commercial semi-State companies should be included, including Irish Water, EirGrid and other companies which have a monopoly.  All State companies with a monopoly should come within the scope of the freedom of information legislation.<\/p> <p>As for commercial semi-States, I agree with the witnesses to a point but not to the extent that it would disadvantage them when operating in a commercial market.  One must be very careful in this regard.  While it should be so in spirit, it should not be to such an extent that one would give their competitors a competitive advantage.  Perhaps it could be designed in such a way that everyone in the market would have the same level of openness to freedom of information requests as the semi-State commercial entity.  However, one must be very careful to not disadvantage such entities, because they are of significant importance to the State.  I will leave it at that and might come back after the witnesses have dealt with these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020700006#E00200","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360231800,"counter":500,"content":"<p>On the issue of incentivising and perhaps achieving a faster turnaround for freedom of information requests, there are a couple of practical ways this could be done.  For example, on the issue of delays, if a freedom of information request is not processed within the legislative time limit, perhaps the information then should be made available automatically to the requestor.  This would provide a real incentive to the decision-makers to process it.  In addition, as the National Newspapers of Ireland, NNI, submission noted, making available a lot of this information as a matter of course would preclude the need for freedom of information requests in the first place.  It would be going to the spirit of more open governance that routine basic information should be provided as a matter of course.  On the issue of fees and incentivising the correct decision-making in this regard, appeal fees should be refunded if it is found that the material sought was found to have been in the public interest because, at present, there is no incentive for a decision-maker to get the decision right.  One can keep redacting and refusing information and ultimately appealing it but no matter how many times this is done, there is no incentive on the decision-maker to get that right.  In addition, training will be absolutely crucial in changing this cultural shift and incentivising freedom of information officers to make decisions that genuinely are in the public interest.<\/p><p>  This cultural issue and such training will be crucial because as journalists, we come up against barriers in a very practical way on a daily basis.  A big issue with the 2003 amendment to the Act is that not only was it an attempt to shut down the operation of large aspects of the freedom of information legislation, but it also led to this culture of redaction and rejection of information.  I will give a couple of practical examples.  On the issue of delays, for example, I made a freedom of information request to the HSE regarding the treatment of separated children seeking asylum.  These were particularly vulnerable children who were in unregulated hostels, were disappearing and about the welfare of whom there were major concerns.  That freedom of information request took three and a half years to be processed by the HSE.  The information was only released after the Government had actually changed the practice and shut down such hostels.  Consequently, one gets the sense that in many cases, the information was being delayed until they had political cover for the decision they had made.  Similarly on excessive fees, as Ms Dearbhail McDonald mentioned, there is a huge disparity, on a day-to-day basis, in the fees being quoted for the same types of documents.  I refer, for example, to briefing material prepared for Ministers or Secretaries General.  Sometimes it is the basic &euro;15 fee while at other times, it is hundreds of euro.  One gets the feeling a lot of the time that such excessive fees are being quoted to dissuade people from seeking information.<\/p><p>  In addition, another cultural approach to the decision-making is the blanket refusal or sometimes cynical use of part of the legislation to reject records, such as the use of deliberative processes or commercial sensitivity.  I have to hand a document which was released on foot of a freedom of information request relating to briefing material for the Minister for Finance in respect of the 2009 budget.  The budget in question involved taking between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;2 billion out of public spending and, consequently, these were issues that are relevant to every man, woman and child in the State.  A seven-page document was released to me that set out the spending options put before the Minister.  However, as members can see, this is a seven-page document in which every single page has been blacked out and only minimal information regarding headings has been retained.  Such a cynical approach to releasing information really undermines the spirit of the Act.  Moreover, this example related to a budget that had been announced, to Estimates that had been published and for which the Finance Bill had been enacted.  In real terms, there was no reason to reject the release of the information but yet all this information was denied on the grounds of deliberative processes.  Such blanket use of deliberative processes is a real issue because matters are under permanent consideration in the eyes of decision-makers.  Consequently, this often undermines the practical application of the Act and is where going back to training for staff is crucial in terms of fulfilling the spirit of the Act and ensuring we maximise the potential of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020700007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carl O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360231800,"counter":501,"content":"<p>May I address the point on how to incentivise information officers to respond in a timely fashion?  We must have greater oversight from the Office of the Information Commissioner, that is, Ms Emily O'Reilly's office.  There is a global right to information ranking in which Ireland is ranked just 44th out of 92 countries that were assessed by Access Info Europe and the Centre for Law and Democracy.  One of the reasons for this is because the Office of the Information Commissioner, OIC, has very few oversight powers.  We recently did a story on how the OIC has stated it now has 86 staff, which is down from 102 in 2009.  However, the Information Commissioner has three hats.  She must deal with standards in public office and is the Ombudsman.  In this context, she has a lot more responsibilities as so many more bodies have come under the remit of the Ombudsman in recent years.  Consequently, that office is being asked to do more with fewer resources and freedom of information has fallen down its list of priorities.  Latest statistics show that only 19.5% of appeals to the Information Commissioner were finished and completed within the four-month period set down by statute.  The statue provides that the Information Commissioner must deal with appeals within four months, where practicable.  While there is an \"out\" there for the Information Commissioner, one must concede the office does not have the resources to go knocking on doors to ask the reason the body concerned has not responded within this timeframe.<\/p><p>  News and records like this are perishable products or pieces of information.  If someone is working on policy and the Bill is published and passed but one only gets the briefing documents or the lobbying submissions two or three years later, it is academic.  While it might be good for a history book, it lacks news value.  One reason Ireland scored so poorly is the exemptions mentioned by Mr. Carl O'Brien on the grounds of deliberative process and commercial sensitivity.  In addition, there is an exemption whereby documents prepared for the Cabinet are completely exempt.  There is no public interest clause to the effect that such a document should be released in the case of there being an overriding public interest.  If one goes back to the bank guarantee in September 2008, we sought access to all briefing documents and memos of the notorious meetings between the Government, the bankers, the Central Bank and so on.  It was only on appeal to the Information Commissioner, approximately five or six months after we started the freedom of information process, that the Department suddenly discovered there were two brief and hurriedly written scribbled notes taken by an official that recorded what was said at these meetings.  These are very important documents but, unfortunately, the Information Commissioner ruled against us after the appeal.  It was decided that this was a document prepared for the Cabinet because apparently, these notes were passed on at the incorporeal meeting.  However, it is a very significant document that I believe should be out of the public domain but which simply cannot be placed there under our freedom of information laws.  We could have taken a High Court challenge to the ruling but in terms of cost, I do not think I could persuade my editor to take up that challenge.<\/p><p>  In respect of one point on which Ms Dearbhail McDonald touched, it is kind of outside the scope of freedom of information legislation but access to court documents is an issue the joint committee perhaps should discuss with the Minister.  As members are aware, there is a constitutional right for all legal actions to be carried out in public.  However, I cover the courts a lot of the time and one often now sees lawyers standing up in court and telling the judge they will now refer to their written submissions.  Unless the lawyer or the clerk will play ball, the reporters will not get to see the contents of such affidavits or written submissions.  This is a practice that has evolved from court rules issued by judges.<\/p> <p>It is something the committee should examine because as Ms McDonald said, one can log on to PACE or American websites and see what NAMA has filed against Sean Dunne yet we cannot see what NAMA is saying in detail in the case of the Quinns, unless they play ball and give one a copy of the affidavit.  The courts are a considerable part of the system of open government.  We must open up the area as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020700007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Tighe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360232400,"counter":503,"content":"<p>As legal editor of the<i> Irish Independent<\/i>, access to court documents is a huge problem.

We act as the eyes and ears of the public.  It also affects, for example, policy areas such as the operation of the <i>in camera <\/i>rule, the blanket ban on coverage of family law cases and cases involving minors.  The connection with freedom of information is that we seem to have a blanket culture of secrecy.  It is the mindset which Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referenced earlier.

The public and democracy benefit when there is an open culture.  Last night there was confusion on social media and elsewhere about what was happening.  It erodes trust among citizens in a modern democracy when they do not know what is going on.  We have huge rows over information on issues that are not controversial.  Some of the biggest battles we fight relate to non-controversial information.  We shy away from it because it is simply not working.  The risk is that when we do not get information by ordinary measures available to journalists and taxpayers in all other countries then one must resort to surreptitious means.  That is not good.

Increasingly, there is evidence of the use of private e-mail accounts being used, which are not subject to FOI rather than official e-mail accounts.

I want to talk to them about lung disease.  It is an extremely important public health challenge.   Lung disease is any disease, or medical condition, that affects the lungs.  It includes conditions, as mentioned, that are related to smoking such as COPD and lung cancer but also, as members can see from the groups represented here, many other conditions that are not related to smoking such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, sleep apneoa and lung fibrosis as well as genetic conditions such as CF and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency.  The symptoms of lung disease include breathlessness, cough and wheeze, among others.  It is important to emphasise that breathlessness is an extraordinary difficult symptom with which to live.  We look after patients who have severe breathlessness.  They feel like they are breathing through a straw all the time, they are very disabled, they feel a sense of panic all the time because of the sensation of breathlessness and this is because of respiratory disease.  It is important to emphasise the level of disability that takes place in the Irish population because of lung disease.<\/p><p>  Lung disease is extremely common in Ireland.  One in five people in Ireland will die of a respiratory or lung disease.  It is the second most more common reason for admission to any acute medical hospital in the country and in this respect Ireland has the second highest mortality rate in Europe.  It is the most common reason for people attending their GPs and the annual cost involved in 2006 was around &euro;560 million.  <\/p><p>  If one notes how outcomes have changed for people with respiratory disease over time, one will see there has been no impact in that respect during the past ten years.  If one compares that to outcomes achieved by our colleagues who look after people with coronary artery disease, one will note that they, through a very concerted public health programme, have seen a dramatic reduction in coronary artery disease deaths over ten years, which is now less than that of respiratory disease.  <\/p><p>  What are the big challenges that face respiratory disease and that have led to a lack of public awareness of it and a lack of public policy to improve outcomes for people with respiratory disease?  The first is a lack of awareness of the condition both among policymakers and among people who have the disease.  We recognise that the symptoms of lung disease such as breathlessness are often put off to other factors such as not being fit or getting older when in fact there is disease present.  Therefore, people present with quite advanced disease whereby it is very difficult to treat and very difficult to recover lung function.  Another issue is the public perception of respiratory disease.  People perceive lung disease to be all about a lifestyle choice because of cigarette smoking.  The majority of lung disease is not smoking-related.  Public policy impacts on reducing exposure to smoking, and although we support it in every sense because it does impact on the incidence of lung disease, there are still many cases of lung disease that will not be affected by this.  Outcomes in Ireland are already poor despite having relatively low smoking rates compared to other European countries where outcomes are better.  <\/p><p>  Another issue which is important to mention is that respiratory disease is a disease of the poor.  There is a four times higher incidence of chronic bronchitis in people who have a poor background, a two times higher mortality rate for conditions such as pneumonia and COPD if one is in the lowest socioeconomic class, and a four times higher mortality rate for lung cancer and TB.  ITS data that we collected on World Spirometry Day recently identified that one in five people had abnormal lung function who never had a history of lung disease and of those the two biggest predictors of whether they had lung problems was whether they smoked, which we expected, but also their educational level.  People who did not get an education level beyond junior certificate had much lower lung function than those who got to leaving certificate or beyond.<\/p><p>  Another issue, which is an important reason we are here today, is that there has been a lack of a clear message about lung disease in the past.  Twelve charities were focusing on different lung diseases with no cohesive message but in past year we have come together as a group to form lung health alliance to promote lung health as best we can.  That is what we have been doing and we have been doing this through the World Spirometry Day, the Love Your Lungs campaign, about which members will hear more later.<\/p><p>  Lung disease is a huge public health challenge.  It has not been addressed properly and we need to work together to develop a national public health strategy to improve lung health outcomes and increase awareness of lung disease. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013020700003#C00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Edward McKone"},{"type":"speech","time":1360230000,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McKone for his interesting and sobering presentation.

Asthma is the biggest chronic disease that affects the largest number of the population in this country.  We estimate that 470,000 people have asthma.  The Asthma Society of Ireland has been in operation for approximately 40 years.  It represents people with asthma and provides information, education and services.  As Dr. McKone said, one of the biggest challenges we have is education for patients, but also we try to advocate on their behalf to have the best possible treatment and guideline-based care in public policy and the health service.<\/p><p>  We have an advice line and we deal with 2,000 patients every year.  We also hold clinics.  We do what we can with the limited resources available to us.  We have no statutory funding for our core services for patients.  I wished to raise that point at the beginning.  A total of 470,000 in the country have asthma.  The incidence is the fourth highest in the world.  People with asthma are the largest chronic disease group in the country.  One in ten people has asthma but the incidence among children is one in five.  It is an enormous issue from the point of view of the children and paediatric health.<\/p><p>  Asthma is not curable.  It is a condition of the lungs which can be controlled and managed with correct medication and patient education.  A tragic statistic is that one person per week dies of asthma in this country.  A number of those are young people.  We have contact from schools and parents concerning children who have lost friends to asthma.  Children have died who have been involved in sports days or have been playing football.  They were unable to catch their breath properly and have had an asthma attack and, regrettably, they have died.  The deaths are preventable, in particular in young people.  We are keen to advocate for a comprehensive programme to be implemented to deal with the issue.<\/p><p>  Asthma is one of the chronic conditions whereby 85% of those affected can be effectively managed in the main in primary care.  The remainder need more secondary care treatment and must be referred to consultants and in the hospital environment.  A number of patients require both types of treatment.  A total of 20,000 people attend accident and emergency services every year due to an asthma attack or exacerbation.  The average length of stay is three days.  A total of 50,000 require emergency nebulisation.  On average, adults with asthma miss 12 days per year from work and children miss 12 days from school.  That has an impact on the education of children and their participation in sports and in regular, everyday activities.  Children relate their experiences of playing sports and running and not being able to catch their breath or participate in the same way as other children.  Those with asthma are affected in their daily lives in basic activities such as walking up the stairs or running for a bus.<\/p><p>  From a public policy viewpoint we seek that the national asthma programme adopted by the Government in 2011 would be implemented.  There is a Government drive to implement the programme and we must have impetus behind it to get it through and to ensure the resources are available at primary and secondary care level to address the problems.  Xolair is a medication which Dr. Elnazir can explain in more detail.  It is intended for severe asthma patients.  Access to it is inequitable.  It is not covered by any of the reimbursement schemes and it is identified in the global initiative for asthma, GINA, guidelines as the appropriate treatment for the most severe allergic asthma patients.  The two main points we wish to pursue today are the implementation of the programme and action to address the inequity of treatment.  I spoke to a consultant yesterday who has 40 patients in Cork University Hospital who cannot get access to the drug for his patients who badly need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013020700004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sharon Cosgrove"},{"type":"speech","time":1360230000,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cosgrove.

I very much appreciate their being present.  I also thank Senator Crown for facilitating today&rsquo;s meeting.  I welcome Caroline Heffernan, a patient advocate who has cystic fibrosis.<\/p><p>  Cystic fibrosis, CF, is an inherited chronic disease that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system of approximately 1,200 children and adults in the country.  A defective gene causes an unusually thick and sticky mucus to build up that clogs the lungs and leads to life-threatening lung infections; and obstructs the pancreas and stops natural enzymes from helping the body break down and absorb food.  Our association is the only national patient CF group in Ireland.  We were formed in 1963 and this year is our 50th birthday, which is a fantastic achievement.  Along with the Irish Cancer Society we are the oldest patient group formed in Ireland.<\/p><p>  In the 1950s, few children with cystic fibrosis lived to attend primary school.  Today, thanks to advances in research and medical treatments and the fantastic clinicians we have children and adults with CF enjoy an extended life.  However, the disease remains challenging.  The median age of death is still around 25 years of age, but thanks to the good care standards in hospitals, people with CF can now expect to live into their 30s and beyond.  Increasingly, some of our members are attending third level colleges, accessing employment and living more independent lives, with the support of family.  However, this also puts major demands on adult CF services in particular.  There is a particular deficit of adult CF services and also of children&rsquo;s services.  This country has some of the most severe manifestations of cystic fibrosis in the world and also has the highest incidence of CF in the world, with three times the rate of the United States and the rest of the European Union.<\/p><p>  We wish to draw some key points to the attention of the committee.  We acknowledge the recent improvements in CF care in recent times, but we are still catching up with accepted standards in the United States and other parts of Europe.  The recent approval of the ground-breaking drug Kalydeco and the introduction of newborn screening for CF in 2011 and the opening of the long-awaited unit in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital are some examples of positive developments.  However, huge challenges remain.  Isolation facilities are still needed around the country.  There is an urgent need for 13 adult inpatient isolation rooms in Beaumont Hospital.  There are only four isolation rooms at present for approximately 130 adult patients attending the hospital in Beaumont.  It is estimated that the cost of the project is relatively modest at &euro;2.5 million for capital costs alone.  The indication is that association will have to collect the money for the project through our fund-raising, which is not entirely fair on patients and their parents who have many other demands in terms of managing the disease.  There are major infrastructure deficits in many other CF centres which I have listed in the presentation.<\/p><p>  There is need for an increased rate in double-lung transplantation.  We are delighted to hear that this week three such transplantations were undertaken in the Mater Hospital.  However, we must double the current rate of transplants.  Such operations are necessary at the end of people&rsquo;s lives and it can make a major difference in terms of the extension and quality of people&rsquo;s lives.  We acknowledge the fantastic quality of the transplantation that is undertaken but urge that more such operations would take place.<\/p><p>  We also wish to draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the non-replacement or significant delays in the replacement of dieticians, specialised nurses and physiotherapists which affect all the groups represented at the committee today.  Those on maternity and sick leave are not being replaced.<\/p> <p>That is causing real hardship for many of our patients.<\/p><p> Annual assessments in some of our hospitals, which are vital for people's health, are being cancelled or deferred because of staff embargoes.<\/p><p> We also object to the recent increase in prescription charges for medical card holders of 50 cent per item up to a monthly limit of &euro;19.50 per family.  That is causing significant hardship for our patients, particularly in terms of the number of medications they must take every month.<\/p><p> We must also preserve research funding into new and innovative treatments, as the recently approved drug Kalydeco shows.  We urge that the funding for schemes such as that operated by the Health Research Board, HRB, and the Medical Research Charities Group is maintained.<\/p><p> On the point Dr. McKone made at the start of the presentation about the need for lung health in general to become a much more important public health priority than it is currently, that is consistent from all the messages we heard here today.  It must be given a much greater priority.  Also, practical initiatives such as greater emphasis on flu jabs and the need for vaccination for pneumonia, which is very important for vulnerable groups but does not get much publicity, are vital.  We call for a partnership approach with non-governmental organisations working with clinicians through the Lung Health Alliance and the State as an effective way of going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013020700004#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360230600,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Watt for his presentation.

Members might not have heard of alpha 1 previously.  They might have commonly heard it described as hereditary emphysema.  The disease, whose full name is alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, is a genetic condition which can also cause liver disease.  <\/p><p>  The Alpha One Foundation was set up as a lung charity.  It is based in Beaumont Hospital, which is the national referral centre for alpha 1.  I realise members have been given a lot of statistics this morning but another one is that one in 25 people in Ireland are carriers for this condition.  That makes it the second most common genetic lung condition in Ireland next to cystic fibrosis.  Alpha 1 is the fourth most common cause of lung transplantation in the world.  To put that in an Irish context, the first single lung transplant and the first double lung transplant in Ireland involved alpha 1 patients.  The research we did recently shows that over 3,000 individuals on the island of Ireland suffer with a severe form but 200,000 individuals also have a deficiency, and they are also at risk of lung disease if they smoke.<\/p><p>  A national targeted detection programme was established to test people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which members might know as COPD, along with poorly controlled asthmatics, those with unexplainable liver disease and first-degree relatives of people with alpha 1.  Early detection of alpha 1 is vital, and it gives us a real example of the way personalised medicine in this age can yield improvements in quality of life, life expectancy, and smoking cessation.  To date in our programme we have screened more than 10,000 individuals, 300 of whom had a severe deficiency and 2,000 of whom had a milder form.  Twenty-six hospitals participate in that programme and we believe it is vital for the maintenance of this target detection programme.<\/p><p>  In terms of how we became involved with the Irish Lung Health Alliance, we<b><\/b>decided that we wanted to highlight lung health in Ireland and joined up with other patient support groups and health professionals.  There were 12 of us in total, giving us a unique partnership with all of the key stakeholders in lung health.  Its key messages are the same as ours: early diagnosis, early intervention, and increased awareness of lung health.  We found we have benefited from involvement in and membership of this group.  Members might have read about the Love your Lungs campaign last year when we had Dr. Ronnie Delany supporting our cause.  That was aimed at highlighting that lung disease can affect people in all socioeconomic groups, non-smokers as well as smokers.  We encouraged people who had symptoms of coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath to get a simple free lung test.  In the same way someone can get a blood pressure measurement done, one can get a simple lung test done to see if any lung disease is present.  As Dr. McKone stated, that campaign highlighted that lung disease is highly prevalent and under-diagnosed in Ireland.  The Irish Lung Health Alliance wants to involve all stakeholders in lung health and gives a voice to hundreds of thousands of patients suffering with lung disease.  Our main aim this morning is to highlight that we would like to be the contact for the Government in efforts to raise awareness of lung health and its importance in formulating future lung health policies.

We are non-profit volunteers, and we do not receive any State funding.<\/p><p>  Sleep apnoea, which we spell the old Greek way, namely, A-P-N-O-E-A as opposed to A-P-N-E-A, the American spelling, is a respiratory sleep disorder in which the sufferer frequently stops breathing while he or she sleeps.  Breathing cessations last for at least ten seconds and may be accompanied by a drop in blood oxygen saturation levels or even a cardiac event.<\/p><p>  The name &quot;sleep apnoea&quot; is derived from &quot;apnoea&quot;, a Greek word meaning &quot;without breath&quot;.  It is a very serious medical condition, which in its severest form can cause premature death.<\/p><p>  There are three main types of sleep apnoea: obstructive sleep apnoea, which is the most common and is caused by an obstruction or collapse of the airway; central sleep apnoea, a neurological condition in which the brain forgets to tell the body to breathe, which is very serious but very rare; and a mix of the two.<\/p><p>  Severity of the condition is measured by the apnoea-hypopnoea index, AHI, which measures cessation of breathing per hour.  Anything within a range of five to 15 is mild, 16 to 30 is moderate, and above 30, which equates to a cessation in breathing 30 times every hour during sleep, is severe.<\/p><p>  There are serious health risks involved with this condition, including excessive daytime sleepiness, which leads to poor work performance and a high risk of road traffic accidents; increased risk of cardiac disease and stroke; increased risk of diabetes; and increased risk of glaucoma.  The symptoms include severe snoring, hypertension, diabetes, severe mood swings, excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired cognitive function, impaired short-term memory, and nocturia, which involves frequent bathroom visits during the night.<\/p><p>  Treatment is very simple and is by way of a device called a continuous positive airway pressure, CPAP, which splints the airway open by an airflow which is set at a particular pressure.  There is also a device called an oral appliance made by a specially qualified dentist, which draws forward the lower jaw.  This has proved effective in dealing with mild and possibly moderate apnoea.<\/p><p>  Population studies carried out in the 1990s indicate that 4% of the adult male population, 2% of the adult female population and 0.5% of children suffer from sleep apnoea.  More recent studies indicate that up to 10% of the adult population and 3% of children suffer from sleep apnoea.  In the case of children there is a very close link to those with Down's syndrome, 45% of whom are likely to develop sleep apnoea.<\/p><p>  In terms of figures, studies in the 1990s found that there were up to 112,000 sufferers in Ireland, and the figure could be as high as 360,000.  If we take the best-case scenario, there is a significant number of people here with the condition.  The large increase in the number of children suffering from this condition is of major concern.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with the condition as it relates to adults and then in the paediatric area.  The current position is that a number of HSE-managed and voluntary hospitals offer an <i>ad hoc<\/i> type of service.  There is no national structure or framework for dealing with the condition in the public health system.  The type of service offered varies from hospital to hospital, with only one HSE hospital offering dedicated sleep disorder beds.  In many cases diagnostic testing is suspended when an acute hospital finds itself busy, usually through a busy night in the accident and emergency department.  Typical of that is a current problem in Dublin in which possibly the largest unit in the country, at St. Vincent's University Hospital, has had its staff reduced and is facing the prospect of a vastly reduced service from June of this year; it is looking at halving the service.  The ISAT has met with the chief executive officer of the hospital, who has no money, and the HSE has not responded to correspondence.<\/p><p>  The Beaumont Hospital sleep disorder unit is located at St. Joseph's Hospital, Raheny.  I might add that that public unit was funded by private sources.<\/p> <p>It has been closed since mid-December last as there is a perceived safety issue.  I do not know what it is.  Since sleep studies have been suspended there, up to 100 patients have been left in limbo.  There are similar problems throughout the country.  It should be pointed out that there are no sleep medicine consultants employed by the HSE.  The diagnostic work is carried out by respiratory consultants, who give up a percentage of their time to deal with the condition.<\/p><p> There are many clinical studies available which prove that sleep apnoea patients who are being successfully treated are less likely to develop cardiac conditions, are up to 33% less likely to have a stroke and usually have fewer visits to their GPs.  ISAT has pleaded with two Ministers responsible for health to introduce a national strategy to deal with this problem, but to no avail.<\/p><p> This year, the Road Safety Authority has issued new guidelines to general practitioners on fitness to drive for group 1 drivers.  On page 56 of this document, there is a section covering sleep apnoea.  It states drivers who suffer from symptoms and are sleepy must not drive and must report this to their driving licence authorities.  General practitioners are not qualified to diagnose this condition.  With an <i>ad hoc<\/i>sleep disorder service whose capacity is being reduced, we fail to see how these regulations can be enforced, particularly if a suspected sufferer of sleep apnoea has to wait up to 12 months to be officially diagnosed, and longer to be treated.  It is an absolute must that a national strategy be introduced.<\/p><p> The situation for children with sleep apnoea is even worse.  Sleep apnoea in children is a very different condition from that in adults.  It is frequently associated with conditions such as ADHD, and approximately 45% of children with Down's syndrome are likely to develop the condition.  There is no structure at all, with a number of hospitals offering <i>ad hoc<\/i>services.  There are no sleep consultants employed by the HSE.  As with adults, a number of respiratory physicians coupled with respiratory scientists offer very limited services.  The following hospitals offer some degree of service: Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin; Temple Street Children's University Hospital; the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Tallaght; Cork University Hospital; Galway University Hospital; and the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick.  We believe the paediatric units in Mullingar, Cavan and Drogheda have shown an interest.  In many cases, these centres cannot offer the full overnight sleep test - a polysomnogram - and rely on the less reliable oximetry test.<\/p><p> Let me give an idea of the scale of the problem nationally.  In 2007, 433 tests, both polysomnograms and oximetry, were carried out in paediatric units.  In 2011, 1,793 tests were carried out, representing an increase of 414%.  The number of children on non-invasive ventilation increased by 627% over the same period.  Waiting times for oximetry testing are in excess of eight months and waiting times for polysomnograms are over 12 months.  It is no way to treat our children.  A national strategy is required, be it produced jointly or severally.<\/p><p> The diagnosis and management of sleep apnoea cries out for the introduction of a national strategy, both for adults and for children.  From an adult perspective, the introduction of fitness-to-drive guidelines for group 1 motorists places additional pressure on what is a fractured clinical service that has been starved of resources over the years.  The proposed introduction of fitness-to-drive guidelines for group 2 motorists next year will create an even bigger strain on the service, as it has been proven by a number of recent studies that the incidence of sleep apnoea in professional drivers is as high as 28%.  From this perspective alone, there is an undeniable case for a national strategy to deal with sleep apnoea.  After all, these guidelines have been introduced by a national regulatory body.  As a nation, we must support these decisions.  From a children's perspective, it is even more serious.  For us to ignore the plight of up to 3% of our children is unacceptable to ISAT and the people.  There is absolutely no excuse for it.  With the use of modern technology and committed people, the cost factor of a national strategy can be controlled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013020700005#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan Smith","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360231200,"counter":541,"content":"<p>Is it the case that the HSE has not replied to any correspondence in regard to St. Vincent's hospital?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013020700006#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360231200,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I have received no response from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013020700006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan Smith"},{"type":"speech","time":1360231200,"counter":543,"content":"<p>When did Mr. Smith last contact the executive?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013020700006#F00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360231200,"counter":544,"content":"<p>Approximately three or four weeks ago.

In particular, I thank Senator John Crown for organising the invitation.<\/p><p>  I have a problem in that most people do not know what chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, is.  It is a chronic disease of the lungs associated with narrowing of the airways.  It produces two problems primarily, namely, difficulty with breathing and a propensity to get infections or exacerbation of symptoms that may lead to the patient seeking medical care, either through the general practitioner or in hospital.  Patients are very numerous.  In the winter, many end up on trolleys, thus contributing to many of the difficulties in emergency departments of which we are well aware.<\/p><p>  There is confusion over the disease and people ask whether it is asthma.  The name is a difficulty for patients.  Many COPD patients with whom I deal tell me they have asthma, COAD or smoker's asthma.  COPD is different from asthma.  We have heard from my colleague about asthma.  Asthma tends to be associated with younger patients and to be more reversible.  COPD is a progressive disease that tends to get worse as one goes through life.  It is different and tends to affect a different spectrum of the population.  Diagnosis is on the basis of a simple spirometer test that examines airflow reduction.  It ought to be easily available but unfortunately it is not.  It is available only in perhaps 50% of general practitioners' surgeries.  That is certainly a problem.<\/p><p>  The disease is certainly very common.  We have heard a lot of figures today.  Much of the problem in the Irish health care system is associated with the provision of accurate figures but we reckon there are approximately 100,000 patients in the country diagnosed with COPD.  Perhaps 200,000 more have not been diagnosed.  The disease is becoming more common with increasing age.  Canadian figures show that approximately one in four people who reach the age of 70 will need treatment for COPD.<\/p><p>  We know there are at least 12,000 admissions to hospitals with the disorder each year.  There are probably more, but 12,000 are directly related to COPD.  Unfortunately, 1,400 people die from COPD every year.  To put that in perspective, approximately 1,400 people die annually from lung cancer, which we now know is the biggest cancer killer in the country.  COPD, therefore, is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients.  It is probably the most frequent reason patients with chronic diseases are admitted to hospital, and is a frequent cause of readmission to hospital.  Many of my patients with COPD require multiple admissions.  Given that the average length of stay of patients in hospital is approximately nine to ten days, it involves their being in hospital for a quite considerable period.<\/p><p>  COPD is predominantly caused by smoking, but not all cases are related to smoking.  We have heard already that alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency can be a contributor.  People who are born prematurely may have difficulty with it.  It is associated with deprivation and tends to reflect poor nutrition, for example.  Unfortunately, smoking is a considerable factor.  Many patients with COPD are ex-smokers.  An individual who has given up smoking for ten or twenty years may have done enough damage to his lungs to present with COPD.  It is not fair to say the problem can be addressed by stopping smoking.  Many people who have chosen to give up smoking are inflicted with the disease some time later.<\/p><p>  Why is there so little public recognition of the disease?  The name is a problem.  We have already heard about bronchitis and emphysema.  COPD is, pathologically, bronchitis and emphysema.  It is a kind of catch-all phrase for chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It is difficult for patients to remember the terms \"COPD\" and \"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\".  The disease takes decades to develop and patients sometimes attribute symptoms to the ageing process.  They may say they are short of breath because they are getting older but it is actually because their lungs have been damaged.  COPD is more common in poorer social groups.  I do not need to tell members that poorer social groups tend to receive poorer health care and poorer solutions to their problems.  The chronicity of the disease is associated with the degree of guilt.  Perhaps people are less likely to demand resources for smoking-related problems.  People get used to the disease developing slowly and just do not seek resources.<\/p><p>  Along with certain colleagues, I did not study respiratory medicine to look after COPD patients; I was interested in the more exciting end of respiratory medicine.  However, I ended up working with COPD.  Nihilism has been part of the problem until very recently.  Doctors and nurses were not really interested in looking after patients with COPD, and this reflected the public mood.  That is changing for the good, and bodies such as the Irish Lung Health Alliance and the Irish Thoracic Society are certainly pushing the agenda, but there has been, both in Ireland and elsewhere, a lack of awareness of and interest in dealing with the problem.<\/p><p>  We have heard about various patient advocacy groups today.  As of yet, there is not a properly formulated group to support COPD patients, who amount to a considerable number.  Mr. McGloin, who travelled here this morning from Sligo, is the chairman elect of COPD Support Ireland, which is in the process of being formed.  There has been significant neglect regarding this very common and troublesome disease.<\/p> <p>One of my roles is that I am the clinical lead for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, in the Health Service Executive's clinical strategies and programme directorate.  This has been established for several years.  It was originally under Dr. Barry White and more recently under Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll.  The idea behind the programme is to reduce morbidity and mortality from COPD through several initiatives.<\/p><p> The COPD outreach service allows patients who would ordinarily be admitted to hospital with COPD exacerbations to be dealt with at home or discharged from hospital earlier.  This has been pioneered by Professor Gerry McElvaney's colleague in Beaumont Hospital, Professor Richard Costello.  This outreach programme is being rolled out in 12 other sites across the country.  We have had great success so far but we have had to start in several places with limited staff because of the recruitment pause which has shackled us somewhat.<\/p><p> Many COPD patients can be treated in primary care centres.  We have been examining strategies to get spirometry out to primary care centres so diagnosis can be made at that level.  We also have pulmonary rehabilitation, an integrated programme for looking after patients with COPD.  It primarily revolves around exercise and is a very beneficial programme.  We have been trying to spread this programme around the country.<\/p><p> Cost effectiveness is important for the COPD programme.  With the events of yesterday bringing money to the fore again, we need to show we are producing benefits for the taxpayer.  Already the programme has demonstrated a reduction in the average length of stay in hospital for patients.  Between 2008 and 2011, we reduced the number of bed-day units required for patients with this disease by 10,000.  We are demonstrating some return on investment for the taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013020700006#F00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Tim McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360231800,"counter":548,"content":"<p>Thank you, Professor McDonnell.

I commend the work the various groups are doing in highlighting this issue and making the public and the Government more aware of it.<\/p><p>  Do we have any longitudinal studies to help us understand why Ireland has the fourth highest rate of asthma in Europe?  Has the prevalence of asthma increased or decreased over the past ten, 20 and 30 years?  Why does one in five of our children suffer from asthma?  Why are those from poor educational backgrounds four times more likely to have the disease?  Why does the rate of prevalence move from 20% of children to 10% of the general population?<\/p><p>  Do people who suffer from chronic lung disease have automatic entitlement to general practitioner, GP, pharmacy and hospital services and medical cards?  Is testing for chronic lung disease part of the routine child health assessment programme or is there a test that can be applied to infants and younger children?  Would it help if this were to be a routine part of the infant and child welfare programme?  Do we have any information on the impact of early diagnosis and treatment of lung disease from a health, well-being and health economics perspective?

It was great to hear their presentations.  It is recognised there are disparities in smoking across the socio-educational spectrum.  Does Dr. Edward McKone believe there are other factors which determine the disparity of the incidence of lung disease across social groups?  How do we stack up in international comparisons in terms of the number of respiratory consultants per head of population?  I would guess we are we somewhat worse than the UK and disastrously worse than other places in the world, considering Britain and Ireland have disastrously low levels of specialists in most specialities.<\/p><p>  It is frequently suggested that asthma is a disease where the advances in knowledge and treatment have not necessarily percolated to the front lines of treatments and that substantial further improvements could be made if doctors were to follow the best existing practice and best medications.  What is the Asthma Society of Ireland's take on this?  Are we doing okay on that?<\/p><p>  Does Cystic Fibrosis Ireland believe an adequate number of beds have been built in the cystic fibrosis unit in St. Vincent's to comply with international guidelines for beds per sufferer in the population?  All the groups harbour under somewhat of an extra burden in that people believe lung disease is caused by smoking and, therefore, it is the fault of smokers who contract such diseases.  It is a far more subtle and complex problem than that, however.  Notwithstanding the fact that a significant part of lung disease is not related to smoking, if we were to have a complete disappearance of smoking as a habit, what would be the impact on the demand for respiratory services?  Saying that, I am asking everyone to check the website, <i>www.sos2030.com<\/i>, which we set up recently with the ambitious plan to get EU governments, the European Commission, etc., to buy into the idea that we will pick a date in the future which from thereafter it will not be legal to do for-profit commerce in tobacco.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013020700007#G00400","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1360231800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>Again, I thank Senator Crown for this meeting but also for being present despite having had no sleep due to the late sitting of the Seanad this morning.

Are we still painting with the same awful brush those who have been brave enough to give up but who, 15, 20 or 30 years later, still catch COPD?  We should not be treating them in that way.

It is a pity they all had to come in together because there is a lot of information there.  I, too, will suck it because some of the questions have been asked.<\/p><p>  The first speaker referred to the impact on those with lower education levels and those with lower socioeconomic backgrounds, diet, etc.  I would be interested in hearing a little more in that regard.  It astounds me that, according to the asthma association, one person dies a week from an asthma attack.  I did not realise that.<\/p><p>  As somebody who has dealt in the past with Dublin City Council, I am still astonished when I deal with queries from those who have housing difficulties that asthma is not registered as a medical condition with the local authority.  If there is water running down the walls and there is damp on the ceiling, it is still not classed as living in poor conditions.  When I go to any of the housing sections in Dublin City Council, it is astonishing that a medical officer can state that the conditions in which tenants live, particularly very bad conditions in many of the old flat complexes, do not contribute to the serious illness of asthma.  I merely want that noted.<\/p><p>  As somebody who has had the trauma of losing a loved one who had a donor card and whose organs were donated, I understand it is a terribly traumatic time for the family in general and that the only comfort at the end of it, after a couple of months or maybe even after a couple of years, is that the loss of the loved one has led to giving life to others.  I am concerned about how people view being a donor, particularly how it is pictured.  How does one advertise for donors?  I am aware that one can tick a box on one's driving licence to be regarded as being a donor but there is a need for the process to be a more user-friendly.  There is a need to go into schools and talk to young people.  There is a need to go into the colleges.<\/p><p>  Not everybody dies in road accidents.  We just happened to have a family member who did.  There could be a significant link with young people if they were given proper information.  I suppose one aspect that struck us when we were left with that dilemma was whether one should sign this piece of paper or make the decision to leave one's loved one in a state of coma because he or she might come out the other end.  One hears such stories now and again.  What must form part of the education of asking people to be donors is the sensitivity of the tests concerned and the need to take in as an individual when somebody says there is nothing there.  That goes for those wanting to be donors as well.<\/p><p>  Will the witnesses provide evidence of being able to portray people wanting to be donors.  It is important that such a message goes out, particularly to young people and families, and it needs to be provided in colleges, schools and workplaces such as here.  It is not enough that one is asked to take a card at a counter in a shop and tick a box on that card.

As I mentioned, lung disease is much more common in persons from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.  In the past that has been largely attributed to the belief that those who are poorer and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to smoke more.  There is a great deal of information which shows that although smoking is an important contributor, it certainly is not the biggest one.  The most compelling data show, first, that diseases that are not related to cigarette smoking, in particular asthma and including cystic fibrosis, CF, are heavily influenced by socioeconomic factors.  Survival around the world is much lower, for example, in North America, if one does not have private insurance.  Inner-city asthma is a massive problem and it is not smoking related; it is due to asthma and other environmental factors.  Therefore, we know that socioeconomic factors independently affect conditions like asthma and CF.<\/p> <p> Irish data were collected for COPD on world spirometry day in June, when we offered free lung function testing to 750 people around the country.  Half of these individuals were never previously diagnosed for lung disease.  One in seven of the latter cohort had airflow obstructions suggesting asthma or COPD and one in five had abnormal lung functions.  This highlights the prevalence of the condition.  We also asked people to complete questionnaires on their smoking habits and educational backgrounds.  Education level is one of the best determinants of socioeconomic background.  It is better than asking people about their incomes or jobs.  We found that lung function was on average lower in smokers, as one would expect, but also that socioeconomic factors had an independent effect on lung function.  There was a significantly lower level of lung function among people who were not educated beyond junior certificate level.<\/p><p> Clearly, however, this is not simply an educational issue.  Other factors include awareness and getting out the message that people should do something about these symptoms.  Access to health care is also an issue.  We have a good public health service but there are limitations and access can be disparate.  Environmental factors must also be considered, including housing and jobs that entail exposure to dust and fumes.  These factors cause lung disease in ways that are not related to smoking.  Healthy air is also relevant.  If one lives in the centre of a city in a poor environment with heavy traffic, one is exposed to pollutants.  We would like to do more work on the multitude of factors involved.  We spend considerable amounts of money on drugs but if we could find a way to bridge the outcomes among people from different socioeconomic classes, we could probably make a bigger impact than through expenditure on medication.<\/p><p> In regard to manpower, 50 public consultants work in the area of respiratory medicine in this country.  The European Respiratory Society plans to publish a White Paper on the issue later this year.  We tried to get access to the hard data but we do not have them yet.  As Senator Crown noted, we fare badly compared with other European countries in terms of delivery of respiratory health care.  That includes consultants, respiratory nurses, respiratory scientists, physiotherapists and primary care provision.  There is currently one consultant per 80,000 in Ireland, compared with one per 50,000 in the UK.  Indeed, the UK intends to further improve its ratio by employing additional consultants.  We would need to appoint an additional 30 consultants to bring our ratio to the UK level.  We also need to increase substantially the numbers of respiratory nursing staff, who are critical to carrying out breathing tests to identify lung disease.  This issue is being addressed by the asthma programme and Professor McDonnell's COPD programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013020700008#H01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Edward McKone","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360233000,"counter":564,"content":"<p>We have a good idea of how many people in Ireland have alpha 1- antitrypsin deficiency.  We estimate that 170,000 people have the MZ form and more than 3,000 have the ZZ form.  If somebody who is a ZZ smokes, he or she will develop severe emphysema in his or her 30s and 40s.  Even a non-smoker will have a good chance of developing emphysema.  The advantage of our targeted early detection programmes is that we know from our own data that people who are found to have the condition can be persuaded to stop smoking and institute lifestyle changes that help to prevent progression of disease.  We have set up a targeted detection programme in Beaumont Hospital which is funded by the HSE.  The funding has been cut but it is still functional.  We can offer a free test to everyone in the country for alpha 1- antitrypsin deficiency.  We have rolled out the programme to more than 26 hospitals and GP surgeries across Ireland.  A GP in west Cork can now send a letter to us in Beaumont and we will send a kit so that he or she can take a blood sample from the patient, put it on a filter paper and return it to us for diagnosis.  We will then give the patient an appointment at our outpatient centre in Beaumont for advice on the condition and lifestyle improvements that can help.

In the case of St. Joseph's, I have received a response which was passed on to another area manager and I presume something will be done.  I have heard nothing in the case of St. Vincent's, however.  St. Joseph's is an effective sleep clinic with a high throughput.  There is a small clinic in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, a unit in Blanchardstown which cannot get beds and a very small unit in Cavan.  All these additional things are coming on stream.  An awareness campaign has been suggested but the problem is that it would clog up the waiting list in the absence of services.  That would defeat the whole purpose of the exercise.  This is why a national strategy is required.<\/p><p>  I will explain some of the reasons children develop sleep apnoea.  Down's syndrome is prevalent in one child per 1,000 and sleep related breathing disorder, that is, sleep apnoea is present in 70% to 100% of such children.  They are at high risk of pulmonary hypertension, especially in cases of coincident heart disease.  For neuromuscular disease, the prevalence is one in 3,000 and 42% have a prevalence for sleep related breathing disorder.  It is difficult to detect clinically but it reduces life expectancy and is reversible by treatment.  Craniofacial abnormalities have a prevalence of one in 7,000.  Depending on the severity, the chance of individuals with this condition having a sleep related breathing disorder is up to 100%.  Achondroplasia is prevalent in one in 25,000 children and has a 48% prevalence rate for sleep apnoea.  Mucopolysaccharidosis is prevalent in one in 40,000 children and has a greater than 90% prevalence of sleep disorder breathing.  Prader-Willi syndrome is prevalent in one in 52,000 children and has a 25% to 75% prevalence rate.  These figures are from Crumlin hospital.  Approximately 0.5% of children are born with sleep apnoea.<\/p><p>  The condition has not been clinically proven beyond doubt but one or two small studies have indicated that while it is not genetic, it is hereditary.  Much depends on the craniofacial build of an individual's face, particularly where the jaw line is receding.  In the past, obesity was blamed for the condition and patients were told to lose weight, but an increasing number of thin people are developing sleep apnoea.  As we age, the tissue in our airways grows weaker and starts to collapse and close.  Sleep apnoea develops when the airway collapses completely.  One can imagine the effect of this on the rest of the major organs.<\/p> <p>One's brain goes into a total panic, one's heart starts to beat faster and one is at a high risk of stroke because snorers traditionally get a thickening of the carotid artery.  All of a sudden, there is a sudden rush of blood to the head.  If there is a weakness in the artery, the person will suffer a stroke.  There is a big pressure on the kidneys and other organs, as well as the threat of hypertension.<\/p><p> Sleep apnoea is unlikely to kill a person but what it does will kill.  A road traffic accident has been costed by Government agencies at &euro;1.5 million.  It is said 20% of traffic accidents are caused by sleepy drivers.  There are three categories of sleepy drivers.  The first is an untreated sleep disorder, the second is young aggressive male drivers and the third is professional drivers tying to hit deadlines.  If that is cut in three and one life is saved, &euro;1.5 million could be put into this programme, which would more than fund it.  It does not require big bucks.  It is about getting the right people together to put the strategy together.  There are methods of funding these initiatives but we have to have a national strategy.  It is not about money; it is about putting the brains together and getting a strategy together.  It is the same for all long-term health issues.  It is about putting a simple strategy together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013020700009#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan Smith","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360233600,"counter":571,"content":"<p>Deputy Colreavy asked about asthma incidence in Ireland and the fact that we rank fourth in the asthma world league.

As the Deputy said, the local authority staff will look at it and the parents will come back and say nothing happened after the letter I wrote and ask me to write another letter.  This happens every day in clinical practice.<\/p><p>  One in ten adults and one in five children in Ireland suffer from asthma.  This is a difficult area for us as a doctoral practice in paediatric medicine because many other conditions in the first five years of life can confuse the diagnosis of asthma.  Many viral infections can result in symptoms similar to asthma and, on many occasions, we treat them with asthma medication and that leads to people using the common phrase, \"He had asthma but he has outgrown it\".  While the incidence among children is one in every five, there is a grey area.  If I were to base it on clinical practice, it would be probably one in seven or one in eight and this becomes one in ten later in life.<\/p><p>  Professor Crown asked about the guidelines.  The society has developed an e-learning programme in collaboration with the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and while the uptake is not great, we try to make sure we are standardising the care of asthma in Ireland but we need to do more work to makes sure this filters all the way down and that primary, secondary and tertiary care is standardised according to the guidelines.<\/p><p>  Deputy Doherty asked an important question about inequality or inequity in treatment.  The medicine, Xolair, is like a key in a lock.  If the key fits in the lock in the cell, it excites a reaction and releases many substances that can cause asthma symptoms - difficulties in breathing, wheezing and shortness of breath.  This medicine targets the key and, therefore, it stops the key going into the lock.  It is not suitable for every asthma sufferer but it is definitely suitable for what we call severe allergic asthmatics and, in Ireland, according to figures we have, 450 people qualify for the use of the medicine.  It takes the form of an injection under the skin, which must be taken every two to three weeks.  There has been significant improvement, according to a study performed by Professors Lane and Costello, which highlighted a significant reduction in exacerbation and improvement in quality of life.  We do not know why there is an inequality but the medicine is not covered by any of the schemes or high tech programmes.  One of our colleagues treating adults in Cork has 40 eligible patients who cannot secure funding to start treatment.<\/p><p>  Asthma is a simple condition, if managed properly.  One of the parents who tragically lost her daughter wrote \"I wouldn't have thought that my Tricia would die of an asthma attack in a million years.  I am paying a very high price for something I didn't know.  I am living without Tricia and that is just a nightmare\".  Education, therefore, is key among all sectors of society but particularly among the patients themselves.  That brings us to the national asthma programme.  We urge that this be expedited because this will bring everything back to the level of the patient and primary care.  There must be education with a properly resourced programme with asthma nurses.  It has been shown time and time again that the role of nurses in the management of asthma, particularly in paediatrics, is huge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013020700010#K00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Basil Elnazir"},{"type":"speech","time":1360233600,"counter":578,"content":"<p>What is the estimated cost of Xolair to the State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013020700010#K00900","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360233600,"counter":579,"content":"<p>It is &euro;14,000 per patient per year.

It is particularly acute in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, because of co-factors with smoking and a past history of smoking clearly related to deprivation.  Early intervention makes a difference in these diseases and people in lower socioeconomic groups have poor access to health care and we know this.  On the other side of the coin, as one goes through life with COPD one falls down the economic ladder because one suffers from winter infections, one cannot turn up for work, one gets passed over for promotion, one loses one's job and one must go on disability benefit.  It has a social impact as well as being promoted by social factors.<\/p><p>  Deputy Doherty asked about nihilism.  Perhaps I was nihilistic about it.  A huge positive message is coming out at present about COPD.  Mr. McGloin has been on oxygen for six years and despite this he will take on running the support group when we get going.  An issue is slowness with regard to establishing a COPD support group.  This is an international issue not just an Irish one.  Very few good COPD support groups exist in other countries.  The British Lung Foundation is an umbrella organisation which looks after COPD.  The United States has a separate COPD support group.  The factors for this include that many of the patients are socioeconomically deprived and by the time many of them are aware of the problem and want to do something about it, they are significantly disabled.  There is also a little bit of embarrassment.  I have known politicians with the disease who did not want to be involved with a support organisation.  There is a huge positive message because the drugs have improved and improvements are being made.  COPD tends to be at the bottom of the queue.<\/p><p>  We are dealing with real numbers in terms of getting the programme going.  We can say we have 100,000 patients and we are fairly confident 200,000 people have not been diagnosed, which comes to Deputy McLellan's point about making a diagnosis.  We know spirometry is available in some general practices.  It is a relatively simple test but it requires training.  This training goes to practice nurses who get pulled to look after all of the other issues.  We are running a course at the moment, which is accredited through DIT and has European accreditation.  However, we have a feeling some of the people who do the course and go back to their practices will get pulled to look after diabetes patients, blood pressure monitoring, vaccination and everything else.  The COPD programme may have to consider something else but in the current climate we went for the most cost-effective option available.  We probably require outreach spirometry from hospitals.  Deputy Doherty spoke about experience from other countries.  In Scotland spirometry is done through outreach, as is the case in Denmark and the Netherlands.  Of course this costs money.<\/p><p>  Deputy Byrne mentioned housing.  Anecdotally I have been examining requests for disability stickers for patients with bad COPD.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council did not provide them for lung disease for a long time and one had to write letters and create hassle, whereas those with cardiac disease automatically received a sticker.

We have presented the committee with data on the importance of lung disease.  That has been communicated very well.  The HSE has recently published a health promotion strategy document which talks about the crises and public health challenges being faced by the Government, yet there is no mention of lung disease in it.  They talk about coronary artery disease, diabetes, obesity and smoking.  We are trying to get across that smoking will impact on respiratory disease but that there is a substantial morbidity that is not smoking-related.  We need advocates therefore to ask the HSE: \"Where is respiratory disease when you're making these policy documents?\"  The HSE should focus on it and have an independent approach to it so that we can work on trying to improve outcomes for this huge patient population.  One in five is the number we have heard repeatedly.  We need to advocate to get the HSE to recognise that and work with us to develop a strategic document to move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013020700012#M01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Edward McKone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360234800,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I would like to lobby for a lot more awareness of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD.
