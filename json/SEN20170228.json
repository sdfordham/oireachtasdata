This is a legacy issue from the Troubles.  It relates to the scrutiny of an independent inquiry into victims of and deaths that occurred during the Troubles.  It relates to at least 1,000 victims of the Troubles in the North and their families who are seeking justice in the form of an independent inquiry into the deaths.  There are many victims, both living and dead, who have suffered as a result of the Troubles in the North of Ireland.  Organisations such as the Pat Finucane Centre have done Trojan work in seeking justice.  To date, despite the best efforts of the parties in the North prior to the dissolution of the Stormont Executive, it has not happened.  A roadmap was paved through the Stormont House Agreement in 2014, which would have effectively set up an independent evaluation, conducting effective and prompt or reasonably prompt investigations to give justice to the families who lost loved ones.  One of those who lost his wife is a constituent in Donegal, Mr. Max Mogollon, who is here in the Visitors Gallery today.  He lost his wife in the 1990s as a result of security forces' collusion at the time.  While that has since been proven, the substantial facts surrounding the case have never been independently, objectively evaluated, which is wrong.  The British Government has an opportunity to accept the recommendation made by the Stormont Executive in December 2014.  If it did that, it would allow for the roadmap of justice and peace to prevail and would ensure that the United Nations position on seeking human rights is upheld.  The United Nations has ruled against the British Conservative Government on this particular issue because it continues to block the independent evaluation on the grounds that it presents a risk to national security.  There are ways to mitigate any such risks.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I encourage the members of the Government, particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and also the Taoiseach, to engage with their British counterparts in order to raise these issues and put them firmly on the agenda.

There is an undercurrent right across the North - these families have all been affected - and it is blocking the peaceful road to progress that we all want to seen taken.  I do not know what will be the response from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I hope it will be a proactive one and one of engagement.  Ultimately, however, it is a matter for the British Government to deal with this particular issue and try to bring some form of solace, peace, justice and equality to the families who have lost loved ones.  This is not exclusively an issue for one side or the other, it affects both sides of the political divide in the North.  We are not just talking about the deaths of nationalists, there were killings involving people on both sides.

I am taking this Commencement debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, who is abroad and cannot be here.  I acknowledge the presence of Dr. Paul Monaghan, MP, and other representatives in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.<\/p><p>It has been 15 months since the signing of the Fresh Start Agreement, which was reached after ten weeks of intensive cross-party negotiations.  It is deeply regrettable that while considerable work has been undertaken and there have been productive discussions, the fact remains that in the time since there has been little visible progress in establishing the legacy institutions provided for under the Stormont House Agreement of 2014.  The Government shares the deep disappointment and frustration of victims and survivors of the Troubles from all communities who have had to wait far too long for access to truth and justice. In that regard, I acknowledge the presence of Mr. Max Mogollon and sympathise with him on his loss.<\/p><p>The Government remains strongly committed to the establishment of the architecture for dealing with the legacy of the past that is provided for in the Stormont House Agreement and this is reflected in the programme for Government.  This system provides a framework for dealing comprehensively with the legacy of the past in a way that can bring whatever healing is possible to those affected by the Troubles.  The legacy institutions agreed at Stormont House include the Historical Investigations Unit, HIU, an independent body tasked with investigating outstanding Troubles-related deaths.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has rightly highlighted the critical importance of the HIU as part of the comprehensive approach to dealing with the legacy of the past.  An effective and adequately resourced legacy inquest system is also an essential part of the system to provide for effective investigations into deaths during the Troubles.  The Government has been clear in its support for the proposals made by Lord Chief Justice Declan Morgan in this regard.<\/p><p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has remained intensively engaged since the time of the Fresh Start Agreement to seek and support a way forward to get the Stormont House legacy framework urgently established.  This has included an extensive programme of consultation on the part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with victims' groups from across the communities in Northern Ireland as well, as groups representing victims and survivors of the Troubles from this jurisdiction and Britain.  It is vitally important that the envisaged legacy institutions have the trust and confidence of the victims and survivors and their families.  Their support will, therefore, continue to be central to the Government's approach in this area.<\/p><p>In December 2016, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, directed that Ireland advocate at the Council of Europe on the urgent need for progress on legacy issues in Northern Ireland, focusing in particular on the establishment of the HIU and a properly resourced legacy inquest system.  These mechanisms would satisfy the outstanding judgment against the British government in the McKerr <i>v. <\/i>Others group of cases by ensuring that effective investigations and full compliance with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights finally takes place.  The Minister has also remained in regular and direct contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with the political parties there on legacy matters and has consistently underlined the obligations of the British Government in this area.<\/p><p>It is important to emphasise that both Governments remain committed to the establishment of the Stormont House legacy institutions as soon as possible and that they continue to work to achieve this outcome.  The Minister discussed legacy issues most recently with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at their meeting in Dublin on the 30 January.  There was agreement that the ongoing work by both Governments with the political parties to support the establishment of Stormont House institutions must continue and be intensified following the Assembly elections on Thursday with a view to getting the necessary agreement as soon as possible.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Government has and will continue strongly to urge the British Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and all interested parties to approach legacy issues with resolve, leadership and compromise in the period ahead in order that the few outstanding issues can be dealt with and the necessary legislation introduced and enacted in both jurisdictions to get the Stormont House Agreement legacy bodies finally established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#C00200","speaker":"1314","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>An bhfuil an Seanad&oacute;ir s&aacute;sta?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#D00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta leis an fh&iacute;rinne a r&aacute;.

I do not wish to in any way insult the Minister for Health who is doing an excellent job, as is the Minister of State in his own role.  The issues I bring to him today are issues which have national importance.<\/p> <p>It has come to my attention that everybody on a waiting list in University Hospital Waterford received a letter from the hospital informing them that their request to be removed from the waiting list had been accepted.  Even those who replied that they wished to remain on the waiting list received a second letter asking them if they wished to remain on the list.  The false cleansing of the waiting list has not only confused people, but also hides the true nature of waiting lists across all categories in Waterford.  We are all still reeling from the \"RTE Investigates\" programme on the waiting list crisis, and it is difficult to obtain accurate information.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

We all know that people get seriously ill and die in shorter time periods than this and, by the hospital's own admission, \"The clinical risk for the Urology Services is on the Corporate Risk register and is rated high risk\".<\/p><p>I welcome the announcement that University Hospital Waterford is to get a mobile catheterisation laboratory for cardiac patients and the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has had much to do with that, and he is to be complimented on that.  However, I regret the fact that it took extensive public and political lobbying to achieve this.  Citizens should not have to lobby to get essential health care.  <\/p><p>We are not short of money.  A total of &euro;900 million has gone into the health system this year alone but the system itself appears to be flawed beyond repair.  In fact, the 2016 Euro Health Consumer Index ranked Ireland as the country with the worst waiting times in a large-scale study of 35 countries.  As appalling as this statistic sounds, the fact that the quality and length of human life is at the centre of it makes it even worse.  I ask that a new system be put in place to ensure that waiting lists are compiled in an accurate, accountable and highly transparent manner.<\/p><p>I welcome the introduction of the new national inpatient, day case, planned procedure, IDPP, waiting list management protocol and I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, for the reactivation of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  However, I believe that it will take a very assertive and thorough root and branch overhaul of the HSE to ensure that this protocol and the NTPF will be effective.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for giving of his time to take this time on this matter and I welcome his response specifically on the waiting lists in Waterford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#D01000","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I join the Cathaoirleach in welcoming our friends from Estonia.

I offer my sympathy to Susan and his family.  I know Senator Craughwell will join me in paying tribute to the former Deputy Peter Mathews.  He was a very kind, gentle and friendly man and a very dedicated public servant.  I again offer our sympathies to the Mathews family.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Craughwell for raising this very important issue today.  The personal stories of the people waiting for treatment broadcast in the RTE documentary a few weeks ago were deeply moving and the experiences they described are absolutely inexcusable.  The NTPF published waiting list data provide an up-to-date and verified picture of patients actively waiting for a date for inpatient-day case treatment and outpatient appointments.  While there has been an evolution in the way the data are gathered and presented in a move towards greater access and transparency, only data on patients actively waiting have been consistently published.  <\/p> <p>Numbers on the pre-admit list were collected on a phased basis dependent on each hospital&rsquo;s ability to deliver the data.  Verifiable and consistent figures across hospitals for this list became available in 2012.  The NTPF started collecting planned procedures data at the end of 2013 and these became available in a consistent manner in 2014.  <\/p> <p>In the D&aacute;il, the Minister for Health clarified that the NTPF published waiting list data has consistently not included the pre-admit and planned procedures lists.  However, it is important to note that these lists have been and are widely circulated on a weekly basis to a broad range of stakeholders including hospitals, hospital groups, the Health Service Executive, HSE, and national clinical leads.  Two weeks ago, the Minister for Health committed to asking the NTPF to work towards the publication of the pre-admit and planned procedures waiting lists.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In this regard, the NTPF will review and advise me on the appropriate format for publication for these two different categories of patients.  In the meantime, I advise Senator Craughwell that as of 31 January, 16,521 patients were waiting for inpatient and day case treatment in the Ireland East hospital group, which covers most of the south east.  In addition, there were 3,980 patients on the pre-admit list and 2,925 on the planned procedures list for inpatient or day case treatment in that group.  The NTPF regularly reviews its processes to ensure best practice.  It has commenced a significant research project examining updated international best practice around publication models and methodologies.  The Government looks forward to this work being concluded and to any actions arising from its recommendations being taken.  Reducing waiting lists for the longest waiting patients is one of the Government&rsquo;s key priorities.  It is for this reason that &euro;20 million was allocated to the NTPF in budget 2017, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  The money is going into that investment.<\/p><p>In December 2016, the Minister for Health granted approval to the NTPF for a day case waiting list initiative with the aim of ensuring no patient will be waiting more than 18 months by 30 June 2017.  In excess of 2,000 day cases will be managed through this process and I have been advised that appointments under this initiative will be issued shortly. The HSE will also submit waiting list action plans for inpatient day case and outpatient waiting lists.  The focus of these plans should be to ensure no patient is waiting more than 15 months on either list by the end of October 2017.  The HSE has been requested to develop the inpatient day case waiting list action plan in conjunction with, and supported by, the NTPF's approach to the utilisation of the remaining &euro;10 million of 2017 funding for patient treatment.  These plans are being finalised and the Minister for Health expects to receive them imminently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#E00300","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>That was a very comprehensive reply.

It has now been made clear that it is a deductible expense but only as far back as 2013.  Those who paid the charge will only be able to submit claims as far back as 2013 because of Revenue's rule that one can only amend one's tax returns for the preceding four years.  In that context, I ask the Minister for Finance to make a special exception to allow people to amend their tax returns as far back as 2009 on the basis that the Revenue Commissioners issued very clear guidance in that year on the interpretation of the Taxes Consolidation Act to the effect that NPPR was not a deductible expense.  It now transpires that it can be treated as a deductible expense but only for the previous four years.  This could represent a huge saving, given that some people were paying up to 50% in income tax.  The Minister must examine this issue because it is very unfair to landowners.

However, this is not merely a pay dispute; it is also about the structural formation of Bus &Eacute;ireann and its financial difficulties.  In January 2016 the previous Government was aware that there was a deficit of &euro;20 million, which has since grown to &euro;30 million.  The Minister became aware of the problem when he took on the transport brief.  I call on the Government and the Minister, in particular, to deal with this issue and ensure the country will not be affected by a strike.  The Minister has been sitting on the fence and letting the dispute work its way out at the WRC, which is not acceptable.  He needs to get involved.

Even though allegations of rape and the abuse of Grace and 47 intellectually disabled children were widely known, she was left there for nearly 20 years.  I have three questions for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, to answer on behalf of the Government she represents.  Why was Grace abandoned by those who had a duty to ensure she received the care she desperately needed as a vulnerable human being and citizen of the State?  Who stopped the 2012 report by Conal Devine from being published until now?  Who stopped the 2015 report from being published?  We are told it was because criminal proceedings might take place, but who has been arrested?  How many files have been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions?<\/p><p>It is welcome that a commission of investigation will be set up in the coming weeks, but where is the accountability?  Like me, most people are sick and tired of cover-up after cover-up.  We are fed up with the protection of State institutions being sacrosanct.  There is a vulnerable young woman - there are many other vulnerable adults - at the centre of this scandal and we know that it is by no means an isolated case.  The <i>ad hoc<\/i>approach of State services, whether they are provided directly by the State or contracted out to other service providers, is an abomination.  I commend the young social worker who acted as a whistleblower in this case.  Her courage and the tenacity she showed in exposing the plight of Grace are laudable.

The mother has expressed her devastation after the HSE turned down her application for medicinal cannabis for her beautiful daughter.  She was left heartbroken when the HSE turned down her application for medicinal cannabis for Ava and now fears her daughter will die.  She has tried to get the Minister for Health to make medicinal cannabis available to her young daughter, Ava, who suffers from a very rare form of epilepsy.  The Minister has been informed that the condition can be alleviated by taking medicinal cannabis.  Ava's condition has improved in recent months after she started taking cannabis oil.  Ava has taken cannabis oil, which is legally sourced from a shop in Dublin, since last October.  Vera says that her daughter's life has been transformed since taking cannabis oil.  Ava has thrived and there has been a 90% drop in the number of seizures.  Little Ava can have up to 20 seizures a day, which is devastating.  I know because I have a family member who has seizures.  I can attest to the fact that it is heartbreaking. <\/p> <p>The Minister has told Vera that she cannot get the medication to help treat her daughter because it has not been prescribed by a paediatric brain specialist and no exception will be made.

We hear that all these people are being housed and about all that is being done for those on housing lists but the homelessness crisis is out of control.

He was a traditional old-style Roman Catholic but not in any narrow sense.  He was always very friendly to me.  I liked him and found him very helpful.  When I spoke some years ago at the beginning of the financial crisis, he contacted me and said I was the only one who was speaking out and that I was the only one who was right in the debate.  However, he noticed that there were no figures and asked why.  I said I had been absolutely hopeless at arithmetic at school and had not improved.  He supplied me with the figures and as a result in the Seanad I contradicted the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan.  His figures were completely wrong and the ones supplied to me by the late Peter Mathews in support of my arguments were correct to the last decimal point, which was an astonishing feat.  He was a most brilliant economist, as well as a thoroughly decent man.<\/p> <p>I also wish to raise, if it has not been raised already, the question of the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service.  It is quite shocking that the head of Dublin City Council, Owen Keeg---- I am not allowed to mention his name - has decided to take steps to replace the fire brigade ambulance service with a general fire brigade warning.  He wants to take the service to Tallaght, with a backup centre in Ballyshannon.  The Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service answers all 999 calls in Dublin, the rest of Leinster, as well as counties Cavan and Monaghan.  It deals, for example, with people who need an epinephrine injection.  We all remember the girl who tragically died because she could not get an epinephrine injection.  The service deals with people who have had a heart attack or suffer a cardiac arrest, road traffic accidents and so on.  If it is transferred to a national agency, there will definitely be delays.  SIPTU members in Dublin Fire Brigade have been balloted and 97% have voted for strike action if this goes through.  It is a really serious matter.  It involves the Dublin city manager interfering again in a most stupid way.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann should have an opportunity to discuss the matter.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to contact the responsible Minister on my behalf.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#S00800","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>It may be a little unfair to mention - it is obvious, even though the Senator did not mention his name-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#S00900","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Owen Keegan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#S01000","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>-----the Dublin city manager because he is not here to defend himself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#S01100","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I know; I stopped half way through his name.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#S01200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>The Senator still hit the point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#S01300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>He is an ass anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#S01400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>It is most inappropriate to say that.

A total of 47 young children and vulnerable adults were placed in the home in question.  They were not monitored even though what was going on was known.  We have had inquiry after inquiry.  When do we stop and say we have done something well?  Tusla is an underfunded HSE organisation.

She has just left Mitchelstown and we should form a welcome party for her in Leinster House.  Deputy McDonald and I met her and her family in Cork in January and she outlined the harrowing experience her young daughter is going through and how they are coping with it.  They have found something that works but there has been a long wait for legislation to legalise it.  The Leader said last week that he welcomed the legislation.  Could he ensure it is put through speedily?  Two neurologists are treating Ms Twomey's daughter, Ava, and they are willing to prescribe this if they are given training.  The training would take six hours and then they could become experts and be able to prescribe for Ava and other children and adults like her.  We need the legislation to be hurried through.

This has raised its head again in light of the tragic death of an elderly gentleman in County Waterford last weekend.  Elderly people, especially in rural Ireland, depend on the telephone and as a result of the withdrawal of the allowance in 2014, many were forced to take out their telephone lines.  This resulted at a time in a substantial reduction in the number of the elderly applying for a panic alarm system linked to a telephone service.  Unfortunately, because broadband provision is so poor in rural areas and because the mobile telephone service is also poor, it is not possible to use the panic alarm system unless there is a telephone line.

According to the coroner in London, not enough was done to protect people.

The first time I met Peter was in a professional capacity as a county councillor back in 2003.  He was, as many people have said, an absolute gentleman, a very nice person and a great man to meet and have a chat with.  One would often see him around Mount Merrion in particular, but also around Dublin South.  I pass on my sympathies to his wife, Susan, his four kids, James, John, David and Maria, his wider family, friends and a very wide circle of colleagues.  It is very sad.  I remember being at a road opening in Sandyford with Peter in the middle of June 2011 when the news broke of Brian Lenihan's very premature death.  It is very sad that both Brian Lenihan, who was also mentioned today in the House, and Peter died very young from cancer.<\/p> <p>I also want to raise the issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann, which has been covered by many people.  It is important that we remind ourselves that the Minister, Deputy Ross, is the 100% shareholder in Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the State.  If I owned 100% of a company or was shareholder of 100% of a company, I would want to know what was going on.  I would want to make sure the company and its workers and management were all getting on with their business in as effective a way as possible.  It is not acceptable at this stage, when we could be facing an all-out transport strike because there is risk of contagion, not only in Bus &Eacute;ireann, but onwards into Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus.  It is important that we remind ourselves that it is a State company and one that has been around a very long time, formerly in the guise of CIE.  It is 30 years old as Bus &Eacute;ireann.  For many years Expressway was profitable.  We all know there are many reasons it is not profitable at the moment.  It is not acceptable for the Minister to continue in this way.  The Minister for transport is also the Minister for tourism.  It does not reflect well if tourists coming into the country, who presumably want to go all over the country, which we want them to do, only experience a product near Dublin Airport or Shannon Airport.  They should be able to travel all over the country.

It is important to recognise today, as many Senators have raised it, that this is a woman, a person and a citizen of our State, and she is entitled to respect, dignity, care and protection.  I join all the Senators who have raised it today in the House, and I join the Taoiseach in his remarks in the other House, in saying that the way she was treated is a disgrace.  It is unacceptable in a modern, 21st century Ireland.  The very least, as the Taoiseach said, that this House and the other House can do is apologise to Grace and to her family for the way she was treated.  It is a matter for which the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, has responsibility, not the Minister, Deputy Zappone.<\/p> <p>The two HSE reports have been published.  It is important that we not just publish those reports and have an inquiry but also that we have accountability and responsibility.  I make the point again today in this House.  It is about time that responsibility and accountability are accepted and stood up for by those who are charged under the State with the care and protection of people within our society.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I agree completely with what Senator Devine said.  How many more times must we come into this House and lament and deplore the condition and the treatment of people like Grace?  It is time it stopped.  We thought we had drawn a line under these sagas in our society but this has been ongoing for 20 years.  We have come to recognise that this is not acceptable any longer.  There is a need for accountability and responsibility to be accepted and we should not have to come in here any more to discuss negligence and incompetence.  I have already put in a request for a debate in this regard to be held in the House next week and I waiting for the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to respond to me on that.<\/p><p>Senators Ardagh, Bacik, Byrne and Horkan raised the issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It is a matter of grave urgency and concern that there is an impending public transport strike.  I hope there will not be an all-out strike.  It is important there is engagement by everybody involved regarding this proposed strike.  There is a need for the talking to continue and for there to be a proper conversation around what is being asked for, what is being proposed and for how we can have a roadmap for the way forward to bring a resolution to this dispute.  The Workplace Relations Commission is still the way to go.  That requires all parties to this dispute to be involved.<\/p><p>I wish to put on record and it is important that people recognise that the subvention to the company has been increased to &euro;40 million; in terms of free travel, the public service obligation funding has been increased by 11% and Bus &Eacute;ireann has seen a 21% increase in its subvention.  The bottom line, however, which we cannot ignore at one level, is that there is a &euro;50,000 loss per day on the Expressway service.  However, the approach taken by Bus &Eacute;ireann yesterday in issuing a threat to cut public sector workers' pay straight away was the wrong one.  One cannot threaten people or engage in that type of activity in a public manner.  The way to reach a resolution to this dispute is by all sides sitting down, engaging and reaching a compromise and a solution to ensure that the travelling public will not be discommoded.  The Government is committed to a public service transport entity being continued.  It is important there is a continuation of the talks. <\/p><p>Senator McDowell raised the issue of Seanad reform.  I understand the delay in the progression of his Bill rests in the appointment of a chairperson of the implementation group.  I do not have a timetable for it or any further involvement in it.  I am not in any way acting as a barrier to its progression despite what he might think.  Therefore, I cannot give him an update on that.<\/p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue relating to mica.  Our colleague and friend, Senator Paudie Coffey, when he was Minister of State, set up an expert group on this matter.  My understanding is that the expert group met in Donegal recently.  I am told it is either finished or very close to finalising its report.  That report will be given to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and to the Minister of State, Deputy English, who was in Donegal recently.  They will be fully informed of the issues at hand, the report will be published and I am told an implementation plan will arise from it.  The work is ongoing.  There is no question of procrastination about this.  I very much look forward to that report being published and subsequent to that to our having a debate on this matter in the House.<\/p><p>Senators Black, Noone and Devine raised the issue of the treatment of Ava Twomey and of her mother, Vera's protest walk on which she set out today.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority report was published two weeks ago.  It provides for an access scheme in terms of the issue being discussed, that of a cannabis-based treatment relative to specific schemes.  This relates to certification and to a medical practitioner of some description being able to sign the relevant form.  The Minister for Health is committed to a compassionate access scheme.  He  met Vera Twomey last week.  Senator Colm Burke also met her and I advise Senator Devine that I spoke to her yesterday.  All of us are committed to finding a resolution to this issue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is about the treatment of a young child and a family.

This is the story of a young child.  If we are honest, if any of us had to endure and witness what Ms Vera Twomey and young Ava had to endure, we would all be sympathetic and would all want to see a resolution, which we do.  The Minister is committed to doing that but I believe it is important that we continue to have talks about the matter.  It is through conversation and dialogue that we can reach a compromise.  However, the Minister cannot just abandon protocol and processes at the click of his fingers.  It is important that we allow him the space and time to arrive at the right decision.  I think he will do that, but he cannot do things automatically.  There is a report published and he has to take advice from the chief medical officer.  It is important that we do everything humanly possible to ensure that the quality of life of young Ava is improved, because what is happening to her is a tragedy.<\/p> <p>Senator Black raised the issue of the homeless people outside her office and Senator Davitt also raised the issue.  It is important to recognise that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has put together an action plan regarding housing and homelessness.  There is significant investment gone into it.  Rather than having a political debate, I believe it is important that we work with the different agencies to ensure that the people Senator Black referred to are housed or given accommodation.  If the Senator wants to e-mail me the details, we can talk to the office of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, regarding that particular case.<\/p> <p>Senator Byrne raised the issue of Irish Cement and fossil fuels.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Davitt raised the issue of mobile phones.  He is right.  There is a need for checks and balances in terms of how young people, minors in particular, can access and buy SIM cards.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House.<\/p> <p>Senator Norris raised the issue of Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service and the decision regarding the outsourcing of the ambulance call and dispatch function.  It is a matter of concern that has reached a point where SIPTU has balloted its members.  A forum was set up.  It is important for Dublin City Council to re-engage and reconvene that forum.  I know I am repeating myself, but it is through conversation and dialogue that we can reach solutions.  I appeal to Dublin City Council to reconvene that forum so we can reach a resolution in regard to the matter Senator Norris raised.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of the withdrawal of the telephone allowance.  I share his view.  I hope that a mechanism through the Department of Social Protection can be formed to allow for that to happen.  I also join Senator Gallagher in sympathising with the family of the late Mr. Paddy Lyons in Waterford who died over the weekend.  I know there is a man in custody with regard to his death and therefore I will not say anything further, other than to offer my sympathies to his family.<\/p> <p>Senator Butler raised the issue of the Tunisian attacks of 2015 and today's report by the coroner.  I will bring the Senator's remarks back to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade because the Senator is right.  It is important that the Irish Embassy engages on behalf of the Irish citizens and families who lost their lives.  If there has been any sort of shambolic or cowardly treatment by the police, it should be addressed immediately.<\/p> <p>I do not have a timetable for the alcohol Bill, but Senator Noone has raised a very pertinent point around the increase in the sale of alcohol, particularly around the use of spirits, which has increased considerably.  There is a worrying trend but I have not got a specific date regarding the public sale of alcohol Bill.<\/p> <p>I hope all Members of the House will join with Senator Burke and I in welcoming the further fall in the numbers of unemployed and the increase in the number of men and women who are back at work.  It is great to see that just 6.6% of people are now unemployed.  It has been of source of great joy to all of us that the policies of the last Government and this Government are seeing many of our citizens going back at work.<\/p> <p>Senator Burke is right in that the future planning of our health system around the issue of a changing demographic is something we should perhaps debate in the House.  I would be happy to have that debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#Y00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488292200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Committee on Justice and Equality Report: Motion","time":1488292200,"counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#Z00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That Seanad &Eacute;ireann: (1) notes the agreed Report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality under Standing Order 107 on the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventive restructuring frameworks, second chance and measures to increase the efficiency of restructuring, insolvency and discharge procedures and amending Directive 2012\/30\/EU - COM(2016)723 which was laid before Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 16 February 2017 in accordance with Standing Order 107(3)(<i>b<\/i>); <br \/><br \/>(2) having regard to the aforementioned Report, and in exercise of its functions under section 7(3) of the European Union Act 2009, is of the opinion that the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventive restructuring frameworks, second chance and measures to increase the efficiency of restructuring, insolvency and discharge procedures and amending Directive 2012\/30\/EU - COM(2016)723 do not comply with the principle of subsidiarity for the reasons set out in paragraph 3 of the Report, and<br \/><br \/>(3) notes that, pursuant to Standing Order 107(3)(<i>d<\/i>), a copy of this Resolution together with the reasoned opinion and the aforementioned Report shall be sent to the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#Z00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488292200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488292200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.30 p.m. and resumed at 4.45 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Third Report of Committee of Selection: Motion","time":1488292200,"counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#CC00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Third Report of the Committee of Selection be laid before the Seanad.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#CC00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488292200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Communications Regulation (Postal Services) (Amendment) Bill 2016: Second Stage","time":1488292200,"counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#CC00500"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488292200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#CC00700","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the Second Stage of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) (Amendment) Bill 2016 which was passed on 22 February by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I extend apologies on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, who unfortunately is unable to attend today.  The Bill is a relatively short legislative proposal, the purpose of which is to repeal section 30 of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011, which sets out the mechanism for regulating postal pricing within universal service using a price cap mechanism.<\/p> <p>The mails business is undergoing a profound structural change both here and internationally.  Electronic substitution has had a significant impact on the letters business while also providing opportunities for growth in parcels.  This development is particularly apparent in terms of large volume postal customers such as banks and utility providers.  The trend, which has been evident for some years, accelerated in 2016, with An Post recording a year-on-year doubling in volume decline, resulting in a serious financial impact for the company.<\/p> <p>In addition, the impact of a 2.5% Labour Court pay recommendation has added further pressure to an already delicate financial situation.  Each 1% decline in mail volume equates to a loss of revenue for An Post of &euro;4 million and a 1% increase in pay adds &euro;4.5 million to payroll.  The mails business still generates almost two thirds of An Post&rsquo;s revenue and represents 78% of company payroll.  That explains why the volume decline and Labour Court award has had such an impact on the company&rsquo;s financial base.<\/p> <p>Internationally, the mails and post office businesses are experiencing long-term structural challenges, so this is not just an issue facing An Post.  One of the main elements of the postal service here in Ireland is the daily delivery of post to every address in the State.  Government is extremely cognisant of the value placed on this service by communities in both rural and urban areas and recognises the importance of ensuring An Post has the capacity to continue to fulfil its obligations in this regard.<\/p> <p>It is clear that the company is entering a period of significant change to cope with the rapidly changing environment in which it operates.  In this regard, the company has started a fundamental review with a view to identifying the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to maintain the company on a sound financial footing.  The Government fully supports this review, the outcome of which is expected early in quarter 2 of 2017 and accepts that the company requires some financial headroom to be able to implement the findings of the review while continuing to deliver on its universal service obligations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Consequently, the Government has agreed to introduce this Bill as a matter of priority to repeal the price cap mechanism.  This is the most viable option to support An Post in the short term while a restructuring plan is being implemented.  This decision was not taken lightly.  NewERA has conducted an in-depth review of the company in recent months on behalf of the shareholding Ministers and has confirmed the seriousness of the situation the company is facing.  The Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, has met the chairman and CEO of An Post, officials from ComReg and representatives of the Communication Workers Union to discuss the issue in detail.  Having considered all matters, the Minister acted swiftly in taking appropriate action.<\/p><p>The impact of the legislation will involve a substantial increase in stamp prices.  Stamp prices in Ireland are currently well below the European average.  It is expected that the proposed increases will bring the price in line with European norms.  As we are cognisant of the impact this measure might have on consumers and on the SME sector, we have provided in the Bill that ComReg will undertake a review of the consequences of the repeal of the price cap mechanism after a two-year period.  ComReg will report to the Minister on its findings within six months.  The Bill also enables ComReg to undertake such consultation as it considers appropriate in carrying out this review.<\/p><p>The Minister has issued a policy direction to An Post instructing it that price increases introduced following the repeal of the price cap mechanism must be subject to prior consultation with ComReg and must have due regard to the tariff principles set out in section 28 of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011.  These principles set out a number of requirements which must be complied with in the provision of a universal postal service.  For example, prices must be affordable and must enable all users to avail of the services provided, prices must be cost-oriented and tariffs must be transparent and non-discriminatory.  Under the 2011 Act, ComReg has a role in ensuring compliance with the tariff principles outlined in section 28.<\/p><p>An Post has been instructed to give due consideration to the impact any increase will have on personal customers and on the SME sector.  It is important to remember that An Post provides a high-quality mail service to Irish businesses and personal customers across the country.  The mail network undertakes the delivery of 2.5 million mail items to 2.1 million homes and businesses every working day and consists of 7,620 collection, processing and delivery staff, 160 local delivery units and four national mail centres.  The company has a number of strengths, including its brand and nationwide reach.  The post office network implementation group, chaired by Mr. Bobby Kerr, was established on foot of the publication of the final report of the post office network business development group.  The implementation group worked throughout 2016 to arrive at a suite of recommendations to support the future sustainability of the post office network.  These recommendations are with An Post for its consideration.  It is expected that they will be considered in the context of the strategic review of the company.<\/p><p>An Post is a significant employer with over 9,000 staff.  Its payroll costs amount to &euro;40 million per month.  This includes payments to the postmasters who run the bulk of the post office network.  I want to make it clear that despite An Post's difficult financial situation, there is no threat to the delivery of mail or to the universal service obligation.  An Post will continue to deliver post to every address every working day, in line with the EU requirement.  The amended approach to pricing being facilitated in this legislation aims to ensure An Post can continue to fulfil this obligation.<\/p><p>I will outline the main provisions of the Bill.  For the convenience of the House, a detailed explanatory memorandum has been published to provide a synopsis of the provisions.  The Bill is relatively short and consists of three sections.  Section 1 provides for the repeal of section 30 of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011, which provides for the price cap mechanism.  The section also provides that any price cap decision within the meaning of section 30 will cease to have effect.<\/p><p>Section 2 provides for an amendment to section 10 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 to enable ComReg to carry out a review of the consequences of the repeal of the price cap mechanism in section 30 of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011.  The functions of ComReg, as set out in section 10 of the 2002 Act, as amended, are being amended in this Bill to enable it to undertake this review.  This review will commence two years after the coming into operation of this legislation.  ComReg will report to the Minister on its findings within six months of the commencement of the review.  The Minister will lay the report prepared by ComReg before each of the House of the Oireachtas as soon as practicable.  In addition, provision is made to enable ComReg to undertake such consultation as it considers appropriate in carrying out the review.  Following an amendment on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, this Bill now provides that this consultation will be completed by ComReg within 42 days.<\/p><p>Section 3 contains general provisions relating to the Short Title, commencement, collective citation and construction.<\/p><p>Given the seriousness of the challenges facing An Post, it is considered prudent to have this legislation in place as soon as possible to allow An Post pricing freedom at the earliest opportunity.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As it stands, An Post must give notice of its intention to increase prices so even after the commencement of the legislation, there will be a delay before a price increase can take effect.  I look forward to hearing the views of the House on the Bill, a constructive Committee Stage debate and Senators' valuable assistance in facilitating its early passage into law.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#CC00800","speaker":"1314","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Senator Gerry Horkan has eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#EE00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Kyne, for being present for this important debate.  I too am substituting on behalf of my Seanad colleague, Senator Leyden, who is at a British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly meeting in London.<\/p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) (Amendment) Bill 2016.  The Fianna Fail Party supports this Bill as a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of An Post.  However, the long-term future of our postal services needs a much broader range of measures to keep an active post office network alive and well across the country.  The system is under serious financial pressure and requires fresh thinking, not just simple price increases.<\/p> <p>It has now been eight months since the formation of this Government, with little movement by Government on outlining a plan to safeguard the future of the post office network.  Currently, Government responsibility for post offices and its future network renewal resides between two Departments and three different Ministers.  The Government received Bobby Kerr's report almost a year ago which outlined a number of practical solutions to address the problems in An Post but it has yet to take any action.  This is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>The Government must put a new emphasis on defending services in Ireland, particularly rural Ireland, and must stop neglecting ideas that are being put forward.  Securing the role of post offices as community hubs is a vital component of that.  This Bill seeks to remove the price cap that is currently placed on stamps in response to the financial difficulties An Post has been experiencing.  The Bill also accords responsibility to ComReg to review the effects of repealing a price cap, a review which must be commenced two years after the enactment of the legislation and which must be concluded within six months of its start date.<\/p> <p>A standard stamp in Ireland costs 72 cent and is 21 cent cheaper than the EU average.  Bringing the price of the stamp more closely into line with the EU average will help An Post to regain financial sustainability and to continue to serve its customers, but inevitably volumes will fall.  At the same time, making the mail delivery component of An Post more profitable will not save the entire network.  Mail delivery represents an increasingly small portion of An Post's overall business, something which will likely be accelerated by an increase in price.<\/p> <p>We need to seriously consider other options to diversify An Post's business model and to ensure the long-term sustainability of the network.  Fianna Fail believes the post office network in Ireland is more than simple buildings supporting a commercial enterprise.  Post offices are an important strategic asset, which play an invaluable role as the centre point of community and commercial activity in urban and rural Ireland.  These offices provide key State services and often reduce social isolation.<\/p> <p>As one of the most trusted brands in Ireland, An Post has the potential to increase the commercial success and business activity of the post office to a greater level.  The Fianna Fail Party has repeatedly fought to defend the network against Fine Gael's past inaction and incompetence.  We therefore put forward the following proposal to consolidate the post office network and increase commercial activity in every post office unit.  The network needs to be guaranteed as it currently exists.  We need to allow post offices to become the centre for many different State payments and charges, including motor tax and banking services.  We did have a post bank offering before which did not work out, but this needs to be looked at again in the context of the different banking environment we have now, which is very different from the environment that Postbank was operating in at that time.<\/p> <p>Equally there are many fines that could be dealt with via the post office as opposed to by the courts or the local authorities.  I know the local authority on which I served moved the rental payments from the council offices and ceased to have a cash office and got people to make the payment through the post office.  Our local authority is doing its bit to help the post office network.  There was a situation where my former local authority would have to pay &euro;150 to do a secure cash delivery and would have only picked up &euro;30 to &euro;40.  The post office offers a major retail network and it is important to harness it where possible.<\/p> <p>We can create shared community services and a multipurpose space in rural post offices, and also provide Internet and print facilities at those offices, particularly where appropriate and where volumes are currently very low.  We should extend the Department of Social Protection contract.  It is very worrying, particularly for rural communities, that the Department of Social Protection previously encouraged people to receive welfare payments directly through their bank account rather than by collection at the post office, taking crucial transactions away from post offices.  It is inevitable that cash payments will reduce over time and electronic payments will increase, but perhaps there is an opportunity for people to go to their post office as a signing in facility and that the post office is there to verify their identity and to ensure persons are still in the country and are still available for work and seeking work.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Even if the cash is moved electronically rather than being transported to post offices and then given to people who are spending it in the shop and bringing it back to the post office, the post office could be harnessed to do some of the work it is currently doing for cash payments.  We have been campaigning for the past two years for the Department of Social Protection to immediately stop issuing letters about moving to electronic payments.  In July 2016, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, relented and performed a U-turn by directing his Department to cease instructing welfare recipients to transfer their payments from the post office to banks.  The Government has failed to secure the long-term future of An Post's agreement with the Department of Social Protection and has placed it on a yearly basis.  The Government has failed to commit to protecting the existing postal network despite announcing a whole-of-Government approach to the development of An Post before the European and local elections in 2014.  Concrete actions are needed as opposed to PR and spin.  In supporting this Bill, Fianna F&aacute;il recognises the positive impact it can have on An Post, the post office network and those who are employed in the provision of the service.  However, it is in no way an acceptance that it is a solution to An Post's problems.  We will continue to hold the Government to account on this issue and to put forward innovative policies on revitalising the network.  <\/p><p>It is important to outline the scale of An Post's operations.  It has 1,130 offices employing 3,700 people; 51 are owned by An Post and the remainder are independently contracted to An Post.  They are often co-located with other retail units where it is of benefit to the shop to be with the post office and to the post office to be with the shop.  According to An Post, 99% of addresses in the country are within 10 km of a post office and 93% are within 5 km of a post office.  At the finance committee, of which I am a member, we regularly lament that the banks are closing down and pulling out and consequently, the post office is an even more vital part of communities than it was before.  It handles around 120 million transactions but mail volumes have declined by 38% since their peak in 2007.  We will see that again.  My bank, UPC, Vodafone and so on are all asking people to go electronic.  As mail volumes will fall we must, as a nation and a Government, ensure the future of An Post by refreshing it, giving it new, additional services and promoting efficiencies across all Departments of the State.  There should be a whole-of-Government approach to An Post.  <\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State and look forward to hearing his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#EE00300","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and this debate.  I support the measures in the Bill.  It is a short-term, emergency measure that will not solve the problems of the post offices but at least it will stave off major solvency issues in the short term.  This needs to be just a start.  The Minister of State referred to reviews.  There have been major reviews.  In the last D&aacute;il, I was Chairman of the communications committee.  We produced a report making suggestions on what needed to be done with post offices but the time for reports is at an end and the time for action is now.  This measure has to be implemented and I am glad there is consensus on the approach to it as an emergency measure.<\/p> <p>Senator Horkan mentioned motor tax and all of those things.  Some of those measures need to be implemented once and for all.  We have banks closing down in areas and a post office network that is underutilised.  We need to overcome the obstacles to putting more services into the post offices.  When rural Ireland is under pressure, successive Governments are blamed.  That is the nature of it.  I could come in here and argue that fewer post offices closed during the term of the last Government than the one previous to it but at the end of the day, we all seek a solution.  Lifestyles have changed and it is important to make it appeal to the public.  We have all stood in halls where there was an opposition to a post office closing down.  There would often be 400 or 500 people in it but if half of them supported their local post office, we would never have had to go to that hall.  People do not shop as locally as much as they used to.  I am not blaming the public but the solution is multidimensional.  I am not absolving this, the previous or any Government.  We need to put more services into the post offices.  Banking services and so on need to be fast-tracked because at the end of the day, the sums do not add up.  While the volume of mail is declining as a result of e-mail, I note e-mail is nearly out of fashion now because there are so many other forms of communication.  That is moving apace and life is moving apace.  Everyone is catching up with it so we need action.  We will only realise the need for post offices if they disappear.  I welcome that this will not be allowed to happen but we need to see action on it as soon as possible.  We need to look at the strengths of the postal services.  There is a postal service every working day in every part of Ireland and it is important to maintain that.  <\/p> <p>Another thing that has affected rural Ireland is people shopping online instead of locally.  That can be an advantage for post office parcel services.  There is a niche there and it has increased hugely.  A number of years ago it was almost being discouraged by An Post.  Now it sees how it is growing and sees the need to latch onto it.  There is more potential for growth in the post office for parcel services.  I have spoken to postmen and women and they emphasise that the volume of parcel post has multiplied.  That needs to be explored even further.  Whatever measure is needed, whether it is through Government or public support, it needs to be done quickly.  In the short term, this measure will help to keep the show on the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#FF00200","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the role the post office has played thus far in the life of rural Ireland.  It is not acknowledged enough how absolutely vital it is in certain areas.  Sinn F&eacute;in recognises this but also sees an enhanced role for the post office network far into the future.  In our document, A New Deal for the West, we put the local post office at the heart of our plans for communities.  We want to see a range of services provided at post offices.  They should be given the ability to sell insurance, process motor tax, offer single payment accounts, provide banking services and process the payment of bills to local authorities.  They are positive moves that Sinn F&eacute;in supports.  Years ago, when I lived in London, they were things that were automatically done through the post offices.  When I hear that emergency legislation is needed, I think successive Governments have been asleep at the wheel.  We should never need emergency legislation on this.  It is a crazy idea.  We know people's tastes and we know the trends and what people need.  As someone who lives in rural Ireland, emergency legislation to ensure the survival of post offices is crazy.  We support most of the recommendations of the Kerr report and want them to be implemented speedily.<\/p> <p>The main thrust of the Bill involves removing the cap on a price increase to postal services currently set out by the communications regulator.  We accept the need for an increase but believe the removal of the cap will lead to uncertainty and remove a vital check on any potential increases.  In its submission to the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, ComReg stated it was very worried about the liquidity position of An Post.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It has gone from having a cash balance of &euro;350 million in 2008 to having just under &euro;40 million at present.  While ComReg was at pains to stress its independence regarding whether to support the legislation, the figure mentioned points to serious financial problems at An Post.  It seems the Government is intent on allowing prices for postal services to greatly increase rather than investing in the network.<\/p><p>I am concerned that removing the price cap and significantly increasing the price of postage before the development of an enhanced An Post service will jeopardise the viability of the company further.  By lifting the cap on postal pricing, we are told it is expected that the increase in the cost will be in the range of 12% to 38%.  It is certain that an increase at the higher end of the scale will dissuade people from using the postal service.<\/p><p>Putting our post offices in danger means that older people, especially in rural areas, will be forced to rely on the kindness of family and friends or on the public transport system to access services in other areas once their local post offices have closed.  Given the many difficulties affecting the public transport system, this creates even more concern for people who rely on their local post offices to access services.  Put simply, Sinn F&eacute;in would prevent any further closures or downgrading of the network by negotiating a comprehensive review of derogations from the postal services directive to increase minimum standards of universal provision and also to increase obligations to communities regarding, for example, accessibility and protection of branches from closure.<\/p><p>There is a problem with just repealing section 30 of the 2011 Act and removing the cap ComReg can currently impose.  ComReg can set a range, currently from 60 cent to 75 cent.  Removing this power is a negative move.  We believe there should be freedom to increase charges but ComReg needs to play a role.  The Bill removes ComReg's role, which is counterproductive and will push more customers away.  This is particularly the case given the price increase that has been mentioned.  The Bill does not simply raise the price cap but gets rid of it completely.<\/p><p>The general secretary of the Irish Postmasters Union has expressed concern that the price increase will reduce the volume of business and threaten postal services.  Justin Moran of Age Action addressed a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment in January and stressed that the big increases will affect older people most.  They could be doubly hit, not only by the increase in the cost of the postal services but also by the removal and closure of local post offices.  Mr. Moran argued that the increase will have a disproportionate affect on older people because they are more likely to use postal services.  It noted that only 3% of those aged over 75 years used electronic mail.  The repeal of the pricing cap also represents a weakening of the power of the regulator.  ComReg's role will become one of a spectator or commentator at best.  Uncontrolled price increases may bring a temporary solution to the financial problems of An Post, but these will only get worse if customers are lost and the company finds it hard to maintain its existing post office network.  If ComReg is removed from the process, I fear that any increases will become uncontrolled and unsustainable.<\/p><p>The postal service industry in Ireland had a turnover in 2015 of approximately &euro;540 million.  An Post's losses in the same year amounted to &euro;25 million, the bulk of which, as we learned yesterday, can be attributed to international mail delivery and the registered mail service.  An Post receives only 44 cent per standard letter item for international mail.  Domestically, however, postal services are almost breaking even.<\/p><p>The consulting group, McKinsey, has been hired to conduct a strategic review and advise An Post on the future of the business.  It is surely premature, therefore, to implement price hikes.  While Sinn F&eacute;in accepts it is necessary to take action, it is wrong to remove the role of the regulator and its ability to impose a cap on prices before the McKinsey report has been published.  I understand the report is due in April or early May.<\/p><p>Although An Post and the broader postal service network in Ireland are separate entities, they cannot be viewed in isolation from one another.  The post office network must be considered in any examination of postal services.  The financial health of the postal network and the well-being of the corporate structure of An Post are related.  On many occasions we have asked the Department of Social Protection to stop sending letters to people encouraging them to manage their social protection payments through banks rather than post offices.  It is vital that this function remains.<\/p><p>The recent pilot scheme between post offices and credit unions was deemed a success in terms of joint loans and payments made to either institution at branches of both.  There is no reason this trial run could not have been extended to 1,130 branches across the State.  The local post office is an essential component of the cluster of businesses needed in any small town or village.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Bill is not to permit price increases but to sideline the Commission for Communications Regulation.  We complain a great deal about the inactivity of regulators.  This legislation sidelines and removes a regulator from the pitch, which will result in ComReg becoming a spectator or, at best, a commentator.  We believe this is the wrong approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#FF00300","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am conscious that we are discussing the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) (Amendment) Bill 2016.  I take the opportunity to share some of my concerns.  I recently met representatives of the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU.  We can talk at great length of our own experiences and our own views of post offices, but we must recognise that they are a national social asset.  They are also a very important community hub.  An Post has an opportunity to expand its service offering.  It has an amazing network.  It is the biggest single retail network across the country which presents great opportunities.<\/p> <p>It is clear that there are issues, particularly at a time when the Government has made a big pitch on balanced urban-rural regional development across the country.  There are particular issues for rural communities with small post offices.  However, many post offices are also facing closure in suburbs of Dublin.  These are in places where there is no public transport, many elderly people and many people who wish to avail of the services.  That is an important point.  We do not seem to have a definitive policy on where the future for An Post lies.  Where is the future for this small but very important hub in the heart of urban and rural communities?  As I have said, they represent the largest network of retail units in the country.<\/p> <p>I want to focus on six points the Irish Postmasters' Union raised with me.  It wants the Government to recognise the post office network as a national asset and to ensure its future by making it the provider of choice and the front office for all Government services such as motor tax, hospital charges, local property taxes and perhaps other taxes and charges.  How can it be used as a community hub offering more services?  There is a possibility of MABS information, local outreach Garda clinics, citizens information, etc.  How can we tie in all of these with the established hubs of post offices?  The need to recognise the post office network as a national asset is important and must be taken on board.<\/p> <p>The IPU wants to secure the role of post offices in delivering Department of Social Protection payments, either by means of cash or direct electronic payment, and maintaining the existing rates.  That can be developed and expanded within the post office role.  The IPU believes there is potential to grow that area.  It wishes to provide funding for a standard bank account through the post office network to ensure financial inclusion for all.  The potential for that growth is important.  It also wishes to quantify the social role which post offices provide.  I do not believe the importance of that has been quantified and teased out.  The IPU refers to the onus on the State to provide equality for citizens under Article 45 of the Constitution.  We need to provide services equally to all people in the nation.  There are some grounds there and the Minister of State might like to look at that.<\/p> <p>The union wants the Government to instruct An Post to immediately cease any action, over the \"post and pay\" pilot project, which could be construed as establishing an alternative network.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The IPU has concerns about the damage alternative networks may do to the post office.<\/p><p>I will conclude because those are the six key points the members of the IPU wish to have addressed.  They seek a comprehensive commercial review of the network to be carried out to ensure its viability for the foreseeable future.  That does not mean coming up with suggestions that it is not viable, but to come up with an imaginative plan for the future of the post office and the service it offers its community, and particularly rural people.  I will not discuss transport or telephone services at length.  Earlier a Member spoke about the cuts in telephone services for rural communities.  There is a range of cuts and people in isolated, rural communities are suffering.  There is a real need for a strategic plan that recognises the important community asset the local post office is and the important contact it provides.  It must be supported.  A strategic policy is required on how to secure and retain post offices throughout the country, be they in urban or rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#GG00200","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and compliment him on his presentation on this important issue.  Basically, we are seeking to pass legislation that will hopefully ensure the postal service will be viable into the future and particularly in the short term.  A further body of work is required to ensure the postal service can progress in the long term.<\/p> <p>The postal service is at a crossroads.  There have been dramatic changes in volume and in how the public, not only in Ireland but also throughout the world, communicates.  Electronic mail has become the main form of communication for many industries across the world and that will affect how we will promote our postal service.  We must examine international models in that regard.  The pricing structure An Post has at present is at the lower end of international pricing levels.  It is a key issue we must examine.  It is not popular to say this but we must look at the current pricing structure.  We have debated this issue in the communications committee.  All of the main players appeared before the committee, which was very helpful, and we teased out many of the key issues that are important for this project.  I believe the two-year review is important because we can examine where the pricing structures will be two years hence.  However, the long-term issue is the Bobby Kerr report and how we can promote the postal service and the network of post offices around Ireland.<\/p> <p>For years we have had the problem of post offices closing.  Now the issue is that postmasters do not wish to take up the opportunity of operating a post office in a village because they do not think it is viable.  We have come full circle, so there must be a review of how the service will be promoted into the future.  The postal service has lost services it could have provided, such as the driver licence service.  We should have considered that for the post office setting, given that it had the services and infrastructure required.  Unfortunately, it did not work out when it came to the tendering.  If we had services such as that linked to the postal service it would promote the service in the future.<\/p> <p>However, this is a crossroads and the legislation must be supported.  It was supported in the D&aacute;il by all parties aside from one amendment that was supported by the Government.  It is important to pass this legislation as soon as possible so we can steady the ship for the future.  If we pass the legislation through all Stages by next week it will go a long way towards putting the postal service on a good footing in the short term.  However, the long-term issue must be debated.  In fairness to the Minister of State, he is very much aware of that and I am sure he and the Minister, Deputy Naughten, will come forward with the longer-term plan that is required to ensure the postal service is saved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#HH00200","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their contributions to the debate.  Undoubtedly, An Post is entering a period of significant change in order to cope with the rapidly changing environment in which it operates.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Horkan for voicing Fianna F&aacute;il's support for the Bill.  I understand and accept his view on the importance of An Post as a rural service, that the An Post business model is a strategic asset and that we should harness its resources where possible.  An Post has commissioned McKinsey &amp;amp; Company to undertake a fundamental review of An Post and its operations with a view to identifying the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to maintain the company on a sound financial footing.  The timeline for delivery of that report is the second quarter of this year.  This is a separate exercise to the Bobby Kerr report but the findings of both reports will inform the future strategic direction of the company.  There is no doubt that An Post will undergo significant and necessary change in the future and in this regard the Government looks forward to being briefed on the McKinsey &amp;amp; Company review.  Many of the issues the Senator raised will be dealt with in the context of the implementation of both reports.<\/p> <p>Senators O'Mahony and Boyhan also addressed the issues for the future.  Obviously, the McKinsey &amp;amp; Company and Kerr reports will deal with these.  The final Kerr report was presented to An Post on 23 December last.  It contains a number of recommendations which are being considered by the board of An Post, and the Government looks forward to details of any implementation plan that arises from that.  It would not be appropriate to comment further on these matters until both reports have been fully completed and considered.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh spoke about the impact of the price increase.  Obviously, there is concern that the legislation will have the effect of accelerating the decline in volume.  An Post engaged Indecon Economic Consultants to examine this question and the findings indicate that price increases will not necessarily escalate electronic substitution.  The findings of that work will inform An Post's consideration of the appropriate level at which to set a revised pricing structure.  The chief executive officer has indicated that the price increase will be in the range of 12% to 38%.  Such an increase will bring the price in line with European norms.  The Senator also said that the purpose of the Bill was to get rid of ComReg.  Its purpose is to respond to the dire financial situation of An Post.  It is a serious financial position and that is the reason we are here.  Clearly, the company will undergo significant restructuring.  Such restructuring takes time and this legislation will give the company the financial headroom to restructure while awaiting the implementation of the Kerr and McKinsey &amp;amp; Company reports.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the role of post offices in rural Ireland and their importance for older people in particular.  We wish to prevent any more closures in so far as we can.  That is in everybody's interest.  Senator O'Mahony also spoke about the history of post office closures over a long number of years.  He pointed out that this is an emergency short-term measure.  Clearly, there is potential with regard to the parcel service and also through the implementation of the Kerr and McKinsey &amp;amp; Company reports.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan spoke about the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment having responsibility for the postal sector.  That includes the governance of An Post and ensuring that the company is fully compliant with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and governance functions, including in the statutory framework underpinning An Post.  Following a Government decision early last year, responsibility for the post office network and implementation of the Kerr report and associated matters transferred to colleagues in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The Senator met with representatives of the IPU.  They have been engaging with officials in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on the matters raised.  The outcome is that the McKinsey &amp;amp; Company and Kerr reports will have to be implemented together.<\/p> <p>Senator Lombard spoke about the pricing structure and the comparison with the EU.  We are below average is respect of the cost of postage stamps.  The Senator also mentioned that the main players had appeared before the communications committee and expressed their concerns, including the importance of the service for rural communities and elderly people.  There are some issues with viability in some rural communities, but this emergency legislation is necessary.<\/p> <p>As I said earlier, the mails business is undergoing profound structural change, both here and internationally.  Electronic substitution has had a significant impact on the letters business while also providing opportunities for growth in the parcels business.  This trend is particularly apparent for large volume postal customers, such as banks and utilities providers.  The trend has been evident for some years and it accelerated in 2016, resulting in An Post facing serious financial difficulties.  The outcome for 2016 represents a doubling of year on year volume declines.  As the mails business generates approximately two thirds of An Post's revenue the scale of decline is having a significant impact on the company's finances.  In addition, the impact of the 2.5% Labour Court pay recommendation to An Post staff added &euro;8.5 million to the payroll in 2016.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->An Post has started a fundamental review with a view to identifying the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to maintain the company on a sound financial footing.  The Government fully supports this review, the outcome of which is expected early in the second quarter of this year, and accepts that the company requires some financial headroom to be able to implement the findings of the review while continuing to deliver on its universal service obligations.<\/p><p>The Government has agreed to introduce this Bill as a matter of priority to repeal the price cap mechanism.  This is the most viable option for supporting An Post in the short term while a restructuring plan is implemented.  This is not a decision that was taken lightly.  NewERA has conducted an in-depth review of the company in recent months on behalf of the shareholding Ministers and has confirmed the seriousness of the situation facing An Post.  We all agree that An Post still has a number of strengths, including a strong brand and nationwide reach.  Any restructuring plan will build on these strengths and position the company for the rapid changes in its external environment.  Clearly it will take time to restructure and turn the company around and that is why it is imperative that this legislation is passed quickly in order to give the company the financial headroom to do this.  The consequences of not introducing this legislation cannot be underestimated.<\/p><p>It is important to point out that despite the difficult financial situation, there is no threat to the mail delivery element of the universal service obligation of An Post.  The company will continue to deliver post to every address on every working day.
