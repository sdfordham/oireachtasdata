This is a legacy issue from the Troubles.  It relates to the scrutiny of an independent inquiry into victims of and deaths that occurred during the Troubles.  It relates to at least 1,000 victims of the Troubles in the North and their families who are seeking justice in the form of an independent inquiry into the deaths.  There are many victims, both living and dead, who have suffered as a result of the Troubles in the North of Ireland.  Organisations such as the Pat Finucane Centre have done Trojan work in seeking justice.  To date, despite the best efforts of the parties in the North prior to the dissolution of the Stormont Executive, it has not happened.  A roadmap was paved through the Stormont House Agreement in 2014, which would have effectively set up an independent evaluation, conducting effective and prompt or reasonably prompt investigations to give justice to the families who lost loved ones.  One of those who lost his wife is a constituent in Donegal, Mr. Max Mogollon, who is here in the Visitors Gallery today.  He lost his wife in the 1990s as a result of security forces' collusion at the time.  While that has since been proven, the substantial facts surrounding the case have never been independently, objectively evaluated, which is wrong.  The British Government has an opportunity to accept the recommendation made by the Stormont Executive in December 2014.  If it did that, it would allow for the roadmap of justice and peace to prevail and would ensure that the United Nations position on seeking human rights is upheld.  The United Nations has ruled against the British Conservative Government on this particular issue because it continues to block the independent evaluation on the grounds that it presents a risk to national security.  There are ways to mitigate any such risks.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I encourage the members of the Government, particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and also the Taoiseach, to engage with their British counterparts in order to raise these issues and put them firmly on the agenda.

There is an undercurrent right across the North - these families have all been affected - and it is blocking the peaceful road to progress that we all want to seen taken.  I do not know what will be the response from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I hope it will be a proactive one and one of engagement.  Ultimately, however, it is a matter for the British Government to deal with this particular issue and try to bring some form of solace, peace, justice and equality to the families who have lost loved ones.  This is not exclusively an issue for one side or the other, it affects both sides of the political divide in the North.  We are not just talking about the deaths of nationalists, there were killings involving people on both sides.

I am taking this Commencement debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, who is abroad and cannot be here.  I acknowledge the presence of Dr. Paul Monaghan, MP, and other representatives in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.<\/p><p>It has been 15 months since the signing of the Fresh Start Agreement, which was reached after ten weeks of intensive cross-party negotiations.  It is deeply regrettable that while considerable work has been undertaken and there have been productive discussions, the fact remains that in the time since there has been little visible progress in establishing the legacy institutions provided for under the Stormont House Agreement of 2014.  The Government shares the deep disappointment and frustration of victims and survivors of the Troubles from all communities who have had to wait far too long for access to truth and justice. In that regard, I acknowledge the presence of Mr. Max Mogollon and sympathise with him on his loss.<\/p><p>The Government remains strongly committed to the establishment of the architecture for dealing with the legacy of the past that is provided for in the Stormont House Agreement and this is reflected in the programme for Government.  This system provides a framework for dealing comprehensively with the legacy of the past in a way that can bring whatever healing is possible to those affected by the Troubles.  The legacy institutions agreed at Stormont House include the Historical Investigations Unit, HIU, an independent body tasked with investigating outstanding Troubles-related deaths.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has rightly highlighted the critical importance of the HIU as part of the comprehensive approach to dealing with the legacy of the past.  An effective and adequately resourced legacy inquest system is also an essential part of the system to provide for effective investigations into deaths during the Troubles.  The Government has been clear in its support for the proposals made by Lord Chief Justice Declan Morgan in this regard.<\/p><p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has remained intensively engaged since the time of the Fresh Start Agreement to seek and support a way forward to get the Stormont House legacy framework urgently established.  This has included an extensive programme of consultation on the part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with victims' groups from across the communities in Northern Ireland as well, as groups representing victims and survivors of the Troubles from this jurisdiction and Britain.  It is vitally important that the envisaged legacy institutions have the trust and confidence of the victims and survivors and their families.  Their support will, therefore, continue to be central to the Government's approach in this area.<\/p><p>In December 2016, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, directed that Ireland advocate at the Council of Europe on the urgent need for progress on legacy issues in Northern Ireland, focusing in particular on the establishment of the HIU and a properly resourced legacy inquest system.  These mechanisms would satisfy the outstanding judgment against the British government in the McKerr <i>v. <\/i>Others group of cases by ensuring that effective investigations and full compliance with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights finally takes place.  The Minister has also remained in regular and direct contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with the political parties there on legacy matters and has consistently underlined the obligations of the British Government in this area.<\/p><p>It is important to emphasise that both Governments remain committed to the establishment of the Stormont House legacy institutions as soon as possible and that they continue to work to achieve this outcome.  The Minister discussed legacy issues most recently with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at their meeting in Dublin on the 30 January.  There was agreement that the ongoing work by both Governments with the political parties to support the establishment of Stormont House institutions must continue and be intensified following the Assembly elections on Thursday with a view to getting the necessary agreement as soon as possible.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Government has and will continue strongly to urge the British Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and all interested parties to approach legacy issues with resolve, leadership and compromise in the period ahead in order that the few outstanding issues can be dealt with and the necessary legislation introduced and enacted in both jurisdictions to get the Stormont House Agreement legacy bodies finally established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#C00200","speaker":"1314","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>An bhfuil an Seanad&oacute;ir s&aacute;sta?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#D00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta leis an fh&iacute;rinne a r&aacute;.

I do not wish to in any way insult the Minister for Health who is doing an excellent job, as is the Minister of State in his own role.  The issues I bring to him today are issues which have national importance.<\/p> <p>It has come to my attention that everybody on a waiting list in University Hospital Waterford received a letter from the hospital informing them that their request to be removed from the waiting list had been accepted.  Even those who replied that they wished to remain on the waiting list received a second letter asking them if they wished to remain on the list.  The false cleansing of the waiting list has not only confused people, but also hides the true nature of waiting lists across all categories in Waterford.  We are all still reeling from the \"RTE Investigates\" programme on the waiting list crisis, and it is difficult to obtain accurate information.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

We all know that people get seriously ill and die in shorter time periods than this and, by the hospital's own admission, \"The clinical risk for the Urology Services is on the Corporate Risk register and is rated high risk\".<\/p><p>I welcome the announcement that University Hospital Waterford is to get a mobile catheterisation laboratory for cardiac patients and the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has had much to do with that, and he is to be complimented on that.  However, I regret the fact that it took extensive public and political lobbying to achieve this.  Citizens should not have to lobby to get essential health care.  <\/p><p>We are not short of money.  A total of &euro;900 million has gone into the health system this year alone but the system itself appears to be flawed beyond repair.  In fact, the 2016 Euro Health Consumer Index ranked Ireland as the country with the worst waiting times in a large-scale study of 35 countries.  As appalling as this statistic sounds, the fact that the quality and length of human life is at the centre of it makes it even worse.  I ask that a new system be put in place to ensure that waiting lists are compiled in an accurate, accountable and highly transparent manner.<\/p><p>I welcome the introduction of the new national inpatient, day case, planned procedure, IDPP, waiting list management protocol and I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, for the reactivation of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  However, I believe that it will take a very assertive and thorough root and branch overhaul of the HSE to ensure that this protocol and the NTPF will be effective.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for giving of his time to take this time on this matter and I welcome his response specifically on the waiting lists in Waterford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#D01000","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I join the Cathaoirleach in welcoming our friends from Estonia.

I offer my sympathy to Susan and his family.  I know Senator Craughwell will join me in paying tribute to the former Deputy Peter Mathews.  He was a very kind, gentle and friendly man and a very dedicated public servant.  I again offer our sympathies to the Mathews family.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Craughwell for raising this very important issue today.  The personal stories of the people waiting for treatment broadcast in the RTE documentary a few weeks ago were deeply moving and the experiences they described are absolutely inexcusable.  The NTPF published waiting list data provide an up-to-date and verified picture of patients actively waiting for a date for inpatient-day case treatment and outpatient appointments.  While there has been an evolution in the way the data are gathered and presented in a move towards greater access and transparency, only data on patients actively waiting have been consistently published.  <\/p> <p>Numbers on the pre-admit list were collected on a phased basis dependent on each hospital&rsquo;s ability to deliver the data.  Verifiable and consistent figures across hospitals for this list became available in 2012.  The NTPF started collecting planned procedures data at the end of 2013 and these became available in a consistent manner in 2014.  <\/p> <p>In the D&aacute;il, the Minister for Health clarified that the NTPF published waiting list data has consistently not included the pre-admit and planned procedures lists.  However, it is important to note that these lists have been and are widely circulated on a weekly basis to a broad range of stakeholders including hospitals, hospital groups, the Health Service Executive, HSE, and national clinical leads.  Two weeks ago, the Minister for Health committed to asking the NTPF to work towards the publication of the pre-admit and planned procedures waiting lists.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In this regard, the NTPF will review and advise me on the appropriate format for publication for these two different categories of patients.  In the meantime, I advise Senator Craughwell that as of 31 January, 16,521 patients were waiting for inpatient and day case treatment in the Ireland East hospital group, which covers most of the south east.  In addition, there were 3,980 patients on the pre-admit list and 2,925 on the planned procedures list for inpatient or day case treatment in that group.  The NTPF regularly reviews its processes to ensure best practice.  It has commenced a significant research project examining updated international best practice around publication models and methodologies.  The Government looks forward to this work being concluded and to any actions arising from its recommendations being taken.  Reducing waiting lists for the longest waiting patients is one of the Government&rsquo;s key priorities.  It is for this reason that &euro;20 million was allocated to the NTPF in budget 2017, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  The money is going into that investment.<\/p><p>In December 2016, the Minister for Health granted approval to the NTPF for a day case waiting list initiative with the aim of ensuring no patient will be waiting more than 18 months by 30 June 2017.  In excess of 2,000 day cases will be managed through this process and I have been advised that appointments under this initiative will be issued shortly. The HSE will also submit waiting list action plans for inpatient day case and outpatient waiting lists.  The focus of these plans should be to ensure no patient is waiting more than 15 months on either list by the end of October 2017.  The HSE has been requested to develop the inpatient day case waiting list action plan in conjunction with, and supported by, the NTPF's approach to the utilisation of the remaining &euro;10 million of 2017 funding for patient treatment.  These plans are being finalised and the Minister for Health expects to receive them imminently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#E00300","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>That was a very comprehensive reply.

It has now been made clear that it is a deductible expense but only as far back as 2013.  Those who paid the charge will only be able to submit claims as far back as 2013 because of Revenue's rule that one can only amend one's tax returns for the preceding four years.  In that context, I ask the Minister for Finance to make a special exception to allow people to amend their tax returns as far back as 2009 on the basis that the Revenue Commissioners issued very clear guidance in that year on the interpretation of the Taxes Consolidation Act to the effect that NPPR was not a deductible expense.  It now transpires that it can be treated as a deductible expense but only for the previous four years.  This could represent a huge saving, given that some people were paying up to 50% in income tax.  The Minister must examine this issue because it is very unfair to landowners.

However, this is not merely a pay dispute; it is also about the structural formation of Bus &Eacute;ireann and its financial difficulties.  In January 2016 the previous Government was aware that there was a deficit of &euro;20 million, which has since grown to &euro;30 million.  The Minister became aware of the problem when he took on the transport brief.  I call on the Government and the Minister, in particular, to deal with this issue and ensure the country will not be affected by a strike.  The Minister has been sitting on the fence and letting the dispute work its way out at the WRC, which is not acceptable.  He needs to get involved.

Even though allegations of rape and the abuse of Grace and 47 intellectually disabled children were widely known, she was left there for nearly 20 years.  I have three questions for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, to answer on behalf of the Government she represents.  Why was Grace abandoned by those who had a duty to ensure she received the care she desperately needed as a vulnerable human being and citizen of the State?  Who stopped the 2012 report by Conal Devine from being published until now?  Who stopped the 2015 report from being published?  We are told it was because criminal proceedings might take place, but who has been arrested?  How many files have been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions?<\/p><p>It is welcome that a commission of investigation will be set up in the coming weeks, but where is the accountability?  Like me, most people are sick and tired of cover-up after cover-up.  We are fed up with the protection of State institutions being sacrosanct.  There is a vulnerable young woman - there are many other vulnerable adults - at the centre of this scandal and we know that it is by no means an isolated case.  The <i>ad hoc<\/i>approach of State services, whether they are provided directly by the State or contracted out to other service providers, is an abomination.  I commend the young social worker who acted as a whistleblower in this case.  Her courage and the tenacity she showed in exposing the plight of Grace are laudable.

The mother has expressed her devastation after the HSE turned down her application for medicinal cannabis for her beautiful daughter.  She was left heartbroken when the HSE turned down her application for medicinal cannabis for Ava and now fears her daughter will die.  She has tried to get the Minister for Health to make medicinal cannabis available to her young daughter, Ava, who suffers from a very rare form of epilepsy.  The Minister has been informed that the condition can be alleviated by taking medicinal cannabis.  Ava's condition has improved in recent months after she started taking cannabis oil.  Ava has taken cannabis oil, which is legally sourced from a shop in Dublin, since last October.  Vera says that her daughter's life has been transformed since taking cannabis oil.  Ava has thrived and there has been a 90% drop in the number of seizures.  Little Ava can have up to 20 seizures a day, which is devastating.  I know because I have a family member who has seizures.  I can attest to the fact that it is heartbreaking. <\/p> <p>The Minister has told Vera that she cannot get the medication to help treat her daughter because it has not been prescribed by a paediatric brain specialist and no exception will be made.

We hear that all these people are being housed and about all that is being done for those on housing lists but the homelessness crisis is out of control.

He was a traditional old-style Roman Catholic but not in any narrow sense.  He was always very friendly to me.  I liked him and found him very helpful.  When I spoke some years ago at the beginning of the financial crisis, he contacted me and said I was the only one who was speaking out and that I was the only one who was right in the debate.  However, he noticed that there were no figures and asked why.  I said I had been absolutely hopeless at arithmetic at school and had not improved.  He supplied me with the figures and as a result in the Seanad I contradicted the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan.  His figures were completely wrong and the ones supplied to me by the late Peter Mathews in support of my arguments were correct to the last decimal point, which was an astonishing feat.  He was a most brilliant economist, as well as a thoroughly decent man.<\/p> <p>I also wish to raise, if it has not been raised already, the question of the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service.  It is quite shocking that the head of Dublin City Council, Owen Keeg---- I am not allowed to mention his name - has decided to take steps to replace the fire brigade ambulance service with a general fire brigade warning.  He wants to take the service to Tallaght, with a backup centre in Ballyshannon.  The Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service answers all 999 calls in Dublin, the rest of Leinster, as well as counties Cavan and Monaghan.  It deals, for example, with people who need an epinephrine injection.  We all remember the girl who tragically died because she could not get an epinephrine injection.  The service deals with people who have had a heart attack or suffer a cardiac arrest, road traffic accidents and so on.  If it is transferred to a national agency, there will definitely be delays.  SIPTU members in Dublin Fire Brigade have been balloted and 97% have voted for strike action if this goes through.  It is a really serious matter.  It involves the Dublin city manager interfering again in a most stupid way.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann should have an opportunity to discuss the matter.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to contact the responsible Minister on my behalf.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#S00800","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>It may be a little unfair to mention - it is obvious, even though the Senator did not mention his name-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#S00900","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Owen Keegan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#S01000","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>-----the Dublin city manager because he is not here to defend himself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#S01100","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I know; I stopped half way through his name.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#S01200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>The Senator still hit the point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#S01300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>He is an ass anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#S01400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>It is most inappropriate to say that.

A total of 47 young children and vulnerable adults were placed in the home in question.  They were not monitored even though what was going on was known.  We have had inquiry after inquiry.  When do we stop and say we have done something well?  Tusla is an underfunded HSE organisation.

She has just left Mitchelstown and we should form a welcome party for her in Leinster House.  Deputy McDonald and I met her and her family in Cork in January and she outlined the harrowing experience her young daughter is going through and how they are coping with it.  They have found something that works but there has been a long wait for legislation to legalise it.  The Leader said last week that he welcomed the legislation.  Could he ensure it is put through speedily?  Two neurologists are treating Ms Twomey's daughter, Ava, and they are willing to prescribe this if they are given training.  The training would take six hours and then they could become experts and be able to prescribe for Ava and other children and adults like her.  We need the legislation to be hurried through.

This has raised its head again in light of the tragic death of an elderly gentleman in County Waterford last weekend.  Elderly people, especially in rural Ireland, depend on the telephone and as a result of the withdrawal of the allowance in 2014, many were forced to take out their telephone lines.  This resulted at a time in a substantial reduction in the number of the elderly applying for a panic alarm system linked to a telephone service.  Unfortunately, because broadband provision is so poor in rural areas and because the mobile telephone service is also poor, it is not possible to use the panic alarm system unless there is a telephone line.

According to the coroner in London, not enough was done to protect people.

The first time I met Peter was in a professional capacity as a county councillor back in 2003.  He was, as many people have said, an absolute gentleman, a very nice person and a great man to meet and have a chat with.  One would often see him around Mount Merrion in particular, but also around Dublin South.  I pass on my sympathies to his wife, Susan, his four kids, James, John, David and Maria, his wider family, friends and a very wide circle of colleagues.  It is very sad.  I remember being at a road opening in Sandyford with Peter in the middle of June 2011 when the news broke of Brian Lenihan's very premature death.  It is very sad that both Brian Lenihan, who was also mentioned today in the House, and Peter died very young from cancer.<\/p> <p>I also want to raise the issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann, which has been covered by many people.  It is important that we remind ourselves that the Minister, Deputy Ross, is the 100% shareholder in Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the State.  If I owned 100% of a company or was shareholder of 100% of a company, I would want to know what was going on.  I would want to make sure the company and its workers and management were all getting on with their business in as effective a way as possible.  It is not acceptable at this stage, when we could be facing an all-out transport strike because there is risk of contagion, not only in Bus &Eacute;ireann, but onwards into Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus.  It is important that we remind ourselves that it is a State company and one that has been around a very long time, formerly in the guise of CIE.  It is 30 years old as Bus &Eacute;ireann.  For many years Expressway was profitable.  We all know there are many reasons it is not profitable at the moment.  It is not acceptable for the Minister to continue in this way.  The Minister for transport is also the Minister for tourism.  It does not reflect well if tourists coming into the country, who presumably want to go all over the country, which we want them to do, only experience a product near Dublin Airport or Shannon Airport.  They should be able to travel all over the country.

It is important to recognise today, as many Senators have raised it, that this is a woman, a person and a citizen of our State, and she is entitled to respect, dignity, care and protection.  I join all the Senators who have raised it today in the House, and I join the Taoiseach in his remarks in the other House, in saying that the way she was treated is a disgrace.  It is unacceptable in a modern, 21st century Ireland.  The very least, as the Taoiseach said, that this House and the other House can do is apologise to Grace and to her family for the way she was treated.  It is a matter for which the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, has responsibility, not the Minister, Deputy Zappone.<\/p> <p>The two HSE reports have been published.  It is important that we not just publish those reports and have an inquiry but also that we have accountability and responsibility.  I make the point again today in this House.  It is about time that responsibility and accountability are accepted and stood up for by those who are charged under the State with the care and protection of people within our society.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I agree completely with what Senator Devine said.  How many more times must we come into this House and lament and deplore the condition and the treatment of people like Grace?  It is time it stopped.  We thought we had drawn a line under these sagas in our society but this has been ongoing for 20 years.  We have come to recognise that this is not acceptable any longer.  There is a need for accountability and responsibility to be accepted and we should not have to come in here any more to discuss negligence and incompetence.  I have already put in a request for a debate in this regard to be held in the House next week and I waiting for the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to respond to me on that.<\/p><p>Senators Ardagh, Bacik, Byrne and Horkan raised the issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It is a matter of grave urgency and concern that there is an impending public transport strike.  I hope there will not be an all-out strike.  It is important there is engagement by everybody involved regarding this proposed strike.  There is a need for the talking to continue and for there to be a proper conversation around what is being asked for, what is being proposed and for how we can have a roadmap for the way forward to bring a resolution to this dispute.  The Workplace Relations Commission is still the way to go.  That requires all parties to this dispute to be involved.<\/p><p>I wish to put on record and it is important that people recognise that the subvention to the company has been increased to &euro;40 million; in terms of free travel, the public service obligation funding has been increased by 11% and Bus &Eacute;ireann has seen a 21% increase in its subvention.  The bottom line, however, which we cannot ignore at one level, is that there is a &euro;50,000 loss per day on the Expressway service.  However, the approach taken by Bus &Eacute;ireann yesterday in issuing a threat to cut public sector workers' pay straight away was the wrong one.  One cannot threaten people or engage in that type of activity in a public manner.  The way to reach a resolution to this dispute is by all sides sitting down, engaging and reaching a compromise and a solution to ensure that the travelling public will not be discommoded.  The Government is committed to a public service transport entity being continued.  It is important there is a continuation of the talks. <\/p><p>Senator McDowell raised the issue of Seanad reform.  I understand the delay in the progression of his Bill rests in the appointment of a chairperson of the implementation group.  I do not have a timetable for it or any further involvement in it.  I am not in any way acting as a barrier to its progression despite what he might think.  Therefore, I cannot give him an update on that.<\/p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue relating to mica.  Our colleague and friend, Senator Paudie Coffey, when he was Minister of State, set up an expert group on this matter.  My understanding is that the expert group met in Donegal recently.  I am told it is either finished or very close to finalising its report.  That report will be given to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and to the Minister of State, Deputy English, who was in Donegal recently.  They will be fully informed of the issues at hand, the report will be published and I am told an implementation plan will arise from it.  The work is ongoing.  There is no question of procrastination about this.  I very much look forward to that report being published and subsequent to that to our having a debate on this matter in the House.<\/p><p>Senators Black, Noone and Devine raised the issue of the treatment of Ava Twomey and of her mother, Vera's protest walk on which she set out today.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority report was published two weeks ago.  It provides for an access scheme in terms of the issue being discussed, that of a cannabis-based treatment relative to specific schemes.  This relates to certification and to a medical practitioner of some description being able to sign the relevant form.  The Minister for Health is committed to a compassionate access scheme.  He  met Vera Twomey last week.  Senator Colm Burke also met her and I advise Senator Devine that I spoke to her yesterday.  All of us are committed to finding a resolution to this issue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is about the treatment of a young child and a family.

This is the story of a young child.  If we are honest, if any of us had to endure and witness what Ms Vera Twomey and young Ava had to endure, we would all be sympathetic and would all want to see a resolution, which we do.  The Minister is committed to doing that but I believe it is important that we continue to have talks about the matter.  It is through conversation and dialogue that we can reach a compromise.  However, the Minister cannot just abandon protocol and processes at the click of his fingers.  It is important that we allow him the space and time to arrive at the right decision.  I think he will do that, but he cannot do things automatically.  There is a report published and he has to take advice from the chief medical officer.  It is important that we do everything humanly possible to ensure that the quality of life of young Ava is improved, because what is happening to her is a tragedy.<\/p> <p>Senator Black raised the issue of the homeless people outside her office and Senator Davitt also raised the issue.  It is important to recognise that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has put together an action plan regarding housing and homelessness.  There is significant investment gone into it.  Rather than having a political debate, I believe it is important that we work with the different agencies to ensure that the people Senator Black referred to are housed or given accommodation.  If the Senator wants to e-mail me the details, we can talk to the office of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, regarding that particular case.<\/p> <p>Senator Byrne raised the issue of Irish Cement and fossil fuels.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Davitt raised the issue of mobile phones.  He is right.  There is a need for checks and balances in terms of how young people, minors in particular, can access and buy SIM cards.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House.<\/p> <p>Senator Norris raised the issue of Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service and the decision regarding the outsourcing of the ambulance call and dispatch function.  It is a matter of concern that has reached a point where SIPTU has balloted its members.  A forum was set up.  It is important for Dublin City Council to re-engage and reconvene that forum.  I know I am repeating myself, but it is through conversation and dialogue that we can reach solutions.  I appeal to Dublin City Council to reconvene that forum so we can reach a resolution in regard to the matter Senator Norris raised.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of the withdrawal of the telephone allowance.  I share his view.  I hope that a mechanism through the Department of Social Protection can be formed to allow for that to happen.  I also join Senator Gallagher in sympathising with the family of the late Mr. Paddy Lyons in Waterford who died over the weekend.  I know there is a man in custody with regard to his death and therefore I will not say anything further, other than to offer my sympathies to his family.<\/p> <p>Senator Butler raised the issue of the Tunisian attacks of 2015 and today's report by the coroner.  I will bring the Senator's remarks back to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade because the Senator is right.  It is important that the Irish Embassy engages on behalf of the Irish citizens and families who lost their lives.  If there has been any sort of shambolic or cowardly treatment by the police, it should be addressed immediately.<\/p> <p>I do not have a timetable for the alcohol Bill, but Senator Noone has raised a very pertinent point around the increase in the sale of alcohol, particularly around the use of spirits, which has increased considerably.  There is a worrying trend but I have not got a specific date regarding the public sale of alcohol Bill.<\/p> <p>I hope all Members of the House will join with Senator Burke and I in welcoming the further fall in the numbers of unemployed and the increase in the number of men and women who are back at work.  It is great to see that just 6.6% of people are now unemployed.  It has been of source of great joy to all of us that the policies of the last Government and this Government are seeing many of our citizens going back at work.<\/p> <p>Senator Burke is right in that the future planning of our health system around the issue of a changing demographic is something we should perhaps debate in the House.  I would be happy to have that debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#Y00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488292200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Committee on Justice and Equality Report: Motion","time":1488292200,"counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#Z00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That Seanad &Eacute;ireann: (1) notes the agreed Report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality under Standing Order 107 on the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventive restructuring frameworks, second chance and measures to increase the efficiency of restructuring, insolvency and discharge procedures and amending Directive 2012\/30\/EU - COM(2016)723 which was laid before Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 16 February 2017 in accordance with Standing Order 107(3)(<i>b<\/i>); <br \/><br \/>(2) having regard to the aforementioned Report, and in exercise of its functions under section 7(3) of the European Union Act 2009, is of the opinion that the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventive restructuring frameworks, second chance and measures to increase the efficiency of restructuring, insolvency and discharge procedures and amending Directive 2012\/30\/EU - COM(2016)723 do not comply with the principle of subsidiarity for the reasons set out in paragraph 3 of the Report, and<br \/><br \/>(3) notes that, pursuant to Standing Order 107(3)(<i>d<\/i>), a copy of this Resolution together with the reasoned opinion and the aforementioned Report shall be sent to the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#Z00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488292200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488292200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.30 p.m. and resumed at 4.45 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Third Report of the Committee of Selection: Motion","time":1488292200,"counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#CC00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Third Report of the Committee of Selection be laid before the Seanad.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#CC00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488292200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Communications Regulation (Postal Services) (Amendment) Bill 2016: Second Stage","time":1488292200,"counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#CC00500"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488292200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#CC00700","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the Second Stage of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) (Amendment) Bill 2016 which was passed on 22 February by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I extend apologies on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, who unfortunately is unable to attend today.  The Bill is a relatively short legislative proposal, the purpose of which is to repeal section 30 of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011, which sets out the mechanism for regulating postal pricing within universal service using a price cap mechanism.<\/p> <p>The mails business is undergoing a profound structural change both here and internationally.  Electronic substitution has had a significant impact on the letters business while also providing opportunities for growth in parcels.  This development is particularly apparent in terms of large volume postal customers such as banks and utility providers.  The trend, which has been evident for some years, accelerated in 2016, with An Post recording a year-on-year doubling in volume decline, resulting in a serious financial impact for the company.<\/p> <p>In addition, the impact of a 2.5% Labour Court pay recommendation has added further pressure to an already delicate financial situation.  Each 1% decline in mail volume equates to a loss of revenue for An Post of &euro;4 million and a 1% increase in pay adds &euro;4.5 million to payroll.  The mails business still generates almost two thirds of An Post&rsquo;s revenue and represents 78% of company payroll.  That explains why the volume decline and Labour Court award has had such an impact on the company&rsquo;s financial base.<\/p> <p>Internationally, the mails and post office businesses are experiencing long-term structural challenges, so this is not just an issue facing An Post.  One of the main elements of the postal service here in Ireland is the daily delivery of post to every address in the State.  Government is extremely cognisant of the value placed on this service by communities in both rural and urban areas and recognises the importance of ensuring An Post has the capacity to continue to fulfil its obligations in this regard.<\/p> <p>It is clear that the company is entering a period of significant change to cope with the rapidly changing environment in which it operates.  In this regard, the company has started a fundamental review with a view to identifying the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to maintain the company on a sound financial footing.  The Government fully supports this review, the outcome of which is expected early in quarter 2 of 2017 and accepts that the company requires some financial headroom to be able to implement the findings of the review while continuing to deliver on its universal service obligations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Consequently, the Government has agreed to introduce this Bill as a matter of priority to repeal the price cap mechanism.  This is the most viable option to support An Post in the short term while a restructuring plan is being implemented.  This decision was not taken lightly.  NewERA has conducted an in-depth review of the company in recent months on behalf of the shareholding Ministers and has confirmed the seriousness of the situation the company is facing.  The Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, has met the chairman and CEO of An Post, officials from ComReg and representatives of the Communication Workers Union to discuss the issue in detail.  Having considered all matters, the Minister acted swiftly in taking appropriate action.<\/p><p>The impact of the legislation will involve a substantial increase in stamp prices.  Stamp prices in Ireland are currently well below the European average.  It is expected that the proposed increases will bring the price in line with European norms.  As we are cognisant of the impact this measure might have on consumers and on the SME sector, we have provided in the Bill that ComReg will undertake a review of the consequences of the repeal of the price cap mechanism after a two-year period.  ComReg will report to the Minister on its findings within six months.  The Bill also enables ComReg to undertake such consultation as it considers appropriate in carrying out this review.<\/p><p>The Minister has issued a policy direction to An Post instructing it that price increases introduced following the repeal of the price cap mechanism must be subject to prior consultation with ComReg and must have due regard to the tariff principles set out in section 28 of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011.  These principles set out a number of requirements which must be complied with in the provision of a universal postal service.  For example, prices must be affordable and must enable all users to avail of the services provided, prices must be cost-oriented and tariffs must be transparent and non-discriminatory.  Under the 2011 Act, ComReg has a role in ensuring compliance with the tariff principles outlined in section 28.<\/p><p>An Post has been instructed to give due consideration to the impact any increase will have on personal customers and on the SME sector.  It is important to remember that An Post provides a high-quality mail service to Irish businesses and personal customers across the country.  The mail network undertakes the delivery of 2.5 million mail items to 2.1 million homes and businesses every working day and consists of 7,620 collection, processing and delivery staff, 160 local delivery units and four national mail centres.  The company has a number of strengths, including its brand and nationwide reach.  The post office network implementation group, chaired by Mr. Bobby Kerr, was established on foot of the publication of the final report of the post office network business development group.  The implementation group worked throughout 2016 to arrive at a suite of recommendations to support the future sustainability of the post office network.  These recommendations are with An Post for its consideration.  It is expected that they will be considered in the context of the strategic review of the company.<\/p><p>An Post is a significant employer with over 9,000 staff.  Its payroll costs amount to &euro;40 million per month.  This includes payments to the postmasters who run the bulk of the post office network.  I want to make it clear that despite An Post's difficult financial situation, there is no threat to the delivery of mail or to the universal service obligation.  An Post will continue to deliver post to every address every working day, in line with the EU requirement.  The amended approach to pricing being facilitated in this legislation aims to ensure An Post can continue to fulfil this obligation.<\/p><p>I will outline the main provisions of the Bill.  For the convenience of the House, a detailed explanatory memorandum has been published to provide a synopsis of the provisions.  The Bill is relatively short and consists of three sections.  Section 1 provides for the repeal of section 30 of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011, which provides for the price cap mechanism.  The section also provides that any price cap decision within the meaning of section 30 will cease to have effect.<\/p><p>Section 2 provides for an amendment to section 10 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 to enable ComReg to carry out a review of the consequences of the repeal of the price cap mechanism in section 30 of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011.  The functions of ComReg, as set out in section 10 of the 2002 Act, as amended, are being amended in this Bill to enable it to undertake this review.  This review will commence two years after the coming into operation of this legislation.  ComReg will report to the Minister on its findings within six months of the commencement of the review.  The Minister will lay the report prepared by ComReg before each of the House of the Oireachtas as soon as practicable.  In addition, provision is made to enable ComReg to undertake such consultation as it considers appropriate in carrying out the review.  Following an amendment on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, this Bill now provides that this consultation will be completed by ComReg within 42 days.<\/p><p>Section 3 contains general provisions relating to the Short Title, commencement, collective citation and construction.<\/p><p>Given the seriousness of the challenges facing An Post, it is considered prudent to have this legislation in place as soon as possible to allow An Post pricing freedom at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017022800002#CC00800","speaker":"1314","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488292200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
