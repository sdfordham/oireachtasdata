We came before this committee on 8 October 2015 to highlight major problems within the organic farming scheme and we were very happy with the recommendations of the committee but to date little or none of those recommendations have been implemented.  I understand members have copies of the presentation.<br\/><br\/>There are major problems with organic farming scheme payments being made on time.  We sought to have all money paid out within the calendar year and the joint committee recommended that the Department should ensure no payments were delayed.  For various reasons a lot of payments are still delayed and we are at a loss as to why that needs to be the case.  To clearly define the role of certification bodies, we recommended that Bord Bia take on this role rather than the present arrangement where farmers must pay outrageous fees to private certification bodies.  The joint committee recommended that the Department should investigate whether it would be more efficient to have one streamlined body granting organic status, preferably Bord Bia, and that the registration fees for same would be reduced.  To date, this recommendation has not been implemented.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the impact of double funding on smaller hectare organic farmers, we sought to have the scheme front-loaded to lessen the impact on the smaller farmer.  The joint committee has recognised that smaller farmers are not benefitting adequately from the organic farming scheme while larger farmers are benefitting disproportionately.  The joint committee recommended that the first 20 ha be front-loaded at &euro;315 per hectare in view of the fact that smaller farmers cannot avail of both the green, low carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and the organic scheme.  To date this recommendation has not been implemented.<br\/><br\/>We sought to have risk-based inspection put in place rather than the present arrangement where certification bodies inspect organic farms every year.  The joint committee recommended that the Department employ a risk-based inspection regime when inspecting premises involved in organic farming.  To date, this recommendation has not been implemented.<b><\/b>Farmers who have a Bord Bia inspection and organic inspection should have both carried out simultaneously.<b><\/b>The joint committee recommended that the Department should attempt to reduce the duplication of inspections by making Bord Bia the certification body.

The reason for this is to give us parity with conventional farmers in the GLAS programme, as outlined in our financial comparison between a conventional and organic farmer.  For example, a conventional farmer in GLAS with a low-input hay meadow has a rate of &euro;3,140 on 10 ha over five years.  On the organic farming scheme, the rate is just &euro;700.  The wild bird cover is &euro;2,700 for 3 ha but in the organic scheme it is &euro;510.  The total of the schemes for a conventional farmer in GLAS is &euro;5,840 versus &euro;2,210 for the organic farmer.<\/p> <p>  There should be a tillage payment of &euro;450 per hectare up to 5 ha in order to reduce dependence on imported feeds during the winter months.  There should be one licence to cover the term of the organic farming scheme.  Annual licensing is cumbersome and extremely expensive.  Anything between 9% and 25% of the organic payment must be paid to the certification bodies.  For example, a farmer with 12 ha pays &euro;2,200 to certification bodies while a farmer with 30 ha pays &euro;3,000 to a certification body and a farmer with 50 ha must pay &euro;3,100 to the body.  The certification bodies not only collect fees from farmers but also from factories, co-ops, marts, shops, butchers, branding, etc.  They are also funded by the Department.  The scheme in its current form is completely biased in favour of bigger farmers to the detriment of smaller operators and it must be reviewed as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>  Certification should be carried out by Bord Bia, as recommended by the joint committee.  We encourage a risk-based assessment once a farmer has been fully converted for the organic scheme.  We welcome the penalty system suggested by the Oireachtas committee.  Payment of all organic farming scheme moneys should be delivered in the same calendar year.  With regard to the terms and conditions of the organic farming scheme being changed on an annual basis by certification bodies, we suggest that an independent office should be available to organic farmers to verify the necessity of some conditions, which, frankly, we find ridiculous.  For example, there is a new rule on bedding in slatted accommodation.  We disagree with the new ruling and we want to have this independently assessed.  We find that on occasions we are participating in a somewhat different scheme from that to which we signed up.<\/p> <p>  Agriculture is one of the few sectors - if not the only one- that does not have access to the Labour Court.  The fact that an independent forum such as the Labour Court is not available to the agricultural sector is putting farmers in a position where they can be subjected to unfair treatment by the Department and other organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017013100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic Connelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation, which gains from being brief, succinct and to the point.  It is a good example for other witnesses who might appear before us.  We note the submissions and I was one of three or four members here when the delegation made their very comprehensive submission in October 2015.  That formed the core of our report.  Deputy Deering was Vice Chairman of that committee and the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, was the Chairman.  We prepared a substantial report and were acutely aware of the significant bias towards large farmers, as the witnesses have pointed out.  The opposite should clearly be the case in order to attract people to the scheme.  It goes against the idea of the economies of scale.<\/p> <p>  There is significant potential for growth in the organic farming sector in Ireland and that formed the basis of the discussion at our previous meeting.  At that time, the organic farming scheme was about to be introduced.  Has there been any progress in respect of the aims and objectives of the revised organic farming scheme?  Is it still the case that farmers are subjected to a plethora of oversight mechanisms, for certification and other purposes by numerous bodies?  Sometimes we find those bodies do not run in parallel but rather contrary to one another.  Has there been an increase in the number of organic farmers in the past year or so or, in particular, has there been any progress to entice young farmers into the organic farming scheme?  Are we still stuck at a figure of 1% regarding output from organic farming?<\/p><p>How do the witnesses see that developing?  Food Wise 2025 sets out a target of 5% whereas other countries, such as Denmark and Austria, have targets of 10% or 15%.  Let us cut out the silly ambitions.  We can be ambitious but let us be realistic.  Can we reach 5% in the next seven or eight years?  Other countries are at 15% but they have had a head start.  Let us deal with the reality rather than the theory.<\/p><p> Do the witnesses accept that one of the problems in gaining a foothold in the market relates to the price for consumers?  For example, a product might cost &euro;1.50 but the organic version is priced at &euro;1.95 or &euro;2.25.  It is difficult to make a breakthrough in the absence of extensive and comprehensive marketing and this is where the Bord Bia certification could be of most assistance.  Perhaps we could have further examples from the witnesses to give an idea of the nitpicking rules and regulations that effectively put off farmers, or which farmers find of such a bureaucratic nature that they act as a disincentive.<\/p><p> Are organic farmers subject to the independent appeals system that operates in the Agriculture Appeals Office so they can assert their rights when they feel put out or annoyed by a particular result?  Can they work through the Agriculture Appeals Office or do they feel it is too cumbersome or that the process takes too long?  There are certainly a number of issues.<\/p><p> An excellent report was prepared by the previous committee, of which some of us were members, but it appears to have only reached the waste bin of the Department and got no further.  That is a major disappointment.  It is as much a rebuff to the members of that outgoing committee as it is to the farmers who expected that some progress would be made.  We have to redouble our efforts.  We must try to involve the new Minister and ensure he takes this seriously and gets on with implementing a significant portion of the recommendations.  To be fair, the witnesses only outlined approximately one third of the recommendations, which is the right thing to do.  As they know, they might have 20 recommendations but it is best to get in with three or four key recommendations.  I have no doubt the Chairman and the committee will be anxious to ensure that progress is made on behalf of organic farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017013100002#D00400","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation, which was very much to the point.  There needs to be standardisation of the criteria for qualifying as an organic farmer.  The quality assurance scheme operated by Bord Bia is an excellent opportunity for farmers, given Bord Bia is visiting a significant number of farms every 18 months.  The opportunity to get that scheme intertwined with the organic regime must be taken.  It could be an add-on to the quality assurance inspection for farmers who want to opt in to the scheme.  There are farmers undertaking beef inspections and dairy inspections.  If they also wanted to opt for organic inspections, this could be done on the same day.  The criteria for qualifying as an organic farmer need to be standardised.  Various organisations are looking for different standards.  As a result, the position must be standardised if we want to make progress.  Bord Bia must become a lot more proactive.  The quality assurance scheme is the vehicle we can use to streamline the inspection regime so the inspection can be done on the same day as the quality assurance inspections.  It is clearly linked to the last recommendations made by the committee.  This is something we need to drive home in order to ensure it is delivered upon.  It is only common sense.  It would lower the cost of inspections and the wider cost of the regime, and would have serious benefits.<\/p> <p>  I was surprised to hear about the clash between GLAS and organic farming payments.  Organic farmers are farming in the spirit of GLAS, so when I hear that farming organically is inhibiting farmers from getting payments that are available under the scheme, the common sense of that escapes me.  Perhaps GLAS has to be adapted to suit organic farmers.  To have a farmer on a low input system getting a greater payment than an organic farmer does not make sense and there is no logic to that kind of regime.  Organic farming and GLAS need to become more intertwined.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the consumption of organic products, what kind of premium is being returned from the marketplace?  Deputy Penrose hinted at consumer resistance.  Across the various products, including dairy, sheep, beef, lamb, turkey, eggs, farmhouse cheeses and a whole variety of organic products, is there consistency in the level of premium that can be returned or are some sectors able to absorb a premium far better than others?  On the dairy side, this country has a very small proportion of organic output whereas there is a far higher proportion in other sectors.  Has research been done into the consumer response and how much of a mark-up the consumer will take?  What kind of mark-up do producers of organic food need to have in order to make it commercially viable when compared with mainstream farming?  How many farmers are involved in it and is there potential to grow the sector?  As has been hinted, other countries are far in front of us as regards organic produce.  Have we a handle on what is needed from the marketplace to make it viable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017013100002#E00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.

Absolutely nothing is done to encourage them into the agricultural colleges.  Approximately 2% of farmers are in the scheme and that has been the figure since 2009.  We have statistics for the years from 2009 to 2016 that show it is a revolving door.  Farmers enter, stay for five years and leave again.  They do not stay the pace.  There are so many rules and regulations that they cannot make ends meet.<\/p> <p>  Organic beef, sheepmeat and pigmeat is not being promoted here.  Anything that is promoted is for export.  A recent survey showed that 78% of sheep produced entered the conventional market; 22% of production is organic, all for export.  An Bord Bia is promoting lamb in Ireland under the Origin Green label.  It includes both conventional and organic products. <\/p> <p>  In response to the questions about appeals, I do not know where we can go, apart from the places we have gone to.<\/p> <p>  We were asked why we stayed in the sector.  Animal health is a big issue.  Animals on organic farms are much healthier and we do not need as many veterinary inputs.  There are lower costs because we do not need fertilisers and sprays.  It goes back to the old style of farming before all of the new fertilisers and new technology came into play. <\/p> <p>  One reason for Austria's success is that within the organic system in Europe we operate on two levels.  In Austria there is a lesser level of regulation than her.  Ours is very stringent which makes it very difficult to get farmers to enter the scheme.  That is why there is such a revolving door.  In Austria there is a big dairy system.  We cannot get one off the ground here.  It has been tried.  There is a drive by the Department and certification bodies to get more grain growers in.

We wanted to frontload the payment on the first 20 ha, then the next 20 ha and so on down the line to help the small farmer.  The Department moved from a figure of 55 ha to 60 ha and the payment moved from &euro;106 to &euro;170, which we welcomed.  We wanted the payment on the first 20 ha to be &euro;340, on the next 20 ha to be &euro;225 and on the following 20 ha to be &euro;100.  It would not have been very different, but it would have helped.  We were told it had gone for the bigger size to bring in the bigger tillage farmers.  Approximately 90% of the meal we use is imported to feed our stock.  That is why we wanted everyone to receive a small payment to sow his or her own crop instead of giving the money to the bigger farmer, but the Department did not heed us.  We came here 18 months ago after the new scheme had just been brought in.  Under the old scheme the average size of herd was 20 and the average number of hectares for tillage was 11.<\/p><p>Under the new scheme, the average herd increased to 25 and the size of the average tillage farm had decreased to 8 ha.  Straight away, one could see that the change was making matters worse.  There were more cattle and sheep to feed and less tillage.  It obviously had not worked.  Now the money has run out but the Department has stated that the scheme is very successful scheme.  There are approximately 1,600 or 1,700 farmers on the scheme, which is welcome.  It is the case, however, that there are lots of cattle and lots of sheep but no feed.  Now the Department is saying that if it gets more money for the scheme, it is going to target it towards tillage or dairy farming.  Every farmer in the scheme was looking for a payment to sew his own tillage, whether it was in respect of corn, turnips, kale or whatever.<\/p><p> Can we get to 5% in respect of organic production?  I cannot see a reason why not.  Even 10%, if the schemes were put in place.    I have said previously that most of the production along the west coast from Kerry to Donegal is essentially organic.  It is not certified that way, however, because the scheme does not suit.  It is down to money.  The budget for organic farming is in the region of &euro;10 million.  The budget for the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, is &euro;290 million per year.  There is a big cohort looking for the GLAS money.  If some of that money was diverted to organic production, the price relating to all the cattle and sheep that would go into organic would increase immediately.  Even though it would be the same volume, the export value would be a lot more.  I cannot see why we cannot increase to 5% or 10%.<\/p><p> Austria and other countries in Europe were mentioned.  They would not have the same high standards as Ireland.  In some countries, it is possible to buy standard cattle from a conventional farmer.  For example, one could buy a one month old calf from such a farmer.  If one kept that calf for three months, one would have it for three quarters of its life.  That animal would be automatically designated as organic.  An Irish farmer cannot feed a calf milk replacer because there are no organic milk replacers available here.  There are road shows and the Department and the certification bodies run promotional campaigns by which farmers will taken in.  For the first two years, matters might not be too bad because farmers who become involved are not paid a premium because it takes two years to qualify as organic.  Eventually, after another three years, they get out of it.  In effect, there is a revolving door.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017013100002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda Monaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1485878400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Double funding was mentioned.  On Thursday, 26 March 2014 we, as a group, went to the EU and met the head of the organics unit at the Commission.  There were three other members of staff present that day as well.  It was put to us that double funding cannot be paid out because of considerations relating to taxpayers in Europe.  They said that governments can work around it in order to benefit everyone in another way.  This means that there would be no need for double funding.  For example, the scheme could be front-loaded, for instance.  In a way, organics is already front-loaded because there is a payment for the first 60 ha and there is also a further payment thereafter of &euro;30 for any other hectares.  We are asking that this front-loading be reduced in respect of the first 20 ha and that there then be another payment.  This is already there, so we are just asking that it be put down to the lower end in order to help people who are being affected by double funding.

If he or she is quoted &euro;4.50 on the day, the conventional farmer would probably get &euro;4.60 or &euro;4.65, plus ten cents for quality assurance.  That is built into our 15%.  The biggest problem I face is that I live in the west of Ireland.  There is one factory in Ireland where lambs are slaughtered at it is located in Camolin, County Wexford.  I put my lambs in a trailer and I bring them to Tullamore, which is a two-hour journey.  They are taken from there on a truck.  It is a cost-process and I would be better off if I sold the animals in Tuam.  I am an organic farmer, however, and I sell them into the organic market.  We need a factory to process lambs in the west of Ireland<\/p> <p>.  Most of the organic lambs are not sold into the organic market because of the feed.  At this time of the year, they need feed.  A survey was carried out which showed that 70% of lambs are sold in August, September or October.  The factories want them all year round.  They were saying that if we could guarantee them a year-round supply, they would chase more markets for us.  I am told that my lamb is being sold in the finest restaurants in Paris and throughout Europe.  We also discovered that the worst cuts of the lamb are being put into baby food.  There is a big German baby food company called HiPP Organic that is using our lamb and beef for protein in baby food.  In Europe, the contamination levels relating to their own beef and lamb are so high that they can mix our lamb and beef with it in order to reduce the heavy-metal contamination level, etc.  It is a premium market but we do not get a premium for the product.  All the good cuts of lamb can go to restaurants and shops, and all the bad cuts are made into a paste.  We have seen the process.  The paste is then frozen and sent to Germany.  The baby food is a higher standard than organic.  It is all tested in Germany and if it is not right, it is sent back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017013100002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda Monaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>What is the premium on beef?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017013100002#G00500","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1485878400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I would say it is between 70 cent and &euro;1 per kilogramme.  It depends on whether one is part of a group that is strong enough to negotiate.  I was involved with a group and we met a factory that brushed us aside.  We said that was fine and that we would not supply any organic beef to it but, rather, that we would sell it to the conventional market.  After two weeks, the factory came back to us because it had identified its market but could not get any beef to sell into it.  As a result, we did a good deal.<\/p> <p>  It is a pity that the cost to the local butcher is too great.  If get less than &euro;1 per kilogramme from a lamb, the most I will make is &euro;20 but the average would be more likely to be &euro;12 or &euro;15.  Every time the lamb is handled thereafter, the price seems to double.  I do not know why lamb is so expensive for the housewife, particularly if we are only getting 15% more.  Local butchers have to pay a licence fee and they do not want to bother doing that.  If the Government were serious about promoting organic produce, it would be helping butchers and retailers to get that licence for nothing.<\/p><p>The licence is a barrier in front of us.<\/p><p> Another thing that is often said is that the polluter pays.  We are not polluting but we are still paying.  There is something wrong there.  We are producing the cleanest food in Europe.  When we were dealing with the factory they told us that the Germans could not figure out how there were so many zeros when they test the food.  I saw a report that came from Sweden.  Conventional food had a toxicity of 0.15%, and organic had 0.0003%.  It is 1,000 times less toxic.  We are the same here.  Our beef and lamb and food in general is of a higher class than central Europe because we do not have the pollution from industrial chimneys over the years, but our organic is simply superior.  We are not getting paid though, and barriers are put in front of those with licences.  The Government should be dealing directly with the certification bodies and paying them.  It should not be up to us.  They should be going to the butchers and giving them a grant to promote organic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017013100002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda Monaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I come from Leitrim and we have quite a number of organic farmers.  Many of them have done very well, but I am very aware that there are people who have done it for a few years, found it difficult, and moved out of it again.  It seems that the supports which have been put around organic farming are not working to make it sustainable in the long term.  That is the issue that we have to try and get to the core of.<\/p> <p>  There seems to be a market for the product in spite of the gazumping of it from both ends.  At one end the producer is finding it difficult to survive as the supports have not been good enough, and at the other end the housewife who buys it, the consumer, is really being done for it.  There is something wrong there.  It is something that should be looked at, and I think it is particularly evident in the organic sector.  It is happening in a lot of sectors of farming, as we have spoken about, but it is particularly evident in the organic sector.<\/p> <p>  A couple of the issues that were mentioned with regard to the recommendations from the previous committee are immediately obvious to me.  The front-loading of payments for the first 20 hectares can be addressed without an awful lot of cost and it would make a big difference.  The certification bodies seem to be acting as a block and seem to be one of the problems.  They should not be, and there is no reason for that.  Again, that is something which will cost nothing, but is something that we should be able to deal with either through the Department or through the Minister.  There should be some way to change the rules to make it easy and to remove that block.<\/p> <p>  The appeals process and the independence of the Department in the process were mentioned as applying across the board and not just to organics.  I think every farmer would have that particular gripe.  They feel that if the Department has found them wrong and there is an appeal, the Department personnel are not going to let themselves down and the farmers will be found wrong again.  That is something that many farmers find difficult.  It is particularly the case for organic farmers.<\/p> <p>  Access to entitlements and reserve are big issues for new entrants to every sector of farming.  The fact that there is no national reserve for them at the moment is a big issue, but especially in the organic sector.  I have come across a number of younger farmers who want to go organic and who are very interested and enthusiastic about it.  They are on marginal land.  It would suit them and work for them from the point of view of being able to get a better price for their produce.  To go intensive is going to be difficult because they do not have the land to intensify and it is not good enough.  The issue is that when they study it, and this goes back to the point that was made at the beginning, it just does not work.  The level of support is not there.  We keep coming back to this issue which Deputy Cahill among others mentioned, that most consumers say that organic is a lovely idea but they cannot afford it.  It is seen as something that is for people in Dublin 4 who want to go green and who can afford to buy this expensive stuff, but for ordinary housewives and ordinary people it is just out of their price range.  That should not be the case.<\/p> <p>  If the issues of front-loading and certification were addressed and something done about the gazumping of the market, it would open up the sector and more people would be able to get into organic farming.  One of the things that is stopping the sector from growing is the fact that the product is so expensive for the end consumer.  We should definitely be looking in that direction.  I still think it is not for every farmer, but it certainly is an option for many farmers on the more marginal land, for example, in the west.<\/p> <p>  It would be interesting to find out more about the two levels of certification.  In Austria they have two levels of certification, and the example of the calf was given, that provided that it has organic feed for three months after it is a month old it can be certified organic when it reaches four months.  The code we use here is so strict, it is something we could look at as well.  We could work with the farmers to come up with recommendations and put pressure on to try to get the original recommendations implemented, but there are other things that should be looked at as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017013100002#H00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation and thank the members for their report.

Listening to the presentation and the comments of my colleagues, I am reminded that the core issue here in terms of agriculture is that until we have an honest conversation about the cost of food and a fair price for those who produce it, we are just giving way to the supermarkets.  So much of what comes in terms of single farm payments and European payments and matched by Government funding is subsidy to supermarkets.  Farmers across every single sector of food are not getting anywhere near the price that they should get for their produce in terms of the input that goes in.  There is a conversation for consumers.  People talk about organic food and how it is healthier and better for the environment, but will they pay a reasonable price for it?<\/p><p>We must have serious conversations and there is much hypocrisy that we must address, particularly in terms of Government policy.<\/p><p> Another issue drives me mad in this place.

Is it doing its own thing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017013100002#J00300","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak and I welcome the delegation.  The nub of the issue relates to farmers with under 20 ha.  The European Union made a ruling that what it terms double payment cannot be made for the same piece of ground.  The Department clearly made its decision on that.  The problem is that a farmer who was in the organic scheme when GLAS was initiated could get &euro;5,000 in a GLAS payment.  In the case of an organic farmer with 15 ha, 16 ha or 17 ha, it was more attractive to go into GLAS than to stay in the organic scheme because there was approximately &euro;3,000 of a difference.  We give out about the prices arising from doing nutrient management plans with GLAS and all that but &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,100 would get a farmer through the lot.  Meanwhile the certification costs for a small farmer to stay in the organic scheme are totally out of order.<\/p> <p>  In fairness, I have met this and other organic farmer groups previously.  I spoke with them even before the Government talks.  I remember speaking with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and it was included in the programme for Government that we would seek to amend the rural development plan to allow a greater payment per hectare for the first 10 ha for organic producers.  It would bring a balance to the process and there would not be a flight of farmers.  There are farmers with 60 ha but there are more smaller farmers with 10 ha, 15 ha or 20 ha around Ireland and especially the west than there are fellows with 60 ha or 70 ha.  It was agreed within the programme for Government negotiations that there was a problem and if we are to stay in organic farming, it must be addressed.  That is the total issue.  Bord Bia was the delegation's preferred choice rather than having a crowd of bodies doing what is necessary.  If Bord Bia personnel were doing quality assurance on a farm, they could do everything else and the farmers would be finished with it rather than having 40 different fellows coming out.<\/p> <p>  I am considering the appeals process at present.  A new basic payments scheme appeals committee has been set up but no notice of it was given.  I only heard about it in the past week.  It appears one cannot go to the courts with a decision from that committee.  I do not know if it makes the old appeals office redundant.  A statutory instrument is supposed to be brought in every year - this was done in 2015 - setting out the schemes the appeals office covered.  As far as I can see, none was published last year.  The witnesses mentioned the Labour Court.  Currently there are guys involved in appeals about the agri-environment option scheme who have gone a year or two payment periods without receiving anything.  What is going on around the country in that regard is disgraceful.<\/p> <p>  We have talked about this process before, particularly in the lamb sector.  Let us call a spade a spade.  With the distance they go and without much promotion, farmers in the organic sector still have to sell cattle in the same mart as the farmer down the road.  Unless we get more serious, the smaller farmers will leave.  Ultimately, it is money that counts for a farmer.  If a farmer can get &euro;5,000 in GLAS but &euro;1,800 in the organic scheme, with its associated fees, the farmer will go for the scheme that will produce most money.  Generally, the bigger operators get into the organic scheme and fall out after one round.  We have many smaller farmers who are committed to the organic scheme because they believe in it.  They have been in the scheme for years and want to stay in it.  Unfortunately, with the current system, if a farmer has under 20 ha - approximately 17 ha or 18 ha is the cut-off - it is like we are telling them to get out of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017013100002#J00400","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Do the witnesses have a breakdown of the organic farmers around the country?

We fill out our documentation, like all other farmers, in May.  A lot of the stuff that would be sent in would be the same every year and there would be no changes, yet by the end of the year and the time comes for payments, all these problems crop up.

There have been situations that I know have happened, on the organic scheme or other schemes, where we have been told that we would be paid in November, and yet they would stage an inspection in December and we would not be paid.

My answer to that is that if the tillage person wanted to join the scheme before now he would have done so.  The scheme is wrong.  The Department may put money aside to target tillage farmers but he will still not join the scheme.  The scheme provides &euro;170 per hectare or &euro;70 per acre, which is worth less than a tonne of barley.  The crop will be reduced by half so no tillage farmer will opt to join.  The Department gives &euro;900 for wild bird cover for three hectares.  We have suggested that the Department pays half that sum for four or five hectares so one could grow one's own feed.  One of the porridge companies wants oats and wants to target tillage farmers.  Such a move would leave us without feed.  That is why we have suggested that the Department front-load a payment for tillage whether it is an outdoor winter crop, oats or barley.  It would mean we could supply cattle and sheep the whole year around and meat factories could seek a suitable market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017013100002#L00050","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda Monaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I met Mr. Connelly the other day.

I am baffled because the Bill, the purpose of which is to ban fracking, passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and that is the reality with which we should be dealing now.  We should be scrutinising the tightness and clarity of that Bill, rather than going through the facts - or the lack of facts - yet again, hearing the opinions of various bodies that think fracking should or should not have a place in Ireland or discussing reports from the EPA on whether those opinions are valid.  We dealt with all of that in the D&aacute;il.

No applications have been approved.  The Department acknowledges that the timeline envisaged for the research was longer than anticipated but the report does answer some questions about the impact of the unconventional exploration for gas on the environment and health.  Three significant areas require to be addressed before we can conclude that the methodology for this extraction could be used in a compliant manner.  Two relate to groundwater concerns and the third is the implications for air quality.  While not highlighted in the three recommendations, it is also noteworthy that the report finds there are significant gaps in the legislative framework covering this activity not only in Ireland but in several countries.  As the Minister indicated in the D&aacute;il that he would like to see science-led research as the basis on which we make decisions and conclude this matter, it is considered appropriate that we discuss the findings and move on to the legislation.

As our statement is available to all members of the committee I will pick out a couple of points.<\/p> <p>  The EPA's licensing role is relevant to this work and that is why we were involved in this research.  Onshore extraction of gas, if it were ever to happen in Ireland, would require a licence from the EPA.  We also have a research role as the national co-ordinator of environmental research in Ireland.  We have a broader role in respect of environment reporting which is relevant to the broader issue and I am happy to discuss that issue in respect of climate change and carbonisation if that is helpful to the committee.  The opening statement gives the history and context of the research, which I will take as read.<\/p> <p>  The overall aim of the programme and the questions we were asked to address are set out on page 4 of the statement.  It is some time since the terms of reference for the joint research programme were drawn up and it is easy to forget what the purpose of the research was when we set out to do it.  Now that it has concluded we should consider its overall aim when the work commenced.  It was originally intended to happen in two phases.  The phase one work is complete, the reports have been published and are available on the EPA website and the phase two work did not commence.  The EPA has no plans now to do further research in this area in light of the decision of the Oireachtas in October 2016.<\/p> <p>  The EPA did not do the research, it funded it.  As a director of the EPA, however, I have read the summary reports which are available to anyone who wants to read them.  It is clear to me from reading them that the research was independent, objective and extremely thorough.  Many people with a range of expertise and backgrounds were involved and contributed to the work through the consortium, the steering committee and the technical review groups.  This shines through the reports. <\/p> <p>  Two answers emerged from the research.  Notwithstanding that the baseline monitoring intended to happen as phase two did not proceed, the research has gone a long way towards answering the two questions originally asked of the research.  As Mr. Collins pointed out, the research raises questions to be answered.  The research also makes clear that these issues should be resolved prior to any authorisation of hydraulic fracturing.  <\/p> <p>  While the research poses specific questions, as always happens, there is added value from the work, for example, the lifecycle assessment approach to this technology and some of the work done on health impact assessment.  These will have broader implications and use for regulators and those involved in the environmental protection area.  <\/p> <p>  Overall, I am satisfied that the EPA and its joint research programme partners have provided very good value for money to the State.  Ireland is somewhat unique in having taken such a precautionary approach to unconventional gas exploration.  We are one of the few countries where it has been decided to do the research, to consider what baseline monitoring needs to be done in advance of allowing there to be exploration or extraction.  That is something to be proud of.  In time, the work may be seen as a good case study in the application of the precautionary principle in practice and evidence-based policy making supported by independent research.  I also pointed out that the work was very controversial and generated a lot of public interest and engagement, particularly in the two studies.  The public sector can learn from that how best to involve and engage local communities in decisions that can have a very direct impact on the quality of their lives, their health and wellbeing.  On the broader issue, as we start to figure out what we are going to do about the challenges of climate change, engagement with communities will be very important.<\/p> <p>  We are very happy to answer any questions the committee might have.  If it has questions we cannot answer we will get the information to the committee as soon as we can after this meeting. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017013100002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Crowe"},{"type":"speech","time":1485882000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Crowe.

I will skip through some of the slides quickly.  As the members of the committee have hard copies of the presentation, they can follow me as I go through it.  The third slide shows the scope of our work.  We undertook a technical research programme.  There were no political, economic or considerations in the study.  There were five projects.  We had two study areas, one in County Clare and the other on the Border in counties Leitrim, Sligo, Cavan and Fermanagh.  Our approach was based on evidence.  We used peer-reviewed data.  We got information and data from regulatory bodies.  We looked at the regulatory structures.  We used our own experience and knowledge of the industry.  We did not take any information from newspapers, social media, anecdotes or Hollywood.<\/p> <p>  Members will see the slide that sets out the structure of the five inter-linking projects in the EPA's scope of work.  In projects A1, A2 and A3, we looked at the specific impacts on water, seismicity and air quality.  In the fourth project, we looked at the impacts of unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects around the world, the mitigation measures taken as part of those projects and the success of those projects.  In the final project, we looked at the regulatory framework in EU and Irish law and in other jurisdictions.  We examined these matters in the context of the two study areas.  We looked at the EU requirements and we studied what is going on in other jurisdictions.  It was quite a broad project.<\/p> <p>  The next slide indicates that the consortium was led by CDM Smith and was supported by the British Geological Survey.  University College Dublin and the University of Ulster were involved in the seismic activities.  The consortium also included Amec Foster Wheeler, which has done a great deal of work for the European Commission on regulation and best practice in fracking.  Philip Lee offered us local expertise regarding the regulations in Ireland and Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I will not go through the description of the individual projects.  I will move on to the slide entitled \"potential impacts\", which sets out how the fracking process is divided into four main stages for our purposes.  Unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects typically last between 15 and 25 years.  The first stage we normally look at is exploration.  We split that into two parts: baseline monitoring and characterisation, which is fairly benign, and test hydraulic fracturing.  As test hydraulic fracturing is new and rather different, we pulled it out as a separate entity.  The second stage, which applies if it is decided to proceed with fracking, involves a great deal of activity on pad development and the development of infrastructure such as roads, water pipelines and wells.  The third phase is the production stage, when all of the development goes away and the field starts to produce gas.  The fourth stage involves a closure exercise.  Our analysis of the impacts across these four stages was based on five reports, which we drew from an awful lot of information.<\/p> <p>  Members will see that a number of slides feature pretty tables, or not-so-pretty tables.  These simple tables rate the potential impacts of the activities in each phase of the fracking process and assess whether those impacts are normal from the perspective of society.  It is not unusual to be building a road or a pad, for example.  It is unusual, from the perspective of society and the regulations, to be doing hydraulic fracking so it is going to be a bit of a problem.  We looked at whether the regulations that apply to each activity need modifications or additions.  If I had more time, I would go through the various tables to illuminate what we found.  I can do that by reference to the conclusions.<\/p> <p>  The first slide dealing with conclusions follows all the tables to which I have referred.  The first conclusion we came to is that fracking projects and operations involve multiple activities which have the potential to affect human health and the environment in different ways.  The relative importance of these impacts varies from place to place, because these projects are very site-specific, and with time.  As I have said, many of the activities are conventional in so far as they involve things that happen frequently.  People build roads to allow materials to be transported and install pipelines to transfer water.  Much of this activity is fairly typical of society and of behaviour across many industries and is therefore well regulated.  There is a lot of regulation in place and the mitigation measures are quite well developed.<\/p> <p>  I ask members to turn to the next slide dealing with conclusions.  When we looked at other jurisdictions, we found that the operational requirements and therefore the practices that are going on are quite different from country to country.  That is a reflection of the fact that this is a new industry that is evolving rapidly, especially in the US.  We noted that the regulatory environment in the US differs significantly from that in Europe, partly because the US authorities approach things differently and partly because ownership issues are completely different there.  In the US, the resource is owned by the landowner rather than the state.  This means the landowner has a much bigger incentive to get involved.  That is a fairly basic difference.  Many of the more damaging practices in the US would not be allowed in Ireland because of EU regulations.  I refer to the use of open-wastewater lagoons, for example, or to practices like flaring and deep underground reinjection.  Many of the bigger problems in the US simply would not be allowed here under EU regulations.  It is quite ironic that industry best practice - the United Kingdom Onshore Oil and Gas group, for example, has developed best practice guidance in this area - addresses many of the issues that are raised by stakeholders.  There is a nice body of work there that should be incorporated in the regulations if this goes ahead.  The industry has set out what it is prepared to do.  I suggest the public authorities can achieve a great deal of benefit from holding the industry to that.<\/p> <p>  In the next slide dealing with conclusions, we set out our view that many of these activities could proceed in Ireland without causing too much damage to the environment or to health as long as the best practices we have identified in the report are followed and current regulations are applied with a small number of additions and modifications.  This needs to be complemented by adequate implementation of the regulations by the industry and enforcement of them by my friends in the EPA.<\/p> <p>  We are of the view that an unsatisfactory risk status is still attached to three impacts.  We could not say that mitigation measures would work in these contexts.  I have listed the three impacts in question on one of the slides.  We believe there may be a risk of groundwater pollution from failed boreholes, of groundwater pollution caused by gas migrating through the cracks created during fracking, and of emissions after the closure of the wells.  We did not have enough evidence to say that problems would not arise in these areas.  In our view, there is still a problem.  I will go through the three risks individually.  When we say there is a risk of groundwater pollution from failed borehole integrity, we are referring to the possibility of the pumped materials going down leaking into the aquifers.  It is also possible that the returning gas or the production waters - the deep waters that naturally come out of rocks and are usually highly polluted - could leak out as well.  If the well fails, there is a problem.<\/p> <p>  When one engages in fracking, one creates cracks.  Fracking releases gas into the well.  Potentially, those cracks could be a route for migration of gas and polluted water.  There is quite a debate about how long those cracks might be.  The industry will say they are 10 m or 20 m in length, but a great deal of data points to the possibility that they are over 200 m in length.  We think they might extend to 300 m in extreme conditions.  We know from the statistical analysis we use that they could theoretically extend to 500 m if long cracks can go vertically from the oil-bearing strata to the aquifers.  If these cracks extend to the aquifers, the possibility of gas and pollutant migration presents itself.  That is worse if there are existing faults that link in with the natural cracks as a sort of double-whammy.<\/p> <p>  The third unsatisfactory risk is the possibility of post-closure gas emissions.  Things should be straightforward when all the gas is out and the well is capped, but that is not the case.  There are international examples of leaks from conventional and unconventional wells.  In principle, the design of these elements should be straightforward.  It should be easy enough to do, but leaks can happen.  We cannot say it is not a risk.  The levels of gas emissions from a well are typically low, but if there are gas emissions from a number of wells over a long period of time, those levels can be significant.<\/p> <p>  They are the three issues that we really highlight as being problems.  We suggest they should be addressed by anyone who wants to do hydraulic fracturing.  They can be addressed, to some extent, by baseline monitoring.  If we had baseline monitoring of water and seismicity for the two study areas, we could say with a lot more certainty how likely it is that gas and pollutants will migrate from the wells to the aquifers.<\/p><p>Similarly if there is going to be any seismic activity, seismic surveys will be done before anything happens to provide us with better knowledge of the sub-surface geology and hydrogeology.  The structure of the geology and hydrogeology, which is the way water moves around, is fundamental to two of these issues.  If the data are there ahead of time, there is a reasonable chance of being able to say whether we think it is a problem but that cannot be done without the data.  In a sense, we will not know the long-term gas emissions because they are long term.  There are ongoing studies but it will take a long time to find out.  If countries want to proceed with this, there is no reason why the design cannot be well specified and well implemented.  The testing of the closing procedure could be done and then linked to long-term monitoring.  We would recommend a bonding issue so if there are problems the operators pay rather than the Government.  They are the three activities the Government could move forward on to make it a more satisfactory industry.<\/p><p> The last issue is the regulatory environment.  Many regulations have come out of the EU.  They are widespread and are quite applicable to these types of operations but there are some deficiencies and ambiguities on which clarification is needed.  One is the mining waste directive which the EU is clarifying.  There are issues associated with the reuse of wastewater.  Wastewater is not supposed to be re-injected.  The argument is that the water that has been injected down and comes back as part of the fracking process is wastewater.  If it was to be reused, there would be a much lower demand for water and the water resource, which is a concern.  That is an issue we felt need clarification.  It is not clear in the environmental impact assessment directive what scale of projects that should be applied to.  In Denmark, they have taken a view that all fracking projects, whether only for exploration or not, have an environmental impact assessment.  Similarly, it is not really clear at what scale the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, should be.  If one was doing an exploration well or a few wells, one probably would not do it but if one was going to do the whole of the northern carboniferous basin throughout Leitrim and Fermanagh, then an SEA is needed.  The application of SEAs needs to be clarified.  Extraction licensing in Ireland needs to be strengthened because there is such significant water demand in this industry.  The European Commission has developed recommendations for this industry and it attempts to cover the gaps in the existing regulations.  It is quite good and covers most of those gaps.

I also thank them, as well as those in the Gallery, for their patience while waiting.  If one is going to do something that is a risk, the first thing one has to do is ask whether it is necessary.  If there is a pedestrian crossing where one can walk safely across the road, why would one go 20 yd. up the road to cross the road without a red light for traffic to stop?  It seems as though the risks involved here are substantial.  The witnesses have waited a long time and other people want to ask questions.  There are huge risks involved, which is clear from the report and the Department's conclusions on it.  A more comprehensive report on a seven-year study done in New York concluded that the administration should ban it completely.  There are risks to the environment, air and water quality and Mr. Alan Hooper touched on some of those.  The report that was done here did not deal with the effects of burning shale gas; it simply dealt with the extraction of shale gas.  In this country, we are already way behind our international obligations in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Will the witnesses from the EPA share any thoughts they have about the effects of burning shale gas in terms of what effect it would have on our CO2 emissions and whether it would increase those or not?<\/p> <p>  The conclusions of the Department on its potential to pollute ground aquifers is of huge concern to people.  I am from the midlands but I know there is huge concern about that in the north west.  The potential for cracks has been outlined very vividly.  There could be cracks of up to 500 m from hydraulic fracturing.  The closing of wells was also addressed.  We are doing a study in this country where it has not yet happened.  Perhaps Mr. Alan Hooper will address this point.  The studies in the United States addressed a situation where it has happened and where the environmental consequences can be seen, felt and measured.  Does CDM Smith agree it is difficult to do it here because it has not happened here yet?  <\/p> <p>  What is the impact of burning shale gas?  Will it exacerbate the appalling situation in this State where we are far behind and will fall far short of the very modest targets we set ourselves to meet in 2020 and 2030?  I cannot figure out why, as an island nation, we are even entertaining this because surely we have enough, in that we have an abundance of renewable sources of energy.  The EPA has looked at all of this in the past, as I am sure have some of the people here with scientific backgrounds.  We are only scratching the surface in terms of exploring and researching such sources and developing the technology to harvest wind, wave, solar and all the other bioenergies that are available and into which we should be tapping.  Why we are even taking the risk of going down the road of shale gas is beyond me.  Why cross the road 20 yd. from the pedestrian crossing when one can press the button and have a red light to stop traffic?  It is beyond me why we are taking the risk.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017013100002#S00300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1485882000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I will bring in Deputy Ryan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017013100002#S00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485882000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1485882000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I ask those in the Public Gallery not to applaud or make commentary during this session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017013100002#S00600","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1485882000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>It is a strange situation because there is consensus.  In the Second Stage debate, we reached an important decision so it is strange that we are stepping back a bit.<\/p><p>However, it is not a permanent step back.  In fact, we have respect for this process and for the submissions that various people with an interest in this matter have been asked to present and the work they have done on them.<\/p><p> Two or three issues arise.  Dr. Crowe referred to climate change.  For me, that is the quintessential first obstacle for any development of fracking.  We need to keep four fifths of fossil fuel resources underground.  If we burn the shale or tight oil and shale resources, we will have runaway climate change that we will not be able to stop.  There are also secondary issues around methane release, which I believe is an acute problem in the shale fracking industry.  The analysis we have been presented confirms to me, specifically for the sites in Leitrim, Sligo and Roscommon, that the issue of water pollution is very significant.  There are many other concerns that could be raised.  From all the analysis I have read here, this is a geological formation in which there are natural risks, as there are already breaks in the fracturing in the natural sediments of the area.  There are real risks.  The concerns in the hydrological analysis presented by SWAN are being backed up.  In that geological area, there is a risk of contamination of the most critical water resource we have, namely, the mouth of the Shannon.  It seems to me to be a non-starter.  It gives us a certain comfort in following the process of restricting the application of fracking in Ireland.  In my mind, it makes ever more sense.<\/p><p> I would be interested to hear from Mr. Collins from the Department on one final matter.  In our earlier considerations today, the other reassuring development - if I am not breaking confidence - is the sense that the Bill, as presented, is fundamentally legally sound, although there may be a need for a tweaking of words.  I think it may be appropriate for the Department, with its drafting expertise, to provide wording suggestions for the definition of \"land\", \"the State\" and other examples mentioned earlier.  The reassurance for those campaigning on this side is that we have a process whereby, as we agreed under Standing Order 141, we are carrying out the pre-legislative process, which is not going to be long and drawn out.  This legislation is heading towards Committee Stage, for which the select committee will be responsible.  Subject to the D&aacute;il agreeing Report Stage and the Bill's enactment, it will go to the Seanad.  I would be interested to hear from Mr. Collins, as he has a similar assessment, whether there is anything in the legislative process that, in the Department's view, screams \"Stop\".  If there is, I am not aware of it.  That is the good news from my perspective.

The reasons for maintaining the moratorium are quite simple.  There are a number of unresolved issues in the risks that have been identified.  They relate to groundwater and air quality.  Those risks mean that the frameworks are unresolved at the moment.  That is the justification for the Department maintaining the moratorium, particularly in light of the Oireachtas examining a legislative basis for preventing fracking.  It seems clear to us that, in the interim, we are satisfied that those risks exist.  It is in line with the policy goal of the Oireachtas in terms of the legislation.  The Minister has already said that he accepts the Bill.  He is supportive.  He flagged quite a long time ago his specific concerns about groundwater and air quality.  It is important that the research that was carried out flagged that as well.<\/p> <p>  Having the research is useful because it provides comfort in terms of the direction in which the legislation is going.  We have a very clear basis and rationale for what we are doing and the approach we are taking.  Rather than allowing this activity to take place and examining it in retrospect, which some jurisdictions have done, we have probably benefited from the fact that the better approach has been to prevent the activity, do the analysis in advance of the activity and to then allow a policy and legislative framework to be developed that addresses that activity.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the legal soundness of the Bill, I am not a lawyer and I know there are parliamentary draftspersons who are professionals in this area.  What I can say is that the intention of the legislation is very clear.  It is to achieve a prohibition of fracking.  We want to ensure we achieve that through the legislation.  Sometimes, legislative drafting can be complex and this is a particularly technical area as well.  It will probably be a drafting issue, but I think people on both sides agree on the intent of the Bill and that is what we want to ensure occurs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017013100002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matthew Collins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1485882000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I wish to respond to the Chairman's question on the data and the evidence.  Thinking back to 2010 and 2011, when this first came on the EPA's radar, there was a lot of talk about fracking in America and other parts of the world.  There was the possibility that it might happen in Ireland at some point.  Our concern at that time was to get more information about the Irish context.  The Irish underground is very specific to Ireland.  Even within different parts of Ireland, it varies from one place to the other.  The study addressed that to a certain extent.  It looked at whatever available data there is in Ireland right now.  Of course, at the time the study was originally designed, there was also an intention that there would be monitoring done in terms of boreholes, seismic monitoring, etc, but it was never done.  We are where we are on that.  The key thing is to get the Irish context of the data, information and evidence from a regulation point of view.  If we were ever in a situation in which we had to consider an application for the extraction of shale gas, we would want to have all of the knowledge and information that we needed about the specific area in which that was going to happen.  Some of that would be gathered in the course of an application.  However, there are issues such as the strategic environmental assessment, which was mentioned earlier.  There are things the State can do to provide that baseline information, which makes the job of regulators more efficient and effective.<\/p> <p>  In terms of risk, an issue Deputy Stanley raised, the main point is that hydraulic fracturing has not happened in the Republic of Ireland.  The approach that has been taken in Ireland is the precautionary approach to do the research, get the data, collect the evidence and then base policy on whatever that happens to be.  The policy context has changed since 2011.  We now have a White Paper on energy, which we did not have then.  There is a much broader context in which to examine whatever energy systems may be considered for Ireland in the future.<\/p> <p>  We also have the climate legislation, very specific targets for 2050 in residential and transport electricity generation and an 80% reduction of carbon dioxide compared to 1990 levels.  The broader issue will be addressed in the national mitigation plan, which is to be prepared this year.  The whole point of that plan is to set out a roadmap for how Ireland is going to reach the targets in the legislation that have been set for 2050.  Everything has to be considered on that basis.  Essentially, we are talking about decarbonising the energy system.  At present, that system is heavily dependent on fossil fuels.<\/p><p>A total of 90% of energy in Ireland comes from fossil fuels.  There is a much bigger issue at play in respect of the challenges posed by climate change which relate to how we move from an energy system that is heavily dependent on fossil fuels to one that is not.  If there was ever a possibility that shale gas would be considered as part of a national energy resource, it would have to be considered within the broader policy consideration of decarbonisation and the targets set out in dealing with climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017013100002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Crowe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485882000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Did Deputy Brian Stanley have a question for Mr. Hooper?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017013100002#U00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1485882000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Yes.

Ireland is right.  It was a good study to have carried out before anything was put in the ground.  The lack of baseline data does make life very difficult and it invalidates much of the information available because researchers do not know what they are comparing against.  It is also very site specific.  The geology of New York State is very different from that of Ireland.  It is seismically much more active than Ireland; therefore, there would probably be a lot more fractured rock than here.  One of the big problems, which brings us back to Deputy Eamon Ryan's point about water pollution, is that it depends on the underground geology, hydrogeology and fracturing.

I was very sceptical about this process before we started and have already questioned the legitimacy of going down this road.  I am even more sceptical now, having heard the presentations.

The research is by CDM Smith, a pro-fracking company which is working with a State body tasked with protecting our environment, including our water and population.  I see a big compromise in that relationship and get the impression that they sort of regret the decision of the D&aacute;il before Christmas to move to ban fracking in Ireland.  I would like them to comment on this in a genuine way as scientists and people who are interested in the industry because I am very concerned that we are going through this process for a different reason.  I am not a conspiracy theorist, but I find it extraordinary that we are going through the process of listening to the delegates report on something we have rejected democratically.  We should be moving to another stage.<\/p> <p>  Earlier we heard the legal opinion which advised us of some interesting points connected with language such as how to describe the State and land and whether we would have to link this with amendments to previous Acts dating from the 1960s dealing with petroleum.  That is the advice we, as an Oireachtas committee, need to hear to move on.  I am suspicious that it will be dragged out and that the industry regrets that a door has not been left open to allow fracking in this country.<\/p> <p>  I thank and give credit to the people in the Visitors Gallery and their communities for their work in presenting thousands of petitions and going through Governor Cuomo's research in the State of New York and bringing it to Leinster House.  Deputy Tony McLoughlin is a local Deputy of the Fine Gael Party and were it not for the rank and file, ordinary decent farmers and citizens who live with the potential danger that their environment will be destroyed, this issue would not have been brought to the floor of the D&aacute;il.  The delegates have admitted that it is a danger and that we do not know enough.  Why would we want to take it out of the ground in the first place?  If we are hurtling towards climate change and bound by the Paris Agreement to seriously reduce our carbon emissions within the next 20 to 30 years, this proposal flies in the face of the idea that the committee even consider the concept of extracting more fossil fuel from the ground.  It should be left there to protect the environment and the people living in it.  Alternative ways to produce energy should be found.  <\/p> <p>  I hope my suspicions that the industry wants to leave a chink open on the basis that this will not get through or that it could be revisited in the future are utterly and totally misguided and wrong, but I would like to hear that is the case.  We need to deal with climate change and protect the environment.  Any idea of shale gas becoming part of an industry in this country flies in the face of that need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017013100002#U00500","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1485882000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to contribute, although I am not a member of the committee.  <\/p> <p>  This is a huge issue in Sligo, Leitrim and west Cavan.

It is good, however, to have the opportunity to listen and try to learn something.  <\/p> <p>  How does the notion of examining the extracting of shale gas at a time when as a society we are trying to move away from fossil fuels fit with the Department's position?

The programme was set up for the research to be conducted independently, and this happened as a result of the way in which the consortium was established.  Then there are the many other public servants in particular who were involved through the steering committee and the various review groups that contributed to the development of the materials, which the members of the committee all now have as they have since been published in the reports.  I reiterate the point I made earlier that Ireland has adopted the precautionary principle here.  This will be seen in time as a case study in how to deal with a controversial issue such as this: one should get the evidence, get the information, get the data one needs, take the time to do it, produce the research, produce the reports and then make one's policy decisions in that kind of informed, evidence-based position that will help with the policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017013100002#V01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Crowe"},{"type":"speech","time":1485882000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I will bring in Deputy McLoughlin.

It has been a major issue in our area for many years.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the unanimous decision in the D&aacute;il in October on Second Stage.  To be quite honest, I am a little concerned.  I know the Chairman was trying to clarify the process of going from Second Stage to Committee Stage and the fact that we are now listening to comments being made.  I was of the opinion that perhaps on Committee Stage, more advice and more detail should be sought.  However, having read some of the comments made in the past by CDM Smith and others, I was very concerned.  I heard some speakers talking about what has happened only this evening.  A colleague of mine who has a huge interest in the United States came to me and expressed huge concern and told me I should be here to express concern again this evening.

This year we will celebrate the signing of the Treaty of Rome 60 years ago.  Competition rules, including state aid rules, have been part of the treaty from the very first day.  I have the privilege of dealing with legislation dating back to the very early days of the European Economic Community, now the European Union.  The reason it goes back so far is that the founders knew that there could not be a successful single market without a level playing field and fair competition.  They knew that without state aid rules, companies based in smaller countries might find it difficult to compete if they had to compete with companies from bigger countries with deep pockets which would be willing to let taxpayers to pick up the bill.  Every small country realises it cannot hope to win a subsidy race against bigger countries.  When Ireland and Denmark joined the European Union in 1973, they entered an organisation which they knew would give small countries a fair chance of making it.  The founders also knew that without state aid rules, governments would be able to use subsidies and special tax breaks to create barriers between countries.  State aid rules have helped to make the Single Market what it is - an open and fair market.  Efficiency, skills, innovation and tradesmanship decide if a country makes it.  They are the keys to success.  Ireland which has a highly educated workforce and a welcoming business environment has understood better than any other country during the decades how to turn membership of the Single Market into prosperity and economic well-being.<\/p><p> In these days, I think that we all, at least I do, feel the uncertainty coming from the political situation, in particular Brexit.  I do not think that it can be in doubt that the Single Market, with 27 strong members in it, will continue to be the basis of our prosperity, because the Single Market is the jewel of our co-operation.  It must not only be, but also remain and develop, as a market where small, medium and big companies compete on equal terms and are being treated equally as well as the countries whose flags they carry.  This is why enforcing state aid rules is as important today as it was when the treaty was signed when it came into force almost 60 years ago.<\/p><p> Our decisions on tax rulings are being appealed by companies and Governments involved, so it would not be appropriate for me to go into the details of the legal arguments at this point.  This is now before the European courts.  I am very glad to have this chance to explain how we have gone about our work on aid and tax rulings.  The European courts made it clear back in the 1970s that preferential tax treatment could be state aid in the same way as grants given in cash because both undermine the level playing fields by giving companies benefits that are not available to other companies.  The Commission gave guidance back in 1998 on when corporate taxation can lead to state aid and the European court confirmed in 2006 that dealings between group companies had to be on market terms to avoid state aid.  The rules on state aid and special tax treatments have been clear for quite some time.<\/p><p> What has changed recently is that multinational companies have been pushing the boundaries of aggressive tax planning.  Since that came to light, we have investigated tax ruling practices all over Europe.  Our investigation into the Irish tax rulings began in 2013 after Apple told a US Senate hearing about what it called a tax incentive arrangement with Ireland.  That gave reason to ask questions here in Europe and also started the Apple case.  Now our work on tax rulings has gone far beyond the Apple case and far beyond Ireland.  We have asked every member state, big as well as small, for information on tax rulings and we have followed up with in-depth investigation in the most serious cases.  This investigation has been carried out with the full involvement of the companies and the governments concerned.  They have led to four decisions so far involving aid to Fiat in Luxembourg, to Starbucks in the Netherlands, to a number of large companies in Belgium, and to Apple here in Ireland.  Those decisions should help the Single Market to work better by giving all companies, big and small, a chance to compete on equal terms.  We will continue our work to make sure that there are effective deterrents against corporate tax planning practices that are against state aid rules. <\/p><p> That being said, two things are important.  First, tax rulings are completely legal.  We hold nothing against tax rulings as such.  They can give companies the clarity that they need and they can tell them how certain tax rules are being applied.  The only thing we want to ensure is that they are not being used as a tool to give selective advantage, for example to rubber-stamp a way of allocating profits that do not match economic reality.<\/p><p>Second, these cases do not mean that the Commission is claiming authority in tax matters as such, internationally or nationally.  That is not our business.  Ireland has the sovereign right, like any other member state, to determine its own corporate tax system and set its own corporate tax rate.  What we are dealing with is special treatment for certain companies.  Fighting aggressive tax planning practices should make countries such as Ireland and others an even better place in which to invest.  Ireland has a highly skilled workforce and very modern infrastructure, just to mention two of its benefits.  It has chosen, as is the sovereign right of the Irish Parliament and Government, to set a low corporate tax rate.  Enforcing state aid rules means that Ireland and other member states can also offer a place in the Single Market that is open and fair at the tax rate they decide to set.  <\/p><p> I hope I have not wasted members' time or spoken for too long.  I am very happy to have had the chance to make this opening statement.  I look forward not only to taking members' questions but also to hearing their points of view.  I may be even able to answer some of their questions, but that remains to be seen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017013100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Margrethe Vestager","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485865800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.

She said this morning and previously - we also heard this from other Commissioners and spokespersons - that the European Commission respected Ireland's sovereign right to determine its own corporation tax system and that she saw this very much as a separate issue in the application of state aid rules, but I put to her the suspicion among many, but not all, representatives in Ireland - they include me - that those rules are being used as a veil to undermine Ireland's corporation tax system.  I say this because I look at what the Commission as a whole is doing.  Only last week the Commissioner's colleague, Commissioner Moscovici, was here selling the virtues, as he saw them, of the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, whereby the way taxable profits were calculated would be determined under new rules, the allocation of profits across countries would be determined at EU level and Ireland, for example, would not be allowed to have three tax rates.  From my point of view, in the context of this debate, there is a strong suspicion that there are elements within the Commission that are seeking to undermine Ireland's corporation tax system.<\/p> <p>  On the state aid finding and the issue of selectivity, I want to ask the Commissioner about how the Commission reached the conclusion that the Revenue Commissioners had applied selective treatment to Apple which was not available to any other company operating in Ireland.  That was the only basis on which it could have reached the conclusion that there had been the provision of state aid, that it was selective, preferential and not available to anybody else.  Can she tell us how the Commission reached that conclusion and how it compared, for example, the treatment of Apple with that of other companies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017013100002#C00500","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1485865800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>First, the principle is very important because there needs to be a watertight decision on state aid.  Basically, we look backwards to see what happened in the past.  Sometimes we look forward when a state aid scheme is notified to us and approval given, for instance, where it is to support renewable energy projects or the roll-out of broadband in rural areas, but otherwise, as in these cases, we look backwards.  We are doing this under legislation that was included in the treaty almost 60 years ago.  If anyone wants to change the tax system in Europe or a European country, it is done through the front door at the Council.<\/p><p>The Parliament would be heard but it is for the Council to decide.  It has to be done by unanimity, which means the Irish Government has its full right to take whatever position it wishes on the legislation proposed.  My colleague, Mr. Pierre Moscovici, appeared before this committee and I should not repeat why the Commission tabled the proposal on a common corporate tax base, public country-by-country reporting and the lot.  The state aid control goes back decades.  The first guidance was give back in 1998.  It has been approved by the courts in 2006, long before there was any movement on European tax matters as such.  It is not for the Commission.  It is for the member states.<\/p><p> The second point I want to add, one aspect I very much admire, is the fact that Ireland is very much leading when it comes to the implementation of the OECD work to make a more global tax community.  That is very much appreciated and it does not question the sovereign right of the national authority to set its own tax system either.<\/p><p> The question of selectivity is very important because if there is no selectivity then there is no state aid.  That is one of the four criteria for us to use when we look for state aid.  The point about the tax ruling is that it is, by nature, specific.  It is a ruling that is directed exactly to the company asking for the ruling and it is only applicable to the company which has the ruling.  That is why, by nature, when one finds a tax ruling there is selectivity.  That does not necessarily lead to the fact that there is also illegal state aid because then other criteria must be fulfilled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017013100002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Margrethe Vestager","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485865800,"counter":175,"content":"<p>With respect, Ms Vestager did not answer my question about the basis for her conclusion in this particular case that there was selective treatment that amounted to state aid.

In the case of Apple, one had two non-resident companies and the apportionment of profits between the Irish branch and head office.  Without comparing how Apple was treated by way of an advance opinion <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>a whole host of other companies, how could the Commission conclude that it was selective, it was preferential and it amounted to state aid?

This is what they do, and what we have been doing is to look into this tax ruling to see does this make sense and what does that in the tax ruling actually mean in economic sense as to where the profits are recorded.  This is specific to Apple because what happens is that Apple does not pay the 12.5%, which is the corporate taxation rate in Ireland.  That is what makes the case and the tax ruling selective.  They are selective by nature and what one sees in the tax ruling is that this is specific to the situation of Apple to allow the company to pay a different amount of tax because of the very nature of the methodology in the tax ruling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017013100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Margrethe Vestager"},{"type":"speech","time":1485865800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>How does the Commission know that dissimilar methodology and characteristics were used by the Irish Revenue in issuing advance opinions to other multinationals that operated in Ireland?

When we look at the transfer pricing rulings, what we are looking for is whether they are backed up by documentation.  When a transfer pricing ruling is done, one wants to see that the prices used approximate market prices.  Otherwise, a stand-alone company that has do its input shopping on the market and sell its products on the market would be highly disadvantaged.  Of course, this is what we are looking for.  In a number of cases, we find that the work is very well done and that there are no concerns, no further questions to be asked and no strings attached.  The thing in this ruling and the reason we reached the result we did was that we found that no questions were asked and there was nothing to back up the idea that the profits should actually be made in the headquarters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017013100002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Margrethe Vestager"},{"type":"speech","time":1485865800,"counter":193,"content":"<p>There was a reference in the report to when Apple began to negotiate its tax liability in 1990.

It is very strange for me to be on this side of the room but new politics is throwing up new situations.  I am pleased to be here and happy that the joint committee is examining this issue.<\/p> <p>  The exploitation of people on low hour contracts, especially in the retail sector but also across many other sectors is an important issue.  This Bill will allow workers to apply for a contract that is reflective of their actual working week.  Unfortunately we have far too many instances of workers who were on contracts of 15 hours or less for ten years, working 30 and 40 hours week in and week out.  This is a way for some companies to exploit their workers.<\/p> <p>  This Bill offers a solution.  It seeks to provide that a worker or his or her trade union representative or a representative acting on his or her behalf is entitled after six months of continuous employment with his or her employer to make a request in writing to be moved to a weekly band of hours, reflective of his or her actual working week, as set out in the Bill.  Under the existing legislation, Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, there is no obligation on an employer to consider such a request.  It does not allow workers to demand additional hours.  It merely gives a contractual basis to the actual existing working week relationship that is already in place.  The Bill provides that the employer must comply or set out that it is not economically feasible.  The employer must demonstrate that the business is experiencing severe financial difficulties, such that there would be a substantial risk that the workers would be made redundant if the hours were granted, the sustainability of the business would be adversely affected or the business could not sustain the increased level of hours.  In the event that a worker disagrees with the employer's refusal on the grounds set out in the legislation, the complaints procedure would be through the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p> <p>  The Bill also includes an obligation on the employer to inform all employees of the overall availability of working hours by displaying this information in a prominent position in the place of employment.  The Bill is earnest in its intent and would fix a problem which many low paid workers and workers who are on low hour if and when contracts in this State.  More specifically it looks to the business model built on a system of low hour contracts.  It is simply unjustifiable for employers to keep the bulk of their staff on close to full time hours but signed up to part-time contracts, as it pushes these people into poverty and into a position where they cannot plan for their families and their futures.  It creates undue hardship to mothers who struggle to deal with child care arrangements and families cannot be sure of what they will earn from one end of the month to the other.  It is used by some employers as a punitive technique - complain and one's hours will be cut with no legal recourse.  It should be noted that research by EUROSTAT, the Nevin Economic Research Institute and others shows that people on low hours or temporary contracts are more at risk of being low paid.  We also know that precarious working conditions are on the increase across a rising number of sectors, including the Civil Service, nursing and teaching.  There is an onus on the State to regulate the labour market and ensure that workers' rights, in terms of pay and conditions are protected in law.  The idea that the market must be free to compete without undue interference ignores the reasonable voice of workers and the right to be treated with respect and dignity.  Low pay, precarious working hours and the chipping away of workers' rights are bad for the economy and for society.  We could paper the walls of this committee room with the amount of research reports which consistently show the link between precarious work, precarious hours, if and when contracts, zero hour contracts and the growth of inequality.  An unregulated labour market is in nobody's interests.  It dehumanises workers, puts huge pressure on the State in terms of social transfers, reduced people's disposable income and impoverishes households and children.  This is absolutely unnecessary and serves an employment model whereby employers want to have it both ways.  On the one hand they want to use the full weight of their power and political influence to skew the balance of power in their favour by refusing workers real and meaningful access to collective bargaining, while on the other they argue against protective, statutory measures around pay and conditions to set a basic threshold of decency.<\/p> <p>  Go raibh maith agat.

As Deputy Quinlivan said, and as I hope all members will agree, the situation at the moment is entirely unreasonable.  There are many workers in this State who are working 30 or 40 hours a week for some companies, often for five years, ten years or more, yet their contracts are for ten or 15 hours a week.  The Bill essentially allows workers to have contracts which are reflective of the actual hours that they do.  It allows for the Workplace Relations Commission to be the adjudicating body in this regard.  At the moment we have situations where people are stuck in low hour contracts but are actually doing more hours for year upon year, but they have no recourse to ask for their contracts to be changed.  The Bill allows for the employee to make a reasonable request of their employer, if after six months the average hours worked are less than what is in their contract, to move into the band that is reflective of their actual hours.  If that is refused then there must be reasonable grounds for a refusal, which are set out in the Bill.  It then goes to the Workplace Relations Commission which adjudicates on it.  Obviously it would have to look at a whole range of issues.<\/p> <p>  In respect of some of the criticism of the Bill, no Bill is without its shortcomings.  We did say on Second Stage that if people were genuinely supportive of the broad thrust of the Bill, but had concerns around some elements, that we would be open to amendments on Committee Stage.   If there are any criticisms of the interpretations of different elements of the Bill rather than its substance, then I obviously want to hear those.  We are very much open to supporting amendments in that regard.  We are very clear, and were very clear on Second Stage, that this Bill does not allow workers to ask for an increase in their hours.  That is an entirely different issue, one that this committee should perhaps consider.  The issue of people who are on low hour contracts and who want to work more hours is a separate issue, but we are very clear about what this Bill does.  All the Bill does is it allows workers, who have been working for an average of 30 or 40 hours per week for six months or more in this State, to have contracts that are reflective of the hours that they do.  There are lots of other issues such as zero hour contracts, precarious work and requests for additional hours.  They are all very reasonable issues and would be good issues for this committee to deal with, but they are not what this Bill seeks to address.  It simply seeks to address the issue of \"if and when\" contracts.  <\/p> <p>  It is true that Tesco, Penneys and Marks and Spencer have, through dialogue with Mandate, Unite and other trade unions, agreed to use these banded hour contracts.  They do use them and, in fact, have moved from banded hour contracts to more secure contracts, which is what we want.  I hope that everybody here wants a situation where workers have proper terms and conditions of employment and proper contracts which are fair and which reflect the hours that they do.  I hope I have addressed the questions that were asked but I want to be very clear because it has been raised on Second Stage by some who have opposed the Bill, that this Bill is about allowing workers to request additional hours.  It does not allow this and that is certainly not the intention of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017013100002#D00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>If I may I would like to ask the Deputy a question on section 5, which is about displaying notices in the workplace indicating the number of hours being allocated to workers in the forthcoming week or month and which band those hours would fall under.

In many companies we already have situations where rosters of workers' hours are displayed.  We have it in many different workplaces.  One of the concerns that has been raised was the impact that this would have on small employers, that if one employs fewer than five people, it might be difficult.  I do not accept that but that was one of the concerns.  Other people have raised concerns relating to larger employers.  I do not believe it is unreasonable to ask an employer to give notice to workers of the hours that they do.  One of the issues that was raised with us by the trade unions involved was that we have a situation where workers simply do not know what hours they are working from one week to the next.<\/p> <p>  We have also had evidence of exploitation presented to this committee and to other committees in the past by workers of some retail companies, stating that if workers request more hours or if they talk or raise issues about their terms and conditions of employment, they face a punitive sanction by their employer.  One of those sanctions is that their hours could be cut.  It is unreasonable that that is the case.  It is reasonable that workers would know from week to week what their hours are.  If people have concerns around how onerous they believe this might be for some employers then, again, I ask them to bring forward amendments to deal with some of the anomalies that they see, but the principle of workers knowing what their hours will be from week, where there is certainty of hours, is a reasonable request.  It allows people to plan for child care and all of those issues.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017013100002#D00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I would like more clarity about these display notices.

There are some contracts and some workers who know what their hours are on a weekly basis.  They are on fixed hours.  They know that they start at 8.30 a.m. and that they finish at 5.30 p.m., Monday to Friday.  In those circumstances there is no need to display their hours.  In situations where a worker does not know his or her hours from week to week, there are already mechanisms in place where employers will communicate what those hours are.  There has to be, otherwise how would an employee know what hours they do?<\/p> <p>  The problem is that, very often, the workers get the notice too late and it does not allow them to plan for the week ahead.  In situations where there are no set hours, but there is a number of hours although the times may vary, all we are asking is that notices be placed in a manner and form which is appropriate to both the employer and the employee.  That can be worked out in a reasonable way at a local level.  This is one of the many issues that came up.  It is not the biggest issue.  The biggest issue by far was the low hour contracts and the fact that many of these workers are on contracts which are not reflective of the hours that they do.  The problem is, not so much that they are not getting the hours, but that when they raise concerns about different aspects of their employment they can then be subject to sanction by some unscrupulous employers.  I have to say the vast majority of employers are not unscrupulous, and do not engage in these sharp practices, but we have a responsibility to put in place legislation to protect workers from those who do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017013100002#D00600","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for introducing the Bill.  It is a very useful important and useful Bill.  The Deputy says, and I agree with him, that it is quite simple. Keeping it simple is important because I note from the IBEC submission that it is trying to surround it in a lot of complexity so as to suggest that it will be a hard thing to achieve.<\/p><p>It is interesting to think about how the workplace and work practices have changed.  In the 1800s when kids were sent up chimneys, employers complained when the trade unions tried to end the abuse of child labour in factories.  Employers, therefore, are always going to complain about changes to working hours for workers, regardless of their age or personal circumstances.  I think it has been outlined - it is true - that pushing workers into precarious if-and-when or zero-hour contracts deprives them of any hope of a decent life.  They will not be able to take out a loan and know when to arrange child care.  It can cause an enormous amount of stress.  There are some occupations - this will come up in the context of Bus &Eacute;ireann - where one has to have what is called a spare cohort of staff in order that if somebody dies during the night or someone cannot make it in to work, there will be staff who can be relied on to fill in where essential services need to be provided, including ambulance, nursing and transport services, etc.  The industries in which such practices are followed are probably the weakest in terms of union organisation and clearly the ones in which workers are most vulnerable.  In the accommodation sector and hostelries, etc. there is a very high number of women who are generally not unionised or organised.  When we looks at the figures for these sectors we see there was a huge increase in profits following the crash to 2014 but an even sharper increase between 2014 and 2017.  During the same period the use of if-and-when and zero-hour contracts went from a figure 2% to a magnificent 10% of the workforce.  It is the same old mantra - employers never waste a good crisis.  I contend that in arguing against Deputy David Cullinane's Bill the employers are not just saying, \"We had to deal with a crisis;\" rather they want to make them a permanent feature of the workforce and become quite defensive in trying to stop any interference.  Is there any place for tackling not just if-and-when contracts but companies such as Deliveroo which offer bogus self-employment and which state, \"You are not an employee, but these are your hours?\"  One then has to scrap and compete with others to be able to work them.  That is an issue we should be taking on also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017013100002#D00700","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I understand the employer organisations are in Leinster House today and I am sure, therefore, that we will hear from them.

There is an attempt to over-complicate what is a very simple Bill, for which there are reasons from their perspective.  It is welcome, however, that they are here and engaging on the issue, but I hope they will engage in good faith and that if they find flaws in the Bill, as they do, they will understand they have a responsibility to provide what they see as an alternative.

As I said, the Bill is very simple in its intent.<\/p> <p>  There are a range of other issues to be addressed in relation to workers rights and if-and-when contracts.  There is also the issue of zero-hour contracts which has been raised by Teachta Niall Collins and which was raised by his party leader in the D&aacute;il today.  We would support the banning of such contracts.  However, the University of Limerick study showed that it only represented a tiny percentage of the problem.  While it would be good, it would do nothing for those stuck in if-and-when contracts.  There are other issues to do with precarious work, in respect of which I agree there is a strong gender bias in terms of low pay, about which there is no doubt.  All of these issues are worthy of consideration.  However, I do not want any of this to complicate what we are trying to do in this instance.  What we are trying to do, as I have said repeatedly, is, very simply, to allow a worker to have a contract which is reflective of the hours he or she works.<\/p> <p>  My final point to members of the committee and also to business groups which have a difficulty with the concept behind the Bill is that I am not against flexible contracts.  There is a need for such contracts and there are workers who enjoy their benefits, but that is not what is at the heart of the Bill.  We have seen industrial disputes in a number of retail sectors and many here, from all parties and none, have sympathised with the workers involved and stood with them on the picket line and said we have to do something about the issue.  This is a chance to do something about it.  It is a chance to bring forward a Bill, as simple as it is, to provide some assurance for those to whom we are listening that we are dealing with the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017013100002#E00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":415,"content":"<p>As Deputy David Cullinane knows, we are embarking on an engagement process with all stakeholders to try to inform ourselves and get a handle on the problem.

They are not recognised in law.  What we have is a voluntary arrangement with some employers - I have given some examples - negotiated with the trade unions.  In the past they operated low-hour contracts under which some of their employees were to work ten or 15 hours contracts, but they ended up doing more.  Folloiwng negotiations with the trade unions, they have now moved to banded hours on a voluntary basis.  The short answer to the question is that an employee has no right to request that he or she be moved into a band reflective of the hours he or she works.  That is the primary reason we are introducing the Bill.  If it was passed, an employee would be able to take a case to the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p> <p>  There are data available from EUROSTAT and the Central Statistics Office which indicate that one in five workers, or 20%, are in low paid jobs.  There are some data available for if-and-when contracts, including in the the University of Limerick study, but they are quite light.  That raises an issue about the level of interest of the State in dealing with the issue.  One of the good things about the University of Limerick study is that it does shine a spotlight on it.  The Mandate trade union has also carried out some research and its own study.  I do not have the figures to hand, but we can get them.  I am sure Teachta Niall Collins, as a Teachta representing workers, has received representations from people involved in different sectors, not just the retail sector, who are victims of the abuse of low-hour contracts.  I take the point on the lack of data and think the Government agencies need to do more work to provide us with the detail which would help the committee to do its work.

At the moment there is no balance, because workers do not have the right to have a contract reflective of their hours.  Only in circumstances where an employer refuses to grant permission, at the request of the employee, for the person to have a contract reflective of their hours, would it go before the Workplace Relations Commission in the first place.  To me, that would be highly unusual.  If people are working for 30 or 40 hours over a period of six months - I know the Government has said that timeframe is too short - or longer they should have a contract that reflects that.  We should move to a situation where workers working an average number of hours over an agreed time period have that reflected.   If an employer refuses, there must be good grounds for a refusal.  In any situation, and it is not just this situation, where there is conflict between an employee and employer, there must be adjudication.<\/p> <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission was set up with the support of all members of this committee and all parties and none because we need industrial conflict resolution processes.

In any event, just to be very clear, all we are saying here is that the industrial relations body, which is the Workplace Relations Commission, would be the adjudicating body.<\/p> <p>  If anybody here, including Teachta Collins, feels that there is a better way of doing it that would be less onerous on an employer, we are all ears.  We will support any amendments which are tabled that would improve the Bill.  The Deputy made the point in his Second Stage contribution, and I want to welcome it, that he supported the broad thrust of the Bill, and what we were trying to do.  I acknowledge and respect the Deputy has genuine concerns about the impact that it could have on small businesses or businesses generally.  If there is a different way, we would work with members of this committee to make that happen.  We have to be reasonable as well and acknowledge that there must be adjudication processes.

We must be conscious of the impact it has on them as employers and the ability of the companies to be sustainable.  In reality, it does not place any additional financial burden on any company, because they are already giving the workers the hours that they do.  If we were dealing with the issue of banning zero hour contracts and the broader issues of precarious work, I could see then how the impact on businesses would be much greater.  In a situation where the same employers are already giving the workers the hours they are doing anyway, it could be 30 or 40 hours, and all they are doing is giving them a contract reflecting that, that does not put any extra burden on them.

If that is the case, they can put forward amendments to extend the time period.  Personally, I believe that six months is reasonable to get a sense of the average hours worked.  In fact, it is the recommendation that is made in the University of Limerick report.  They are the people who looked at this.  On page 124 of the report, recommendation 4(ii), it states:<\/p><blockquote>For employees with a combination of minimum guaranteed hours and If and When hours, the mean number of hours worked in the previous 6 months (from the date of first hire or from the date of enacting legislation) will be taken to be the minimum number of hours stipulated in the contract of employment.<\/blockquote> <p>That recommendation t is exactly what this Bill does in a nutshell.  One can have a debate on it, on the six months and so on, but UL also looked at the seasonal element and felt that six months was a reasonable time period.

I am drawing on my own experience, because I have worked zero hour contracts.  I worked on the management side in hospitality for many years around the world and also in Ireland.  I was the person who did rosters for people.  I also had experience of working in new businesses, and growing a business from zero to whatever number of employees.  I want to know if there has been any thought process around that part of the economic sector where these new businesses move from the bedroom to the boardroom or the bedroom to the office where a business actually grows.<\/p> <p>  There is also the matter of someone who comes on board at the initial stage.  I know myself from experience that I had to put in a lot of hours at the start of the business, and my hours calmed down as the business progressed, so I was working 60 hours a week, and then it calmed down to 40, 30 or 20 hours a week.  Has there been any consideration of that, in terms of the six month period, or have there been any studies around how long the average is for a new business to get to that threshold where things do calm down?  It may be longer than six or eight months, so somebody has to put in the extra work.

I will deal with the final point first, only the employee can make a request, so that in circumstances where a worker enjoys a flexible contract or is quite happy with their arrangement, there is no change in circumstances.  It is only in situations where communication breaks down between the employee and the employer that a request can be made by the employee.  The Deputy is correct that there are circumstances where employees enjoy flexible contracts and can work a number of different jobs and may not want to move into a band of hours.  This would only apply in circumstances where an employee wants to move into a band and have a contract that reflects his or her hours of work.<\/p> <p>  There are genuine reasons people would want a contract that reflects the hours they work.  Deputy Quinlivan touched on this point.  Many of these workers, notwithstanding the exploitation and threats from some employers which hang over their heads if they raise concerns about their issues, if one goes for a loan or wishes to get a mortgage to buy a home, the banks look for one's contract.  One can give them P.60s, which show that you have worked 30 or 40 hours a week for the year, but if the contract is for 15 hours a week, that is what they base their decision on.   That has real consequences for people.  We have heard at first hand from people who have suffered as a consequence.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the consequences of the timeframe for new businesses.  Again, this will only happen where there is a breakdown in communication and the issue is adjudicated upon by the Workplace Relations Commission.  I am sure that if an employer was able to make the case that as a new start-up business, the viability of the company was dependent on flexibility in respect of the hours and that the hours would reduce when it was up and running, the Workplace Relations Commission is reasonable and has shown itself to be reasonable.  The employer would have an opportunity to set out its case and if it the case that the small business needs people doing additional hours in order to get the business up and running, but the hours will reduce over time, the employer would make that argument and I would hope in those circumstances the Workplace Relations Commission would adjudicate fairly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017013100002#G00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":429,"content":"<p>Deputy Cullinane stated that a business has to set out the financial evidence of why the banded hours contract cannot be put in place.

For those employers who refuse to engage with trade unions, or to engage with their employees on these if and when contracts, leading to industrial disputes because of the serious nature of these contracts, one has to have some mechanism in place.

When I engaged with some of the employer organisations, and I did so in good faith, they were very good at telling us where there is no problem from their perspective but where we know there are problems and when they acknowledge there is a problem, they were not very good at coming up with solutions.  In respect of the issue of low hour contracts, if and when contracts, is the University of Limerick study wrong?  When I stood on picket lines with workers who were affected by this, was this my imagination or were they real people?  We have had many discussions in the D&aacute;il on precarious work and if and when contracts; we all deal with people they affect.

In those circumstances, the worker can ask for a contract that more realistically reflects increased hours.  It is not a case of looking for increased hours regardless of whether those hours are available.  Much of the argument put forward has considered what is done if the party is not in financial difficulty.

I simply will summarise ISME's response to the five particular questions we were asked.<\/p><p>I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. John Barry, who is a member of the national council.  Mr. Barry also runs a human resources consultancy so he can speak as an employer and as an adviser to employers should members wish to put any questions to him.<\/p><p> In response to the five particular questions that the committee asked, the first relates to the prevalence of zero-hour contracts.  Our response last year was that the University of Limerick study establishes no evidence of prevalence.  I am sorry if that sounds like a mouthful but, as employers, we feel that we are entitled to ask the industrial relations machinery of the State to establish the size of the problem before the State enacts legislation or a Member brings forward a Private Members' Bill to address it.  As to whether this form of contract should be banned, we do not believe it should because there is a desire on the part of employees and employers that it should remain in place in certain circumstances.  That is not to say that we support any form of abuse of contracts of this nature where it does occur.<\/p><p> ISME was asked to comment on the flexibilities described in the Bill.  We consider the obligations imposed on employers in this Bill to be excessive, especially the requirement for the employer to estimate all the hours for the week or month ahead and to display these in the Irish and English languages.  We ask the committee to note that - by comparison with the requirements in place under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 - those obligations go considerably beyond what is already provided for.<\/p><p> We were also asked to comment on whether workers should be allowed to request minimum hours.  Consistent with how we answered the fifth question, we take the view that any legislative response to this problem must be informed by evidence.  When we see the evidence of what is happening, we will react fairly to it.  First, there should be an evidence-based analysis of the treatment of workers who are on zero-hour or low-hour contracts.  Second, there should be an evidence-based analysis detailing the failures of the current controls that exist under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and of the enforcement measures that are in place.  This analysis should specifically look at the enforcement measures that are available to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and how those who used to be National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, inspectors but who are now WRC inspectors are failing to address this problem.  There is an obligation on Government and on the members of the committee.  We want a regulatory impact assessment to be carried out before the Bill is progressed.<\/p><p> We do not believe that the remit of the Low Pay Commission should be expanded in order to permit a review of these proposals.  We would like to discover where current legislation is failing or where it is falling down in the context of enforcement.  I would make the general observation that there is a tendency for the House to respond to an identified problem in the workplace by introducing legislation rather than by seeking to understand why the available enforcement measures do not address the problem at hand.  If current enforcement is failing, why do the Members of the Houses believe that introducing more legislation is going to fix the issue?  Look first at what is going wrong and then tell us how the gap needs to be bridged with new legislation.  Let us be honest, employers typically fall in to two categories; those employers who observe and comply with employment law and those employers who do not.  If the Houses legislate without understanding what it is they are legislating for, they are simply increasing the gap between compliant and non-compliant employers and we do not believe anything would be achieved by doing so.  Non-compliant employers are going to ignore any new legislation unless enforcement of the legislation is ensured.  These are the observations of ISME and we are happy to take any questions the members of the committee may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017013100002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McDonnell.

The Irish Business and Employers' Confederation, IBEC, represents more than 7,500 businesses operating in Ireland, from the very largest to the very smallest.  In sharing our thoughts on the Bill, I do not intend to go through the detail of our submission or the answers, which have been circulated to members, nor do we intend to get into any theoretical or ideological discourse.  We shall highlight the issue of why we do not believe this Bill is going to work in the spirit in which it is intended.  We believe that we understand the intention of the Bill is to encourage secure employment.  Regrettably, we do not feel that this legislation is going to satisfy that desire.  We are of the view that it has the potential to undermine more and secure employment.<\/p> <p>  We shall look at a couple of examples of the realities of how people work and the flexibilities that are required on a day-to-day basis.  Consider the position regarding technology companies such as start-ups, whereby we are trying to encourage more entrepreneurship and engagement.  We see situations where people look for the next new client and for opportunities.  As they pitch for that business, they have an opportunity to perhaps take somebody on with a certain number of hours but the employer has no idea what the commitment is going to be or whether that contract is going to come to fruition.  The restrictions proposed in this proposed legislation with regard to flexibility are such that, rather than adding more hours that may not be flexible in the longer term, an employer is much more likely to look at a contracting-out situation as opposed to hiring more employees.<\/p> <p>  I will give another example regarding flexibility.  As we move towards more flexible working opportunities, people are looking for more opportunities to balance their work and personal lives.  Let us consider, for example, the necessity of the maternity leave contract.  This is a situation where a person is paid a top-up by her employer.  It may be a small employment, a great job and the employer may be keen to have that person back on foot of the investment made in her.  Over the course of the maternity leave, somewhere between eight and 12 months potentially, colleagues take up the work.  When that person comes to return to work eight or 12 months later, we would have a situation whereby the proposed legislation, in its current for, might actually have the opposite effect.  As a result, those flexibilities to allow people to engage and take more time off - and to balance the latter - would not be sufficiently elastic to allow those opportunities to come through.  Another example is students who work and have very flexible opportunities to be able to offer their labour to the market.  An employer is going to look at a situation and say they can offer certain hours now.  Unfortunately, the past hours are not necessarily a great predictor of the future.  What has happened previously does not always tell us what is going to happen next.  For example, an employer might hire a student and six months into the term of employment, the student might state that his or her lecture timetable will allow him or her to offer the employer more hours.  The employer, however, will not accept the offer on the basis that an obligation or liability would be created within the business without him or her necessarily knowing - or maybe knowing - what the peaks and trends in the market are going to be or knowing that he or she is not going to be able to maintain or facilitate those hours for the employee in the future.  When we look to see what is the intent behind this proposed legislation, I do not believe that these potential situations are secure employment.  It certainly does not provide opportunities or allow additional opportunities to come through.<\/p> <p>  IBEC is concerned about the ratcheting up of hours and of banded hours.  We are concerned about such an increase in hours where an employer is obliged to demonstrate that the reason they are not giving more hours is because they are in severe financial difficulties.  Members should speak to businesses in their communities and ask them is this appropriate that they should be obliged to publicly state \"I will be in severe financial difficulties if I have to offer these additional hours\".  That is actually not a very good way to save their employment, their businesses and the ongoing employment opportunities for employees within their sectors.<\/p><p>Employers being obliged to appeal to the precariousness of their own finances is clearly an unintended consequence of what this Bill would bring through.<\/p><p> I will give a final example.  Let us take a nursing home under the implications of this Bill.  Obviously, there are different intensities of care required at all times.  There can be very difficult and harsh winters and the recruitment of additional resources can be required to support the needs of the business.  As the crisis passes and one moves into summer and a potentially milder autumn, over that period of months the business has actually contracted in more hours than it might have necessarily needed in the longer term.  With the inflexibilities this Bill would provide, there would be no way of being able to manage those hours and the business would be left in a situation in which there would be more hours available than the work required.  For any manager, that is not a sustainable way to be able to run a business.  Into the longer term, no business is going to be able to manage in that way.  Rather than creating secure employment, that incentivises the employer to have two employees with fewer hours rather than one employee with the opportunity to be able to have a greater amount of secure hours.<\/p><p> The key point is that predictable flexibility is really what any business needs to survive.  We believe this Bill will encourage more sporadic and insecure employment than what we believe to be its intention, which was more secure employment.  We suggest the ability to flex working hours in a more predictable and appropriate way is a better way for people to be employed, to be able to share their labour in the labour force and to be able to flex that labour up and down.  It is important to note the University of Limerick report demonstrated that only 2.6% of employees in the labour market are on variable part-time contracts.  This is highly significant legislation with huge unintended consequences to deal with an issue that perhaps would be better addressed through monitoring and compliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017013100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for her presentation.

Chambers Ireland is the largest business network in the State, representing 10,000 members in every geographic region and economic sector in Ireland.  We are well positioned to understand the concerns of businesses from across the country.  I am not going to read out our full submission but will try to point to some key aspects.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I believe it is important to stress that chambers throughout the country are supportive of employment regulation that works for the benefit of both employers and employees.  It is a truism that businesses need certainty.  Businesses need to know their production cycle, when their liabilities fall due, when their orders need to completed and so on to operate efficiently.  If a business is unable to provide with reasonable certainty a guaranteed number of hours of work for its employees in advance, it is very likely because the business model does not allow them to do so.<\/p> <p>  In our view, the Banded Hours Contract Bill as drafted is unbalanced and ignores the perspective of employers and the realities of business.  The Bill unfairly assumes that employers are withholding higher-hour contracts from employees without good cause.  This negative view of employers and businesses is clearly reflected in the unmanageable requirements this Bill seeks to impose upon all Irish businesses.<\/p> <p>  When considering the introduction of legislation, we must consider what the legislation is intended to address, whether it can actually achieve this intent and whether it is proportional.  This Bill fails to achieve any of these criteria and stands to have negative effects for employers and employees if enacted.  The publication of the University of Limerick&rsquo;s 2015 report on the prevalence of zero-hour contracts and low-hour contracts in the Irish economy found that \"Zero hours contracts within the meaning of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 ... are not extensive in Ireland\".  As such, any increased regulation or legislation to prevent the use of such contracts is disproportionate and unnecessary.  This Bill seeks to implement disproportionate and onerous restrictions on sectors which by their nature require a degree of flexibility and seems to have general applicability regardless of the core structure of employment in an organisation.  It applies to organisations to which hourly-base work has no relevance.<\/p> <p>  I will point out a few specific issues and some definitional aspects of, for example, how to define when a business is experiencing severe financial difficulties.  It is an unmanageable requirement, which has the potential to undermine a business's ability to operate and grow.  The requirement that a business must be experiencing severe financial difficulties to refuse such a request is an extremely unfair burden on a business and does not exempt cases where the business is facing, for example, seasonal downturns or requirements to invest in other areas or simply is at a fragile stage of development or growth.  The Bill fails to provide any flexibility for employers in the managing of their businesses; there is no provision contained in the Bill that allows for employers to move employees back to a lower band where necessary, for example, when trading conditions deteriorate.  Again, outside of a business cycle, the Bill ignores the requirements of businesses most typically engaged in this type of low-hour or flexible-hour employment contracts, such as seasonal or sharp demand-led businesses. <\/p> <p>  The Bill does not take into account the flexibility which often is of benefit to employees and employers.  For example, an employer may alternate extra hours available between staff so that each of them receives a similar increase on top of their contracted hours.  However, under this Bill, the first employee to request an increase might benefit disproportionately.  Banded hours contracts within smaller businesses are more likely to have the effect of reducing the total number of employees rather than increasing the number of hours per employee.  If there is an obligation or perceived obligation on a business to provide increased hours of paid work for an employee regardless of whether there is an actual business need for the additional hours, an employer may take the view that there is less exposure to risk of complaint by simply reducing headcount.  Fewer jobs overall is not something that should result from any legislation in this area.<\/p> <p>  This Bill, while attempting to strengthen employee rights, is more likely to act as a deterrent for businesses when considering entering into employment contracts.  From a business perspective, the requirements of the Bill are so burdensome and overly restrictive that it would incentivise the avoidance of contracted labour.  We are all obliged to deal with the real world, both public representatives and the business community.  In the real world, there is a risk that this legislation will push some employers to move to more informal working arrangements with employees.  The risk of employment moving to the grey economy is not a good outcome for any party.<\/p> <p>  Section 5 of the Bill, which requires that businesses provide information of overall availability of working hours, mandates that such notices be displayed in English and Irish and in other languages where required.  This represents another unfair burden on businesses and this provision can only result in potentially significant increased costs. <\/p> <p>  In conclusion, this legislation is disproportionate, will have significant unintended consequences and is unnecessary.  It is deeply flawed in its approach to employer-employee relations and is more likely to incentivise the avoidance of employment contracts, for example, through outsourcing, or a reduction in jobs creation.  It will also apply to a large number of companies to which hourly work has no relevance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017013100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I now invite questions from the members.

It made no distinction between those who chose to be on variable hours and were satisfied with them - who would refuse additional hours were they to be offered - or whether they were low-paid or precarious.  They will have captured people on very high rates of pay who may be working very small numbers of variable hours, perhaps lecturing or taking up very short periods of specialised nursing care on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis.  We have not considered who is actually being affected in a detrimental way by the issue.  Before we proceed with any legislation, it is important we quantify it.

Part of the reason they are here is that we are examining the Bill.  I am very concerned that an impression would be created that there is not a problem.  We need to identify the size of the problem in a much clearer way than we have to date.  There is a moral guidance.  Whether it is 2% or 20%, people are being abused.  If the law is insufficient to deal with it, the law must be changed.  I am very glad to hear all three parties have engaged with the Department and made submissions.  Clearly, they have suggestions to make.  Regardless of the size of the problem, there is a problem.  Everybody knows and accepts that.<\/p> <p>  ISME and Chambers Ireland have many members who are involved in SMEs.  It may not be such a big problem for IBEC, whose members tend to be bigger employers.  We need their help and guidance as to where the specifics of the Bill are causing problems for them.  I can understand Mr. Talbot's statement that it seems like a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  However, we are trying to find out how best to address it.  The witnesses have engaged with the Minister and I would be very grateful if they could give us some guidance on where they feel we could nuance the Bill's provisions to protect workers.<\/p> <p>  The Bill purports to protect workers who are consistently working longer hours than they are contracted for.  We will get into the nitty gritty to ensure it does that and nothing else.  Some people say six months is too short and maybe a year would be better in order to accommodate the seasonal element about which people have spoken.  In those circumstances, there is an issue that must be addressed.  This is the witnesses' opportunity to give an alternative approach to how it might be addressed.  They have asked us questions and we will have to go and get the answers.  This is our opportunity to ask the witnesses questions and perhaps they might give us some direction and answers.<\/p> <p>  I am struck by a few statements.  With all due respect, a student who is working a certain number of hours and is then going to be available for additional hours, has clearly not been working those hours on contract.  That is what the Bill is supposed to address.  I struggle with the concept that nursing homes take on additional staff in the winter time.  It has not been my experience, although I can fully understand that with people being more ill, in theory they would need more help.  I would be keen to hear from the witnesses on how we can help address the issue, and if not through the Bill, through what mechanism.

We all know this has come about because there is a problem of some employers, maybe, not treating employees fairly.  It has been suggested employers are using this as a form of punishment for employees in different cases.  This is not the original zero-hour contract.  Unfortunately, I can remember the original zero-hour contract, and it came in for the same reason.  In those days, a phone was stuck to a wall and an employee had to remain in a house until a phone call came through to say they could come into work.  This is how the legislation came in.  It is interesting that the Organisation of Working Time Act was introduced in 1997, and all parties - I was included - were invited in around 2000 to come and make presentations on how to improve the Organisation of Working Time Act.  Unfortunately, although very valid comments were made, nothing ever happened.  The Organisation of Working Time Act is the legislation which addresses working hours and to bring in a stand-alone, independent Act without taking account of the obligations of the Organisation of Working Time Act would be inconsistent.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the practicalities of it, leaving aside the seasonal issue, this has come about given that some employers may abuse the arrangement.<\/p><p>The majority of employers do not abuse it.  They are fair and try to treat people fairly.  Some employers may treat people unfairly by using these contracts.  However, if this legislation is introduced, what will it actually do?  It will actually give employers a benchmark against which to work.  If banded contracts are in place, an unscrupulous employer will ensure an employee never works more hours exceeding the banded hours provision, so the employee can never look for increased hours.  That employee will, in turn, lose out on the opportunity for additional hours.  If there is somebody on maternity leave, as was suggested, and an unscrupulous employer felt that person could claim those hours after 42 weeks, that employer will ensure they do not get the opportunity of those hours.  This, in turn, reduces their opportunity to gain more experience in the workplace, learn new jobs and develop themselves within an organisation.  This is the negative side of this.<\/p><p> In reality, we are focusing on the people who abuse this, not the majority of good employers.  They are being penalised because of the minority.  I accept something needs to be done.  Doing it this way, however, is not practical.<\/p><p> Another significant point about this legislation is that there is no mutuality of obligation.  The employee is the only person who can benefit from it.  What happens to the established standard terms and contracts of employment for short-time working, etc?  Are they now overruled by this legislation?  Once a person moves up to banded hours, how are they moved back down again?  These are not addressed in this legislation and have been forgotten about.  It will put an undue onus on the employer again when there is actually legislation dealing with this.<\/p><p> The issue of enforcement was raised.  As was said earlier by a speaker who supports this legislation, the Workplace Relations Commission is good and fair at enforcing industrial relations provisions.  For example, the Industrial Relations Act allows any employee to go to the Workplace Relations Commission if they believe they are being unfairly treated by an employer.  The commission will bring an employer to account.  If an employer is giving somebody a certain number of hours, the Labour Court or the commission will ask why the employee has not received a contract which reflects that.  An employer will have to stand up and justify that.<\/p><p> This proposed legislation only regards a company&rsquo;s financial circumstances.  The fixed-term work Act and other legislation bring in objective criteria, which is more than just the financial condition of the company.  There could be other reasons a company is keeping people's hours down or cannot give them certain hours.  These need to be taken into account if we go down this road.<\/p><p> The issue of notification of hours is already dealt with in section 17 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which states the employer must give notification of working time to an employee.  It is reasonable that people will want to know what they are doing next week, so they can plan their own lives.  People work fewer hours in order to do other things.  We have moved on to atypical working.  We are long since gone from the standard working practices.  People now have multi-arrangements and multi-employments.  For example in the cleaning industry, a person could work 12 hours in one particular contract and work for another company for another 12 hours.  They need certainty and I understand that.  However, what happens if a client says we no longer need that person or we want to reduce hours?  How does the cleaning industry respond to that?  This is very common.  If this proposal sees hours increasing in the cleaning industry, we will see what happened when social welfare changes were introduced several years ago which brought 15 hours working down to 12.5 hours.  Essentially, hours will be cut to avoid these obligations.<\/p><p> All that will happen with this legislation is that those who abuse this - I accept we need to find a way to address those people - will just find another way to abuse it.  The trouble is that every good employer will have to do likewise.  They are not going to employ people or give them extra hours if they think that, in six months time, they will have to guarantee those hours.  Small industries are vulnerable because they do go up and down.  People in them will work more or fewer hours.  In my company, which only employs seven people, I have people who work three days a week.  There will be times, however, when I will have to ask somebody if they could come in for an extra day.  That might happen for six months to cover a contract.  Under this legislation, that person can demand more hours but I might not have the work for them.<\/p><p> Many difficulties will arise from this legislation which aims to resolve what is essentially a small problem in the total workforce.  I accept, however, for those it does affect, it is a big problem.  The financial institutions have to learn that they have to approach these employees in a different way and give them credit.  If someone can show from their P60 that they have consistently worked 15 to 20 hours a week for the past two years, the financial institutions must take that into account.  A banded hours arrangement would effectively do no more than that, however.<\/p><p> My biggest concern about this legislation is that those employers who will find ways around the system will not give people extra hours.  As a result, it will probably deny people the opportunity of getting more experience, more hours at work and developing themselves.  That is my serious concern about taking this matter in isolation.<\/p><p> Instead, we should review the working time Act like as happened in 2000 and ask how we can address this issue.  The facilities are there to address and enforce this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017013100002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1485878400,"counter":463,"content":"<p>IBEC represents a significant number of small and medium-sized companies, both through the SFA, Small Firms Association, and its wider membership.  It is not just an issue that we see for our larger members.<\/p> <p>  This is about the reality of how people work and the flexibilities people want to see in their working lives.  A large number of students work, and need that opportunity, throughout their period of education.  Employers work with them on a flexible basis on what times suit and so forth.  An employer who has to trade on an ongoing basis, and needs some certainty around financial commitments and obligations they may be creating in terms of continuing to flex hours up and down, will have to have certainty within that six-month period as to how many hours they have committed if the likelihood is the employee can tell the employer they have an obligation in terms of the number of hours they flexed up and down to accommodate the employee&rsquo;s needs and earning capabilities during this time period.  Unfortunately, it will reduce an employer's ability to work with the hours somebody might want so as to offer flexibility into the labour market.  That ability to be able to work with somebody's own needs and requirements will be significantly curtailed.  Again, an employer cannot continue to allow an obligation to grow into the long term without having any certainty that they will be able to deliver work to meet the hours they have agreed over a short period.<\/p> <p>  We see this in many sectors, particularly in hospitality and retail.  For example, a local shop situated beside the University of Limerick could be enormously busy during term time but exceedingly quiet outside of it.  Those hours will fluctuate considerably.  Even if the business knows that, in a six-month period, it may have committed more hours than it would be able to give in the next six-month period.  It is the same with hospitality where somebody may work additional hours to cover for a colleague.  Hospitality is also unpredictable.  Many of our members, such as the local pub or the local hotel, tell us about unpredictable surges in trade such as funerals, banquets or family gatherings.<\/p><p>There are unpredictable surges in trade and, over a six-month period, a business may need people to flex up and to be able to flex those hours back down without creating an ongoing commitment into the longer term, because a business has no certainty as to whether those issues or types of events are going to arise again, when they will arise again and for whom.<\/p><p> It is understood that there are issues in terms of compliance.  In every aspect of legislation, there are always issues of compliance.  The major concern for employers is the scale of what is proposed to deal with the issue that is there.  I acknowledge that people do have some difficulties, and they can be severe difficulties.  However, as has already been said, the vast majority of employers have invested in their employees.  It is in their interests to work with their employees and be good employers, particularly given the cost of recruitment, hiring and training in order to secure good employment opportunities for their employees.  The unintended consequence of this Bill will be an inability to be able to flex that work, leading to a situation in which the hours that are provided at the outset will be stuck to very rigidly and will not be able to be flexed up and down.  Therefore, nobody would have the opportunity to increase their hours as their circumstances permit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017013100002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":465,"content":"<p>If I may interject, there is a vote in the Seanad at the moment.

That would be fantastic, but I guess we are not there yet.  I keep coming back to the vulnerability.  We spoke earlier about the vulnerability of small businesses and how they are least able to deal with new regulations and obligations.  Larger companies' pay are not in this general space at all anyway.  However, they have the resources and the skilled HR departments and everything else.  Small businesses are desperately trying to stay alive, manage their cash flows and make some sales.  Adding in new restrictions, regulations, things that have to be posted and converted into Polish and everything else is, for 39 out of 40 jobs, going to end up causing extreme grief and threaten viable businesses, all in order to solve what I think is a relatively small problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017013100002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

It is the Act that currently addresses the whole question of working hours.  I do not see the logic of bringing in a new Act to do this when there is already legislation there that needs to be looked at.  There was a lot of criticism of the Organisation of Working Time Act back in 2000.  To be quite honest, it was a waste of time going in and making presentations on it, because those presentations are still collecting dust somewhere.  Nothing has changed in the Act with all of its imperfections.  We have all had to work with that Act in the meanwhile.  The Labour Court has done its job to try to make the Act reasonably applicable.  It was a badly-written Act in the first place, but it is the Act that deals with these issues.  My view is that that is where this matter should be going, rather than as a separate stand-alone Act.<\/p> <p>  As I said, the enforcement side of the Industrial Relations Act allows the adjudicators and the Labour Court to recommend what they regard as just and equitable in the circumstances.  The Labour Court is given a huge remit in dealing with employee disputes, including if an employee feels they are being unfairly treated at work because they are not getting either guaranteed hours or the hours have been unfairly distributed.  A classic claim to the Labour Court is about the unfair distribution of overtime hours, for example, and things like that.  Those issues can be dealt with and addressed by the Labour Court.  As was said by the previous presenter, the Labour Court is very fair.  He has said that himself.  It has its finger on the pulse and can deal with these issues.  While I would say its recommendations are only recommendations and are not binding, they carry an awful lot of moral support.  Certainly, an employer generally does not like to go to the Labour Court and have a recommendation against it that it then ignores.  All of its employees can then see that it is ignoring the Labour Court.  We have the resources already.  We do not need to be creating a whole new horse for this when have the horse.  I am simply saying that we should take a practical look at that, use it and not reinvent the wheel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017013100002#N00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":473,"content":"<p>What about the engagement with the author or authors of the UL report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017013100002#N01000","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1485878400,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I had occasion to engage with the UL authors as they carried out their research for this particular report.  They interviewed me and a colleague in IBEC about some of the issues that came up.  I had a number of concerns and questions for them about the interview on the basis that the questioning took on a remit well beyond the remit that the report had, which was contracts of less than eight hours.  There was concern around the fact that all types of variable-hours contracts, including the full-time shift patterns of people on very significant rates of pay, were all being collated into the one report, which again was way beyond the scope of the report's remit.  All of the information that was being transmitted was anecdotal.  As the issue had arisen, we did not have any facts around how many people were on zero-hours contracts or very low-hours contracts.  That is what UL was tasked with determining.<\/p> <p>  In actual fact, by coming to ourselves, ICTU and the various unions, we did not have that information or we would have already supplied it.  Therefore, it was very much a conversation around what we thought, what our opinion was on how many variable-hours contracts there are or why there are variable-hours contracts.  There was a lot of discourse around what the difference is between as and needs, if and when, casual contracts and variable-hours contracts.  They are all very different and discrete types of working, but were all conflated into one in the report.  My understanding, when I asked the question, was that UL did not carry out any direct survey to determine who was on variable hours, what the terms of those variable-hours contracts were and how many people wanted more hours, would accept more hours or were dissatisfied with the distribution or assignment of hours.  That information is still not available to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017013100002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1485878400,"counter":475,"content":"<p>We also engaged with the University of Limerick research team when it was compiling the report.
