This represents an increase of &euro;34 million and is a 5.6% increase on funding provided to the Agency in Budget 2014. <\/p>  <p>  This funding increase demonstrates that, despite the budgetary constraints, this Government remains strongly committed to delivering the critically important support and reforms needed to supporting Ireland&rsquo;s children and families.

In December, I notified Tusla of its funding allocation for 2015 and on foot of this, Tusla prepared its Business Plan for this year.<\/p>  <p>  Like all State agencies, Tusla has reviewed the scope to make savings across various areas of expenditure and to ensure that services are developed where possible.  It has identified areas where resources need to be provided and it has also identified areas where available funding can be used to better effect to support service delivery.<\/p>  <p>  The key focus has been on ensuring that services are streamlined and rationalised where necessary, with any overlap in service provision and duplication of costs eliminated. I have specified to Tusla that they should do everything to defend front-line services to children.  This has implications for some organisations when services do not reflect the statutory remit of Tusla at this time. <\/p>  <p>  I am very supportive of the approach that Tusla is adopting in terms of the reform of services, the targeting of funding at front-line services and the work being done in developing a new approach to the commissioning of services.<\/p>  <p>  I want to assure the House, that in furtherance of the Government&rsquo;s policy and commitment to child and family services, Tusla will continue to work very closely with service providers in managing budgets and in the delivery of services to children and families across the country.

To help address the issue, funding of more than a quarter of a billion euro is provided annually by my Department to support the implementation of a number of childcare support programmes that assist parents in accessing quality childcare services.  This funding, which is in addition to the direct support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit, supports more than 100,000 children each year.  <\/p>  <p>  The most significant of these programmes is the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, which represents an annual investment of approximately &euro;170 million, enables 67,000 children each year to benefit from free pre-school provision.  The standard weekly capitation payment for each eligible child enrolled is &euro;62.50 with a higher capitation of &euro;73 paid for eligible children enrolled in services where staff hold higher childcare qualifications.  Parents who qualify for support under this programme can have their annual childcare costs reduced by as much as &euro;2,375 for each qualifying child. <\/p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention programme provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families. In the region of 25,000 children benefit  from this programme each year. In the case of full day care, parents can have their weekly childcare costs reduced by up to &euro;95 per week.   <\/p>  <p>  Further childcare support is provided under a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to the workforce or availing of education or training opportunities. These include the:<\/p>  <p>  - Childcare Education and Training Supports programme for parents availing of training and education courses; <\/p>  <p>  - Community Employment Childcare programme for parents in Community Employment schemes; and <\/p>  <p>  - After-School Childcare programme for after-school care.   <\/p>  <p>  The high level of funding to support these childcare programmes has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary position that has prevailed in recent years.  To ensure that all the benefits of current (and future) investment are fully realised, it must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. Accordingly, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare.

Parents who qualify for support under this programme can have their annual childcare costs reduced by as much as &euro;2,375 for each qualifying child. <\/p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention programme provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families, and in the case of full day care, parents can have their weekly childcare costs reduced by up to &euro;95 per week for each qualifying child.   <\/p>  <p>  Further childcare support is provided under a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to the workforce or availing of education or training opportunities. These include the:<\/p>  <p>  - Childcare Education and Training Supports programme for parents availing of training and education courses; - Community Employment Childcare programme for parents in Community Employment schemes; and <\/p>  <p>  - After-School Childcare programme for after-school care.   <\/p>  <p>  For all of these programme, the maximum contribution a parent makes to the cost of childcare is capped at &euro;15 per week for part-time and after-school care and &euro;25 per week in the case of full-day care.   <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to maintaining and improving the quality of childcare services and I consider that the funding provided by my Department through the childcare programmes is the most effective way of achieving higher quality while continuing to support parents with the cost of childcare. <\/p>  <p>  To ensure that all the benefits of current (and future) investment are fully realised, it must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. Accordingly, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare. This Group, which is considering the needs of children in their early years as well as the needs of school-going children, will consider a variety of mechanisms to address the objectives set out in the Deputy's question.  The Group is expected to submit its final report to Government in June 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700077#WRA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection Services","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700077#WRA02350"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[20495\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700077#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"in view of recent reports on child protection services in County Laois and County Offaly, if he is satisfied that these services are sufficiently well staffed, funded and fit-for-purpose; that the children in these counties are protected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>I have been in regular contact with Tusla regarding the situation that has emerged in Laois\/Offaly, including meetings with the Chair and senior management.

Where Tusla identifies underlying problems, for example mental health issues, it can refer the family to the appropriate services.

Under these Acts, the Child and Family Agency has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. The definition of a child contained in both Acts is that of a person under 18 years of age who is not or has not been married. A child may be brought into care in accordance with the Child Care Act 1991 on a voluntary basis or, if necessary, a child may be received into care by Court order.<\/p>  <p>  Young people leaving the care of the State at 18 years of age are entitled to an aftercare service. Aftercare is the term used to describe the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of such young people to assist them in making the transition to independent living. <\/p>  <p>  The Child Care Act 1991 provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years. This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged, up to the age of 23 years.<\/p>  <p>  The situation regarding leaving care in Scotland differs from the Irish situation. The majority of young people leave care in Scotland between the ages of 16 and 18 years. The provisions of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014 are being introduced on a phased basis. The Act provides for a number of supports to those in care and care leavers. These include the introduction of &lsquo;continuing care&rsquo;, a new legal term to describe care leavers who remain in their &lsquo;looked after&rsquo; (care) placement up to the age of 21. Local authorities have a new duty to provide care leavers with a continuation of the kinds of support they received prior to leaving care. In essence, the young person has ceased to be looked after but the local authority continues to provide them with a looked after placement and any necessary support until their 22nd birthday. This is akin to aftercare services for children leaving care in this State.<\/p>  <p>  93% of children in care in Ireland are in foster care. At the end of December 2014, 58% of the 1,685 young people aged 18 to 23 years in receipt of an aftercare service were in full-time education. A significant number of these care leavers are supported financially to remain living with their foster carers, in addition to having access to an aftercare worker.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare in Ireland. The approach proposed is to impose a statutory duty on the Child and Family Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person. It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700077#WRA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700077#WRA03150"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[19800\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700077#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he had any engagement with the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes; if he will ensure that any issues related to those of mixed race will be adequately addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>The Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters was established by Government Order on the 17th February 2015. <\/p>  <p>  I met with the three Commissioners in early February to personally thank them for agreeing to take on this important and challenging work.

During this period the School Completion Programme provided targeted support to approximately 36,000 children and young people at risk of early school leaving across 124 community based programmes.<\/p><p>Tusla also provides a range of services that offer advice and support to families.  This includes over 100 family resource centres.  The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit. The Programme emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700078#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700078#WRB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[19539\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700078#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide an update regarding the investigations into mother and baby homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":98,"content":"<p>The Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters was formally established by Government Order on the 17th February 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with its comprehensive Terms of Reference, the Commission is tasked with thoroughly examining the experience of mothers and children resident in Mother and Baby Homes and a representative sample of County Homes.

Tusla's policy is that all children coming into care and those in high risk placements have an allocated social worker.

Choices available to individuals (after taking the tax-free retirement lump sum) include the option to purchase an annuity with the remaining funds, to receive the balance of the pension funds in cash (subject to marginal rate income tax, as appropriate), to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), once certain conditions are met. <\/p>  <p>  Finance Act 2014 introduced changes relating to the imputed distribution rate for certain ARFs as well as provisions to allow owners of AMRFs to draw-down up to 4% of the assets of such funds on one occasion in each year instead of the facility to draw-down the accrued income and gains of such funds, as had applied heretofore. <\/p>  <p>  A system of imputed distributions of the value of ARF assets was introduced because an internal review of tax relief for pensions provision undertaken by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners in 2005 found that the ARF option was largely not being used as intended to fund an income stream in retirement but was, instead, being used to build up funds in a tax-free environment over the long-term. In an effort to counteract this, Budget and Finance Act 2006 introduced, with effect from 2007, an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets of an ARF on 31 December each year (subsequently changed to 30 November each year). The notional distribution arrangement only applies where the ARF owner is 60 years or over for the whole of a tax year. The notional distribution was phased in over the period 2007 to 2009, with 1% applying in 2007, 2% in 2008 and the full 3% from 2009. The notional amount is taxed at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate. Funds actually drawn down by ARF owners are credited against the imputed distribution in that year to arrive at a net imputed amount, if any, for the year. Budget and Finance Act 2011 increased the rate of the notional distribution to 5% of the value of the assets of an ARF, while Finance Act 2012 further increased the rate to 6% in respect of ARFs with values over &euro;2 million.<\/p>  <p>  Finance Act 2014 reduced the annual imputed ARF distribution rate from 5% to 4% for ARF owners in the age group 60 to 70 years whose ARFs have assets of &euro;2 million or under. This change was introduced in order to reduce the risk that individuals in that age group might outlive the funds in their ARFs. <\/p>  <p>  As regards the changes to AMRF access,\u00a0I should explain by way of background, that under the flexible options at retirement arrangements, where an individual in a DC pension savings arrangement is under age 75 at the time of exercising the option and does not meet the guaranteed pension income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum, that individual must place a maximum \"set aside\" amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension funds if less than &euro;63,500 after taking the retirement lump sum) in an AMRF or purchase an annuity with the &euro;63,500.<\/p>  <p>  Any amount of remaining pension funds in excess of &euro;63,500 can be invested in an ARF with access to those funds at the owner's discretion (subject to tax, at the marginal rate and having regard to the imputed distribution requirements). <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension \"nest-egg\" to provide for the latter years of his\/her retirement. Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation. While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, up to now, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate. <\/p>  <p>  I decided to change the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year up to the point at which the AMRF becomes an ARF. This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided.<\/p>  <p>  Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years. In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy. <\/p>  <p>  The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary pension income prior to reaching age 75. This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has not purchased a pension annuity in the meantime.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals whose AMRF represents a less significant part of their retirement funds and whose circumstances would allow for greater investment risk and, therefore, potentially greater investment returns will be limited to the 4% level of asset draw down. However, this draw down will also be available to them for periods when their AMRF investments make losses or returns of less than 4% of the value of their AMRF assets and where, under the previous arrangement, they would not have been able to make a draw down or the draw down would have been of a lesser value than will now be permitted. I consider that the change will be to the benefit of AMRF owners, generally, over the medium to longer term and I have no plans to reverse it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700079#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland Investigations","counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700079#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[20895\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700079#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total fines imposed by the Central Bank of Ireland on financial institutions since 2011; and if he will provide details of each fine.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":160,"content":"<p>Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended,\u00a0provides the Central Bank of Ireland\u00a0with the power to impose sanctions in respect of the commission of a prescribed contravention by\u00a0regulated financial service providers and by persons concerned in the management of a regulated financial service provider.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Since the commencement of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, the Central Bank may impose a monetary penalty upon a body corporate or an unincorporated body of the greater of &euro;10,000,000 or an amount equal to 10 per cent of the turnover of a firm.

The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd. It is a unique opportunity for farm participants to improve the efficiency and profitability of their herds, with significant state support.<\/p><p>It can also make an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the national herd and has been approved as an agri-environment measure under the Rural Development Programme. The six year commitment arises from the requirements of the EU Rural Development Regulation under which this scheme is co-funded by the EU and Irish taxpayers. Article 28 of this Regulation stipulates that all agri-environmental schemes must be at least 5 years in duration and farmers will be familiar with multi-annual schemes such as GLAS and REPS where similar conditions apply.<\/p><p>The six year timeframe for the BDGP provides a guaranteed and stable payment for suckler farmers, allowing them to plan and budget on their farms for the duration of the programme. It is important to note that the penalty system includes appropriate tolerances where only minor non-compliances occur and no penalty will apply in these cases. In more serious cases there must of course be an applicable penalty. However, on balance, I am satisfied that the approach proposed reflects the most proportionate response consistent with the Regulations. The requirement to seek full refund of payment only applies in the event of permanent withdrawal from the scheme. As always in such cases, <i>force majeure <\/i>clauses have been included in the Terms and Conditions where withdrawal is due to circumstances beyond the applicant&rsquo;s control such as illness or disease. There is also a provision included for transfers by gift or inheritance whereby the transferee can decide to take over the commitments or exit from the programme entirely.<\/p><p>Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 per hectare for the first 6.66 payable hectares under the scheme, and &euro;120 per payable hectare after that. Payment to scheme participants is on the basis of costs incurred and income foregone for each of the actions undertaken. All of the costs to the farmer, including in terms of time and effort, have been factored into the payment for the farmer as agreed with the European Commission. The payment includes a cost associated with the tissue tag sample and subsequent processing, and this genotyping cost will be deducted at source from the farmer&rsquo;s payment. The cost of the genotyping will be finalised following the conclusion of a public tendering process undertaken by the ICBF in relation to laboratory analysis, tissue tags and the DNA chip. It is expected that this will result in a reduced sampling\/genotype cost compared to the 2014 scheme<\/p><p>The number of animals to be genotyped each year will be equal to 60% of the number of calved suckler cows that the applicant had on his\/her holding in 2014 &ndash; known as the applicant&rsquo;s &ldquo;reference animals&rdquo;. The number of &ldquo;reference animals&rdquo; will be advised to applicants upon acceptance into the scheme. For example, an applicant with 15 reference animals in 2014 must have sufficient animals to genotype 9 cows\/heifers\/calves\/stock bulls, in each year of the programme, without repetition. In specific circumstances, 2015 may be used as the base year. <\/p><p>While the level of testing required has increased compared to the 2014 pilot scheme, the payment to the farmer has also increased significantly so the percentage of the overall payment related to genotyping is broadly the same under both schemes. The 15% genotyping in 2014 was undertaken to develop the training population for genomic which provides the platform for the more widespread application of genomics and higher level of genotyping now made possible under the BDGP. <\/p><p>The 60% genotyping requirement reflects the need to genotype a high percentage of female calves at birth within scheme herds and to genotype female animals introduced from non-scheme herds so that sufficient 4 and 5 star animals can be identified. The 60% requirement will also include pedigree males and cows for ongoing research and knowledge development. This increased level of genotyping also adds value to the breeding indexes.<\/p><p>The BDGP is a substantial commitment to the beef sector over the next 6 years and I will continue to monitor its implementation to ensure that it is fit for purpose. The BDGP, like all RDP Schemes, will be subject to mid-term review. If aspects of the scheme can be improved in the future, I will seek to address these issues in consultation with the EU Commission. For now I am satisfied that the scheme provides the long term support that is required to ensure the future sustainability of our suckler herd, within the parameters laid down by the relevant regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700080#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licence Applications","counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700080#WRD01450"},{"type":"question","counter":222,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[20962\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700080#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"with reference to the renewal of an aquaculture licence (details supplied), the reason statutory consultation requests have not been issued to relevant parties; the reason this has not been completed to date, since the renewal was received in 2009; when these consultation requests are expected to be sent; the time frame for completion of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[20963\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700080#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding an aquaculture licence (details supplied); if he will clarify the consultations held in respect of this matter; when a decision is expected; his plans to introduce a new credit facility for aquaculture companies struggling to access credit from banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":224,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 80 together.<\/p><p>The application referred to by the Deputy is in respect of a site located within Lough Swilly which is designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive and a Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive (Natura 2000 sites).<\/p><p>As previously advised my Department is constrained by law from issuing or renewing aquaculture licences for sites located within Natura 2000 areas until such time as an `Appropriate Assessment' has been conducted to assess the potential effects of the proposed aquaculture activities on the conservation objectives for that Natura site.

There is also a provision included for transfers by gift or inheritance whereby the transferee can decide to take over the commitments or exit from the programme entirely.<\/p><p>While the BDGP is an area based payment, the area upon which payment is made is based on the number of suckler cows calving in the herd in 2014. Using a range of 2012-2014 stock numbers would disadvantage some applicants, and on the basis of AIM calf registration data, would appear to increase the burden of testing on average. It was not possible to select a future date because a scheme approved under the RDP could not provide an incentive for increasing stock numbers. Selecting 2014 also adds a measure of administrative simplicity for farmers that will facility early payments under the scheme. The provisions do, however, allow the use of 2015 as an alternative base on an exceptional basis for new entrants or applicants impacted by force majeure circumstances in 2014.\u00a0 Such farmers should apply for the scheme before the 29 May deadline and the decision regarding whether to use 2015 as basis, where appropriate, will be decided after the closing date for applications. I should also add that the above provisions relate only to the calculation of payment under the BDGP &ndash; there is no restriction on individual farmers increasing their output and cow numbers during the course of the scheme. <\/p><p>The 60% of the herd that will be genotyped each year represents an increase compared to the 15% under the 2014 Beef Genomic Scheme, however the percentage of the overall payment related to genotyping is broadly the same under both schemes.

Under the second method, the details are collected by the Court Registrar where a licence is produced to the Court at the hearing of the offence.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined above, if the licence is produced to the Court, the Court Registrar records the licence number and the number is updated to the Courts Service computer system.<\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has indicated that it is not possible to differentiate between the two methods above to provide statistical data in relation to the number of driving licence numbers actually collected within a Court.  However, the Courts Service has informed me that 7,790 defendants were listed for Court for drink driving prosecutions in 2014 with 983 driving licence numbers recorded.  It should be noted that the information provided by the Courts Service relates to all drink driving prosecutions in 2014, whether or not the summons was served.  In addition, some of the prosecutions may be ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that where an accused is summonsed to appear before a Court in respect of a penalty point offence and is convicted of the offence, if a driving licence is not produced to the Court, the Court Registrar records on the Court Minute Book or on the summons that no driving licence was produced.  The non-production of the driving licence is recorded whether or not the accused appears before the Court.  The Courts Service computer system does not currently support the updating of data in relation to the non-production of driving licences in Court.  I want to assure the Deputy that my Department is in contact with the relevant agencies with a view to ensuring that the most efficient and effective processing and recording of data in respect of non-production of licences is in place. I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service are actively engaged in a process that will facilitate prosecution of those who fail to produce a driving licence or permit and the copy of a licence or permit before the Courts.  The Courts Service and the Garda personnel required, in accordance with agreed procedures, have been identified and it is expected that cases will come before the Courts for hearing in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700081#WRE03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700081#WRE03450"},{"type":"question","counter":304,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[20876\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700081#WRE03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will report on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Operation Learner Driver; the number stopped under this operation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":305,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the matters referred to by the Deputy.

Under the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, only children may be received into care and this can be up to the age of 18 years.  <\/p><p>Children who are received into care, depending on their identified need, may be placed in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, residential care, special care or other placement types.  The majority of these children are in stable placements, with over 92% of children in care currently in foster family setting.  Residential settings represent most of the remaining placements, usually between 5 and 8% of all children in care.  A residential setting will typically have 3 to 4 children in residence, who are usually older teenagers, allowing for their individual needs to be met.  Regulations under the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, underpin a number of safeguards for children in care, including the frequency of reviews of care plans and of visits by social workers to the child's care setting.  In addition there are standards in place for foster and residential placements and there is a regime of regular monitoring and inspections.<\/p><p>Data, made available by Tusla, on children in care are on the basis of the type of care placement that is involved.  Tusla does not provide data on the residence of the child at the time of the referral.  However, feedback from practice information and from the independent inspection regime of the Health Information and Quality Authority shows that the most likely source of risks that lead to a child protection response is located in the wider community.  <\/p><p>Tusla's data shows that in 2013, it received a total of 41,599 referrals, of which 19,407 related to abuse referrals.  Figures to date for 2014 indicate that there had been 14,112 abuse referrals out of a total of 32,687 referrals up to the end of quarter three.  It should be noted that more than one referral can be received in relation to a child so referrals data does not equate to the number of children that come to the attention of Tusla.<\/p><p>Data published in recent years indicate that the numbers of children entering care has been decreasing.  This indicates that the increase in the number of children in care seen between 2012 and 2013 is a result of fewer children leaving care during the period.

The Department of Social Protection have the lead role in delivery on a child poverty target and are the Sponsor of outcome 4 of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures - economic security and opportunity.  <\/p><p>This child target relates to lifting over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.  In order to meet this target 101,000 children will need to be lifted out of poverty by 2020.  The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  <\/p><p>Through social transfers, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children is reduced from 45.5 per cent to 17.9 per cent in 2013 a poverty reduction effect of 60.7 per cent.

My Department invests &euro;260 million annually on early childhood care and education and after-school support programmes which provide care to 100,000 children. A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes. In addition in early 2015, I established an Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education.  The work of the group is focused on identifying policy objectives to guide future investment in this area.  <\/p><p>My Department is also leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2016).  The ABC Programme is co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services.<\/p><p>My Department also provides targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people provided through a range of schemes totalling &euro;49.93m of funding.  The forthcoming National Youth Strategy will ensure that the social inclusion of young people is a key objective.  <\/p><p>Finally, as part of my Department's response, Tusla, the child and family agency is also responsible for the delivery of educational welfare services which involves intensive intervention and a multidisciplinary approach to address the child's needs and support school attendance.

By June 2002, Wicklow County Council investigations concluded that in excess of 200,000 tonnes of waste material had been dumped at the site.
