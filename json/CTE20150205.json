He also emphasises the importance of Vietnam in our trade relations with south-east Asia generally and that Vietnam&rsquo;s economy has 90 million people.  It is important to the growth of our exports.  If members have a view on that, they can talk directly to the clerk of the committee.  The suggested date is 7 March 2015.

It is proposed this committee and the Northern Ireland Assembly's Public Accounts Committee will get a joint briefing on the report at a meeting in Belfast on 4 March 2015.

While her name is not mentioned, the issues relate to the processes within NAMA dealing with matters of that kind.  I want to put on the record my disappointment with NAMA because of the manner in which it is treating this individual.  Despite the fact that a group of cross-party Oireachtas Members were informed, she and her family received an invitation to enter into mediation after some pressure was applied.  She told us her husband took his life.  Within weeks of her meeting with us, papers were served on her late one Friday night.  They were thrown into the reception area of her home.  She was given the opportunity to attend a mediation meeting with NAMA after that.  I understand that NAMA is now proceeding to court even before it meets her.  It is unacceptable that a State body would behave in that way.  I ask members to note it.  I ask the clerk to express these views to NAMA and insist that it do what it stated it would do, namely, enter into mediation to determine whether this situation can be resolved.  It is bringing nothing but trauma and sadness to the woman's life.  She has lost her husband.  This is another case of the State at war with a citizen and I ask members to consider proceeding on this basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015020500002#A00500","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423130400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I do not know about other members of the committee, but I was not aware that that had been the turn of events for the family subsequent to our meeting with its members in private session.  Strictly speaking, it is not our job to get involved in the particularities of individual cases.  That said, we had a lengthy discussion on the question of mediation and were led to believe by NAMA that this was its first preference in every circumstance.  It is extraordinary and shocking that NAMA would act in the way described by the Chairman.  I would be in favour of the clerk writing to NAMA, with all of the caveats around us and particular circumstances, while making it clear that, after giving us by way of testimony to the committee the clear impression that it was committed to mediation and on which we took its word, we were most alarmed to see that such did not appear to be the case in this instance.  NAMA is in open contradiction with its evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015020500002#B00200","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1423130400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I was not aware that the issues that we discussed with that particular lady had taken a turn for the worse.  The note that NAMA presents to us indicates that it has been successful in 160 of the 162 completed cases and that a number were mediation cases in which the success rate was equally high.  Perhaps we need an in-depth presentation on the nature of the mediation, for example, whether it takes place under threat or is fully consultative and whether there are guidelines.  Requesting more in-depth information on how NAMA operates would be useful, both in terms of the 160 out of 162 completed court cases that it took successfully and the 21 out of 22 cases taken against it that it completed successfully.  The success rate in terms of mediation is another day's work.

I would like to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General, if appropriate, how commitments that are made in this manner are reflected in financial statements and analyses.

I have also drawn attention to that and particularly the basis upon which they decided that it was appropriate to present their affairs on a going concern basis.  There is a history of deficits in the college from 2011.  The deficit that year was around &euro;116,000.  In 2012, it was &euro;528,000 and in 2013, it was &euro;236,000.  The combined effect of that has been to practically eliminate the retained revenue reserves of the college.

The land acquired to create the land banks was purchased with loans from the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, generally provided for a term of seven years.  The intention was that the loans and the accrued interest would be repaid by the local authorities from capital grants paid by the Department from its social housing investment programme, when housing on the land was brought into use.  In total, the HFA advanced &euro;821 million to local authorities for such land purchases.<\/p> <p>  Because of the reduction in the amount of capital funding available for development of social housing, some local authorities ran into difficulty in meeting their commitments to repay the loans to the agency when the loan term ran out.  The land aggregation scheme was established by the Department in 2010 to help alleviate the financial burden of the loans on local authorities.  Initially, the scheme provided for the Department to make funds available to the relevant local authority to redeem in full the maturing loans, including the accrued interest.  In return, the local authorities were required to transfer the residential development land related to the redeemed loans to a special purpose body called the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, which is referred to as the Housing Agency.<\/p> <p>  Under revised arrangements for the scheme introduced in June 2012, maturing loans could be converted to equivalent annuity loans provided by the HFA.  Under that arrangement, local authorities make annuity payments to the HFA and, on condition that the related lands have transferred to the Housing Agency, may recoup the payments from the Department.  The scheme closed on 11 December 2013.  No submissions were accepted after that date, and applications made but not approved by that date were not accepted into the land aggregation scheme.<\/p> <p>  The Department asked local authorities to identify land and loans that might be suitable for inclusion in the scheme.  They identified 259 sites covering 775 ha with related loans and interest amounting to &euro;500 million.  The Department approved applications for 47 sites, with an aggregated area of 173 ha, under the original terms of the scheme.  The Department paid grants totalling &euro;111 million to redeem the 47 loans.  The original purchase cost of the associated land is estimated at around &euro;86.6 million. The accrued interest element on the redeemed loans is estimated at around &euro;24.5 million or 28% of the original purchase cost.<\/p> <p>  A further 25 sites were approved for inclusion in the scheme under the revised conditions, and prior to the scheme closing in 2013.  Twenty five year annuity loans with a combined value of &euro;52.15 million, including &euro;12 million in accrued interest, were approved to refinance the matured loans.  If all of the 25 approved sites are transferred to the Housing Agency, the annual commitment to be met by the Department is estimated at around &euro;2.68 million per year.  The annuity payments will continue until 2038.<\/p> <p>  The examination found that local authorities retained parts of many of the sites associated with loans approved for the scheme.  However, there was no formal procedure in place to adjust the value of the loan accepted into the scheme where the entire original site purchased was not transferred.  The Department considered each case on an individual basis, and the general practice was that up to 100% of the outstanding loan could transfer to the scheme where more than 75% of the site area related to that loan was transferred to the scheme.  The Department did not consider whether any of the area retained by the local authority was of greater or lesser value per hectare than the area accepted into the scheme.<\/p> <p>  Under the original arrangements for the scheme, land did not have to be transferred before the grant issued to redeem the loan.  The revised scheme required the land transfer to have taken place before the Department made any annuity payments.  At June 2014, we found that the transfer had been completed for 41, or 56%, of the approved transfers.  The Accounting Officer will be able to provide an update on progress since then.  The examination also noted that land was not valued prior to or after its transfer to the Housing Agency.<\/p> <p>  The original HFA loans were intended for land that was suitable for residential development.  Despite that, the examination found that local authorities had proposed 25 sites, with associated HFA loans to the value of &euro;37 million, for inclusion in the scheme that were rejected by the Department because they were, or had become, unsuitable for residential development.<\/p> <p>  The total value of housing land acquisition loans drawn down from the HFA in the period from 1999 is &euro;821 million.  By end December 2013, the total amount of loans outstanding was &euro;507 million.  The profile of the maturity of the outstanding loans is shown in the figure now on screen.  The darker bars on the right of the graph represent original land purchase loans that have matured and have been converted into long-term annuity loans.  At end December 2013, these amounted to &euro;226 million, including loans annuitised under the land aggregation scheme.<\/p> <p>  The annexes to chapter 6 were included to provide relevant information to readers about the individual loans and the related sites.  I must draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to Annex D, and point out that the caption is not correct.  It should read &lsquo;Amount borrowed from HFA for residential site purchases since 1999, and outstanding balances at 31 December 2013, by local authority&rsquo;.  The data are correct, and the incorrect caption has no effect on any findings in the report.  I am arranging for a revised annex to be submitted to the library to correct the record.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 7 deals with a couple of issues that arose in the course of audit of Vote 25.  The first part of the chapter deals with capital commitments under the Vote in relation to water services projects.  As the committee is aware, Irish Water took on responsibility for water services from the local authorities with effect from 1 January 2014.  It also took over all the assets and liabilities related to the authorities' water supply and discharge business.  The legal transfer of contractual obligations to Irish Water from the local authorities was effected on 21 February 2014 and 25 April 2014 under orders made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p> Prior to the establishment of Irish Water, the Department provided funding to water services authorities for the provision of major water and wastewater schemes to meet key environmental and economic objectives.  Department expenditure under the water services programme was &euro;241 million in 2013, and the total cost of the programme from 2007 to 2013 was &euro;2.9 billion.<\/p><p> In the 2012 appropriation account for the Vote, the Department recorded that it had outstanding capital commitments to local authorities to provide a total of &euro;340 million in respect of local authority water services projects.  The disclosure of such commitments is required under the standard accounting policies for appropriation accounts.  The Department did not include any capital commitments that existed as at end December 2013 in regard to the water services investment programme in the Department&rsquo;s appropriation account for 2013 on the basis that they became the responsibility of Irish Water in 2014.<\/p><p> The second part of the chapter deals with EU penalties in regard to control of septic tanks.  In December 2004, the EU Commission notified Ireland of its conclusion that Ireland had infringed its obligation to fully and correctly transpose the requirements of the 1975 waste management directive, which aims to protect human health and the environment against harmful effects caused by the collection, transport, treatment, storage and disposal of waste.  The infringement related to the management of domestic waste disposal through septic tanks and similar systems.  The Commission requested that Ireland rectify that infringement by February 2005.  A subsequent European Court judgment in October 2009 found that with the exception of County Cavan, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under the directive in regard to such systems.  Further legal proceedings resulted in the imposition of penalties that eventually amounted to &euro;2.648 million.  This was borne on the Vote in 2013.<\/p><p> Members will be aware that legislation to comply with the directive, the Water Services (Amendment) Act, was passed by the Oireachtas in February 2012.  The Act requires the registration of all septic tanks and the development of a risk-based national inspection plan for septic tanks by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  Following a public consultation process in October 2012, the agency developed an inspection plan that required a minimum of 1,000 septic tank inspections to be carried out across all local authorities in the 12 months commencing July 2013.<\/p><p> At 31 July 2014, the number of systems registered on the domestic wastewater treatment system register was 450,620.  Based on census 2011 information, which recorded almost 500,000 septic tanks and wastewater systems in Ireland, this suggests a registration compliance rate of over 90%.<\/p><p> The results of the first round of risk-based inspections under the EPA&rsquo;s inspection plan revealed that over half of the tanks examined failed the inspection.  While all failures represent a potential risk to human health or to the environment, care must be taken in interpreting the results of the initial inspections as the inspection plan was based on prioritising higher risk areas.  In order to establish an estimate of the overall level of compliance across the State, inspection of a random sample of systems would need to be undertaken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015020500002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423130400,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

The Comptroller, in reviewing the administration of the scheme, notes that it was established to support local authorities by alleviating the financial burden in servicing land loans that had been taken out from the Housing Finance Agency for the purpose of acquiring land for social and affordable housing developments.  It is also noted that some of the sites accepted into the scheme have seen their value decrease significantly from the original purchase price.<\/p> <p>  The scheme was introduced in 2010 in a difficult economic landscape as part of revised arrangements for the funding of land for social housing purposes.  The primary purpose of the scheme was to support the unwinding of the book of land loans taken out by local authorities to purchase land for the public housing investment programme.  Sizeable amounts of land for housing had been purchased by local authorities through borrowings, which would then be recouped when the land was developed for housing purposes.  However, the substantial contraction in Exchequer funding available for the traditional local authority house building programme resulted in a significant slowing in the pace at which housing projects could be funded.  Yet, borrowings for land loans were maturing and in order to alleviate the financial burden that would have arisen for local authorities in dealing with these loans, it was decided that funding should be set aside to address what would otherwise have been an unsustainable position.<\/p> <p>  Under the scheme, local authorities could, subject to approval from the Department, transfer residential lands on which there were outstanding loans from the Housing Finance Agency to the Housing Agency when the loans fell due for redemption.  In addition, there had to be no short to medium term plans for the development of the land in question.  Applications to the value of some &euro;163 million in loans were accepted into the scheme.  The figure of &euro;163 million includes &euro;111 million in respect of loans which were, under the first phase of the scheme, fully redeemed by local authorities with funding recouped from the Department.  The remaining &euro;52 million accepted into the scheme under its second phase are in the form of annuity loans, for which local authorities are making repayments to the Housing Finance Agency.  Local authorities may recoup those capital and interest repayments from the Department on condition that related lands have transferred to the Housing Agency.<\/p> <p>  At the time the Comptroller was carrying out his review of the scheme, 41 sites accepted into the scheme had transferred to the Housing Agency.  As of 15 January last, this figure had increased to 49 sites.  Of these 49 sites, 36 were dealt with under the first iteration of the scheme and have had their associated loans redeemed in full.  Of the 24 sites still to transfer, 11 are in the final stages of that process.  I have personally written to the relevant local authorities and the Housing Agency requesting that the remaining sites be transferred as expeditiously as possible.<\/p> <p>  In 2013, as a consequence of continuing pressure on Exchequer resources at that time, and following a review of the scheme carried out in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it became evident that further expenditure on the land aggregation scheme, in terms of accepting new applications into the scheme, was not sustainable.  Accordingly, in December 2013, local authorities were notified of the ending of the scheme.<\/p> <p>  Following this, local authorities have been advised to consult with the Housing Finance Agency directly on the management of loans relating to lands not accepted into the land aggregation scheme.  I understand the Housing Finance Agency has made arrangements directly with some local authorities to extend interest-only arrangements to land acquisition loans, on maturity, for a further five years, after which they will revert to normal-course annuities.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, water sector reform has been an area of intense activity in the Department over the past two years.  The first part of Chapter 7 of the Comptroller&rsquo;s report gives a summary of some aspects of implementation of the reform programme.<\/p> <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has had statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels, including responsibility for the delivery of capital infrastructure.  The progression of water services capital projects is now a matter for Irish Water. <\/p> <p>  Up until the transfer of responsibility for water services to Irish Water at the beginning of 2014, local authorities were responsible for the delivery of water services capital infrastructure and funding was provided by the Department under the water services investment programme.  The final programme administered by the Department ran from 2010 to the end of 2013.  Under that programme, a total of 294 major contracts were completed comprising 176 water supply projects, including 75 water conservation projects, and 118 wastewater projects.<\/p> <p>  On taking over responsibility for the delivery of water services, Irish Water published a capital investment plan for the period 2014 to 2016.  The plan outlines the indicative investment priorities in water services infrastructure over the three-year period.  It consists of a targeted programme of over 386 individual projects and a range of sub-programmes, which will deliver improvements in drinking water quality, leakage reduction, wastewater compliance, business efficiencies and customer service.<\/p><p>The second part of Chapter 7 relates to the European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland in October 2009 in respect of septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems.  Legislation was prepared in the Department and enacted, as the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012, to address the issues covered by the court's ruling.  Under the legislation, local authorities are obliged to establish and maintain registers of domestic wastewater treatment systems in their functional areas and owners of such systems are obliged to register.  Registration began in June 2012 and by the end of January some 453,088 owners had registered.  This represents over 91% of the estimated total number of domestic wastewater systems in the country based on census 2011 data.<br\/><br\/>The legislation further provides for the establishment of a national inspection plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems.  The first inspection plan was published by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA,  in February 2013 and risk-based site inspections by inspectors approved by the latter began in July 2013.  Inspections are objective, evidence-based and aimed at identifying systems which are a risk to public health or the environment.  Where an on-site system fails an inspection, the remediation work required will be based on factors such as the nature of the problem, the extent of risk to public health or the environment, existing site size and the hydrological and geological conditions present.  The implementation of the plan is a matter for the local authorities, subject to supervision by the EPA.  The first plan required that a minimum of 1,000 inspections be carried out by local authorities during the 12-month period commencing in July 2013.  The EPA subsequently informed local authorities that a further 500 inspections - on a <i>pro-rata<\/i>basis - should be carried out during the period July to December 2014.  Earlier this week, the EPA published a review of the first national inspection plan.  In addition to detailing the findings for the first year, the review includes a public consultation process, with the agency inviting submissions regarding its proposals for the development of a new inspection plan for the three years 2015 to 2017.<br\/><br\/>As noted in the comptroller and auditor general&rsquo;s report, fines totalling &euro;2.648 million were imposed on Ireland by the ECJ arising from this case.  While such an outcome is, of course, to be regretted, I am satisfied that an appropriate system of regulation in this area is now in place, closing off an issue that proved to be quite challenging to address, both in terms of the legal issues arising and the associated vigorous public debate regarding the way forward.  The fines were paid by the Department in 2013 and the European Commission formally closed the case on 30 May of that year.<br\/><br\/>The matters addressed in the chapters prepared by the Comptroller relate to some of the key areas of activity within the housing and water services programmes in recent years.I and my colleagues will be happy to respond to questions on these issues that emerge in the course of the committee&rsquo;s work today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015020500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423130400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

One of the recommendations in that report centred around the need for local authorities to engage in active land management strategies.  In effect, NESC was encouraging local authorities to try to get ahead of the market in acquiring land for what, at that point, was a very fast-expanding social housing programme.  On foot of that and with the Department's encouragement, local authorities sought to identify sites that would be needed to support that programme.  The issue which arose and which we sought to address in 2010 with the introduction of the scheme was that the normal part of the chain relating to the expected period within which sites would be brought into development became fractured.  This was because the scale of Exchequer funding available for social housing purposes, particularly in the context of the building programme, was reduced significantly.  The scheme was a response to dealing with that situation.  Ultimately, it dealt with it partly but it could not deal with it fully.<\/p> <p>  The future use of the sites which local authorities still own and in respect of which they are still servicing the associated costs will be fundamentally tied in to the delivery of the social housing strategy.  As the Deputy is aware, the strategy was published in November.  The Department is engaging with all local authorities with a view to finalising - in the next few weeks - targets for the delivery of social housing in 2015.  That process will roll on all the way to 2020.  There will have to be an ongoing engagement between the Department and individual local authorities in respect of their building programmes and the identification and use of particular sites, be they sites which are in the land aggregation scheme - we would see these as a priority - or other sites which authorities own and which may match specific local housing needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015020500002#H01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1423130400,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Would Mr. John McCarthy describe the land aggregation scheme as a mini-NAMA, particularly in the context of the site valuations realised by those who were very fortunate to avail of it?

A simple rule of thumb is that if one has a property worth &euro;1 million, the annual rent could be 10% of that, which is &euro;100,000.  In the Valuation Office, rates valuations tend to be very close to approximately 25% of the annual commercial rent of the property.  That is the statistic nationally.

That explains why some local authorities were not charging themselves rates on their own assets.

A total of &euro;728 million was transferred from the taxpayer to Irish Water in 2014.  A sum of &euro;250 million had gone the previous year by way of a loan.  The figure for this year is the subvention of &euro;399 million and a stray contribution from the Central Fund of &euro;222 million, which is a total of &euro;621 million.  Now the witness tells us we must add &euro;59 million under a different subhead, which I did not have.  There are also loans this year from the National Pensions Reserve Fund of &euro;96 million.  That is a total of &euro;717 million, excluding the &euro;59 million.  Next year, the subvention already pencilled in is &euro;479 million and there will be a contribution from the Central Fund of &euro;184 million, which is a total of &euro;663 million.  There will be a loan of &euro;56 million from the local government fund in 2016, bringing the total to &euro;719 million.

Let us be straight about this.  A total of &euro;2.5 billion is going from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to Irish Water.  Is it open-ended?  Is there a blank cheque for Irish Water in respect of its set-up, because that is how I perceive it?  A total of &euro;11.25 billion worth of assets is transferring to Irish Water.  I do not know who did the due diligence on that &euro;11.25 billion of assets but I think the Secretary General is saying that each local authority did it.  What does that entail?  Is it a building, a pipe or pump or what is it?  Who quantified it?  The taxpayer funded this because in the years 2007 to 2013, &euro;2.9 billion was spent in some way on these assets, while &euro;241 million was spent in 2013 in respect of water services investment alone.  All of the aforementioned &euro;11.25 billion represents taxpayers' money and they bought these assets.  If I am wrong, the Secretary General should tell me but this is how I perceive it.  On top of that, there is a further &euro;2.5 billion in respect of the funding from 2014 to 2016, inclusive.  This comprises &euro;13.75 billion worth of assets being transferred directly into a company.  Thereafter, as I understand it, the corporate knowledge, which is worth something in commercial terms, also will be transferred into this company.  How much did the Department factor into that built-up knowledge of all these water systems when the assets are transferred?  Is it included in the &euro;11.25 billion, is it simply not quantified at present or will it be quantified?  When all those assets are transferred into this company, for the pleasure of doing all of that on behalf of the taxpayers, they will then be charged for the water.  This is even before one gets to how Irish Water will refund the refurbishment or the renewal of all the assets it is getting.  At the last discussion this committee had in public on this issue - I believe Ms Graham told us this but she should correct me if I am wrong - members were told the taxpayers also would be expected to contribute something towards the billions of euro it will take to bring all the assets, that is, the water infrastructure, pipes, services and so on, up to scratch.

It is stated that the reasons for that were that some of the lands were not zoned residential, some of them were landlocked etc.  This beggars belief.

In terms of these particular sites, they remain in the ownership of the local authorities and it will be up to the local authorities to make a determination as to the appropriate use for them.  Some of the issues around access may well have arisen after sites were purchased because pieces of sites can be given away for a bit of road widening or other issues that may impact on the potential use of the site.  There is a range of individual factors that can arise.  I do not think it is a case that all of these sites will never be usable.

Of the overall number of units that would initially have been identified by NAMA as possibly being suitable for social housing, about a fifth of those were ultimately sold or let by receivers in private transactions.

As the Secretary General said, NAMA own the loans on these properties, as opposed to the properties themselves, so they often have to talk to receivers who may be in place or developers who still own those properties.  As the properties are identified, the first step is that the housing agency contacts the local authorities in question to see whether there is a demand for the properties.  If so, it enters into the process of identifying, where appropriate, if there is a purchase under the leasing scheme and an approved housing body that might be interested or able to purchase those units.  There are a number of different ways that those units can come out of NAMA: the local authority, if it has funding available, might be able to purchase them itself, an approved housing body might be able to purchase them through the capital assistance scheme, or they can come through the leasing scheme, going through the NAMA special purpose vehicle, SPV, under which the approved housing body leases them from NAMA's SPV or purchases them using the capital advance leasing facility.  There are a number of different strands as to how it can come through.  The steering group identifies what is the best way of doing those.  If a voluntary body has already expressed interest in those properties, outside of the NAMA process, we tend to go to it first.  If not, there is an objective selection process whereby we would have a panel of approved housing bodies that would have expressed interest in certain counties, and if an approved housing body is not already involved in that project, the project would be sent out to the panel of approved housing bodies for them to come back to express interest in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015020500002#T03200","nonspeaker":"Ms Lisa Clifford"},{"type":"speech","time":1423130400,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Is it possible to get a note on that issue with a local spin to it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015020500002#T03300","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423130400,"counter":511,"content":"<p>In relation to Kilkenny specifically?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015020500002#T03400","nonspeaker":"Ms Lisa Clifford"},{"type":"speech","time":1423130400,"counter":512,"content":"<p>The Weir-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015020500002#T03500","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423130400,"counter":513,"content":"<p>The Weir View.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015020500002#T03600","nonspeaker":"Ms Lisa Clifford"},{"type":"speech","time":1423130400,"counter":514,"content":"<p>As soon as possible, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015020500002#T03700","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1423130400,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I have a few quick questions.

My statement will be forward-looking as to what one can do to prevent a future crisis.  There are a number of restrictions as to what one is able to do currently in terms of the existing crisis so my focus will be on the future.  My message is one of hope, in large part, that we can succeed at this.  We cannot succeed in stopping all bank failures and we cannot even succeed in preventing all future crises but we can prevent many of them and we can dramatically reduce the severity and length of the crises as well.  That is because the great bulk of the worst crises and the great bulk of the worst individual bank failures will follow a characteristic pattern that can be identified well before a crisis stage and can be the subject of successful regulatory intervention.<\/p>  <p>  I am coming to the committee with four hats today, as we would say in US parlance.  My primary appointment is in economics.  I have a joint appointment in law.  I am a recovering litigator but I also have a doctorate in criminality.  My specialty is in elite white collar criminals, particularly in the financial area and I think I will be the only successful regulator the committee is like to have appearing before it.  We not only write about regulation, as members will see from other parts of the statement we are cited as the exemplars of how to make regulations succeed by public administration scholars.  <\/p>  <p>         We were the only people to come out of a crisis with our reputation enhanced, which is difficult to find in the current crisis.  We made many mistakes and the committee can take advantage of what we did wrong and what we eventually figured out worked well.  The first thing that needs to be done is to identify where the future institutions which will cause massive losses will be found, and how they can be identified when they are still reporting record profits so action can be taken while they are still doing so.<\/p> <p> The committee has asked me to speak about principles-based regulation, which can mean many different things.  The gloss put upon it throughout Europe and the United States was one which ensured it would fail against precisely the kinds of schemes I will talk about.  This is not necessarily inherent in principles-based regulation.  It is such a vague phrase it can mean different things to different people.  Throughout Europe and the United States it came to have the same gloss, which was, basically, BFFs, which means best friends forever and is a clich&eacute; for American teenagers.  This was the idea the banker could be the BFF and we could all have a Kumbaya moment and strum folk songs together, and if we were just nice to the bankers who were oppressed by regulation and removed this terrible hand of government they would work with us and we would all sit around the campfire and it would go very well.  This has no basis in human history, or anything we know about human beings, but it was mighty convenient if you were a non-regulator because you did not have to do much of anything, and the world would be better because you did not do much of anything.<\/p> <p> Here is the recipe which leads to something distinctive.  It is the recipe that the institutions follow which produces the worst losses, is most likely to cause hyperinflated bubbles, is most likely to cause catastrophic individual losses, and is most likely to cause future crises.  I am speaking about the past throughout the world, but my focus is going forward in Ireland with regard to policies the committee might consider recommending.  The recipe has four ingredients: grow like crazy; make terrible quality loans - not kind of bad but absolutely terrible and obvious on their face loans; while employing extreme leverage, which means a whole lot of debt compared to equity; and while setting aside no meaningful loss reserves for the inevitable catastrophic losses which will follow.<\/p> <p> If these four ingredients are followed it is mathematically guaranteed - and let me emphasise it is not hypothetical but mathematically guaranteed given how the accounting works - there will be three sure things.  The bank will report, almost immediately, record profits.  Under modern executive compensation the senior leadership will promptly be made wealthy but many other people in the food chain will also be made wealthy because the same perverse incentive structures are used to ensure they make those really crappy loans I talked about.  The third sure thing is that down the road there will be catastrophic losses.<\/p> <p> Thinking about it from the flipside, if you tried to devise a strategy that would cause catastrophic losses it would be with these four ingredients.  Using them, you will cause huge losses and you will have no loss reserves.  You are particularly vulnerable outside the United States in terms of the accounting rules, as you follow the international accounting rules, which also purport to be principles-based.  The principle they purport to follow is an anti-fraud principle that is concerned with what we call the trade cookie jar reserves.  These are loss reserves that can be established in good times and taken out in a bad quarter to allow officers to meet their targets and maximise their bonuses.  This was the principle that the rule was designed to prevent, but it is being interpreted in a way which creates the perfect crime.  It is being interpreted as saying loss reserves cannot be established currently for future losses, even in institutions which follow the recipe where it is absolutely guaranteed that because of their terrible underwriting they will have catastrophic losses.<\/p> <p> Right now the anti-fraud principle is being interpreted as the most pro-fraud principle we can possibly imagine.  As we speak today, six and a half years after the crisis hit, we still have the same international accounting rule.  There have been all kinds of efforts to change it, but none of them has come to fruition.  This is an area that could be addressed through regulatory policy.  We could have regulatory accounting principles that require appropriate loss reserves.  If we did that we would block the recipe I have been talking about and that would be a very good thing.  It makes perfect sense that if you are doing things that are very risky you should establish loss reserves today.  Otherwise you will create fictional income and you will get everything we have done.  As I said, in a poker sense, this creates a tell.  The tell is that in order to follow the strategy there has to be pathetic underwriting.  What you will find when you look at all of the crises in the past and in other places is precisely this destruction of underwriting.<\/p> <p> Underwriting is a process that a bank goes through to ensure it is likely to be repaid, and that if it does loan it will do so at an appropriate interest rate that reflects the risk.  The committee can see that this was not done all through the world.  I will talk about other places because of pending issues in Ireland and the Constitution.  This is precisely what we did in the United States in the savings and loans crisis.  We saw terrible underwriting, very low reported losses and record reported income, and we said this is too good to be true and it is.  We all teach our children about things that are too good to be true, but we do not, in fact, follow this policy in reality in financial regulation.  If we had, there would be none of these current crises, but we did in the past, which allowed us in the savings and loans crisis to identify when institutions were reporting record earnings, and literally reporting they were the most profitable savings and loans in America, and when they did so we targeted them for closure.  In fact, we took the list of the allegedly most profitable and made it a priority to investigate each of the institutions in the top list.<\/p> <p> To do this you have to understand the accounting and the econometrics.  Econometrics is a fancy word for economic statistics.  Here is the key: if a regulator examines with a standard econometric analysis - and cost-benefit analyses using this kind of econometric test are mandated throughout Ireland - they will give the worst possible result if an institution is following the recipe.  Any characteristic or practice such as ultra-concentration in commercial lending to 25 families during the run up when the bubble is still inflating will show the highest positive correlation with reported profits.  It has to do so.  If we do standard econometric analysis we will say we should encourage everybody in Ireland, England and the United States to loan to only 25 people who should put virtually all of their money in commercial lending.  <\/p>  <p>         That mathematically has to follow, so you have to not rely on those kinds of test.  You have to understand that if you do not underwrite, as we have known for centuries, it will produce adverse selection.  This selection means you get the worst possible borrowers, and the expected value - in order words, what will normally happen - is that you will lose money.  It is like gambling against the house in Las Vegas.  Statistically, you are going to lose money in these circumstances.  <br\/><br\/>I will leave you with the most important thing, which is a phrase that you probably have not even heard to date - Gresham's dynamic, which is the opposite of that hypothetical Kumbaya dynamic - &quot;All will be well.&quot;  There is this guy named Swift who identified it in 1726 and put it in <i>Gulliver's Travels<\/i>, but it has also been dealt with by Nobel laureates in economics.  It says &quot;What happens if cheaters gain a competitive advantage in the markets?&quot;  Then bad ethics will drive good ethics out of the marketplace.  This will happen in the professions as well.  All of those supposed controls - credit rating agencies, outside auditors, what we call appraisers but you may call valuers - can be hired and fired by the senior management of the banks.  That is why, worldwide, in this crisis you see them deliberately going to top-tier audit firms and always getting insane financial statements blessed with clean opinions - because that reputation is valuable and easily manipulated by creating a Gresham's dynamic.  You can block that Gresham's dynamic.  You can block these crises.  We intervened to stop 300 of these frauds that were expanding at over 50% a year in terms of growth, typically while they were still reporting high profits.  We adopted a rule restricting growth which attacks the Achilles heel - the need to grow very rapidly.  We deliberately intervened to pop the real estate bubble - particularly commercial real estate - in Dallas-Fort Worth.  We intervened to stop loans that were in those days simply called low-documentation loans but now in the American parlance are called liar loans.  This was in 1990 and 1991.  We drove them completely out of the savings and loan industry and prevented a crisis.<br\/><br\/>Our current crisis is sometimes called the sub-prime crisis, but it is far more of a liar loans crisis in the United States, and even in the United Kingdom.  We successfully prosecuted more than a thousand elite people from the banking industry with felony convictions.  Even with the best criminal defence lawyers in the world, there was a 90% conviction rate.  So you can succeed.  We would be very happy to help.  If it would be useful, in terms of training, I will provide a week of free training on how we did whatever we did for your regulators or prosecutors, or anything you find helpful, without charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015020500002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Professor William Black","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423094400,"counter":662,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Black for his opening statement.

You are probably particularly aware of what I am going to say.  This is a federal agency that had three presidential appointees, so you get the best you can.  You have to reach agreements.  The best we could get was a restriction on 25% growth annually.  The rule of thumb in banking for many decades has been that if you grow more than 25% a year you will likely fail, so this is a very weak limit.  But here is the good news.  It was still a cutback from growth of over 50% a year, which proved fatal to all 300 of these institutions.  When I say \"fatal\", remember - they are dead but they are reporting that they have record profits.  So you are not causing the failure, but you force recognition of the failure.  In essence, these are Ponzi schemes.

If the FDIC had not done that, US losses would have been roughly twice as large.  In fact, that is an understatement, because losses do not grow linearly but tend to grow exponentially in these circumstances.  Yes, Basel II was a disaster, because it facilitated the recipe that I have just gone through - grow like crazy.  It allowed massive growth.  With extreme leverage, it allowed extreme leverage.<\/p>  <p>  Is Basel III better?  Yes, but Basel III is horrifically complicated.  It would be vastly better to go back to much simpler rules.

With compounding, when something grows at 50% a year, it doubles in size approximately every nine months.  If the expansion had gone on for another two years, it would been more than 40 times the GDP of Iceland.  The losses per person in Iceland would have been hundreds of thousands of euro.

The entire theory of why, under Basel II, it was tier-2 capital is because it would be lost.  Those concerned made a deal, a contract deal.  The deal was that if this bank cannot pay because it is insolvent, we get wiped out entirely, so in recompense we get a much higher interest rate.  They got their interest rate.

Throughout history, the greatest risk to a bank has always been the bank's CEO.  The CEOs are the ones who caused the catastrophic losses throughout history.  That does not mean that most bank CEOs are crooks.  Do not go from that.  Really catastrophic failures are very unusual in banking.  When they occur, it is most commonly because of the banks' CEOs.  That is what I was referring to when Deputy John Paul Phelan asked me about the auditors.  If a bank could choose, it would choose very conservative and very reliable auditors, but banks do not choose auditors.  Bankers do, and bankers want a clean opinion that shows they have record profits and, therefore, should get really big bonuses.  Bankers will choose, and characteristically did throughout this entire system.<\/p>  <p>  When there is a Gresham's dynamic, you will no longer get just episodic problems with bankers.  You can get very widespread problems with bankers, which is why in the United Kingdom, for example, claimants on these products are winning over 80% of their claims.  It became absolutely the norm.  In fact, the testimony in front of your counterparts is that virtually all the profits that UK banks were reporting came from PPI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015020500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor William Black"},{"type":"speech","time":1423094400,"counter":732,"content":"<p>To come back to the recipe Professor Black was outlining to us earlier, the second step is the making of bad or terrible loans.

That higher nominal rate, if you do not establish loss reserves, has to show up as a spread &mdash; a very big positive spread.  It is just mathematics and accounting at that point, although in this regard I would emphasise something I have not emphasised: the really pernicious part that gets added on is when a lot of this income is non-cash.  You have to understand the basics of accrual accounting.  Is the difference between accrual and cash accounting familiar?  With non-amortising or, at least, non-fully amortising loans &mdash; Ireland has had these &mdash; banks are booking as income things that they have never received in cash.  That is how accrual accounting works.  I can agree to do lots of things where I am not actually paying in cash.  That is why people make bad loans or why bankers make deliberately bad loans.

All their choices involve material risk but you do not want a very large financial institution concentrating its risk in a product line like commercial lending.  Even if you were going to concentrate on commercial lending, you would never prudently concentrate in a small number of borrowers.  The old joke they tell about banking is absolutely true.  If you borrow $10,000 from a bank, the bank owns you but if you borrow $100 million from the bank, you own the bank.

The Senator is correct that many technological changes have created rivals to traditional banks and that these rivalries have reduced the profit margins in banks and are likely to do so in the future.  There is testimony in the Senator's counterpart, about which I would be a bit sceptical, of banks claiming that they lose money in traditional activities.  Whether or not they are correct, if they have that mindset, it is going to create pressures to find higher yield.  There are two ways to create higher yield, one of which I have talked about at length, which is the recipe, but the other one produces large profits and it is basically fleecing one's customers.  That is the PPI model.  Both of those are very, very bad things that one would want to prevent.  I do not think we are going to be able to prevent technology from changing.  It does not particularly upset me that there are private entities that take equity risks as long as they are not bailed out and do not create a systemic risk to the system.  If their shareholders want to have an equity fund and win or lose, that is okay by me, but it brings me to the subject we have not mentioned yet, the other grave danger, which is the systemically dangerous institutions, the ones that are so-called too big to fail.  One simply should not ever have an Irish champion like that.  That is nuts.  You cannot bail out Europe in that sense.  If one puts oneself hostage to a champion, it is not a champion anymore.  As soon as it fails, and it is a question of when and not if, Ireland would be back in a crisis.  Do not hitch your star to an institution too big to fail.

He presents in it a model of how to build an effective financial regulatory body.  He talks about an analysis of data to look for patterns of emerging risks, including patterns of incomes that are too good to be true.  He discussed what that means earlier in his testimony.  The final point of his six-point plan calls for the prosecution of &ldquo;elite control frauds\" regardless of their political patrons.  That is the issue I would like Professor Black to discuss.

My answer is not in response to Ireland.  I am not talking about Ireland.  I am responding to the generic question.  Here is an example of that dated 15 July 1987 from Charles Keating, our most notorious fraud in the savings and loan crisis to his chief political fixer.  &ldquo;Highest priority - get Black.  Good grief - if you can't get Wright [the Speaker of the House] and Congress to get Black - kill him dead - you ought to retire.\"  That is the kind of thing I am talking about.  Our joke in the savings and loan crisis was the highest return on assets was always a political contribution for any banker.  In our context, the Speaker of the House held hostage our Bill to get funding to close the institutions, to extort special favours for several fraudulent Texas savings and loan branches.  Five US Senators who became known as the Keating Five sought to keep us from taking enforcement action against the worst fraud.  The President of the United States attempted to appoint two members, chosen by Charles Keating, to run the agency.  I told the committee it was a three presidential appointee agency that ran it.  A Mr. Phelan, doubtless a distant cousin, was hired by the House ethics committee to investigate the ethics complaints against the Speaker of the House, James Wright.  He did resign at the end of this process, but three of the recommended charges by Mr. Phelan after his investigation were that an ethics case should be brought against the Speaker of the House for his effort to fire William Black, his effort to fire Joe Selby, who was one of those two top regulators I told the committee about, and because he held hostage our funding to extort favours on behalf of folks.<\/p>  <p>  In the United States context, these people do not go quietly.  If you bring cases against powerful bankers, they will enlist their political allies and they will give very large political contributions to do that.  In our context, Alan Greenspan was used to recruit the Keating Five, the five US Senators.  He was hired as a lobbyist initially by Charles Keating to recruit those Senators.  The United States is not unusual in those terms.  If you take on really powerful bankers you will find that you get political push-back.  If you do not pick regulators who will stand up to that &ndash; this is what I referred to as the Mike Patriarca level - Mike Patriarca was asked by a US Senator, one of the five who was meeting with us, whether he was saying that Arthur Young &amp;amp; Company, then one of the top tier audit firms, would prostitute itself for a client.  Committee members, as legislators, know that if they ask that of a bureaucrat what the only possible answer is.  When there are five Senators the only possible answer is, &ldquo;Oh no sir, I would never say that.&rdquo;  The actual answer from Mike Patriarca was &ldquo;Absolutely, it happens all the time.&rdquo;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015020500002#L02600","nonspeaker":"Professor William Black"},{"type":"speech","time":1423094400,"counter":872,"content":"<p>I need to move on to another question as my time will run out.

That was exactly the experience in the savings and loan debacle, which is one of the parallels.  This is a superb device for hyper-inflating the bubble.  It was absolutely done in the United States in the current crisis.  We have excellent numbers showing that it was liar loans that grew by over 500% from 2003 to 2006.  They became 40% of all residential loans in the United States while conventional lending was falling sharply.  We know the marginal loans that hyper-inflated the bubble were these fraudulent loans.

The inclusion of subordinated debt is simply indefensible and it tells you that you need to look at whoever would have included it.  Every regulator in the world should have instinctively said \"No\" to that.  It is contrary to everything we do to include the entire concept of subordinated debt.  Remember, precisely because subordinated debt is owned exclusively by people who are considered to be highly sophisticated, they are the ones least likely to run due to liquidity - if it is a liquidity event only and not an asset event - and they cannot run because subordinated debt has a term.  It is not like they can take out like a depositor, which is why the number is so low in terms of redemptions at those levels, and you do not have to redeem it after all if you will be paid in full.

The Sarbanes Bill was considered dead-on-arrival when it happened.

He gave a number of recommendations to this committee for the future, very much as Professor Black indicated in his opening statement, on how to avoid this type of crisis in the future and the necessary levels of accountability at senior banker level.  I shall outline one of the figures he gave us.  He said that the fines to date of US and European banks since 2008 are worth &euro;180 billion.  These are just fines and not prosecutions, bailouts or anything else.  That sum will be paid in fines and is many multiples of the cost of the Irish guarantee.   How should we deal with this matter into the future?  Do we continue to fine institutions?  Do we need to increase the tariff or penalty imposed on bankers along the lines of what was indicated in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015020500002#N01200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423094400,"counter":909,"content":"<p>When I was an enforcement and litigation director I negotiated these things all the time and here is the key that you need to understand.  Bankers make the decision and their priorities are not to go to jail, not to lose their job and not to have their bonuses clawed back.  To accomplish those three things they also have a fourth priority to not throw anybody junior to the wolves.  In the United States we have much broader plea bargaining powers than exists in most of Europe.  If you throw the junior person to the wolves we will flip him which means we will get him to plead and to testify about the more senior people.  The committee will note that in all of these major deals in the United States nobody got named, loses their bonus, loses their job or goes to jail and they are happy to trade off fines.<\/p>  <p>  The fines sound large.  They are large in absolute terms but relative to JP Morgan Chase, to pick a non-random example, they are literally a few weeks' revenue so they do not care.  Also, bankers do not pay the fines; it is the shareholders.  This is the third in a triple whammy hit if you follow the recipe to the extent that the banks have followed this recipe.  First, they have caused huge losses to the shareholders directly by making bad loans intentionally.  Second, they have taken a whole lot of money that should have gone to the shareholders in the form of bonuses for destroying the institution or at least causing huge losses.  Third, they come along and are happy to sign an agreement in which the shareholders pay the fines to make sure that they have no accountability.  Therefore, this is an utterly useless exercise in terms of deterrence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015020500002#N01300","nonspeaker":"Professor William Black"},{"type":"speech","time":1423094400,"counter":910,"content":"<p>I want to clarify the bottom line before I bring in Deputy Higgins.

This is one of the costs of austerity.  Banks are going to lend to businesses when businesses want to hire more people.  That is demand.  When there is not a whole lot of demand from the business community for purchasing, banks sit on the cash.  They will particularly sit on the cash in circumstances where we have massive bailouts of the banks, not through the formal bailout that we have been talking about today, but through this incredibly ultra-low interest rate regime.  Basically, the banks are not just sitting on the money; they are arbitraging.

I am very pleased and honoured to have been invited to the Oireachtas to assist this committee in its inquiry into the banking crisis.  I have been asked to provide the European Commission's perspective on the fitness of the European Union regulatory framework for banks and the supervisory policies, systems and practices in the run-up to the financial crisis, the lessons learned and improvements made in the past two years.<\/p>  <p>  The regulatory framework for banks in the EU has evolved considerably over the past 15 years.  A number of factors have driven this evolution.  These include the need for the EU Single Market, international developments, rapid changes in the banking sector and shortcomings in bank risk management and the regulatory and supervisory framework.  The EU regulatory framework takes into account the global standards for prudential regulation and supervision set by the Basel committee on banking supervision.  These standards have been updated several times since 1988, most recently in December 2010 when the Basel III standards were adopted.  Each of these updates has been implemented in EU law.<\/p>  <p>  In 2000, the EU regulatory framework followed the principle-based approach which was embodied in a minimum harmonisation.  Directives were used as the main legislative instruments, setting minimum requirements for prudential supervision.  Member states were required to transpose those directives into their respective national legislation.  <\/p>  <p>           The use of directives as the main legislative instruments and the minimum harmonisation principle gave member states a degree of flexibility in setting the regulatory framework for banks, as long as they did not go below the minimum standards required by the euro.  However, in line with the principles-based approach to regulation, member states typically did not resort to implementing over-prescriptive rules which would provide specific and detailed guidance to supervisors for exercising their duties.  During this same period, national supervisory authorities were responsible for applying and enforcing the prudential requirements set out in the directives, which empowered each national supervisory authority to take the steps it considered necessary to implement prudential measures to safeguard the resilience of the banks and to supervise the financial stability of the banking sector as a whole.  National supervisors had a considerable degree of discretion to apply stricter requirements than the minimum standards set out by the directives.  In other words, nothing in the directives prevented member states and their national supervisors from taking appropriate measures to reduce further the risk of a bank failing or risk to the stability of the financial system as a whole.<\/p> <p> The crisis has taught us a great deal about the failure of some European banks to manage their risk prudently and of some national regulators and supervisors to exercise their powers with sufficient rigour.  Many studies and reports have been produced to analyse the consequences of the principles-based approaches pursued by national regulators and how national supervisors exercised their oversight and enforcement duties in the pre-crisis period.  Reliance on soft and light touch approaches and low supervisory intensity encouraged by the principles-based approach to regulation, inadequate resources and insufficient attention to banks' corporate governance systems represented the most prominent causes of the various supervisory failures observed in several member states.  Too often, national supervisors took a narrow focus on credit risk and underestimated the importance of other risks, such as concentration risk, liquidity and funding risks.  Too little attention was given to market prudential considerations and effective early warning mechanisms which could have helped national authorities to detect emerging risks early and prevent bubbles from growing.<\/p> <p> The EU capital requirement directive, which is known in the jargon as the CRD, was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2006.  It required national supervisors to conduct a thorough assessment of the risk management systems and governance of the banks they supervised and to take measures corresponding to the specific risk profile of the banks in question.  The directive also stipulated explicit requirements for management of liquidity and concentration risks as well as risks arising from exposures to real estate markets.  If national supervisors had used those powers to the full extent, a number of major difficulties could have been prevented.  Robust risk management in the governance structure in banks and an effective oversight and control system represented the two indispensable conditions for the success of principles-based regulation.  In the absence of those two preconditions, the regulatory effect intended by the directive could not have been delivered.<\/p> <p> These deficiencies also revealed important shortcomings in the governance of the institutional framework for supervision itself and it sparked a period of unprecedented reforms in the EU, backed by an international consensus on the causes of the financial crisis and responses needed to address it.  The reforms, therefore, had two distinctive dimensions - the regulatory dimension and the institutional dimension.  I will discuss them in turn.<\/p> <p> On the regulatory side there has been, in line with international developments, a pronounced shift to a more rule based approach, introducing a more detailed guidance in the regulatory framework for the supervisors to ensure that they step up their supervisory scrutiny.  As a result, the new regulatory requirements have been made more prescriptive, the coverage of risk has been expanded and the prudential treatment of those risks has been strengthened.  These regulatory reforms were carried out in two phases.  The first phase, which is called CRD 11 and CRD III, which were adopted in 2009 and 2010, respectively, introduced quick fixes for some of the most pressing deficiencies highlighted by the crisis, namely, liquidity management, large exposures, remuneration, management of securitisation, trading exposures and supervisory co-operation.  For example, banks were required to develop robust strategies, policy, processes and systems for the identification, measurement, management and monitoring of liquidity risks and funding positions.  In the interbank market, banks were not allowed to lend or place money with other banks beyond a certain amount to limit the risk of contagion, which also increased the diversity of borrowing banks' funding sources.  National supervisors were required to review banks' remuneration policies and empowered to impose sanctions if these policies did not meet with the new requirement.<\/p> <p> The second phase, which is probably the most well known and goes under the name of CRR\/CRD IV in the jargon, was adopted in 2013 and represented a more fundamental revision of the regulatory framework, responding in particular to the review of international prudential standards in the Basel III framework.  This includes new rules regarding the quality and quantity of banks' regulatory capital, more detailed and harmonised rules dealing with liquidity, funding risks and excessive leverage, and measures improving banks' corporate governance, including rules realigning incentives.  Supervisors have obtained enhanced sanctioning powers and are required to carry out their duties in a more intrusive, intense and forward-looking manner.  Particular attention was given to measures improving supervisors' capacity to take appropriate remedial action at an early stage by putting more emphasis on macro prudential consideration.<\/p> <p> This latest revision also aims to establish a single rule book to respond to the need for a more harmonised set of rules across the Single Market, to provide a true level playing field on which EU banks can compete.  The degree of flexibility previously granted to member states and national supervisors, as I mentioned earlier, had led to divergent transposition of EU rules into national law.  This created opportunities for regulatory arbitrage and hampered legal clarity.  To achieve greater convergence, various options and discretions have been removed.  Most provisions have been moved into the regulation known as CRR and that becomes directly applicable.<\/p> <p> Parallel with the new prudential measures to reduce the probability of a bank failure, measures were also necessary to minimise the impact of possible failures and to equip resolution authorities with effective tools to deal with those situations.  The new harmonised bank resolution regime embodied in the bank recovery and resolution directive, adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2014, was introduced in recognition of the fact that the normal insolvency regimes were not well suited to deal with bank failures.  It was also a response to the need to protect certain critical stakeholders, for example, deposit holders, in functions of a failing bank and to reduce moral hazard in banks.<\/p> <p> This legislation includes a requirement for banks and resolution authorities to draw up a recovery and resolution plan, gives bank supervisors an expanded set of powers to enable them to intervene in cases where an institution faces financial distress, provides the resolution authorities with a credible set of resolution tools, including bail-in, and improves co-operation between the respective resolution authorities.<\/p> <p> Another initiative which should be mentioned in this context is the Commission proposal on banking structural reform dealing with the systemic risk of too-big-to-fail banks heavily engaged in trading activities.  The proposal, which is still under negotiation in the Council and in the European Parliament, would provide for a ban on proprietary trading and empower supervisors to separate banks' risky trading activities from their retail operations.  That is the regulatory side.<\/p> <p> On the institutional side, the crisis demonstrated the need to adapt the institutional framework for financial regulation and supervision to a fast moving and inter-connected banking industry.  First, the institutional reforms revolved primarily around the creation of the European Banking Authority.  Its creation was necessary to promote convergency of supervisory practices in the EU and to improve communication and mutual trust among supervisors.  In addition, the European Systemic Risk Board was created to respond to the failure of the national competent supervisory authorities to anticipate adverse market prudential developments and to prevent the accumulation of excessive risk within the financial system.<\/p> <p> Institutional reforms went a step further at the euro area level and led to the creation of a banking union.  The crisis clearly showed that in addition to a common set of reinforced rules for our banks, a single and independent supervisor to enforce those rules was also essential.  Thus, the Single Supervisory Mechanism was created, with a view to breaking the link between banks and sovereign and ensuring the highest standards of quality and impartiality of supervision.  <\/p>  <p>         While the European Central Bank, ECB, has taken over supervisory responsibility for the 120 largest banking groups in the euro area, day-to-day supervision of the smaller banks remains, for reason of efficiency, the task of national supervisors under the general guidance of the ECB.<\/p> <p> The second, equally essential, element of the banking union is the single resolution mechanism.  The single resolution board, the new single resolution body, will ensure that banks participating in the banking union are resourced, if necessary, in an efficient and centralised way, with minimum impact on taxpayers.  The cost of any such resolution procedures will be paid for by the private sectors and backed by a single resolution fund financed by bank contributions.<\/p> <p> To conclude, taken together, the reforms I have mentioned represent a significant strengthening of the regulatory and institutional framework underpinning the EU banking sector.  It would be presumptuous to claim that these reforms have consigned financial and, in particular, banking crises to history.  However, it is undeniable that, if properly enforced, these reforms equip supervisors and the resolution authorities with a more robust set of tools, making a future crisis less likely, and, if one were to happen, less costly.  I thank the members and look forward to their questions and the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015020500002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mario Nava","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423094400,"counter":935,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nava for his opening statement.

The European Commission is the body in charge of drafting legislation, so we draft legislation, particularly in the area of banking legislation.  We get the legislation after having participated in the various discussions in the global forums.  We then draft the legislation.  The legislation that is drafted is brought to the Council and the Parliament.  The Council and the Parliament have their ways of adopting legislation, but, broadly speaking, the Council works its own text and the Parliament works its own text.  There are then meetings called trilogues at which the Council, Parliament and Commission try to find a common version of the text.  Once the text is adopted and put in place, if it is a regulation it is directly applicable.  If there is a directive, the Commission is still responsible for checking that the directives are well transposed - that is the technical word - into the national legislation.  Essentially, that is our role.  I would say it is a role of initiating the regulation and making sure, unless the regulation is directly applicable, that if the legislation needs transposing to the national legal systems, this transposition is correct and the Commission watches over that.  Typically, one would say the Commission is the guardian of the treaty in doing that job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015020500002#S00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mario Nava"},{"type":"speech","time":1423094400,"counter":943,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nava.

I would say it was probably more of a British-style understatement.  I did not want to come before the committee and claim that there will never be another crisis because I did not want to be proved wrong by what may happen and what we have not foreseen.  However, it is very clear that with all the reforms we have done we looked in academic terms to the two important components of a crisis.  One of these is the probability that a crisis will come, and we have put in place all possible mechanisms to reduce that probability by essentially ensuring better risk re-pricing.  One way to look at the crisis is that the pricing of the risk in the banking institutions was not always correct, so we have put in place a number of regulations that allow for a more truthful risk re-pricing.  However, it is important to understand that the project does not consist only of new rules on capital, concentration risk and liquidity, but also new rules on supervision and resolution, and resolution is what makes an eventual crisis have much less of an impact on taxpayers than anything else.  Those are the two pillars we have addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The Senator asked where I would see the next crisis coming from.  That is part of the work that the Commission needs to do in the next five years.  In his opening statement the Chairman asked what we could expect from the Commission in the next five years.  He should not expect the same volume of regulation from the Commission in the next five years as he has seen in the past five years.   That is very clear.  What he should expect from the Commission in the next five years is much more reviewing of what we have done, evaluation, and calibration of all of that.  <\/p>  <p>  Let us be clear.  The financial reform we carried out has allowed us regain financial stability.  Financial stability at some moments seemed truly in peril.  The work we did allowed us to regain financial stability not only on paper and by law but also in the markets.  Bank capitalisation has increased massively following the new regulation.  Because that was done and because we have regained financial stability, it is possible now to look at how this new financial stability and these financial reforms can contribute to the major objectives of the current Commission, which are growth and jobs.  In a word, there is no growth without financial stability, but there is certainly no financial stability without growth.  That is the type of thing we will look at in the next five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015020500002#S01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mario Nava"},{"type":"speech","time":1423094400,"counter":946,"content":"<p>What does the truthful, risk-free pricing Mr. Nava mentioned mean in application?

As the Senator knows, the objective here is not to eliminate risk because lesson No. 1 in economics is \"no risk, no return\".  The objective is not at all to eliminate risk but to allow people to take risks in such a way that if something goes wrong they pay for it.  They can take a risk but they assume the risk.  The aim is to avoid people taking risks and then shovelling that risk onto someone else.  That is the objective.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015020500002#S01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mario Nava","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423094400,"counter":949,"content":"<p>Why has it taken so long, given that the euro was established as a financial currency in 1999 and an actual currency in 2002?

Once he retired from banking, he became chairman of Celtic Football Club in Glasgow which won many cups and leagues and so forth.  The committee was set up in 1998 or 1999 and was tasked with examining the question of whether, together with a common currency, we should have common banking supervision.<\/p>  <p>  Things take time, however, and as we say, Rome was not built in a day.  I have a slide here which illustrates the key milestones.  Obviously, in the initial period from 2002 to 2006 we had quite positive economic developments and clearly that meant less pressure.  Not only did positive economic developments mean less pressure, however, they also hid the potential difficulties to a degree.  It was only with the arrival of the crisis that we were able to see the shortcomings and deficiencies.  Then, I would say that we acted quite rapidly, as fast as we could.  I was very happy to read a report by the House of Lords yesterday which found that given the very difficult circumstances in which the European institutions had to act, they acted appropriately in general.  The report states that the work they did was to be \"admired\".  Clearly it takes time to pass a directive.

Ireland trades primarily outside the common currency area.  Mr. Nava's view was that &quot;the undoubted benefits achievable for the single market&quot; through the effects of the single currency are probably &quot;not enough to justify the endeavour of renouncing the national currency&quot;.  Was that a consideration at the time?  The euro project is doubted in Mr. Nava's book, published in 2005.  We have had a single currency since 1999 and the nation was still in charge.

This ability to reinforce common laws on the basis of needs still exists in some areas today, for example, even under the maximum harmonisation approach, in real estate.  Real estate is very different from one country to another.  Real estate in Dublin is not the same as real estate in London or Paris.  In real estate, lots of freedom has been left to the national supervisory authorities to take measures, typically macro-prudential measures, that might help.<\/p>  <p>  In the period from 1999 to 2006 or 2007, the national supervisors had the responsibility, no doubt, for their own banking systems.

That is what I am saying.  The supervisory responsibility lay with the national authorities.  There were committees and ways to bring supervision to the level of where economics was.  The later move to the banking union - where banking union means central supervision - was dictated by the simple fact that the economics had moved ahead of the regulatory institutional framework.

Credit concentration may be looked at in different ways, for example, moving from micro to macro.  The most obvious mechanism of credit concentration is excessive concentration to a counter party; for example, a bank lends me too much or a bank lends too much to a particular company. There can be credit concentration to a sector whereby a bank lends too much to a sector.  There can also be credit concentration to a region whereby a bank lends too much to exposed activities in that region.  This is a movement from micro to macro.  One of the things we learned from the crisis is that national supervisors were more on a micro level and for good reason.  Among the institutions which were created in 2011 was the European Supervisory Risk Board.  This board's specific task is to help countries to carry out macro-prudential supervision and to carry it out in the context of the Single Market.  Definitely, credit concentration is an issue but what I am trying to say is that this issue has both micro and macro aspects.  Therefore, this issue can be tackled either at the level of one single counter-party by one single supervisor or it can be tackled at higher level and can necessitate some co-ordination of the measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015020500002#W00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mario Nava"},{"type":"speech","time":1423094400,"counter":1020,"content":"<p>I was not clear on the answer.

With Basel III we introduced a capital buffer which is called, \"counter-cyclical capital buffer\".  That buffer increases the capital requirements when an economy is in good times.

This was done in recognition of what the Deputy said, namely, that most of the excess leverage and most of the errors may actually happen in good times because in good times the economy is booming and so banks tended to lend more.  It is interesting to note the ESRB report which stated that in spite of the fact that we are clearly now not in a boom period, all countries have set their counter-cyclical buffer at zero for the time being but in all countries there is the possibility that if the economy booms again, a country will move its counter-cyclical buffer.  Currently, only one country has moved its buffer out from zero.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy makes the point that most of the banking errors are made in the good times because of the excess of lending.

It is not possible to have a restructuring plan which does not take into account the rules we have made.<\/p>  <p>  The second question was on the politicisation of decisions.  As I stated, the Commission brings a draft proposal, a draft capital requirement, to the table of the Council and Parliament.  Let me cite a concrete example.  The last draft capital requirement - the capital regulation requirement that is in application today - was brought to the table of the Council and Parliament in July 2011 and finally adopted in April 2013.  The process lasted a little less than two years, which was quite a fast process for a document of 1,000 pages.  The discussion in the Parliament and Council is done by those who are entitled to make law, who I understand are the legislators.  I understand they are the political masters, the elected and appointed persons who make legislation.  There may be an interpretation that one or other aspect is excessively political but, as a European citizen, I find it democratically correct that we have a clear process of adopting a law and it is adopted by political people.<\/p>  <p>  The members of the committee are political people who have all been elected.  They are the legislative power and they make legislation.  I do not find it particularly strange that politicians make legislation.  Actually, I think it is their duty to make legislation.  In doing so, they may introduce political considerations because that is exactly the area in which politicians are involved.  Let me give a concrete example.  When the capital regulation requirement, CRR, went through the Council and Parliament, given the particularly difficult economic situation, the Council and Parliament introduced a rebate for the banks that were lending to small and medium enterprises.  A rebate of about 25%, which was not in our proposal, was given on the back of a particularly difficult economic situation and the need to sustain the credit flow to small and medium enterprises.  Was that a political decision?  Yes, it was a political decision.  Was it something the Council and Parliament had the right to do?  As a European citizen, I would answer \"Yes\".  I must also say that, as a European citizen, I take comfort in the fact that the politicians looked not only at the piece of paper we brought to the table but also looked outside the window and saw what were the needs.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015020500002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mario Nava"},{"type":"speech","time":1423094400,"counter":1106,"content":"<p>On the minimum regulation laid down by the European Union, Mr. Nava states that member states &quot;typically did not resort to overly restrictive rules&quot;.

If one wants the economics to be European, so to speak, then the vision of those who control the economics needs to be a European vision.  It made a lot of sense to have equivalence between the level of supervision and the level of the banks' activities.  In some countries there are very small local banks and it is questionable whether a supervisor in Frankfurt would be as efficient as a supervisor closer to the bank who knows it better.  Such banks are clearly of a smaller dimension.  However, one point which I did not make and I should have is that the ECB has the power to supervise any bank, no matter how small.  The ECB is responsible for the 120 larger banks, which account for 75% of European assets, and it has the potential to be responsible for the joint supervision, along with the national supervisor, of any of the other banks, which represent the remaining 25% of the assets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015020500002#BB02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mario Nava"},{"type":"speech","time":1423094400,"counter":1169,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Nava and thank him for coming.

Then comes the risk modelling issue.  The models are internal models of the banks but the supervisors verify the different models and we have initiatives both at the European level, at the EBA, and at the global level, the Basel committee or the BIS, to try to make sure that this modelling is not too far apart.

By the early 2000s, it looked as though, particularly with the testimony which has come before this inquiry, those concentrational limits were no longer being overseen or enforced.  It is questionable whether they were even being breached at that stage.  At no time were the sectoral concentration limits lifted by the Central Bank.

The Chairman is referring to matters in addition to the current individual responsibilities of the people who are on the board.  In a banking institution there are still individual responsibilities for the people on the board.

That is a debate which may take place at some point.<\/p>  <p>  What we wanted to do with the construction of the new system we have constructed, which has capital rules, supervision and resolution, was to make sure that the instances where one needed to impose punishments were as few as possible.

We are meeting to discuss cross-Border developments in transport infrastructure.  This topic has been identified by the committee as a priority for examination this year.  The Minister had an informal meeting with the committee members on 12 November 2014 to discuss the A5 road project, in particular the allocation of funding for the development of a section of the N2 between Aughnacloy and Clontibret.  The Minister agreed at that meeting that he would appear before the committee early this year to outline cross-Border transport infrastructure developments with specific reference to the A5 road project.  The committee held an informal meeting with representatives of Monaghan and Donegal county councils yesterday to discuss that project and the development of the section of the N2 between Aughnacloy and Clontibret in particular.  The Monaghan County Council delegates were Mr. Eugene Cummins, chief executive, Councillor Jackie Crowe, an leas-chathaoirleach, and Mr. John McKiernan, acting senior engineer responsible for roads.  The delegate from Donegal County Council was Mr. John McLaughlin, director of services.<\/p> <p>  The committee also wishes to raise issues regarding the Narrow Water Bridge project.

I acknowledge that the issues we are discussing today are very important to members, their constituents, the country in general and all the people on the island.<\/p> <p>  I will start by referring to the projects the Chairman alluded to, namely, the N2, A5, N14 and N15 projects.  I am fully aware that the financial crisis has had a major impact on capital investment in roads and public transport.  This was unavoidable to get the country&rsquo;s public finances back on track.  It has meant, however, that it has not been possible to make progress on a range of projects, and the reality is that budgets will continue to be constrained for some years to come.  From a road safety perspective, the primary focus needs to be road maintenance and renewal rather than new projects.  In this context, the only major road projects going to construction at present are those included in the 2012 Government infrastructure stimulus programme.  However, I hope that over time the road budget can be restored to facilitate projects that can and will support economic development.<\/p> <p>  The proposed N2 upgrade project is one of the projects that has had to be suspended.  Pending progress on the scheme for the road from Clontibret to the Border, phased improvement work is being undertaken by the National Roads Authority on the existing N2 national primary road between Monaghan town and Emyvale village to provide interim road safety and travel quality improvements.<\/p> <p>  On the A5, implementation of the upgrade project is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland authorities.<\/p><p>The quashing by the High Court in 2013 of the Minister for Regional Development's approval for the construction of two sections of the road has resulted in significant delay.  The Northern Ireland authorities have been working hard on the additional evaluations needed in respect of the project.  They have completed public consultation exercises on four reports intended to address impacts on all areas with environmental designations, including special areas of conservation, special protection areas and Ramsar sites, together with proposed mitigation measures.  I understand that once consideration of the outcome of the public consultation on these reports is completed, the Department intends to initiate a public consultation process on an updated environmental statement, draft vesting order and the draft direction order for the scheme.  It is possible that this will be followed by a new public inquiry regarding the scheme.  However, this will be a matter for decision by the Northern authorities.  I will continue to liaise with my northern colleagues on the project through the transport sector of the North-South Ministerial Council.  The next meeting of the council is scheduled for April this year.  In Donegal the N14-N15 proposed link to the upgraded A5 has planning approval and could be progressed, subject to the availability of funding, once the connecting part of the A5 is upgraded.<\/p><p> Turning to the Narrow Water bridge, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' resources supplemented by State road grants paid by my Department.  The selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  My predecessor, Deputy Varadkar, and the Government were very disappointed that the outcome of the Narrow Water Bridge tender process in 2013 was a doubling of the initial costs budgeted for by the project partners for the construction of the bridge and that, as a result, it did not prove possible to proceed with the project under the INTERREG IVA programme.<\/p><p> I had a meeting last year with officials from Louth County Council to discuss a possible alternative plan being considered by the local authority to advance the Narrow Water Bridge project.  At that meeting I indicated that it was for Louth County Council and other stakeholders to develop the project proposal further.  As the project, as outlined to me, would cost in excess of &euro;50 million, it is necessary for a viable project proposal that will meet project appraisal criteria to be developed and for the project partners to identify sources of funding for a revised project.  In practical terms such a project would require support from both sides of the Border.<\/p><p> As I indicated earlier, my Department continues to operate under a very constrained budget with the primary focus on repair and renewal of regional and local roads rather than new projects.  I hope to be able to come to the committee with better news in the future, as our economy continues to recover, but I am confident that whatever progress can be made, given our current constraints, is being made.  I look forward to hearing the contributions from the members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015020500002#C00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423131000,"counter":1231,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  It is important that we discuss the issue of cross-Border connectivity and the upgrading of our road structure.  Unfortunately, over many years during the Troubles the road network was neglected and there is a serious need for capital funding to be provided to improve the cross-Border road network.  The roads between Monaghan and Tyrone, Monaghan and Armagh and Monaghan and Fermanagh are all in a poor state.<\/p> <p>  In the earlier phases of the PEACE funding a small amount of money was made available to open the Border roads, but no funding has been forthcoming in the intervening years to upgrade those roads to a standard that people in the rest of the country would expect of roads connecting major towns.  The main road between Monaghan and Armagh, linking Belfast, requires upgrading but there are currently no proposals to upgrade that road.  There are no proposals to do further work on the road between the county towns of Monaghan and Enniskillen.  We are discussing the N2 and A5 in particular but all of the Border roads linking population centres must be upgraded.  Without that infrastructural development it will be very difficult to increase trade in the Border region and improve the connectivity which it is hoped will lead to increased job numbers and increased investment in the region, which badly needs such investment.<\/p> <p>  The region has been left behind over many years.  Both Governments must focus clearly on developing it.  A large number of young people have had to leave areas on both sides of the Border to go to Belfast, Dublin or elsewhere to seek employment.  We must start to focus on keeping people in the region.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the N2 and A5, we met a deputation from Monaghan County Council yesterday.  Its members asked that the Government consider providing money for a design phase for the N2-A5 and for the N2 in the Republic.  I appreciate the financial constraints on the Government.  I understand that the capital requirements were previously agreed in 2012 and that it will be 2017 or 2018 before they are revisited.  I welcomed the fact that the Minister's predecessor provided money to upgrade the road from Monaghan to Emyvale to ensure that the road, which was in very dangerous condition, could be improved.  If this project is not going ahead, it is important that, in the short term, we seriously consider providing funding for a bypass of Emyvale.  The volumes of traffic going through Emyvale are very dangerous for the residents.  I receive many communications from the residents that something must be done in the short term rather than the long term to alleviate the problem.  It is a narrow street but large volumes of traffic are going through it daily.  If anything could be done to advance a bypass or a short-term solution for Emyvale, it would be welcome.  It would also shorten journey times into the north west.  It is the last stretch of road that would have to be completed between Monaghan and the Border to deal with traffic management issues.<\/p> <p>  There should be a greater level of engagement between the Roads Service in Northern Ireland and the local authorities in the Republic to do something in the short term to develop our local and regional roads.  There is a lack of correspondence or joined-up thinking about what is being done.  To give an example, if one is in Enniskillen one will not see a signpost directing one towards Monaghan.  If a tourist is in Fermanagh, they will not know how to get to Monaghan.  They will be sent to Cavan.  It is on simple things such as this that the local authorities in both the Republic and Northern Ireland could get together and develop simple strategies in order that people can travel around the region in a coherent fashion.<\/p> <p>  Many people in County Monaghan wish to see immediate upgrades of the local and regional roads structure.  In the longer term, it is important that the north west has greater connectivity.  I am concerned that, from what I have learned from studying what is happening in Northern Ireland, it appears that Northern Ireland has cancelled all proposals to develop the road between Aughnacloy and Ballygawley.  The only sections of road that are proposed to be developed in the North are the road between Strabane and Derry and the road between Omagh and the Ballygawley roundabout.  The Northern Ireland authorities appear to have abandoned any plans to develop the road between Strabane and Omagh.  That is worrying for us.  If our Government puts money into a road towards Derry and Donegal, what is being done by the British Government and the Northern Assembly to develop the road between Strabane and Omagh?  I ask that we find out the long-term proposals in that regard before we decide to press ahead, because we need to know what firm proposals there are in respect of that road.  Clearly, this refers to connectivity to the north west, and if there is no proposal to bypass Strabane or to bypass Omagh, what is the position?<\/p> <p>  Those are my main questions.  I welcome the Minister's attendance.  The issue of cross-Border connectivity is very important.  It has not been developed in the past and, as capital becomes available over the next ten years, I hope it will be developed comprehensively.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a final point.  I have not yet seen a proposal to develop a motorway between Monaghan and Dublin.<\/p><p>We have dual carriageways and motorways across the A5 and down from Aughnacloy to Clontibret, but at the moment there is a single carriageway from Monaghan town to Carrickmacross to Ardee and the only place one will find a dual carriageway is where it links up with the M1 south of Ardee.  There is no proposal for the National Roads Authority to develop the motorway from the M1 interchange to Monaghan.  That should be looked at in the long run, because when capital becomes available, there is no point in having dual carriageway on the least populated section of the route and a single carriageway on the more populated sections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015020500002#D00200","speaker":"972","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423131000,"counter":1233,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  There will almost certainly have to be a public inquiry in the North coming out of the consultations.  It is difficult to determine how long that will take because it is done by an independent group and the Minister must consider that report and give his direction order.  From consultation with the Minister, Mr. Danny Kennedy, MLA, and with the road engineers, things are moving apace.  I will come in a minute to the north-west initiative, which might speed all that up again.

He discussed the neglect of the road network, the need for that to be addressed to facilitate economic development in that region and the need for local authorities and both Governments to focus on this.  I fully accept the Deputy's point regarding the need for investment in that part of our road network, the maintenance of what is there and the delivery of new projects, to which he has referred.  He will understand that my challenge at the moment is that I still have a constrained amount of money.  I am looking to allocate that in the best way possible.  If we continue to see improvement in our economy, particularly, I hope, in the context of the Government's next capital plan, my objective is to make more progress than we have been able to in the recent past in parts of our country with specific needs in terms of road infrastructure.  Deputy Conlan asked me specifically about the N2, particularly in relation to Monaghan and Emyvale.  I referred to this in my opening contribution, but to be more specific, the NRA has very recently confirmed funding, as I am sure the Deputy is aware - I just want to ensure it is on the record - of &euro;2.274 million for interim safety works in that area, many of which are concentrated in the Monaghan to Emyvale area.  That has happened.  I am not in a position to confirm that we can fund any further projects now due to the constraints I have, but I am aware of the needs to which the Deputy is referring and the particular needs of the Border counties.<\/p><p>On Mr. Doherty's comments, I am aware of the possibility of a public inquiry taking place upon completion of the current phase.  He asked specifically about the N14 and N15.  My objective is that they would happen concurrently if the A5 progresses in the way that is proposed.  The Deputy also asked about the N2.  There are no plans for much of the work on this to take place, beyond what I have referred to, due to capital constraints.  On the north-west initiative and the reference to the A5 in the most recent agreement, I am aware of that.  To answer that along with Deputy Kitt's question about how that has progressed, to date, I have attended one sectoral committee meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, but the transport project that was discussed most was the A5.  To date, that has taken the form of the<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>council noting its progress and where it stands in relation to the process to which Mr. Doherty referred.  That is how it has been dealt with in the past.  I expect it will receive a further update given what has happened since we last met several months ago.<\/p><p>On the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in those meetings, the Government is represented by me at the sectoral committees, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, is present at the broader committee meetings and contributes to them.<\/p><p>Deputy Kitt asked me about the contact from Louth County Council regarding the Narrow Water Bridge project.<\/p><p>I met with Louth County Council officials on that a number of months ago and wrote to the committee on the status of the project thereafter.  The committee wrote to me, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach and we wrote back to say it was a matter for Louth County Council to progress, that it needs to be subject to full economic appraisal and that funding arrangements for the scheme would have to be identified.  To date, I have not received further contact from Louth County Council on the points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015020500002#E00500","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423131000,"counter":1238,"content":"<p>We welcome the Minister's attendance and submission.  He is speaking from a position of direct knowledge.  He was in my county last Monday where he announced a major initiative on connectivity to make the north west more accessible to Dublin which is the launch of the new air service between Donegal and Dublin.  The Minister travelled on the A5 on the way back right down to Ardee and the M1.  I have been travelling that road for almost 40 years, including before I became a Member of the Oireachtas, and I must note that there has been a major improvement in it.  From the time one leaves Whitehall until one gets to the Border, one only goes through one town, Emyvale.  It is a huge improvement.  It does not hold anyone back.<\/p> <p>  When one enters the North from Aughnacloy through Strabane and Omagh, it is a very difficult road indeed.  When I started coming here, that was the best stretch of road between Donegal and Dublin.  We were always lucky to get into the North where there was a great service with no potholes, but now it is almost becoming a death trap.  If one leaves Donegal to come to Dublin during working hours, one adds an hour to an hour and a half to one's journey.  At this time of year, there are tractors, trucks and buses and one is taking one's life in one's hands if one tries to overtake.  The other day, there must have been 30 to 40 vehicles between my car and the lead one.  It was like a funeral cortege and it puts a great dampener on things.<\/p> <p>  Inquiries are under way, but can the Minister give us a timescale as to when the A5 will be upgraded?  The Minister said there might be another public inquiry.  I understand the Minister travelled from Letterkenny to Strabane, which is where the A5 begins.  The only dual carriageway in Donegal is for five miles from Letterkenny.  The rest of the road to Lifford is probably worse than the A5 and I would like to find out if there are any plans to upgrade it to improve connectivity and access to Donegal to support tourism and industry and facilitate people from Donegal travelling to Dublin hospitals.  It is a crucial development for the economy of the north west.  We want timescales and an overview of the difficulties in the North.  What can we look forward to?  Can we look forward to anything happening in our time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015020500002#F00200","speaker":"1000"},{"type":"speech","time":1423131000,"counter":1239,"content":"<p>I join colleagues in welcoming the Minister and his official and thank him for his presentation, knowledge of the situation and frankness, which is always a good basis for a proper discussion.  I may not be able to wait to hear the response as I must make a Second Stage contribution in the D&aacute;il.  I will read the blacks later with interest as this matter is very relevant to the constituency I represent.  The broad point which does not need elaboration but merits brief mention is that the Border area has suffered hugely over the years.  That is reflected in a lower standard of living, higher unemployment and other difficulties.  A major step in re-establishing normality is to develop the roads infrastructure and establish proper connectivity between North and South to allow people to travel both ways with ease.  It is about getting normal commerce going to restore normal life.  I also note that there are no air, rail or motorway links from the north west to Dublin as matters stand.<\/p> <p>  While the Minister was not able to make a specific promise today, I detected in his contribution a note of hope and an indication that he looks forward to being back shortly with good news.  I urge him to do that at the earliest possible opportunity and to revert to the committee with positive news.  My colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Conlan, gives a very good exposition on the entire road network and the inadequacies North and South.  He mentioned health and safety and the risk to life and limb around Emyvale and the need for emergency works there.  I support him in that and ask the Minister to consider Deputy Conlan's suggestion.  He has an immediate knowledge of the matter.  I support the N2 section of the Clontibret to Aughnacloy road going to design stage and receiving funding as has been requested by Monaghan County Council.  I record my support for the project and appeal to the Minister to bring it to fruition.  If I recall correctly from our meeting with the personnel there, it will cost &euro;1.5 million to carry out the design work.  I urge the Minister to facilitate that as soon as the money can be made available.<\/p> <p>  As a person with an in-depth knowledge of economics, the Minister will know that with the fall in the value of the euro against sterling, there is a huge economic opportunity for the southern side of the Border region to sell into Northern Ireland and the UK at retail and every level.  It is a reversal of fortune, which happens occasionally including now and presents a great opportunity for the southern end to prosper.  In so far as this meeting is being observed, I urge retailers and manufacturers on the southern side to grasp that opportunity, in particular through the use of the Internet.  There is a great opportunity to make Internet sales.  I mention the matter for two reasons.  It merits mention in its own right and it underlines the importance of a normal infrastructure including proper roads and connections.  Proper roads facilitate economic activity.  If we had a better road structure, the potential for Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Donegal to benefit from the current economic opportunity would be much greater.<\/p> <p>  The case for the infrastructure is a compelling one.  I detect hope and a certain imminence on projects and look forward to the Minister coming back to us.  We all want to get out of where we were and into a new mental space away from the dreadful five or six years we have been through.  I look forward to the day the Minister comes back with an announcement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015020500002#F00300","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423131000,"counter":1240,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing the Minister's presentation.  I had responsibility for some of these matters in a previous Executive in the North and am well acquainted with the strategic significance of the A5, not just for the north-west region but the island as a whole.  It is one of the last major routes that needs to be connected to the capital city.  I welcomed very much the commitment of the Irish Government to these projects on the back of the agreement at Stormont at Christmas.<\/p><p>I know others made the case in regard to the A5 and I heard some of the Minister's responses, but I would like to focus, in particular, on the Narrow Water Bridge.  I listened to the Minister's response in regard to the role of Louth County Council.  I represent the area and there was significant disappointment because it had got so close to the line.  The money was on the table from the SEUPB.  The Executive in the North and the Government here had made offers, private money had been made available and both councils were involved, but we still fell short.  I know there was an issue in terms of the specifications of the contract and the actual cost at the end, but we came so close to getting something for which people in the area had lobbied so much.  It would be an iconic connection between North and South and would very much reflect the growing connectivity and the growing North-South business on the island.  Most of us are Border representatives and we know the importance of these projects in an area which is opening up significantly to tourism, in particular south Down and the Mournes.  The facilities there have been opening up quite substantially.  The addition of the bridge would have a huge impact on the area in terms of bringing business to it.<\/p><p> I noted the Minister's response in terms of Louth County Council continuing to have lead responsibility, which is correct.  We will try to get back to the stage at which we were and get the project over the line.  My local council, Newry and Mourne District Council, which will become Newry, Mourne and Down District, is involved with Louth Council Council.  Part of the support for this will have to come from the EU.  The Government and the Minister's Department could have a significant influence in terms of the level of EU support being made available to Louth County Council for the project, which may have the effect of getting it over the line.  The differential in the prices between North and South might have an impact of reducing the price of the project.  Could I get an assurance from the Minister that he will continue to work with Louth County Council, the lead partner, to try to use whatever influence the Government here has in the European Union, whether through INTERREG or the funds that might become available through the SEUPB, to ensure there is a significant commitment from Europe, which will finally get this project over the line?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015020500002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423131000,"counter":1242,"content":"<p>I will begin with Deputy McGinley's contribution and will make one broad point.  When I was in County Donegal on Monday, I had the opportunity to meet the American Chamber of Commerce and a group of employers.  All were united in saying that road connectivity was absolutely essential to economic development.  They made the point - these considerations are applicable across the Border counties and in all the areas represented here - that from the points of view of cost competitiveness, skills and many other factors which play a big role in investment being attracted to an area or people making a decision to set up a business, the region is doing very well in regard to many things.  Their belief was that road infrastructure and the need for connectivity on the island was essential to making the most of that.  That was one of the reasons I made the decision to maintain the public service obligation arrangement between Donegal Airport and Dublin.  I was pleased to see the reaction to that decision from the business community in the area.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McGinley asked about the timeline, when a public inquiry may end and what that process would be.  That is very much a decision for the Northern Ireland authorities and the planning bodies involved in that.  As the Deputy knows, I have no role in that regard but if we look at how processes like that have worked in the past, if a public inquiry were to take place, it is estimated that all that work would be completed around spring 2017.  However, that is just our judgment on what the process would be.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly made a point about the economic opportunity in the Border counties because of the change in the euro and the importance of local infrastructure making the most of that.  The Deputy said he detected a note of hope in my voice.  There is always hope in my voice when I look at things we are trying to deliver and move forward.  However, that hope needs to be grounded in realism.  My challenge is that while I have an amount of money which is, in many ways, better than it was a year ago, there is still a large number of competing demands on that money.  I am doing my very best to see that money is allocated in the best way possible.  It is because of that I cannot give a commitment currently to some of the significant projects for which everyone is looking.  However, I am very clear on their importance.  What I am trying to do in the interim is to find ways to progress other pieces of work that will make a contribution to road safety.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the point Mr. Conor Murphy put to me, looking back at the process that took place in regard to the bridge, the files and the discussions I have had with my officials, an important lesson is the need for real clarity in regard to the actual cost and to give everybody time to plan so that we do not find that many agreements are in place, as Mr. Murphy said, and much good work is done but, in the final phase, there is a significant change in the cost of the project which results in great disappointment for many people.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Murphy referred to the role of the European Union and the different sources of funding.  That is an area where we both have skills and on which we have been working for quite a while in regard to different projects.  We need real clarity in regard to the real cost of the project and while I will still face constraints in terms of the amount of money I have, it is precisely because we face those constraints that we would work to explore other sources of funding.  INTERREG and SEUPB funding are the kinds of funding on which we would actively work with our colleagues in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015020500002#G00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1423131000,"counter":1243,"content":"<p>I wish to make a few observations on a couple of projects, in particular the Narrow Water Bridge.  They may have been made before I came in, so I will not labour them.  Perhaps the Minister might consider them.  The Narrow Water Bridge affects my constituency of Louth, the constituency of Meath-East, the constituency of Mr. Murphy and other constituencies along the east coast.  The potential of that project does not need labouring and has been discussed <i>ad infinitum<\/i>at Louth County Council.  Indeed, this body has visited there more than a few times.  I would like to reiterate the disappointment felt that the project did not go ahead.  We were at the point where there was every possibility that it would move forward, so there was great disappointment.<\/p><p>We need medium-term and long-term planning in regard to these projects.  I will make a couple of observations on which I would like to hear the Minister's views.We need a working group to deal with beneficial cross-Border projects, such as the A5, the Narrow Water Bridge and projects with lesser potential but with potential.  Is there the possibility of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the corresponding body in Stormont establishing a funding subhead for all cross-Border projects so that on an annual basis, each Department would set aside some resources which would be ring-fenced specifically for this purpose?  Every year, two years or three years, prioritising projects might be considered.  In many ways, there is a parallel here with what the Central Bank of Ireland has done in regard to mortgages in that one needs to have a certain amount saved before one can get a mortgage.  If some resources could be set aside - it would not have to be a huge amount - it would retain the commitment that these projects will be addressed.<\/p><p> I realise that there are political frameworks to be dealt with.  They are fluid and will change with the passage of time.  Assuming that there is a meeting of minds on the designs for the projects, these issues will come down to the availability of resources.  The working group, which embraces technical rather than political aspects, will make considerable progress on agreeing the technical aspects.  The A5 is a good example.  It is very challenging and it is a long distance from Aughnacloy to Lifford.  Much of the groundwork could be achieved over time.  A great deal of time has been spent on the design work for the Narrow Water Bridge.  The technical people have refined it and there are few opportunities to modify the plans.  It is a single phase project.  Other projects can be accomplished in several phases.<\/p><p> In respect of the working group, with its emphasis on technical people, let us establish the degree of commitment for this type of work North and South and establish a funding sub-head in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the parallel department in Stormont.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015020500002#G00300","speaker":"945","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423131000,"counter":1245,"content":"<p>I know the A5 very well because we often travelled from Dundalk to Gweedore and stopped at Flinty McArdle&rsquo;s in Hackballscross and Juniors in Castleblayney and we might have called into the pub in Moy Bridge if there was a stop, and the Traveller&rsquo;s Rest.

It would pay for itself because it would bring plenty of investment into those areas where it is needed.  As a minimum we need certainty about the design for the part from Clontibret to Aughnacloy.  There is no point having 400 m sterilised for the next 100 years for the farmers.  The road from Strabane to Derry is like a switchback railway.  It can take an hour to make the journey.<\/p> <p>  As regards the Narrow Water Bridge, there is no point in my repeating what Mr. Murphy and Deputy Kirk said except that INTERREG V does not cover funding for the Narrow Water Bridge.  Let us not fool ourselves.  If an application was made under the guidelines as they stand it would not be possible to get funding.  The three Administrations in Scotland, Northern Ireland and here can do a great deal to change those guidelines, which are draft guidelines, and that at least would allow us to apply for funding under INTERREG.<\/p> <p>  In October 2013 the North-South Ministerial Council stated it supported the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge.  That is a bit woolly and needs to be upgraded to a commitment to the provision of the bridge.  Louth County Council will be very reluctant to do this on its own.  It is the lead partner but that is for technical reasons.  Somebody had to do it.  As Mr. Murphy says, Newry and Mourne, or whatever it will soon be called, Louth County Council and the East Border Region are all partners in this.  The Departments have to come in on this and realise that there is a need, under the Good Friday Agreement, to have special funding arrangements for infrastructural projects because none of them is happening.  It is not the Government's fault.  We need more movement and support on the North-South Ministerial Council.  If that had been the case we might have the Narrow Water Bridge.  That is a personal opinion.  We were not far short of the money needed.

My challenge is that I need to meet those needs in the context of a fixed budget.  The budget will always be fixed in the future.  However, as we see economic recovery, I am aiming to ensure that not only will funding be there to better maintain what we have, but there will be funding to progress projects needed for the economic development of the entire island.  When we get to that point, the projects raised here this morning will be considered.  Members will be aware that I have representatives from many parts of the country making different points to me regarding projects in their areas.  The A5 project has a political reference in terms of recent agreements that have been made to give it a particular status.<\/p><p>I have always recognised that in other contributions I have made to this committee.  <\/p><p> On the proposal in regard to the working group on North-South connectivity, my initial response, although I will give it further thought, is that the North-South Ministerial Council, in which I participate regularly, is the mechanism through which my Department and I aim to progress these matters.  I will share with the committee the minutes and communiqu&eacute; that came out of the last North-South Ministerial Council, which touch on many of the points made here today.  It is the main mechanism through which I progress these issues and matters in relation to the A5.<\/p><p> The issue of the Narrow Water bridge project was raised.  It is an issue on which I touched earlier in my response to questions from Mr. Conor Murphy, MP.  My understanding is that the final tender price was double the initial estimate.  The project was estimated to cost &euro;15 million and the final cost, which became apparent towards the end of the process, was approximately &euro;30 million.  I do not assign singular responsibility for this to anybody, because that is the work of others.  None the less, it is important to make the observation that if a project doubles in cost during the tender process this poses acute difficulties for everybody, including the Government, the local authorities and anybody else making a contribution to it.  I am sure some of the members here today could make the point that an additional &euro;15 million in the context of the overall size of my capital budget could easily be found.  However, the fundamental point is that if a project doubles in cost and is very different from what people originally expected, finding the additional funding for it is exceptionally difficult.  The disappointment expressed by many speakers today is shared by Government.  <\/p><p> In regard to progress in this matter, before I can get into how funding for it will now be committed, or, as Deputy Kirk said, how we propose to plan for these things in the future, I need further clarification about the project.

The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the revised Estimates for 2015.  Our meeting today will involve a slightly revised format, designed to encourage more focused scrutiny of the financial Estimates by linking them to Department's goals and targets.  This is a significant opportunity for the Department and the committee to work together to enhance the scrutiny process and to encourage useful debate.  I take this opportunity to thank the Minister's officials and acknowledge their efforts in preparing the briefing material for today's session, and for supplying additional information on specific areas and on performance, which I hope will benefit the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Session A covers the Department's performance in three areas of activity: the primary care community drugs schemes, acute hospitals and delayed discharges.  For the benefit of members and those watching and listening at home, the format is that I will invite the Minister to make his opening remarks and to comment on the issues of performance, after which members, who have been supplied with briefing materials, may ask questions.  In the first session, members should confine their questions to the three areas under scrutiny - namely, the cost of prescription drugs, acute hospitals and the issue of delayed discharges.  The session will then be followed by an examination of each budget subhead in order.  A draft timetable has been circulated.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Members have been given the departmental briefing note on each of the Votes.

The briefing provided to the Deputies this year concentrates on the three particular service areas in which the committee has expressed a particular interest - primary care services, acute hospital services and long-term residential care.<\/p> <p>  On my appointment as Minister for Health, I said on more than one occasion that my first priority was to achieve a realistic budget for the health service.  We have achieved that in the revised health Estimate for 2015.  Before looking at the Estimates in detail, I wish to make a few general observations on the overall budgetary situation, as there are a number of complicating factors this year.<\/p> <p>  The disestablishment of the HSE Vote is, we all appreciate, a complicating factor when comparing year on year.<\/p><p>Since the beginning of this year, the HSE is funded by grants provided under Vote 38.  The revised Vote structure has resulted in income of &euro;1 billion, previously accounted for as appropriations-in-aid under the Vote of the HSE, being accounted for as income in the annual financial statements of the HSE rather than the Vote for the Department of Health.  This income comprises hospital maintenance receipts, superannuation, the pension levy and other miscellaneous income such as car parks, restaurants and the primary care reimbursement service.  Restating the Health Vote for 2014 on a like-for-like basis consistent with the new Vote structure, the gross Revised Estimates provision for the Health Vote for 2014 is &euro;12.113 billion, while the post-Supplementary position is &euro;12.793 billion.  In other words, the gross Vote for 2015 is &euro;564 million more than the original provision in 2014.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the increased Exchequer funding, additional non-Vote income collected by the HSE of &euro;131 million and at least &euro;130 million through cost reductions and other savings have also been identified and will be retained within the HSE to support services providing, in effect, &euro;825 million<b><\/b>in additional resources, as compared with the original position in 2014 or, more accurately, &euro;145 million compared with the post-Supplementary position.  This funding increase is part of a two-year process to stabilise and improve health funding.  The spending ceiling for health in 2016 has been increased by a further &euro;174 million.  Given the demographic pressures facing the sector, there is no question that the budgetary situation remains challenging.  I am confident, however, that we are in a much more stable financial position than we have been for some time.<br\/><br\/>The budget parameters for 2015 have allowed the HSE service plan to include a number of targeted enhancements to health and social care services<b>, <\/b>while providing generally for the delivery of existing levels of services.  The service plan also progresses key elements of the<b><\/b>health service reform programme.  In addition, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and I recently published our 25 health priorities for the year ahead.  These measures include legislation to reduce alcohol consumption, proposals to extend the remit of the Health Information and Quality Authority and the range of services available in primary care, moves to increase the number of people with health insurance and the first national survey in eight years of Ireland&rsquo;s health.  These priorities provide a clear direction for the development of health services and policy in 2015 and align with and support many of the developments provided for in the service plan.<br\/><br\/>There is, undoubtedly, a strong case for increased funding in health in the years ahead.  However, it is also important to acknowledge that, with growing demand, increasing health funding without reform will not resolve the difficulties in our health services.  Our experience during the boom Celtic tiger years, when considerably increased year-on-year funding was spent on health without a satisfactory return, is a stark testimony to this.  Providing more resources without reform simply will not work, which is why the continuation of the programme of health service reform is of critical importance.<br\/><br\/>With this in mind, the HSE&rsquo;s 2015 service plan gives priority to progressing the Government&rsquo;s reform agenda.  This plan provides for the establishment of<b><\/b>community health care organisations,<b><\/b>which will improve the way in which primary care in the community is delivered.  Likewise, the reorganisation of public hospitals into hospital groups is designed to deliver improved outcomes for patients.  Each group of hospitals will work together to provide acute care for patients in their area, integrating with community and primary care.  The objective is to maximise the amount of care delivered locally while ensuring that specialist and complex care is safely provided in larger specialist centres.  One of my priorities for 2015 is to get the community health care organisations and the hospital groups up and running.  As part of the reform agenda, I also expect to see the issuing of the first individual health identifiers, which is the equivalent of an identification or PPS number for health, increased investment in ICT and e-health and the embedding of the activity-based funding model in the health service in 2015.  This year&rsquo;s Estimate provides for an almost 40% increase in ICT funding, from &euro;40 million to &euro;55 million.  This needs to be sustained in the years ahead.<br\/><br\/>The HSE has put in place a considerably enhanced governance and accountability framework for 2015.  This is set out in detail in the service plan.  The framework provides the means by which the HSE, hospital groups and community health organisations and other units will be held to account throughout the year for their efficiency and control across the balanced scorecard of access to services, patient safety, finance and human resources.<br\/><br\/>A suite of performance indicators for 2015 is set out in the HSE&rsquo;s 2015 service plan.  Having clear and achievable targets is important both in terms of driving performance and activity forward and in measuring past performance.  Performance indicators are particularly useful when it comes to measuring volume and throughput.  However, they are not always sufficient in themselves when it comes to evaluating the more qualitative aspects of service delivery.  For example, an existing performance indicator for ambulance response times measures the extent to which a target time of 19 minutes is achieved.  This is an important measure but what it cannot do is consider or take into account the actual outcome for the patient.  For example, an ambulance getting to the patient in 18 minutes but the patient dying is counted as a success whereas the ambulance getting to the patient in 21 minutes, defibrillating him or her on the scene and the patient surviving is considered a failure.  That is often how targets work.  HIQA now acknowledges that we need to have a different set of targets, with new ones based on clinical audit and actual patient outcomes.<br\/><br\/>As I mentioned earlier, the 2015 service plan provides for the delivery of an existing level of services, with targeted enhancements in some areas.  Enhancements include the commencement of the extension to the BreastCheck programme to women aged 65 to 69 years of age, implementation of the first two phases of a universal GP service, making a GP service without fees available to all children under six and everyone over 70 years, and the provision of &euro;30 million in funding for new hepatitis C drugs which cure the virus.  An additional &euro;35 million in ring-fenced funding is being provided for mental health services in 2015.  A number of measures will be taken this year to develop primary care services further, thereby allowing more people to receive a wide range of quality services in their own community.  An additional &euro;14 million is being provided for primary care developments, including the extension of the pilot ultrasound GP access projects in the south and west and the provision of additional minor surgery services in agreed GP practices and primary care centres.  There will also be an extension of the GP out-of-hours services, within existing resources, to areas currently not covered, and more spending on community orthodontic and ophthalmic services.  An additional &euro;2 million is being provided to improve maternity services. <br\/><br\/>The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and I are also keen to deliver real improvements in patient access and experience in our hospitals in 2015.  For this reason, we have included clear targets for 2015 in relation to delayed discharges, trolley waits and waiting lists times in our recently published health priorities for this year.  We want to reduce by one third to fewer than 500 the number of patients with delayed discharges, and we are seeking to reduce by one third to fewer than 70 on average the number of patients on trolleys in emergency departments waiting more than nine hours for admission.  We are also committed to developing and implementing a plan to address waiting lists, with a focus on very long waiters, so that by mid-year, nobody will wait longer than 18 months for inpatient and day case treatment or an outpatient appointment, with a further reduction thereafter to no greater than 15 months by year end.  These targets involve progressive and measurable improvement for patients and I expect all hospitals to meet them at a minimum and, where possible, surpass them.<br\/><br\/>As Deputies and Senators will appreciate, there are enormous demands and cost pressures on our health service.  Health care demand continues to rise due to our growing and ageing population, the increasing incidence of chronic conditions, and advances in medical technologies and treatments which can be very expensive.  Health services all around the world are struggling with this issue of rising costs, deficits and difficulties and getting staff.  An interesting article in <i>The Guardian<\/i>in England pointed out that the NHS has spent &euro;2.6 billion on agency staff because of the difficulties it is having in recruiting staff and that most NHS trusts are now in the red.  I am aware of the limitations as to what can be achieved with the additional modest increase in funding available this year.  We clearly do not have sufficient funds to address immediately all areas of concern across the health sector.

As acknowledged by the Minister and Mr. O'Brien of the HSE, health funding is inadequate in terms of provision of care for people going through the health system.  This is very evident in the context of our emergency departments.  The Minister said that there is funding in place to stabilise the situation and that we are off to a good start.  The bottom line is that we are not off to a good start.  Rather we are off to a bad start.  In the first month of 2015 there was a huge escalation in the number of people attending our emergency departments.<\/p><p>There is chaos in emergency departments throughout the country.  There were 46 patients on trolleys in Limerick yesterday, 40 in Drogheda and 38 in Beaumont.  On Monday I spoke to people who attended the emergency department in Cork University Hospital and were stunned by what they witnessed.  People did not even have chairs to sit on while they were waiting.  We are off to a very bad start.<\/p><p> The difficulty I have is that the plan lacks a certain amount of ambition.  In fact, there is no ambition whatsoever in this HSE service plan and the Estimates to underpin and fund it.  In the context of waiting lists, the Minister has, in effect, changed the targets because he failed to meet the previous targets.  Johnny Sexton never comes off a rugby pitch and says the reason he missed the conversions was because the goals were in the wrong place.  It is simply incredible that we now have a situation where we have run the white flag up the pole and accepted that the previous targets were unattainable, and are returning to ones which should be more attainable.  The previous targets were wrong.<\/p><p> People should not have to wait eight months.  In the mind of the Minister, 18 months is okay.  I find it incredible that we are now accepting poorer standards of care.  We have always emphasised the fact that, clinically and psychologically, it is bad for people to have to wait, and it is also bad for the health service in the long term because it will cost more when such people are eventually seen.<\/p><p> The Minister should be trying to address what is causing delays rather than changing the targets to make it look like there are no delays.  That is what he has done in the context of inpatient and day case treatments.  I do not know why anybody would come to the meeting and assume that things are getting better.  We have had an appallingly bad start to 2015.  We can assume that if things continue like this, within a matter of months we will encounter major difficulties.<\/p><p> I am most concerned about day cases and inpatient day cases because there has to be an acknowledgement at some stage that additional funding needs to be provided for the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  There is no point in the Minister, Mr. Breslin or whoever the Accounting Officer for the health services is - I am still unsure about that - sitting here and pretending that we can get through this with what we have.  If we try to get through with what we have, the Minister will have very long waiting lists and will have to increase targets again.<\/p><p> We have to accept that to deal with the escalation in waiting lists, the number of patients who have to see a consultant and those who will need to have treatment or procedures carried out this year, we will need to fund the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  That is something that we will have to revisit very quickly for the sake of those who are on waiting lists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015020500002#B00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":1291,"content":"<p>I wish that the situation was other than what it is.  That is probably the Minister's view of things as they stand.  There are many things which are working well within our health services, and that is to be acknowledged.  It is important that we start by acknowledging what I have described time after time as the heroic efforts of front-line service providers, not only, but very particularly, across our network of acute hospital sites.<\/p> <p>  I have noted during the past 12 months a significant increase in patient dissatisfaction presenting to me in specific individual cases and from collective reflection on experiences shared by a number of people, not only within my constituency but throughout the State.  That has been added to over the past 12 months by more people who are service providers within the system coming forward in tandem and reflecting on their experiences as workers within the system.<\/p> <p>  I have no doubt that the Minister is at least as equally aware of this as I and other voices in the committee are.  We need to face up to the problems that exist.  We can only do that with a collective response in a properly worked out, structured and resourced way.  That is not what is happening.<\/p> <p>  This year is the first time in seven years that there has not been a reduction in the budget; instead there is an increase.  Despite all of the marketing language of the budget for the health services, at the end of the day, against the backdrop of the Supplementary Estimates in 2014 and 2015 and the reality that there will be a process of carrying forward what are described as overspends year on year following the passage of legislation during the past year, there are very serious problems not only for this year but mounting year on year for the years to follow.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has been in office for several months, and I had hoped that by now he would have laid out a very carefully thought out plan of address.  Rather than responding to one point or deficiency, I had hoped such a plan would encompass the critical elements that we need to address.  These are presented time after time.  The need for additional resources is the bottom line.  We need more consultants and consultant posts.  We need to see more nurses engaged in the hospital network.  We need to resource community-led responses.  The focus should be on primary care and the prevention of ill health.<\/p> <p>  No substantive and cohesive plan has been presented that gives me confidence that we will see a significant difference in the course of 2015 as against the year gone by and preceding years.  That is a major problem.  Problems are mounting on each other, as I have said, and the situation will get worse.  I am not reflecting words I have authored, but I am reflecting what service providers have said to me.  They have said we no longer have a patient-focused service.  That is a very worrying reflection on the situation as seen by those who are front-line providers and have, as I have said, performed heroically despite all of the challenges they face.<\/p> <p>  I have had considerable experience of our health services over the past 12 months, not only in my personal life but also my family life.  I can say without any question that a wonderful level of service is being provided by people who are going far beyond what is or could possibly be expected of them.  That cannot be missed.  What is happening to them in turn is that they are being worn out and will be burnt out before their time.  I said earlier that they have lost the zest for their career path.<\/p><p>All of that must be faced up to.  If those we trust to look after our health care needs suffer burn-out and loss of verve patient safety will certainly be at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015020500002#C00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":1293,"content":"<p>There has been considerable investment in the development of the mental health services under the programme for Government, amounting to &euro;130 million extra over four years.

By the end of the year very little of the planned recruitment takes place.

We have had regular debates on medical cards and how we fund primary care and support those who need assistance.  We are talking about the roll-out of free general practitioner, GP, care for everybody, which should have happened by this year but will not.  Free GP care is for those under the age of six and over the age of 70.<\/p> <p>  Many people who need the State&rsquo;s support fall through the cracks.  They need access not only to their GP but to secondary services and we must address that in a meaningful way.  We can talk about political parties and health policies and differing views on how society should be structured but a child with Down's syndrome needs and deserves the support of the State.  I understand the complexities involved and that the Minister considered this with an expert group but there is an element of discretion which must be used in a meaningful, fair and compassionate way.  We can understand that some people may pretend there is something wrong with them or try to cheat the system but there is no cheating with Down's syndrome.  This family needs support.  The problem has been going on for a long time, not only for this family but for many others where there is long-term illness or disability and who, because of the means test system operated under the Health Act 1970, cannot qualify on income grounds but should qualify on the grounds of compassion and decency.  We have to focus on that issue in respect of the primary care system and medical cards.<\/p> <p>  If nothing else is done today could the Minister act on the petition sent to the Chairman today, and on others who fall through the cracks?  Most people would welcome universal free GP care but not if the Government is funding it by taking money from somebody who has Down's syndrome.  In effect that is what it is doing because by the Minister&rsquo;s admission there is inadequate funding in the health service.  Providing free GP care to all those under the age of six means taking it from those who need it most.  The Minister can try to dress that up and spin it any way he likes but that is why Ryan Gilmartin was outside the gates of Leinster House this morning, a cold February morning, having travelled from Mayo.  The Government has prioritised healthy children of wealthy people over a child who needs and deserves the support of the State.  I would like the Minister to address the case of Ryan Gilmartin and the many others in a similar situation.  This has been aired publicly and the public expressed its view on it last May, when it was a central issue in the local election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015020500002#D00400","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":1296,"content":"<p>We are discussing the Estimates now, not the local election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015020500002#D00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":1297,"content":"<p>The Estimate this year does not cater for the Ryan Gilmartins but it will cater for giving free GP care to under sixes and over 70s.

I will try it again.  The Minister may not appreciate it but it is very difficult when so much of what is presented to us, certainly as Opposition health spokespersons, can reflect negative and, in some instances, disturbing experiences.<\/p><p>I will start again, as I have attributed, rightly, great credit to our front-line care providers in various health care settings, by saying that I welcome very much the indication of significant savings in the overall drugs bill to the HSE.  In the period 2012 through 2014, we are looking at a significant reduction in the total of the primary care reimbursement in regard to drugs.  That is the result of a focused address of the issue, but much more can be achieved.  That was acknowledged by the Minister's predecessor and I have no doubt it is his own view.  Having welcomed the savings to date, I would like to know if further engagements are intended with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association on proprietary drugs and with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland in regard to generic drugs.  What further engagements does the Minister intend to have?  Is he seeking to achieve new and increased savings through agreement with both these bodies?<\/p><p> It is important to note that the figures that were shared with us demonstrate that over the period of the first decade since the turn of the millennium, there was a more than doubling in the number of individual prescribed items across the State.  While the IPHA and APMI are undoubtedly to be focused on in regard to cost, is it the case that there is ongoing or intended engagement with GP representative organisations to responsibly address this issue to ensure that the most thoughtful and careful consideration goes into prescribing?  The Minister is a doctor himself.  I would like to know if he has intentions in that regard and if he considers that there is a need to address the significant increase in prescribing.  Does he believe there is an element of over-prescribing in all of this that warrants focused attention?<\/p><p> On the cost of drugs and the nine State basket whereby we determine the median position, I have urged the Minister's predecessors to consider the potential of moving from the median position to the lowest with all of the resultant savings that would accrue to the Exchequer and the health spend.  Has the Minister considered that and does he intend to engage in that regard?  I ask him to give me some information on this.<\/p><p> I take the opportunity again in order to be balanced to welcome yesterday's HSE decision on Soliris and PNH which followed its recent engagement with the manufacturers.  It must be a phenomenal relief to that small number of sufferers outside the ten who are being catered for through the St. James's Hospital arrangements.  I commend the decision.  There are other products which have had pharmaco-economic assessments.  Does the decision on Soliris and PNH indicate a relaxation in that regard and suggest that other critically important products to the health and well-being of other sufferers of other challenges in life might expect a similar response?<\/p><p> The time is limited and we are trying to cover three areas in this new format.  As such, will the Chairman allow me to move on to the acute hospitals and waiting lists?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015020500002#D00700","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":1300,"content":"<p>The Deputy can come back in again after the Minister as we started late.

As of 8 a.m. this morning, the position on emergency department overcrowding is that there were 372 patients on trolleys in emergency departments or on wards.  Of those, 183 had been on trolleys for more than nine hours.  As such, it is a significant improvement on the position earlier in the week.  That ranges of course from no patients on trolleys in Wexford and Tralee to as many as 37 in Tallaght, of whom 12 were on trolleys for more than nine hours.<\/p> <p>  The situation is certainly worse than it was this time last year and nobody is trying to say otherwise.  It is due to a combination of factors.  There is a higher level of delayed discharges than this time last year with perhaps 100 or more.  It has also been difficult to recruit senior decision-making doctors in some hospitals.  Junior doctors who are less experienced are more likely to admit patients to be safe than more experienced doctors.  That is definitely a feature in some of the more peripheral hospitals where more than half of patients are being admitted, whereas the statistic should be approximately one quarter.  In some hospitals, we have an influenza-like illness, Norovirus, which is adding to numbers and causing beds to be closed for infection control rather than monetary reasons.  The situation has been worse in previous years than it is now, but it remains very bad.  Aside from the discomfort and lack of dignity, having anyone waiting many hours on a trolley creates an infection control risk and there is a risk of treatment being delayed.  It is also a patient safety issue.<\/p> <p>  In terms of actions, 300 additional fair deal places have been allocated as have 400 additional home care packages.  Approximately 500 transition and community beds have been reopened or funded and we are working on getting another 200 beds opened in the next two weeks across the State.  We are not taking anything for granted or assuming that things will get better as the spring comes in.  In addition, Mount Carmel will be opened as a community hospital for Dublin in March.  We will keep plugging away at this.  As Mr. Liam Doran of the nurses' union said yesterday, this is the most sustained effort we have ever seen to tackle this issue.  We are not succeeding quite yet but will keep at it until we do.<\/p> <p>  The targets on waiting times have not been changed and the 20-week target for children and the eight-month and one-year targets for adults remain in place.  They will be reported on every month in the HSE's PAR as they always have been.  When one cannot do what one wants, one does what one can.  We can deal with those very long waits where people are waiting 15 and 18 months from within existing resources.  That can be done in particular by adherence to chronological order.  Unfortunately, there is evidence in a number of institutions of failures for whatever reason to stick to the chronological order.  GPs will tell one that they send patients in with the exact same condition, some of whom get their operations within three or four months while others are on a waiting list for a year.  We do not know why that is, but it is something that will have to be focused on very carefully to ensure that urgent cases are prioritised and then everyone else is seen in chronological order.  Queue skipping is not ethical or acceptable and it has to stop.<\/p> <p>  There were no targets on waiting lists when Fianna F&aacute;il was in power.  There were newspaper reports that people were waiting six years in some cases for treatment under the then Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, at a time when there were endless amounts of money in the health service.  As such, Deputy Billy Kelleher could be a little less shrill in his criticisms, particularly if he wants that man to be the Taoiseach.  Obviously, I would like there to be more money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015020500002#E00500","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":1304,"content":"<p>He wants to be Taoiseach as much as the Minister does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015020500002#E00600","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":1305,"content":"<p>We are on the Estimates, not the future Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015020500002#E00700","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":1306,"content":"<p>They both have burning ambition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015020500002#E00800","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":1307,"content":"<p>So people say.<\/p><p>Obviously, I would like to have more money to address waiting times.  We do not have it but I would love to get it.  If I did have it, we would be able to spend it on reducing waiting times.  I am not sure I would use the NTPF mechanism, as the Deputy suggests.  What that involves is essentially paying private hospitals to do the work of the public sector.  There may be a role for that, but it is not my favoured role.  I would prefer to see us opening the closed theatres in public hospitals, such as in Cappagh, and the two closed theatres in Nenagh.  I do not think the default solution should be to pay the private sector, because that is an expensive option.  It also creates a perverse incentive to have waiting lists if people know that their waiting lists will be bought off by the Government and paid for in the private sector and they can then be paid twice for the same patient in some cases.  This would create a very perverse incentive and that is what happened under the previous Government with the NTPF.  That is not to say there may not be a role for it where we do not have the capacity in the public system, but where there is capacity we should use the public system's capacity first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015020500002#E00900","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":1309,"content":"<p>Would the Minister include in that commentary a decision not to change consultants' contracts in order to help tackle the waiting lists and free them up to do more private work, or more public work in some cases?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015020500002#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":1310,"content":"<p>When consultants are doing private work they are not dealing with waiting lists.

He said we needed more nurses, and I agree with him.  We had 500 more nurses last year than the year before, so the numbers are starting to rise again after a very big reduction.  There will be further nursing posts this year, some of which have recently been agreed at the Labour Relations Commission.  We now have more consultants and midwives than ever before in the history of the State and fewer managers and administrators than at any time since the establishment of the HSE.  This information does not come across very often, but it is true.  The HSE service plan provides for more consultants and midwives.<\/p> <p>  We are having problems with recruitment.  Just last week, we secured agreement with the IMO on new salary scales for consultants.  Those positions will be advertised in batches over the next couple of weeks.  It will take months to fill the positions, as the nature of consultant posts is that people need to move from somewhere else.  I am confident that they will be filled, and this will help the situation.<\/p> <p>  Recruitment is far too slow with regard to other health professionals, such as in the field of mental health and nursing, because recruitment is processed through the national recruitment service in Manorhamilton.  That system was set up at a different time when the drive was to reduce the headcount.  Now we are trying to increase numbers and we need to turn the whole system around.  There will be more local recruitment, allowing hospitals, once again, to do their own recruitment in certain circumstances.  <\/p> <p>  A reference was made to a lack of ambition.  I have published 25 detailed actions that we intend to undertake in 2015 alone.  If we could complete 22 or 23, we would be doing extremely well.  One can be very ambitious but not achieve anything.  It is better to be realistic and be in a position to achieve something.  I think if we can achieve 22 or 23 of those 25 actions it will be a good year's work.  However, it will not solve all our problems.<\/p> <p>  The issue of drugs savings is being addressed in three ways.  We are continuing reference pricing for generic drugs, where the Government sets the price and that is what we pay.  These are usually the UK prices or a little above, and that will continue throughout the year.  We expect tens of millions in savings from that policy.  With regard to on-patent drugs, we are now in the mid-term review of the IPHA agreement.  The basket cannot be renegotiated until the agreement is renegotiated at the end of this year.  We have indicated to the industry that if a discount cannot be agreed we will use our legislative powers to impose a discount on those patent drugs.  That can be done in a matter of weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015020500002#F00300","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":1311,"content":"<p>What about the companies that are not under the umbrella of IPHA?

GPs can prescribe alternatives to commonly used medicines.  For example, in the case of medicines for the treatment of ulcers, there is already an identified preferred drug from among three or four drugs, and this will be the most cost-effective drug.  Other countries have imposed formularies and decreed that doctors can only prescribe the most cost-effective drug in the class.  We have not done this yet.  In my view it would restrict clinical autonomy, and I would not decide to do that quickly, but it is an option.  What we prefer to do, under the leadership of Dr. Michael Barry, is to encourage GPs, consultants and junior doctors to prescribe the most cost-effective medicine in the class and to do this by agreement rather than by compulsion.  That is an option if we need it.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to savings on drugs, it is not all about saving money.  The main reason we need to make savings in the drugs bill is so that we can fund new treatments and innovative therapies.  We need to find the money from somewhere to fund the additional &euro;30 million being spent on hepatitis C drugs to cure the virus, and this is the reason we are looking for savings on drugs.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about Soliris.  The HSE national drugs committee decided to approve the use of Soliris, following discussions with the manufacturer, Alexion.  It is still considered not to be cost-effective.  The view of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics is that a medicine costing nearly half a million euro a year per patient which does not cure the illness is not a cost-effective medicine.  The reason it was approved is that it is an orphan drug, in that there is no other treatment for that condition.  Where a medicine is an orphan medicine and there is no other treatment other than this medicine, the drug companies have us over a barrel.  The HSE took the decision yesterday not to allow patients to suffer, notwithstanding the fact that the corporation has put its profits first and foremost.  On that issue, I hope another company will develop a similar medicine for those conditions sometime soon, in which case I guarantee that both prices will decrease considerably.<\/p> <p>  With regard to medical cards, Deputies will appreciate that I cannot discuss individual cases.  I do not have access to people's medical records nor to their financial information.  It would be wrong and inappropriate to discuss individual cases.  I will make the point that people with Down's syndrome are entitled to the long-term illness cards, which means they do not pay for their medicines.  In that sense, it is actually better than a medical card because medical card patients have to pay a prescription fee.  In some cases, very sick children or adults will have a doctor visit card, which means they do not have to pay the doctor.  They will have a long-term illness card, which means they do not have to pay at all for medicines for their condition.  Neither do they pay for aids and appliances.  Patients with these three entitlements are actually better off than if they had a medical card, because medical card patients must pay a prescription fee.  That often does not come across well in debates.  People often do not realise that sometimes one can be better off having a suite of supports such as the doctor visit card, the long-term illness card and the aids and appliances card, in that these can be better than having a medical card.  It is sometimes difficult to explain this to people.<\/p> <p>  Medical cards are means tested.  Approximately 40% of the population - the least well-off 40% - have medical cards based on their means.  Discretion is used where people are over the limit, but that discretion is based on their medical costs and their medical bills.  For example, if a person is several thousand euro a month over the limit, it is very difficult to see how they would qualify for discretion because the most one can pay for medicines is &euro;144 a month.  For example, if a person attends a doctor twice or three times a month, that is &euro;150.  Therefore, the maximum one could pay is &euro;300 a month.  If a person is several thousand euro a month over the limit, then it is very difficult to find grounds for discretion.  However, the number of people with discretionary medical cards has increased from 50,000 to 75,000 in the past year or so.  With the addition of those with discretionary doctor visit cards, the number rises to 108,000.  The HSE is now permitted to supply aids and appliances - such as crutches or wigs - where appropriate and regardless of income. <\/p> <p>  The next step in the reform process is the clinical advisory group which was appointed a week or two ago.  Within three months the group will produce guidelines to widen discretion further.  This will encompass more very sick children in particular, but I do not wish to prejudge the outcome of their determinations.  It is important to bear in mind that sometimes the suite of supports given to a patient, such as a doctor visit card, a long-term illness card or aids and appliances, can be greater than the medical card he or she may be seeking.  This point is often not understood.<\/p> <p>  It is important to regard free GP care for the under-six age group as just the first step in providing GP care without fees to everyone in the population.  It has not been done yet, so it is certainly not being done at the expense of anyone else.  I reject that suggestion because it is not true.  It is additional, and it is not just for the children of better-off parents.<\/p><p>It is a new service for all children under six years.  It will be an enhanced primary care service that will include areas such as the management of asthma in practice and health assessments for children at certain points as they grow up.  All children will benefit.  Currently, people go to GP surgeries with an illness for which they are treated and that is it.  Under the new primary care service, there will be health checks for obesity, etc.  This means that conditions not being diagnosed now are more likely to be diagnosed.  That will have benefits down the line.<\/p><p> The real beneficiaries will not be very well-off parents but middle to low income parents, the kind of people who work hard and pay child care fees and a lot of tax without getting anything from the State other than education services.  I really do not believe we should begrudge hard-working parents who often run out of money on Friday or Saturday of every week access to their GP without fees.  Deputy Billy Kelleher mischaracterises what we are trying to do in that respect.<\/p><p> On mental health issues, my officials will revert to Deputy Dan Neville with more details.  I have to hand information which states over 1,150 new posts have been approved since 2012.  They facilitate the policy of moving away from traditional institution-based care to a patient-centred, flexible and community-based mental health service in which hospital admissions are greatly reduced, while still providing inpatient care, where appropriate.  At the end of December, of the 416 approved posts, 95%, or 397, had been filled.  I refer to the posts approved for 2012.  Of the 477 posts approved for 2013, 78%, or 367, have been filled.  The remainder of the vacant posts are at various stages of recruitment.  There have been some difficulties in identifying outstanding candidates, primarily for geographic or qualifications reasons.  Therefore, approximately 86% of combined posts in the period 2012 to 2013 have been filled.<\/p><p> On CAMHS, 233 whole-time equivalent posts were allocated for the years 2012 and 2013, of which 193, or 83%, had been filled by the end of the year.  Of the 150.5 whole-time equivalent posts allocated as part of the 2012 investment, 94%, or 141, had been filled at the end of last year.  Of the 82.5 posts allocated for 2013, 62%, or 52, had been filled at the end of the year.   The remainder are at various stages of recruitment.  Perhaps I might give a note to the Deputy later that will outline the statistics in more detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015020500002#F00500","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":1314,"content":"<p>Let me ask a few questions based on the Minister's reply.

The task of the special delivery unit was to address the issue of emergency department overcrowding, seamless movement of patients through hospitals, step-down facilities, home care services and all that went with them in a manner that would ensure hospitals would deal with patients effectively and efficiently.  The Minister has indicated that the National Treatment Purchase Fund is not the ideal way to address waiting lists.  That statement is incorrect in cases in which a theatre in a public hospital cannot be used because of staff and consultant shortages and patients are transferred to the private sector.  Where there is insufficient capacity in key areas in the public system, the private sector will clearly have a role to play in moving people off the public waiting list.  We should not have ideological hang-ups about this practice.  Patients want to be treated in a timely, efficient and effective manner.<\/p> <p>  Duplication is a clear waste of public funds and should not be condoned.<\/p><p>Where there are huge deficiencies in the capacity of the public hospital system to deliver - that is, not enough consultants, medical staff or front-line staff, or just not enough theatres, wards or beds - the private sector would have a role.  Otherwise, there would be an increase in the number of people waiting for treatment.  I note that the amount is the same as last year.  While the Minister said he might envisage revisiting the use of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, it is evident from the Estimates that there is no intention to increase the capacity of the fund.  That is an observation, not a criticism, of the Minister.  We will try to park it.  <\/p><p> With regard to other services - specifically, compensation payments to a reparation fund established under section 11 of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 1997 and the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2002 - there is a small cohort of women who obtained false positives and who are campaigning to be included in the compensation recompense but also for access to the medical card awarded to persons under this scheme.  Has any progress been made in this area, in view of the fact that we have met these women?  They have made a case to the Minister and, I assume, to the Department and the HSE.  These people were infected but at the time were showing a false positive.

They have a group of symptoms which can be linked to hepatitis C but can also be linked to a large number of other illnesses.  The situation is that one has to test positive for hepatitis C to get compensation, and they do not.  That is the current situation.  In the absence of any medical science to back up the view that it was a false negative, it is not open to them to go to the tribunal, but as I have always said, if this is a decision that is based on medical science and if the medical science stacks up, then that can be reconsidered.

This has been the focus of the committee in the recent past and was raised again earlier in terms of further redress.  It is important.  Perhaps the Minister can explain the considerable decrease in J5.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Billy Kelleher referred to subhead J4 and the mental health provision of &euro;35 million.  The &euro;20 million allowed the previous year led to the under-provision of &euro;15 million that the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health indicated she would seek, although it transpired that she did not.  As the new Minister, does Deputy Varadkar appreciate that the under-provision last year has contributed to the delay in realising all the promise of the policy A Vision for Change?  I do not believe the sum of &euro;35 million will be adequate, given the under-provision in previous years and the underspends in previous years that were not always carried forward.

There is a fine facility in one of our urban settings.  I do not dispute the results of a HIQA report carried out there, as I want to see the highest standard of state-of-the-art provision in regard to the comfort and needs of people entering long-term residential care.  As a consequence of the HIQA report, in terms of the development work undertaken, there was a reduction in the number of beds.  This has been replicated in different facilities around the country, and it is contributing to the difficulties in regard to delayed discharge.  Mr. O'Brien indicated that we cannot continue to do this and, at the same time, crib and cry that we are not meeting the needs of the 750 people in discharge units across our hospitals network.  Has the Minister any plans for the development of long-term residential care for those who are no longer in a position to live at home independently or with home help or home care provision, aids and appliances, etc.?

I welcome that he will focus on it, as he said, long after it falls off the front of the newspapers, which is worth saying.  It is very hard to predict what will come in the future in terms of knowing where the demands come from and where the peaks might be.  How realistic are the targets he has set for reducing it and will the money be made available?<\/p> <p>  There are two issues about the turnaround in emergency departments when people are being assessed - whether they will be discharged, or whether a bed or another facility will be made available to them.  I previously asked the Minister about older people who may have an ongoing chronic illness who are being looked after in a HSE facility.  Something may go wrong - for example, a spike in temperature or a difficulty in the middle of the night.  These very old and sick people then have to go through emergency departments like everybody else.  We need to have different pathways for such people because it does not do them any good and it does no good for the staff in emergency departments.  I ask the Minister to outline his plans in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the State Claims Agency, I have come across cases in recent years of people who have suffered catastrophic injuries, and I am afraid to say that the State gave with one hand and took away with another.  When an award is made it can be quite a lot of money, but this person will have huge costs over his or her lifetime and may lose a medical card.  I know of parents who are not working who lose because of the care needs of the individual.  An older sibling going to college may be refused a grant based on the award made to the person who has been so damaged by misadventure while receiving health care.  I know of a number of families where this has happened.  It is greatly distressing, because the sick or disabled child may have a huge amount of money, but it is his or her money and yet the whole family has been marked not just by the Department of Health but also by other Departments such as the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills.  I am aware of cases in which a sibling was refused a grant because of the award made to her brother and where a mother lost her entitlement to jobseeker's allowance because of her child's award.  That is something we need to look at, because the needs of these children, young people and adults will be greater and the costs will be very significant.

As it turned out, the &euro;151 million which was partially provided for in the Supplementary Estimate at the end of last year was not all required.  Only &euro;135 million of the &euro;151 million was required.  That can often relate to the time of year the judgments are made and paid.<\/p> <p>  We are estimating a reduction to &euro;96 million because the Department of Justice and Equality is introducing legislation to cover periodic payment orders.  So instead of somebody getting one big lump-sum payment of &euro;2 million, &euro;5 million or &euro;7 million, he or she will get an annual payment which can then be reassessed as his or her needs may change.  So the &euro;96 million is contingent on that legislation being brought through and implemented by the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p> <p>  One of the Deputies made a very good point on open disclosure and the duty of candour.  When I was in medical school it was always drummed into us that we had a duty of candour and should disclose where a mistake is made.  People think medicine is an exact science.  It is not an exact science; nor is midwifery.  Essentially, a medical professional talks to the patient, takes his or her history, examines him or her, carries out a few tests, puts it all together and makes a judgment.  Sometimes the judgment is wrong, but that does not mean one is a bad doctor.  It is the nature of medicine.  It is not an exact science; it is a judgment.  By no means are all mistakes down to negligence.  It is important to understand the real job doctors, nurses and midwives have in that regard.  It is not necessarily that they are bad doctors because claims are made against them - they just made the wrong judgment based on the facts they had.<\/p> <p>  In some ways it is a bit like knocking somebody down on the street.  Someone might run out in front of one and one might hit them.  It might be one's fault, it might be their fault or it might be nobody's fault.  Failing to disclose openly and not adhering to a duty of candour, for me, is the equivalent of a hit and run whereby one has knocked somebody down and one does not necessarily know whose fault it is but one drives off.  That happens in our health service, and I am appalled by the number of cases that I have become aware of.  Some of them have been in the news.  Essentially, there is adverse clinical or medical misadventure, and rather than doing the right thing - sitting down with the patient and the family the following week to explain what went on - medical personnel effectively abandoned the patients.  I find that really appalling.  It is not the medicine in which I was trained.<\/p> <p>  If doctors and other health care professionals adhere to the duty of candour and respect the policy of open disclosure, considerably fewer people will sue.  Often people sue because of the bad way their case was handled after a mistake was made.  Because this is still happening, it is my intention to legislate for it in the health information Bill and to make it a legal requirement that there be open disclosure and a duty of candour, which I think is just right.<\/p> <p>  On HIQA, it will be costly to upgrade our community nursing units to HIQA's standards.  In some cases they will just be replaced, because it makes more sense to build a new one than to renovate or rebuild an old workhouse, for example.  In other cases they will be redesigned.  At the moment HIQA and the HSE are trying to agree a multiannual plan to do that.  In addition, we will need to build more community nursing units.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and I are seeking additional money from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the next capital envelope to do exactly that.  HIQA is, of course, an independent regulator.  If the committee has not done so already, it should invite HIQA representatives to come before it to go through some of the issues that arise.<\/p> <p>  On the delayed discharges, we have thrown everything at this in recent weeks and delayed discharges have decreased from about 850 to 750.  I had thought we would do better than that.  We have set a target of 500, which I believe is realistic and achievable.  Some people say it is not sufficiently ambitious and ask how we could possibly say it was acceptable to have 500 delayed discharges across our hospitals.  However, when it is broken down, there are issues.  For example, there are people who are waiting for rehabilitation, there are people who are wards of court, there are people with issues relating to refugee status and so on.  There are one or two homeless people, and of course we cannot and should not discharge people into homelessness.<\/p> <p>  At any given time there are 200 or 300 people who are counted as delayed discharges but have, in fact, only been in the hospital for a few weeks.  There will always be a delay in getting their paperwork together.  They may have to go out to see the nursing home to see if they are happy with it.  Their family members may want to check out the nursing home and the nursing home may want to check them out.  So about 200 or 250 of that 500 will always be there.  That is just the normal churn of new delayed discharges.<\/p><p>Deputy Conway asked about the elderly in emergency departments.  We are trying to do two things in that space, the first is more community intervention teams.  These are the nurses who go into nursing homes and change catheters, and can give intravenous fluids and medicine so that an older person can avoid going into hospital in the first place.  We need more of that.  I think some nursing homes are afraid of having a resident die in the nursing home.  They send the person to the emergency department when it may be better not to and instead they could make more effort to get a GP or the community intervention team to come to the nursing home.<\/p><p> The national clinical programmes are developing a pathway for the frail elderly which might end up as a system of streaming frail old people to emergency departments in a different way.  If one visits an emergency department, and I know all members present have, the majority of patients coming through for admission are elderly.  I know of one private emergency department where the average age of admission is now 90 years.  That is a big change in the past ten or 11 years from when I was working in hospital medicine.  The inpatient population is now much older and that makes things more difficult on the front line.<\/p><p> An additional &euro;35 million has been secured for mental health services this year.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, has done very well to do so and it is a great achievement.  I know she will be looking for additionality on top of that in 2016. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015020500002#L00500","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":1394,"content":"<p>Yesterday the Minister replied to my parliamentary question on the requirement to advise a patient where an adverse incident occurred.

The high-tech expenditure for 2015 is to remain at the forecast 2014 outturn.  I suppose Soliris would come in under high-tech?

There continues to be significant concern - it even runs to distress - in many family cases where young people cannot access dental care through the public system within a reasonable timeframe.  Young people are moving out of education without having significant dental work addressed.  It is not simply a question of pain because pain can be measured in terms of physical and mental pain.  Too often, decisions are taken to refuse orthodontic work that is sometimes described as cosmetic.  For the young person concerned, male or female, it is far from that; it is about mental well-being, self-image and capacity to cope in life.  I have seen the tragic consequences of the failure to face up to our responsibility to provide adequate provision to allow for address of these problems.  These are sorry stories.  I am anxious that this should be reflected not only in the provision this year, but that the Minister takes it on board if he is making these decisions for 2016.  It is vital that we see a significant change in the provision for these services in the interests of young people in future.

I must blame previous Ministers and therefore the current Minister is exonerated.  However, he will be adjudicated on his actions in terms of responding to it.<\/p> <p>  Cleaning and scaling is proven to have positive dental and oral hygiene effects.  Now, people are no longer entitled to cleaning and scaling although they are entitled to extractions.

We must be proactive in the whole area of dental hygiene.  All the socioeconomic surveys show that there are problems in certain groupings and areas and these must be addressed.  We cannot simply depend on the fluoridation of water to address all the ills of dental and oral hygiene.  There should be a concerted effort.

Amendment No. 11 is also a technical amendment and is consequential on amendment No. 10.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015020500002#C01700","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423144800,"counter":1490,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1423144800,"counter":1491,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 11:<\/p><blockquote>In page 10, line 33, to delete &ldquo;for such advice or services&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for services&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015020500002#C01800","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423144800,"counter":1492,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423144800,"counter":1493,"content":"<p>Section 18, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423144800,"counter":1494,"content":"<p>Sections 19 and 20 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423144800,"counter":1495,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1423144800,"counter":1496,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015020500002#C02300","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1423144800,"counter":1497,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 12:<\/p><blockquote>In page 12, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;Insertion of sections 15B and 15C into Act of 1993<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>21.<\/b>The Act of 1993 is amended by inserting after section 15A the following:<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>&ldquo;Power of Minister to specify national standards<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>15B.<\/b>(1) The Minister may specify national standards in respect of the design, construction or maintenance of public roads.<br \/><br \/>(2) Any person, road authority or public authority carrying out works involving the design, construction or maintenance of public roads shall comply with the national standards (if any) specified by the Minister under subsection (1).<br \/><br \/>(3) The Minister may request the Authority to amend any standards specified by it under section 19(1)(e) and the Authority shall comply with any such request.<br \/><br \/><b>Power of Minister to request information from road authority<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>15C.<\/b>The Minister may request a road authority to furnish him or her with such information as he or she may require i connection with any of the authority&rsquo;s functions in relation to regional and local roads, under this Act, and the authority shall comply with any such request.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>This amendment proposes the insertion of new sections 15B and 15C in the Roads Act 1993 in order to provide new general powers to the Minister.

The NRA is the body that specifies standards in respect of construction or maintenance work on national roads in accordance with its statutory powers under the Roads Act 1993.  Standards in respect of non-national roads are issued by my Department, which has oversight of the regional and local roads programme.  The new section 15B will also allow the Minister to have a step-in power, if necessary, in order to ensure consistency in standards across all public roads.  This is important in the context of the fact that a number of road authorities are outside the Department's grant allocation system.<\/p><p>The new section 15C states that the Minister may require road authorities to give him or her any information in respect of any of their functions regarding regional or local roads.

The planning, design and implementation of individual national roads schemes are matters for the NRA under the Roads Acts of 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.  At present there is no provision, in either the Roads Act or the planning Acts for the NRA or roads authorities to enter into pre-planning application consultations with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in regard to proposed road developments.  The amendment to the Roads Act 1993 is being introduced as it is considered desirable to amend the existing legislation to allow for advance consultation on relevant projects and also for any new applications being considered or developed for rejected schemes, such as the Adare or Slane bypasses.<\/p><p>During the Second Stage debate on the Bill, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan indicated that he intended to raise this matter on Committee Stage.  My predecessor, the former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, indicated that he would consider the issue.  Since then, Deputy O'Donovan has raised the matter with me and, upon consideration of his point, I have decided to amend the Bill to take on board the observation he made.<\/p><p>The insertion of this new section sets out the procedure to be adopted by the NRA or road authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to facilitate pre-planning application consultations.  In summary, where the National Roads Authority wishes to make an application for approval to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in regard to a road development, it may, before making the application, make a request to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to enter consultations on the proposed road development.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la shall accede to the request and ensure consultations are completed expeditiously.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la may give advice to the NRA or road authority concerned regarding the application procedures and what planning considerations may have a bearing on its decision on the application.  The National Roads Authority, or the road authority, shall, for the purposes of consultation, supply An Bord Plean&aacute;la with sufficient information to allow it to assess the development.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la may consult third parties where relevant.  The holding of the consultation shall not prejudice the performance by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of any of its functions under the Roads Act 1993. An Bord Plean&aacute;la shall keep a record in writing of any consultations and shall provide a copy of any record kept to the NRA or to the road authority concerned.  Following completion of any consultation between An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the road authority, the road authority or the NRA may apply to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for planning approval for the development concerned.<\/p><p> This amendment in no way seeks to affect or change the absolute independence of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, or any of its functions recognised under the Roads Act 1993.  Its objective is simply to facilitate consultation and the sharing of information between the road authority concerned and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p> I thank Deputy O'Donovan for raising this matter.  His input into this Bill and the amendments he proposed will strengthen the operation of the Bill and the new body.  I hope it will lead to the decision-making process on roads and infrastructure above a certain size being more efficient in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015020500002#E01500","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423144800,"counter":1514,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for putting forward the amendment.  I had a similar amendment drafted, but I appreciate the fact that it was not as detailed as what the Minister has come up with.  This came out of the bizarre situation whereby the National Roads Authority would embark on the design and construction of a new road without knowing whether it was going to get planning permission for it.  The Chairman would not build an extension on a house without consulting Mayo County Council first of all to see whether he was likely to get planning permission.  As the Bill's provisions are not yet in effect, we still have the ludicrous situation of it being a shot in the dark whether major infrastructural projects will get planning permission.  We have seen this in counties Kerry and Meath and in my own constituency in County Limerick.<\/p> <p>  Now that the Bill has been amended, I would like to see proper consultation and dialogue taking place rather than situations like the one we had in Adare, where there was a point-blank refusal with no reason or rationale given as to why the route was rejected.  That creates a situation where we do not know whether we should apply again, move it or change it.  The associated costs are in the tens of millions when the whole country is taken into account.  The situation where the Railway Procurement Agency could engage with An Bord Plean&aacute;la while the other major transport infrastructure agency, the NRA, could not, was just bizarre.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome the amendment, and now that it has been made I would encourage the Minister's Department to use whatever influence it has on the National Roads Authority to re-establish the planning process in Adare, once the Bill has been enacted.  Adare is probably the worst remaining bottleneck in the country in terms of the national road infrastructure.  More traffic goes through it than any other town in the country that is currently down to be bypassed, yet Adare is not on any list.  This is another element of the bizarre nature of how the NRA selects its projects.  Now that this is sorted, I hope the Minister will use whatever influence he can bring to bear to encourage the NRA to restart the planning process with Limerick city and county councils, and to put Adare and the N21 back on that list.

It will then be a matter for the body as to how it uses its powers.  The reason I am making this change is to try to enable a planning process that makes better use of everybody's time and resources.  I am aware of the difficulties to which the Deputy has alluded, which are causing frustration.  I am aware of the difficulties the residents of Adare and the surrounding area face because I have experienced it myself as a commuter on a number of occasions.

Otherwise, difficult decisions can get even more fractious.  I am being explicit in this Bill in saying that nothing here would undermine the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am confident that will happen, because of the subsection I quoted, and also because the power that is here is, in many cases, open to local authorities for smaller planning applications.  They still discharge their powers well and independently.  I am confident the same will happen here.<\/p><p>On Deputy Fleming's point, I am aware of the road to which he is referring.  He and Deputy Griffin have raised the issue previously.  As that road is currently under consideration and has been subject to a potential judicial review, it will not fall subject to this Bill.
