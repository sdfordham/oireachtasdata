One of the benefits funded by the SIF is the provision of redundancy and insolvency-related payments in circumstances where the employer making the redundancies is unable to fund these payments itself; in the majority of cases, because the employer concerned is insolvent.  In this way the payments made into the SIF by employers help to protect the interests of workers when any individual employer cannot meet its obligations under law to pay salary arrears and redundancy settlements to employees who lose their jobs.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding that payments out of the SIF are properly made in accordance with this insurance principle, the Department pursues recovery of the amounts paid.  The balance of any funds paid out but not recovered is recorded and disclosed as a debt in the financial accounts of the SIF.  A dedicated debt management unit is responsible for recovering as much debt as possible in line with the Department&rsquo;s debt management policy.  The unit seeks repayment of debt either directly from the employer (typically by means of an agreed repayment schedule) or from any liquidator that may be appointed to wind up the affairs on an insolvent business.  The unit has a staff of six (5.1 full-time equivalents) and operating costs of just over &euro;300,000.

As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision, and demographic change alone is expected to increase spending on pensions by over &euro;220 million this year, not including the impact of rate increases.<\/p>  <p>  The current rate bands applying to the State pension (contributory) were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000.

If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.

The contributions must have been paid on one of the spouse\/civil partners&rsquo; social insurance records and all must have been made before the death of the spouse\/civil partner.  Once in payment, the pension remains payable while the person remains widowed or a surviving civil partner.<\/p>  <p>  The legal context governing relationships such as marriage is broader than the social protection system.  Where that context changes, the social welfare code is examined for appropriate changes, e.g., the scheme was introduced for widows on 1 January 1936; it was extended to widowers on 28 October 1994 in light of gender equality issues that had not been considered in the 1930s; and extended to surviving civil partners from 1 January 2011 following the introduction of civil partnership. <\/p>  <p>  Entering into a marriage or civil partnership is a legal act, which confers both rights and obligations on both parties, which do not exist in a legal sense between co-habiting couples.  This is among the reasons that the introduction of civil partnership and the subsequent extension of marriage rights to same-sex couples were of such significance.  Widows, widowers and surviving civil partners, who become bereaved, therefore, in addition to their personal loss, also lose someone who had legal duties towards them.  In some cases those legal duties were, in part, financial in nature, and the social welfare code recognises that potential loss by providing a pension to them, subject to certain conditions. <\/p>  <p>  A surviving cohabitant who was not married to their deceased former partner may be entitled to other social welfare payments if he or she has an income need, e.g., One-Parent Family Payment, Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance or Family Income Supplement.  Payment of Child Benefit would continue, where applicable. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of other income supports, supplementary welfare allowance is a means tested weekly payment, subject to certain terms and conditions, which provides a basic income support to eligible people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100070#WRB05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Administration","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100070#WRB06000"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[25839\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100070#WRB06100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"his plans to improve awareness of community employment schemes for those on the live register and other eligible schemes; his further plans for a public awareness campaign; and if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties that the JobsIreland website is causing for those applying to community employment schemes.","asker":"1370","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":90,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[25966\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100070#WRB06200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the way in which he envisages that the referral process of persons to community employment schemes will be carried out, further to the latest report into community employment schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":91,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 89 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of activation supports and programmes catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers and those most distant from the labour market.

It was submitted by TASC to the interdepartmental group on disguised employment as part of its public consultation.  The interdepartmental working group, comprising officials from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, has been examining the issue of disguised employment.  To inform the work of the group, a public consultation   was undertaken in 2016.  The focus of the consultation was on the use of intermediary-type employment structures and self-employment arrangements, such as managed and personal services companies and their impact on income tax and PRSI.  This includes situations where an individual establishes a company to provide his or her services to an employer, but who is dependent on, and under the control of, a single employer.  <\/p>  <p>  The consultation received 23 submissions from interested parties, including employers, trade unions, professional bodies and individuals.

In certain instances inspections are undertaken jointly with other State agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Workplace Relations Commission.  Such inspections are fact-finding visits as a result of which evidence of compliance or non-compliance may be detected.  Where evidence of non-compliance or misclassification of employment status is detected this will be pursued.  Where details of specific cases are supplied to the Department, they are investigated and the insurability of the person concerned is determined. <\/p>  <p>  Arrears of PRSI are calculated and collected where incidences of misclassification of workers as self-employed are detected.  Where an employee has been misclassified as self-employed, his\/her social insurance record will be updated to reflect the correct rate of social insurance.

Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department, representing over 36% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.<\/p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by approximately &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the conditions for the State pension (contributory), which is the pension based on PRSI contributions, are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  A number of significant reforms to State pensions were introduced in recent years which has allowed my Department to maintain the value of the State pension, and indeed increase it in the last two Budgets.<\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.  The rate of payment does not include rent allowance, household benefits or fuel allowance, which would be paid as additional payments where applicable. <\/p>  <p>  Where the pensioner is widowed, there is a pension which is based on either their spouses&rsquo; PRSI record or their own, and generally at the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the average personal payments made by my Department to men and women of this age are close to parity, with a differential of 2%, and this is reflected in CSO figures which show women over 65 are 0.3% more likely to be at risk of poverty than their male counterparts (10.8% compared to 10.5%), and men over 65 are 0.3% more likely than women of that age to be in consistent poverty (2.9% compared to 2.6%).  Most people will understand that such small differentials are statistically insignificant, and when it comes to the main domestic social indicators of poverty, men and women over 65 are at parity.<\/p>  <p>  It might also be noted that both of these indicators show that men and women over 65 are far less likely to be in poverty than working-age people, who are the ones funding pensions on a pay as you go basis through current PRSI deductions, as 16.9% of the general population are at risk of poverty, and 8.7% are in consistent poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.  Following completion of the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund later this year, a refined proposal will be developed.  My Department will conduct a period of consultation with relevant stakeholders including interest groups, representative bodies and the Oireachtas.  Following the consultation period, I will submit a proposal to Government seeking approval of the new approach.<\/p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100071#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Waiting Times","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100071#WRC02600"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[25969\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100071#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he has satisfied himself that adequate resources are in place to ensure minimum waiting times in respect of decisions on appeal in respect of various payments; if every effort is being made to reduce such waiting times to the minimum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>The average appeal processing times for all appeals determined from 2015 to date in 2017 broken down by all social welfare scheme types is outlined in the tables below.

This will generally have the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, and may result in a higher rate of pension, depending on their circumstances.

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The current processing times for CA applications is 12 weeks and for DCA applications is 16 weeks. Both schemes have seen a considerable increase in applications in recent years.  Applications for CA in 2016 were 20% higher than in 2015, while applications for DCA were 16% higher than in 2015.

As an example, in the 4 year period from 2013 to 2016 the number of applications for domiciliary care allowance has increased by 54%, from under 5,000 to almost 7,500 per annum.

This is reflected in CSO figures which show that women over 65 are 0.3% more likely to be at risk of poverty than their male counterparts (10.8% compared to 10.5%), and men over 65 are 0.3% more likely than women of that age to be in consistent poverty (2.9% compared to 2.6%).  Most people will understand that such small differentials are statistically insignificant, and when it comes to the main domestic social indicators of poverty, men and women over 65 are at parity.  It might also be noted that both of these indicators show that men and women over 65 are far less likely to be in poverty than working age people, who are the ones funding pensions on a pay as you go basis, as 16.9% of the general population are at risk of poverty, and 8.7% are in consistent poverty.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, EU figures show that Ireland has significantly smaller gender pension gaps and gender poverty gaps for over 65s than is the norm among our EU neighbours, even though some of those have longer periods of higher female participation in the labour market.  In Ireland, unlike other countries, the State pension benefits received by a very high paid worker with significant PRSI deductions are identical to those of a part-time worker on the minimum wage in otherwise similar circumstances.  It is not the case, as is sometimes suggested, that people with 20 or so years of contributions can expect a full contributory pension, and in most countries, even those with significant homemakers schemes, such a record will generally result in a significantly lower pension than they would be paid had they not had such gaps in their records.  A challenge with the Total Contributions Approach, therefore, will be to ensure that the outcomes for women under the new scheme are at least as good as has been achieved to date.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, where somebody does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they will generally qualify for an alternative payment, unless they have significant additional means.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult amounting up to up to 90% of a full rate pension, which is based on their own means and is paid directly to them. Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested non-contributory State pension which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate, based on a household means test. <\/p>  <p>   Most pensioners would satisfy the means tests for these two payments, and the very large majority of people paid them receive the maximum rate.  Those alternatively in receipt of SPC payments at a lower rate, therefore, are among the better off pensioners who have significant additional means, over and above state supports.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100071#WRC04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":139,"content":"<p>Question No. 83 answered with Question No. 54.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":140,"content":"<p>Question No. 84 answered with Question No. 65.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Reform","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100071#WRC05000"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[25715\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100071#WRC05100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when he proposes to publish his plans and costings for a universal pension for all persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>I have made pension reform a priority for my term as Minister for Social Protection.

Firstly, the State pension (non-contributory) is a means tested pension and is funded by general taxation.  Secondly, the State pension (contributory) is not means tested and is paid from the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, as in other countries, the State contributory pension is primarily aimed at people with sustained contributions towards the Social Insurance Fund which finances it, on a pay as you go basis, and rewards such contributions with greater entitlements and coverage for a range of benefits, including contributory pension entitlements.  It is important to ensure that those qualifying for a contributory pension have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension (contributory), all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties. The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded in the calculation of the pensioners yearly average.  This may have the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension, and may in turn qualify them for a higher rate of payment.  The disregard does not involve the award of credits, and entitlements are still subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied, including a minimum of 520 paid contributions being paid before reaching pension age.<\/p>  <p>  This scheme was not introduced retrospectively.  My Department has estimated that the annual cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost some &euro;290m in 2017, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the rate of the overall cost of State pensions.  This is a very significant cost, and the main beneficiaries would be people who already have significant household means, and who do not therefore qualify for an alternative means-tested payment. <\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a State pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate. <\/p>  <p>  For example, a person with a yearly average of 20 contributions paid or credited per year may qualify for a reduced rate SPC of &euro;202.80.   However, they can instead be paid a higher amount through the non-contributory pension, unless their means are over &euro;52.50 per week (or &euro;105 for a married couple), at a minimum payment rate of &euro;204.50 (maximum rate is &euro;227), which would bring their total personal means (including their pension) to over &euro;257 per week.  Their household means test ignores their spouse&rsquo;s state pension, the capital value of their home, and has generous income and capital asset disregards, where applicable. This minimum of &euro;257 doesn&rsquo;t include rent allowance, household benefits or fuel allowance.  It is also higher than the &euro;238.30 received by a person solely dependent upon a maximum rate State pension (contributory), who would receive no benefit from any change to the method of calculation of contributory pension entitlements, and they would experience a loss if such a change was financed by reducing the core rate of the State pension, or by moderating increases in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020. The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year. This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100071#WRC05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance","counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100071#WRC05600"},{"type":"question","counter":148,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[25902\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100071#WRC05700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 195 of 3 May 2017, his views on whether it would be more beneficial to categorise various groupings of persons on disability allowance by type of disability or severity of disability in order that groups that work with persons with particular disabilities can plan resources on a needs-based approach; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":149,"content":"<p>Disability allowance (DA) is a payment for persons with a specified disability who are over 16 and under 66.

The current assessment of the threat here is that while a terrorist attack here is possible, it is unlikely and there is no specific information in relation to any threat to Ireland from international terrorism.<\/p>  <p>  The level of threat is kept under constant review by the Garda Authorities.  The House will understand the detail of security arrangements that are in place should not be disclosed.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has considerable operational capacities in countering terrorism and in responding to critical incidents.  There is, in particular, a highly-trained and well-equipped special intervention capability in the Emergency Response Unit that is supported by the regional Armed Support Units and the range of other resources across the Garda organisation.  The considerable skills and resources of the Defence Forces are also available in support to the civil power when and where needed.<\/p>  <p>  They are  engaged in intensive, ongoing work aimed at preventing any attack taking place here.  In this regard they work closely with the Defence Forces.  Detailed preparations have also been made in the event of an attack.  Other agencies also have plans in place to deal with the outcome of major incidents.  Of its nature, much of this work cannot be disclosed publicly, but the Deputy should be assured that it goes on relentlessly.<\/p>  <p>  The authorities here will continue to work closely with their EU and other international counterparts in responding to the shared threat to national and international security.  The Government is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to enhance their connectivity to a range of EU and other international resources and a significant programme of work is ongoing in this regard supported  by dedicated funding.  This includes connecting to the Schengen Information System, developing the processing of travel-related data and mechanisms for the exchange of criminal fingerprint and DNA data.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Taoiseach chaired a meeting on 25 May to review the State's arrangements and level of preparedness in the event of a major terrorist attack here.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>I have been advised by the Commissioner that as of the 31 March 2017 there were 288 Garda with 18 Garda Reserves and 27 civilians attached to the Meath Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>This plan is progressing apace. I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that just under 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide 31 of whom were assigned to the Meath Division.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; including Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division including the Meath Division in the coming years.  To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner earlier this month with a closing date of 1 June.  The competition is being undertaken by the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner and applications should be made to www.publicjobs.ie.<\/p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.

An independent panel consisting of two senior counsel and five junior counsel was established for that purpose.  To ensure that the independence of the review process was preserved, I appointed a retired High Court Judge, Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy, to oversee the preparation of summaries and recommendations in the notification letters of the outcome of the process.  His role was to independently vouch for the fact that the summaries of conclusions and the reasoning behind them were a fair reflection of the advice which has been made available to my Department by the Panel. <\/p>  <p>  It was open to the independent counsel of the Independent Review Mechanism to make any recommendation that they saw fit.

That is, they may only be increased in line with inflation.  The Irish VAT thresholds were increased to their current values on 1 May 2008.  As Central Statistics Office figures show the consumer price index is below the level it reached in 2008, it is not possible to increase the thresholds. <\/p>  <p>  I would point out that Ireland&rsquo;s VAT registration threshold for small enterprises supplying services is the\u00a0eighth highest in the EU while the goods threshold is the third highest.<\/p>  <p>  While the registration thresholds are designed to reduce the administrative burden on businesses and Revenue, registration thresholds are not intended as a means of keeping small businesses permanently outside the VAT system.

Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. <\/p>  <p>  No school, including the school to which the Deputy has referred, will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year. <\/p>  <p>  An\u00a0additional 900 teaching posts\u00a0have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. <\/p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government.  The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation\u00a0of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular school referred to by the Deputy, this school had a\u00a0Learning Support\u00a0allocation\u00a0of 40\u00a0hours for the 2016\/17 school year, which combined with\u00a033.15\u00a0resource teaching hours allocated to the school by the National Council for Special Education,\u00a0gave\u00a0a total allocation to the school of\u00a073.15 additional teaching hours for the 2016\/17 school year.<\/p>  <p>  As the profiled allocation for the school did not indicate an increased allocation requirement for the school for 2017\/18, the school has maintained its existing level of allocation.<\/p>  <p>  The special education teaching allocation for this school for 2017\/18 is\u00a073.15 hours.<\/p>  <p>  There has therefore been no reduction to the special education teaching allocation for this school.<\/p>  <p>  Schools who wished to submit an appeal were asked to do so by March 31 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has confirmed that the school referred to in this question has not submitted an appeal.<\/p>  <p>  Schools could appeal\u00a0whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017\/18 allocation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The model\u00a0will\u00a0also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances\u00a0or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very\u00a0substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance. Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very\u00a0significantly since the allocation was made to the school,\u00a0may\u00a0an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. <\/p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs have also now been published and are available on my Departments website.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100073#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Psychological Assessments","counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100073#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[26082\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100073#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of children a primary school can refer for a NEPS assessment in a given school year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":239,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychology service to all primary and post primary schools through an assigned NEPS psychologist and in some cases receive assessment services through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. <\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for\u00a0public servants\u00a0to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. \u00a0The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.\u00a0 This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.\u00a0 Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.\u00a0 It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.<\/p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system.  Teachers are not paid equally.  For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching.  Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of public service pay talks.\u00a0 My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, invited the Public Services Committee of ICTU to discussions on public service pay and a continued approach to the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation and these discussions are now underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100073#WRE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Eligibility","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100073#WRE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[26115\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100073#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied);

The development of proposals for provision for Education about Religion and Beliefs and Ethics at primary level will also take account of the on-going work on the review of the structure and time allocation in the primary school curriculum. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100073#WRE05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Junior Cycle Reform","counter":288,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100073#WRE05600"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[26138\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100073#WRE05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding the development of short courses for the junior cycle; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":290,"content":"<p>Short courses are designed for 100 hours of engagement over the three years of junior cycle.

In order to promote the development of these sites, on 27 April 2017,\u00a0I\u00a0published the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map.  The\u00a0Map is a vital initial step in the new strategic approach to State land management, which will be further\u00a0developed\u00a0through the forthcoming National Planning Framework, to be titled &quot;Ireland 2040: Our Plan&quot;. <\/p><p>The\u00a0datasets published on the map include details of over 700 local authority and Housing Agency-owned sites, totaling some 1,700 hectares, as well 30 sites (covering about\u00a0200 hectares) owned by State or semi-State bodies.  The map is available to view on the Rebuilding Ireland website at: . <\/p><p>The specific approach to housing delivery on\u00a0each site, including the optimum\u00a0tenure mix and delivery mechanism,\u00a0is a matter for the local\u00a0authority concerned, the elected members included, who are best placed to understand the housing needs in their areas.  Given the differences in terms of scale, location and other site characteristics the approach from site to site will vary with some sites suitable for social housing only and others being more suited to a mixed tenure approach.<\/p><p>Mixed-tenure development on suitable publicly-owned sites\u00a0provides an important avenue for the\u00a0delivery of\u00a0social and affordable housing quickly in a fully integrated and sustainable community.  Opening up the supply of State land in this way, for mixed-tenure housing, is a critically important policy in addressing a situation where the pace of recovery in the house development sector is slower than it needs\u00a0to be, to meet demand.  In practical terms, the development of these sites will\u00a0mean accelerating social housing delivery and securing more homes for sale and rent at lower and more affordable price points.  In this regard, I welcome the fact that\u00a0two of the Dublin local authorities have already brought\u00a0forward four key, large-scale sites, capable of delivering 3,000 new homes, and\u00a0I expect other local authorities to follow suit.\u00a0<\/p><p>With regard to the specific\u00a0judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union\u00a0referred to,\u00a0I understand that the case involved &ldquo;tax incentives&rdquo; and &ldquo;subsidy mechanisms&rdquo;, neither of which\u00a0are\u00a0part of the State land initiative.\u00a0 In such circumstances, the question of EU State Aid approval does not arise.\u00a0 Insofar as procurement is concerned, the development of each site will be subject to an open competitive process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100074#WRF03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Provision","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100074#WRF03800"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[26174\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100074#WRF03900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"when he plans to introduce the roll-out of choice-based letting in Galway county council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>The allocation of social housing support is a matter for the relevant housing authority in accordance with the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated regulations.

Demographic change alone will increase this by over &euro;220 million this year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension is critical to protecting older people from poverty. <\/p>  <p>  State pension (contributory) is an entitlement built up through PRSI contributions, and is not impacted upon by the means of the pensioner.  It is one of three pensions paid by the Department of Social Protection to those over 66, and its rate of payment is related to contributions made over the years into the Social Insurance Fund, which fund the scheme on a &lsquo;Pay As You Go&rsquo; basis.  As such, those who have paid more into that fund are more likely to be paid under that scheme.  <\/p>  <p>   There are two State pensions related to reaching state pension age.  Firstly, the State pension (non-contributory) is a means tested pension and is funded by general taxation.  Secondly, the State pension (contributory) is not means tested and is paid from the Social Insurance Fund. <\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, as in other countries, the contributory pension is primarily aimed at people with sustained contributions towards the Social Insurance Fund which finances it, on a pay as you go basis, and rewards such contributions with greater entitlements and coverage for a range of benefits, including contributory pension entitlements.  It is important to ensure that those qualifying for a contributory pension have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension (contributory), all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. <\/p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded in the calculation of the pensioners yearly average.  This may have the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension, and may in turn qualify them for a higher rate of payment.  The disregard does not involve the award of credits, and entitlements are still subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied, including a minimum of 520 paid contributions being paid before reaching pension age.<\/p>  <p>  This scheme was not introduced retrospectively for periods prior to its introduction.  My Department has estimated that the annual cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost some &euro;290m in 2017, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the rate of the overall cost of State pensions.  This is a very significant cost, and the main beneficiaries would be people who already have significant household means, and who do not therefore qualify for an alternative means-tested payment. <\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a State pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate. <\/p>  <p>  For example, a person with a yearly average of 20 contributions paid or credited per year may qualify for a reduced rate SPC of &euro;202.80.   However, they can instead be paid a higher amount through the non-contributory pension, unless their means are over &euro;52.50 per week (or &euro;105 for a married couple), at a minimum payment rate of &euro;204.50 (maximum rate is &euro;227), which would bring their total personal means (including their pension) to over &euro;257 per week.  Their household means test ignores their spouse&rsquo;s state pension, the capital value of their home, and has generous income and capital asset disregards, where applicable. This minimum of &euro;257 doesn&rsquo;t include rent allowance, household benefits or fuel allowance.  It is also higher than the &euro;238.30 received by a person solely dependent upon a maximum rate State pension (contributory), who would receive no benefit from any change to the method of calculation of contributory pension entitlements, and they would experience a loss if such a change was financed by reducing the core rate of the State pension, or by moderating increases in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Actuarial Review of the Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors, due to the redistributive nature of the Fund. <\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach for new pensioners from 2020. The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year. This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100075#WRG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Schemes Data","counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100075#WRG02700"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[26243\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100075#WRG02800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of women throughout the country that do not qualify for a contributory pension due to the marriage ban which forced them to retire from work particularly in the public service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":377,"content":"<p>The &lsquo;marriage bar&rsquo; describes a rule that existed in most of the public service and some private sector employments, where women were required to leave their employment upon marriage.

One of these is that they have at least 520 paid contributions (i.e. 10 years).  However this of itself does not qualify someone for a full rate contributory pension. As with such pensions in other countries, there is a separate criterion to decide the rate of payment for those who do qualify.<\/p>  <p>  For those who have insufficient contributions to qualify for a full State pension (contributory), there are supports available in the overall State pension system which assist some pensioners in qualification for a contributory payment.

average appeal processing times for all appeals determined from 2015 to date in 2017 broken down by all social welfare scheme types is outlined in the tables.<\/p><p>Appeal processing times are kept under constant scrutiny by the Chief Appeals Officer.  The Deputy will be aware that significant effort and resources have been devoted in recent years to reducing the length of the time taken to finalise an appeal and that as a consequence processing times have improved quite considerably.<\/p><p>The overall average processing time, across all schemes, for appeals requiring an oral hearing reduced from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 25.5 weeks in 2015, 24.1 weeks in 2016 and 24.4 weeks to date in 2017. The overall average time taken to finalise appeals decided by way of a summary decision has also improved in recent years from a peak of 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 18.1 weeks in 2015, 17.6 weeks in 2016 and 18.1 weeks to date in 2017.<\/p><p>The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved. The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which require a high level of judgement, and the need to ensure due process and natural justice. The system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information at all stages which is to the benefit of the appellant.<\/p><p>Where claimants have been refused a payment and are appealing the decision, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs pending the outcome of the appeal, it is open to them to apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance in the interim. If their application for Supplementary Welfare Allowance is not successful, they can also appeal that decision.  Supplementary Welfare Allowance appeals are prioritised for attention within the Social Welfare Appeals Office as soon as the appeal file and submission are received from the Department.<\/p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times will continue to be a priority for her office. <\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>Appeals processing times by scheme 01\/01\/2015 &ndash;

As part of this strategy, the Department is engaged in the delivery of integrated Intreo centres, which provide a full range of services, including the Community Welfare Service (CWS), generally available in one location.<\/p>  <p>  People claiming supports under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme generally only interact with the Department on an occasional basis, for example, when seeking an exceptional needs payment or in claiming additional supports such as rent supplement, which are usually reviewed once to twice yearly.  The availability of the CWS during normal office hours is therefore sufficient for general day to day requirements.   <\/p>  <p>  However, in response to emergency situations such as those caused by severe weather events,  local staff are proactive in contacting households affected and in providing targeted supports to those in need as swiftly as possible.   This can include the provision of service outside normal office hours and to people that may ordinarily have no reason to engage with these services.  The Deputy may be aware that following the recent fire at the Verdemont complex in Blanchardstown, a multi-agency clinic comprising the CWS, Citizens Information and Fingal Council was quickly put in place for people affected.

There are special provisions for those caring, in receipt of Blind Pension or recently bereaved that extend the age of the youngest child beyond 7 years of age.   The majority of customers transition to the JST, FIS or JA schemes when their OFP entitlement ends.<\/p>  <p>  Lone parents who are not working outside the home can transition to JST when their OFP ends.  These customers do not suffer an income loss when they move to JST as JST is paid at the same rate as OFP.  JST is available to lone parents (both former OFP recipients and new lone parents), until the youngest child reaches 14 years of age.  JST customers are exempt from the JA conditions that require them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work. As such, no lone parent with a youngest child aged under 14 years is required to take up employment in order to receive income support from the Department.  They can also move into education and\/or employment, including into part-time employment, and still receive payment, subject to a means test. <\/p>  <p>  All JST recipients also receive a one to one meeting with a case officer from the Department who assists them to produce a personal development plan and guides them towards appropriate education, and employment opportunities.  While the customer is on the JST payment access to these supports are potentially available for up to seven years.  This is a much broader support than the 12 month engagement that normally applies for jobseekers from their one to one meeting.  The aim of this broader support is to improve the individual&rsquo;s employment prospects. <\/p>  <p>  When the youngest child reaches 14 years of age lone parents can transition to the JA payment.  To qualify for this payment a person must be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.  However, lone parents on a JA payment also gain access to the full range of Intreo supports available to assist them into training, education and employment.  These income and activation supports combined ensure that there are effective resources available to lone parents.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100075#WRG05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100075#WRG05300"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[26252\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100075#WRG05400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if gaps in a person's contribution record in the assessment of entitlement to contributory old age pension, which now may entitle them to a lower level of payment, notwithstanding the fact that they were in insurable employment during a multiplicity of employment of up to five years and in which previously his Department's policy was, that they receive credit for such voids in their payment record on the grounds that contributions should have been returned on their behalf; if this policy has been discontinued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":403,"content":"<p>Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7.3 billion, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department, representing some 37% of its expenditure.  Demographic change alone will increase this by over &euro;220 million this year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension is critical to protecting older people from poverty. <\/p>  <p>  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension (contributory), all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. <\/p>  <p>  At the moment, to qualify for the State pension (contributory) a person must have at least 520 paid contributions and satisfy a yearly average test (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid and\/or credited is required for a maximum rate pension).  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced.  The scheme was designed with a view to ensuring that people could qualify for contributory pensions immediately and to suit a system where social insurance coverage was limited. <\/p>  <p>  The primary purpose of credits is to secure social welfare entitlement of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment or illness.  Credits do not, on their own, give an individual entitlement to social insurance benefits.  However, they may assist insured workers to qualify for them.<\/p>  <p>  If someone believes that their PRSI record is inaccurate and does not have a record of certain contributions which were deducted from their pay, they should contact my Department with evidence, and this will be investigated.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a State pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.<\/p>  <p>  It is planned to replace the yearly average approach with a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.

The total of all estimated costs including business change elements for a 5 year implementation are in the range of &euro;647m to &euro;875m respectively and the 9 year figure is between &euro;609m-&euro;824m.

Realistic timescales are important to ensure that the adoption of both the technology and the business change required by front line staff can be absorbed and managed in a coherent way.

My Department is currently evaluating how this might be progressed particularly in delivering an EHR in the context of the work being planned for the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital which aspires to be the first digital hospital facility in the country.

This includes emergency services and referral as appropriate to children under 6. A targeted fissure sealant programme is provided for children aged 6 to 8 and 11 to 13 (usually 2nd and 6th class in primary school).  In addition, a screening programme is provided for these age groups with necessary interventions for permanent teeth including fillings and extractions.  Children aged 9-11 may receive a screening and necessary interventions where resources allow.  The provision of these dental services is in line with the Dental Health Action Plan, published in 1994. Annual expenditure on the Public Dental Service has been approximately &euro;60 million in recent years.  A breakdown by year was provided to the Deputy in response to a Parliamentary Question (Ref. 15138\/16) on 7 June 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The Dental Treatment Service Scheme provides access to dental treatment for medical card holders over the age of 16.  All medical card holders are entitled to specific dental treatments, including an annual dental examination.  Last year almost 1.2 million treatments were provided to over 460,000 patients at a cost of &euro;63.2 million.  <\/p>  <p>  The Dental Treatment Benefit Scheme,  for which the Minister for Social Protection is responsible, provides an annual dental examination to insured workers and retired people who have the required number of PRSI contributions.  It has recently been further extended to some 450,000 self-employed people and their dependent spouses for the first time.  Later this year some of the most popular treatment benefits available through PRSI, including scale and polish, will also be restored.  <\/p>  <p>  The cost of increasing the level of service provided by the HSE or introducing of free dental care for the general population would depend on a number of factors, including the underlying oral health of the population, the way in which such a service would be provided, the level of service that would be provided, and the likely level of take-up of such services.  Therefore it is not possible to provide the estimated cost as requested.  The National Oral Health Policy which is being led by the Chief Dental Officer in the Department will inform future provision of dental services.

Cases of high grade pre-cancerous changes of the cervix have reduced by 75% in Australia and by more than 50% in Denmark and Scotland.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines that are licensed in Ireland.

The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency continually monitor adverse events to vaccination. <\/p>  <p>  Unfounded, false claims have been made of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that they first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine and a false connection is being made between the HPV vaccine and the onset of these symptoms.  There is no scientific evidence that the HPV vaccine causes any long term illness.  The misinformation around the HPV vaccine has led to a significant drop in uptake rates of the HPV vaccine.  The Irish Cancer Society state that, based on national cancer statistics, the drop in the rate of uptake to 50% for the 2016-2017 academic year will have the following alarming consequences:<\/p>  <p>  - The death of at least 40 girls  with cervical cancer who did not receive the HPV vaccine;<\/p>  <p>  - A further 100 girls will develop cervical cancer and will require life altering treatment; and<\/p>  <p>  - An additional 1000 girls will require invasive therapy to prevent the precancerous form of HPV. <\/p>  <p>  Misinformation is causing real harm to those unvaccinated children and adults who develop vaccine preventable diseases, and to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions that are not caused by vaccines.  Any parent who has doubts or questions about vaccination should talk to their family doctor, or alternatively to visit the National Immunisation office website.  These sources of information are clear and accurate and will answer any queries you may have about the benefits or risks of vaccination.  Vaccination is the best way for parents to make sure their children are healthy and protected from preventable diseases.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to commission a study along the lines suggested in the Parliamentary Question as the safety and efficacy of these vaccines continues to be monitored by regulatory agencies at both national and European level.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100077#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":480,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100077#WRJ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":481,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[26112\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100077#WRJ02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a hospital appointment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":482,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Since the publication of the NBP in 2012, commercial investment has been considerable.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband roll-out so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint.<\/p><p>In\u00a0April, I\u00a0signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to its\u00a0plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.\u00a0 Eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over\u00a0a 90 week period, with an average of 500 premises passed per day.\u00a0 My Department will be monitoring this roll-out to ensure that eir\u00a0meets its\u00a0obligations under the Agreement.\u00a0 A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website .\u00a0 <\/p><p>On the same day I\u00a0published \u00a0an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at , which\u00a0finalises the\u00a0State Intervention area for the procurement process.\u00a0 The\u00a0updated Map shows\u00a0the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:\u00a0 <\/p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,\u00a0 <\/p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process.<\/p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The map shows that 100% of \u00a0Bree in the townland of Knocknagoss, Co Wexford falls within a BLUE area\u00a0where eir is planning to deliver high speed broadband by end 2018.\u00a0 The map also shows that 28% of Ballinamuck in the townland of Shanmullagh Co Longford is in an AMBER area and will require State Intervention while the remaining 72% falls within the\u00a0 BLUE area\u00a0covered by commercial operators. <\/p><p>Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at <\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. \u00a0The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can\u00a0progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.\u00a0\u00a0The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0<\/p><p>The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers.\u00a0<\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to roll-out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP, once contracts are in place. <\/p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. <\/p><p>In this regard,\u00a0I established\u00a0a Mobile Phone and Broadband\u00a0Task Force in July 2016\u00a0together with\u00a0Minister Humphreys to\u00a0identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate\u00a0how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The\u00a0report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is\u00a0 available at the following link:.<\/p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities,\u00a0ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In addition, I\u00a0signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with the\u00a0allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  On 22 May, ComReg announced the result of its 3.6 GHz spectrum award which\u00a0will\u00a0provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate\u00a0this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.<\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100079#WRL01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Better Energy Homes Scheme Expenditure","counter":581,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100079#WRL01200"},{"type":"question","counter":582,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[26147\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100079#WRL01300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the cost to the State to extend the warmer home scheme to include the upgrade of windows and doors over five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1232","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":583,"content":"<p>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers the Better Energy\u00a0Warmer Homes scheme\u00a0on behalf of my Department.  The scheme provides energy efficiency upgrades free of charge to people who meet the eligibility criteria. Typical measures available under the scheme include attic and cavity wall insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets and low energy light bulbs.<\/p>  <p>  The measures currently offered under\u00a0the Warmer Homes schemes were selected as the best balance that could be achieved between the limited resources\u00a0available to the scheme, the number of homes that can receive support and the energy savings that can be\u00a0delivered.  In short, the measures supported are those that can deliver the most energy savings at the lowest cost to the highest number of people. While upgrading windows\u00a0and doors\u00a0does improve the energy efficiency of a home, the cost of these measures is high in relation to the energy efficiency gains made. <\/p>  <p>  For example, SEAI estimate that the cost of installing a basic energy efficient window package is &euro;6,000 per home.  The inclusion of windows under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme, which is free to those in receipt of the Fuel Allowance, would increase the average cost per home to &euro;8,641 rather than the 2016\u00a0average of &euro;2,641.  In 2016, this would have required an extra &euro;41m to complete the same number of homes, or could have meant that\u00a04,800 fewer\u00a0homes in energy poverty\u00a0would have received upgrades from the 2016 budget allocation.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless as we move towards deeper renovation of homes, as will be necessary to meet our 2020 and 2030 climate and energy goals, window and door replacement could become cost effective as part of a wider package of upgrades to the fabric of a building.  My Department and SEAI are now testing out the channels for carrying out deeper renovation in homes across the country to inform future policy. <\/p>  <p>  For this reason window and door upgrades are eligible for funding under the Better Energy Communities scheme in 2017, when carried out as part of a combined fabric upgrade, which also includes upgrades to insulation and\u00a0ventilation.  Grant funding is available for up to 50% of the cost of these works in homes and up to 95% funding is available for those in energy poverty. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, under the Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing pilot scheme, energy efficient windows and doors are installed wherever a surveyor deems them necessary.

At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement as well as supports available in relation to housing, education and health all contribute to an individual&rsquo;s standard of living. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated. The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement. It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. <\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission was established in 2015 and its primary function is to, on an annual basis, examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.  The Commission presented its first report in July 2015 in which it recommended an that the minimum wage increase to &euro;9.15 per hour. That increase, which was accepted by Government, came into effect on 1 January last 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission presented its second report in July 2016 and its recommendation that the minimum wage be increased to &euro;9.25 per hour was subsequently accepted by Government and came into effect on January 1 last. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy might note that figures published by EUROSTAT in March of this year show that Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage of any country in the EU at &euro;1,563 per month, behind only Luxembourg whose minimum wage is &euro;1,999 per month.

Their report also indicated that there is no evidence of significant abuse when it comes to the application of sub-minima rates. <\/p>  <p>  Given that the remit of the Low Pay Commission is to make its recommendations using an evidence-based approach, the Commission had agreed with the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in early 2016 the inclusion, on a pilot basis, of a specific question on the national minimum wage, and the use of sub-minima rates, in the CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey series.\u00a0 The Commission indicated in its 2016 report that it did not consider it appropriate to make recommendations on the appropriateness of the current sub-minima rates at that stage, but would await the availability of the up-to-date data on usage of the rates from the CSO before making any recommendation. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the results from the pilot question for 2016 are currently being verified by the CSO, and I understand that the Low Pay Commission intends to submit its recommendations in a supplementary report, on receipt of the verified data from the CSO. \u00a0The question of whether a change in the current system might be warranted or desirable will be considered further in light of the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100079#WRL05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":628,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100080#WRM00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HIQA Reports","counter":627,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100080#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":628,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[26150\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100080#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she has received a report on Tusla by HIQA in the past month; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":629,"content":"<p>In the past month, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has not received a specific report on Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, from the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA).<\/p>  <p>  My Department is routinely provided with HIQA inspection reports on the services provided by Tusla.
