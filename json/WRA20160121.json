This payment is in respect of the three month period 1 October -31 December 2015 for those applicants with a 1 October start-date, and   with actions which were payable in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Some 17,500 GLAS farmers received a first instalment of their 2015 payment in December, with an average payment of &euro;650 per applicant. The Department is continuing to process applications which are eligible for a 2015 part-year payment and further payments will be processed by the end of January. The balancing payments in respect of 2015 payments are scheduled to be processed in May 2016 when all GLAS 2015 inspections have been completed. This 2015 part-year balancing payment will include the GLAS+ payments for eligible applications.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that these part-year payments are purely in respect of actions that were applicable to 2015 and cannot be used as a basis to extrapolate the average value of a GLAS contract over a full year. Farmers will only see the full value of their contracts when payments are calculated for 2016, the first full year of their five-year contracts. Current indications are that for Tranche 1 participants , the average value will be of the order of &euro;4,200, not including GLAS Plus payments. In respect of GLAS Plus, the latest estimates indicate that some 1,400 participants from the first tranche have combined eligible actions which exceed the maximum annual payment of &euro;5,000.

The Beef KT programme is an excellent way for farmers to enhance their enterprises and bring about efficiencies to their production systems. In addition under TAMS, supports have been made available for a range of capital investment on farms including for example animal housing which will allow suckler farmers to invest in their farms and I have also targeted supports for young farmers wishing to invest in their farms in the form of the Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme. Schemes such as these are a vital aid to ensure that suckler farmers can continue to farm into the future and develop profitable enterprises, and demonstrate a clear commitment by my Department to such farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100050#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Competition Law","counter":24,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100050#WRA01650"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[2308\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100050#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the move by the ABP Food Group to take a 50% stake in Slaney Foods; the effect this will have on competition in the beef and lamb processing sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This represents an exceptionally strong start to this trade considering that the first exports only went in March 2015 and some of the plants were only approved for export as recently as September. Also trade is confined to the market for intact cuts as we currently await approval to export beef intended for grinding. Another factor is that US beef prices have fallen back from the peaks recorded in the early part of 2015 which makes beef imports less competitive.   <\/p>  <p>  More importantly the relatively high prices available for beef in Europe in 2015 meant that US buyers may have been priced out of the market as Irish exporters chose to send product to more valuable markets in the UK and on the continent. While the volume of beef exported to the UK in 2015 was largely the same as the previous year, it rose in value to represent 54% of the exported beef from Ireland compared to 47% in 2014. This of course is helped by a strong sterling and weak euro.<\/p>  <p>  My department will continue to engage with competent authorities in international markets. In 2015 the Canadian beef market opened to Ireland and other Member States and markets in Iran Oman and the Maldives opened to Irish beef exports.

This committee, with membership from key Government Departments, the EPA, Teagasc, the Marine Institute and academia, will (inter alia) carefully monitor total livestock numbers and any implications for greenhouse gas emissions<\/p>  <p>  - the commissioning of further work on the development of cost effective greenhouse gas mitigation measures.<\/p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU commitments, is clearly understood by Government, as reflected in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the annual targets under the 2009 EU Effort Sharing Decision in the first half of the 2013-2020 compliance period. However, there will be a significant compliance challenge in the years 2017-2020, which will be addressed in the National Mitigation Plan, currently being prepared by all relevant sectors including my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is engaged in intensive discussions, in a whole of Government approach, with the European Commission to highlight the importance of ensuring a coherent approach to the twin challenges of food security and increasing global demand for food with EU climate ambition. An important step forward in this regard was taken at the October 2014 European Council. The recent Paris agreement further recognises the fundamental priority of safeguarding food security.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100051#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dairy Sector","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100051#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[2202\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100051#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will increase Irish milk production; his efforts to ensure banks afford credit flexibility to farmers while the Irish dairy sector consolidates its expansion, given the market turbulence in adjusting to the abolition of dairy quotas and given significant borrowings by dairy farmers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1180","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>Production decisions are made by producers, taking prevailing market conditions as well as their efficiency of production and price of inputs into account. The abolition of dairy quotas in April 2015 allows farmers the freedom to make these production decisions on a commercial basis.<\/p>  <p>  The price of milk and dairy commodities is determined by a range of factors, including supply and demand at international level. Food commodity markets including dairy markets have been characterised by significant levels of volatility for a number of years and this trend has continued throughout 2015 and into early 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Factors contributing to global price volatility in 2015 include the Russian ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers including the EU on the supply side. The longer term demographic and demand perspectives remain positive and Irish dairy farmers are well placed to take full advantage of rising global demand. <\/p>  <p>  I maintained ongoing contact with the Irish banks and have indicated the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015 and into 2016. At the dairy forum in late September, I again reiterated these calls to the three main banks in attendance.   <\/p>  <p>  The Irish dairy sector is cost competitive and Teagasc figures indicate that Irish farmers have relatively low levels of indebtedness compared to counterparts in competitor countries. The banks assured me that they are sensitive to the temporary pressures on dairy farmers and will be flexible in their dealings with them. Banks have stressed the need for early engagement from those who see early financial pressure. <\/p>  <p>  I am also in regular contact with the banks, co-ops and others about the development of lending products for farmers that are better adapted to the volatile global markets in which we operate.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also been proactive of course. Initiatives include provisions allowing dairy and other farmers to use income averaging over five years when it comes to paying income tax bills. This offers respite to the sector from a cash flow perspective. Furthermore, I have also ensured that priority has been given to measures for the dairy sector in the Rural Development Plan. The agreement at the Council of Agriculture Ministers late last year to increase the rate of single Farm Payment advance to 70% has been of assistance from a cash plan perspective as have the EU targeted aid payments for the sector, matched at national level, which on completion will have injected approaching &euro;25 million in liquidity into the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Also of relevance in this respect was my decision to make a 3 year interest free instalment arrangement available to all those affected by superlevy. This option has been availed of by approximately 3,700 producers and will be of assistance to farmers facing cash flow difficulties arising from super levy in the final year of the milk quota regime.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100051#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Industry","counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100051#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[2276\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100051#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the measures he will take to ensure healthy competition prevails in the Irish beef industry.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":66,"content":"<p>The State, through the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, has an existing and well established infrastructure for oversight of competition matters and for dealing with allegations of anti-competitive practices or abuse of a dominant position.<\/p>  <p>  While the deputy has not referred to any particular case, I am aware of recent proposed developments involving two meat processors.

It is allocated funding annually from the Exchequer for its various programmes and measures in this area.  Approximately &euro;378 million has been expended during the period 2005-2015 on major Flood Relief Schemes, undertaken directly by the OPW or funded by the OPW and undertaken by local authorities and also on the provision of funding to local authorities to carry our smaller, more localised flood relief works under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  The total of &euro;378m also includes expenditure by the OPW on its Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  Expenditure by the OPW on its Arterial Drainage Maintenance programme is not included in the figure of &euro;378m.<\/p><p>Expenditure for this period is shown on a county by county basis in the following table.  The table shows that expenditure on major Flood Relief Schemes amounted to &euro;267 million in this period while &euro;52 million was spent on providing funding to Local Authorities to undertake small scale projects under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme which commenced in 2009 and for the repair and restoration of coastal defences following the storms which caused extreme damage at the beginning of 2014. <\/p><p>The OPW has spent approximately &euro;60 million on other programmes, including the Flood Studies Update, Hydrology and Coastal, Flood Risk Data Management and the CFRAM Programme of studies, that is not attributable to a specific county and is therefore not included in the details of the table.<\/p><p>In addition to the above figures the OPW has spent &euro;183 million over this period on its Arterial Drainage Maintenance Programme which covers 11,500 kms of river channels and approximately 730km of embankments around the country.  As these are catchment based activities it is not possible to attribute the costs on a county basis and are therefore not included in the details of the table.<\/p><p>Local Authorities or other State bodies may have incurred expenditure directly themselves on flood relief measures utilising their own resources in the period in question.  The OPW does not have any information on such expenditure.<table><tr><th>Council<\/th><th>Type of Work<\/th><th><div>2005<\/div><\/th><th><div>2006<\/div><\/th><th><div>2007<\/div><\/th><th><div>2008<\/div><\/th><th><div>2009<\/div><\/th><th><div>2010<\/div><\/th><th><div>2011<\/div><\/th><th><div>2012<\/div><\/th><th><div>2013<\/div><\/th><th><div>2014<\/div><\/th><th><div>2015<\/div><\/th><th><div>TOTALS<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><div>&euro;,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow Co Co.<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Major Schemes<\/td><td><div>38<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,144<\/div><\/td><td><div>9<\/div><\/td><td><div>57<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,732<\/div><\/td><td><div>716<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>5,708<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Minor Works<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>32<\/div><\/td><td><div>611<\/div><\/td><td><div>439<\/div><\/td><td><div>114<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,196<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan Co.

Long-term leasing has a number of advantages over the conacre system and the Finance Act 2014 introduced measures to assist in rebalancing the market by enhancing the existing tax relief for income from long-term leasing, as follows:<\/p><p>-Increasing the income thresholds for relief from leasing income by 50%<\/p><p>-Introducing a fourth threshold for lease periods of 15 or more years<\/p><p>-Removing the lower age threshold of 40 years of age for eligibility<\/p><p>-Allowing non-connected limited companies as an eligible lessee.<\/p><p>EU Regulations governing the new Basic Payment Scheme provide for the transfer of entitlements by means of:<\/p><p>-Transfer by Sale of Entitlements<\/p><p>-Transfer by Gift<\/p><p>-Transfer by Inheritance<\/p><p>-Transfer by Lease\/Rental agreement<\/p><p>-Transfer by Scission<\/p><p>-Transfer by Merger<\/p><p>-Transfer by Change of Legal Status<\/p><p>- Transfer by administrative change to the registration details on the herdnumber.<\/p><p>The market for entitlements by lease is an open market based on supply and demand and the Department is not involved.

All entitlements are subject to a two year usage rule whereby entitlements not used for 2 consecutive years are returned to the National Reserve and lost permanently to the farmer.  Entitlements in the National Reserve are used primarily for distribution to eligible young farmers and new entrants to farming.  Farmers who wish to transfer their entitlements or to have the registration details of the entitlements changed must submit a Transfer of Entitlements application to the Department.

As with any Minister for Agriculture in the EU, I can have no role in influencing commodity prices in Ireland.  I do note however that 2015 was a relatively positive year for beef prices in Ireland with the yearly average nearly 8% higher compared to 2014.  The primary determinant of prices in any market is the relationship between supply and demand.  Price variations in different EU beef markets reflect prevailing conditions in those markets.  With regard to the price differential between Irish and UK cattle, a number of factors have been identified to explain why Irish-born cattle command lower prices than their British equivalents.  These include a British consumer preference for indigenous product as well as additional transport and processing costs in supplying that market.  Last year, Ireland exported approximately 272,000 tonnes of beef, worth in the region of &euro;1.1 billion to the UK.

It has enviable natural resources, adaptable and resilient producers, a strong international reputation, an effective dairy processing sector and a strong core of research infrastructure and expertise.  A recent report from Bord Bia estimates that Irish dairy exports increased by 4% to &euro;3.24Bn in 2015.  Some 42% or &euro;1.36 billion went to international markets beyond our traditional UK and EU partners&rsquo; markets.  This represents a very strong performance against the background of somewhat depressed international dairy markets during 2015.  The Deputy will be aware that prevailing market conditions and in particular the price of milk and dairy commodities is determined by supply and demand factors at international level.  Production decisions are taken by producers taking these prevailing market conditions as well as their efficiency of production and price of inputs into account.  In an increasingly global market environment, prices for raw milk and dairy commodities will be dictated by the market and by supply and demand factors at Irish, EU and global level.  Similarly, input prices are increasingly dictated by factors beyond our borders.  In such circumstances efforts at farm level to increase efficiency represent a factor where the farmer can exert greater control.  The work of Teagasc is invaluable in this respect.  Furthermore, efforts at both farm and processor level to produce higher value products for high value export markets also represent a boon against volatility in commodity production markets.  Research and investment is also very important for Ireland in continuing to punch above our weight, to continue to sell our products on premium markets and shelves across the world, to continue to find new customers and to maximise the economic return from our quality produce.<\/p>  <p>  Food commodity markets including dairy markets have been characterised by significant levels of volatility for a number of years prior to the abolition of dairy quotas and this trend has continued throughout 2015 and into early 2016.  Such volatility was a fact of life in advance of the abolition of quotas and will remain so in the current quota free environment.  The key challenge for the future is how we seek to mitigate this volatility.<\/p>  <p>  Factors contributing to global price volatility in 2015 included the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers including the EU on the supply side.  The longer term demographic and demand perspectives remain positive, but 2016 will be a challenging year.<\/p>  <p>  At producer level, while the Irish dairy sector is cost competitive, we must always strive for improvement.  With respect to the aforementioned factors affecting efficiency, farmers of all sizes, large and small, can drive their profitability by increased efficiencies across a range of factors, from animal health to breeding, from soil management and fertiliser use to financial management and an appreciation of costs and margins.  In fact the mantra in the run up to quota abolition from my perspective has always been to get better before getting bigger and this remains very much the case.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to indebtedness Teagasc figures indicate that Irish farmers have relatively low levels of indebtedness compared to counterparts in competition countries.  In ongoing interaction with banks I have been assured that they will remain vigilant on the issue of liquidity and cash-flow, particularly if prices continue to deteriorate into spring 2016, and that they will be facilitative in the measures available and in their dealings with dairy farmers.<\/p>  <p>  EU market supports, including intervention, are available to operators, the dairy package agreed by the Council of Ministers in December 2015 included an additional direct payment to dairy farmers, and my Department will continue to provided support to the sector through Rural Development Schemes such as TAMS, and by providing funding to bodies such as Teagasc, AHI and ICBF to improve efficiency at farm level.<\/p>  <p>  The long-term fundamentals of the global dairy market are strong but there will be significant challenges this year.  I am confident that the Irish and EU dairy sector is well placed to gain from the opportunity presented by expanding global demand whilst simultaneously addressing the aforementioned challenges with a particular focus on the challenges of price volatility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100059#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Exports","counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100059#WRK01400"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[2694\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100059#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he will develop new markets for Irish beef, lamb and pigmeat over the next five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":233,"content":"<p>A strong global demand for meat exists and my role as Minister is to facilitate market access so that Irish exporters can take advantage of market opportunities as they arise.  My Department engages on an ongoing basis with many third countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Irish Embassies, the meat industry and the European Commission on various market access issues.  2015 was a very successful year for meat exports.  According to Bord Bia, overall exports of beef, sheepmeat and pigmeat increased by &euro;130 million to &euro;3.2 billion.  This represents an increase of 4%. Although exports to the EU account for the majority of meat exports, Third Country markets are increasingly an important alternative outlet for the industry.  Since taking office I have led trade missions to a wide variety of destinations, including China, the United States, Algeria, Japan, West Africa and the Gulf States, in order to promote Irish food and beverages, including meat exports, and to open up new markets abroad.  These initiatives have led to several notable successes in securing agreement to export Irish beef to Japan, Singapore, Egypt, Iran, the US, and Oman; to export sheepmeat to Singapore, South Africa, the Philippines, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Canada and Oman; and to export pigmeat to Australia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Serbia.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to beef the opening of the US market to Irish beef in early 2015 has provided an important new outlet for Irish beef exports and it is one that holds enormous potential for future development given that we are the first EU member state to gain access.  An estimated 1,800 tonnes valued at &euro; 11.5 million has already been exported.  This is a strong start to this trade considering that the first exports only went in March 2015 and that some of the plants were only approved for export as recently as September.  There has also been some progress made with the lifting of the BSE ban by China in February 2015.  My Department is currently hosting an inspection visit by a delegation from AQSIQ which should bring us one stage closer to the commencement of exports of beef.  Again, this is a market that has enormous long-term potential.  In relation to the Philippines, Ireland has now become their second-largest supplier of beef.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding sheepmeat, the agreement of a veterinary health certificate with Hong Kong in 2014 has provided a valuable new outlet for Irish sheepmeat.  During my Trade Mission to China in November 2014, I was able to hand over the completed version of a sheepmeat questionnaire which represents the first milestone on the road which will lead, I hope, to Ireland gaining access to the Chinese market for sheepmeat in the future.<\/p>  <p>  For pigmeat, I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish pigmeat processors since the closure of the Russian market in 2014.  In this regard I was pleased to announce the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which will serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.<\/p>  <p>  The search for new market will continue in conjunction with the industry, Bord Bia, the European Commission and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

The NCSE operates within my Department's policy in allocating this support.<\/p>  <p>  Staffing arrangements for special schools are in line with policy advice provided by the NCSE which did not recommend alteration to staffing ratios established under SERC Report in 1993.<\/p>  <p>  Circular 0042\/2011 provides information to schools regarding the staffing arrangements which apply in Special schools.<\/p>  <p>  The Circular sets out that special schools are staffed based on their pupil profiles and the disability category of the pupils enrolled, as opposed to being based principally on school designation.  Staffing levels therefore reflect the complexity of needs that exist within schools rather than being determined solely by a school's designation, in recognition that many Special schools enrol students from disability categories other than from those provided for by their school designations.<\/p>  <p>  In determining the staffing allocation for schools, the NCSE takes into account up-to-date enrolment and pupil profile information. School staffing schedules are reviewed and updated each year by the NCSE.  As such, the profile of Special school pupil populations are aligned with appropriate staffing allocations. Accordingly, the staffing allocation for the school referred to in the Deputy's question reflects the profile of pupils currently enrolled in the school, in accordance with each pupil's disability categorisation.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has recently submitted their Policy Advice on Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.

My Department's contribution to the funding of the Centre commenced in 2000 under the Children at Risk Fund (CAR) and has continued to date to the current level of &euro;47,500 in non-pay funding and 968 teaching hours at a cost of &euro;81,840.  This represents an overall annual total of &euro;129,340.   With the hours allocated, tutors are employed by the Cork Education and Training Board (ETB) to work in the Centre and deliver tuition in subjects across the post-primary school curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the Life Centre is currently experiencing financial difficulties due to a combination of a decision by its main funder, the Christian Brothers, to withdraw direct funding to the Centre, and a decision by the Centre to expand its enrolment.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard it is important to note that my Department has not reduced its funding or support to the Centre in recent years. Rather it has maintained its contribution to the cost of education provision to its current level of just over &euro;129,000 per annum.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the pupil cohort currently attending the Life Centre includes referrals by TUSLA's Educational Welfare and Child and Family Services; the HSE's Child and Adult Mental Health Service (CAMHS) and other health professionals.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, TUSLA, the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory body with responsibility for the administration of educational welfare functions contained in the Education Welfare Act, 2000.  These include assisting parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child, and ensuring school attendance, participation and retention for all pupils.  Other functions of TUSLA include responsibility for the provision of supports for children in the care of its Child and Family Services.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs have confirmed to me that TUSLA refers young people to the Life Centre because of their complexity of needs which are not only educational, but also social and emotional, and because of the multidisciplinary and holistic approach of the Centre.  I understand that young people attending the Centre have access to a multidisciplinary team providing counselling and therapy as well as access to an outreach drugs and alcohol worker.<\/p>  <p>  Officials of my Department are currently engaging with the Cork Life Centre, Cork ETB and the Educational Welfare Service of TUSLA to facilitate appropriate future educational supports for the cohort of pupils currently supported by the Life Centre. I have also asked them to seek the involvement of other Tusla services to consider the question of other supports provided by the Centre.<\/p>  <p>  A key consideration for me in this matter is my Department's policy of inclusion, where the objective is for children to be educated within the mainstream system to the greatest extent possible. In this regard, it is important to note that the level of additional supports provided to schools to meet a range of additional educational pupil needs, has increased significantly since my Department's first began funding the Life Centre in 2000. I must also take account of my Department's funding of national programmes catering for early school leavers in the Cork area.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important that the supports provided by my Department to schools are fully availed of by students who need them, both to ensure value for the investment being made, and in recognition of the importance of early intervention in meeting individual need.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to working with my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to ensure that the particular needs of this student cohort can be met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100067#WRS00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Funding","counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100067#WRS00350"},{"type":"question","counter":397,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[2585\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100067#WRS00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of funding for a school (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
