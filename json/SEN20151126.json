I will keep this short and sweet.  I have been working in politics for more than 25 years and have dealt extensively with people applying for medical cards while helping them with their applications.  I have never come across a case in which a full-time student did not receive a medical card in the same way as his or her parents.  In this case, which I encountered recently, the mother is an invalid and the father is a carer.  The student in question works during the summer and at weekends to help finance her way through college because her parents cannot afford to help her.  However, due to her income from this work, she has been disallowed from getting a full medical card as held by her parents and she has only been given a GP visit card.  I have no problem with eligibility being based on a student's income, provided this is applied across the board and all students are assessed on their income and means.  This means in the case of parents who do not have medical cards because of their income, a student who has part-time earnings should be so assessed and it should be across the board.  What if the girl in question happens to get sick and ends up in hospital?  This is not beyond the bounds of possibility and could happen because while in college, my own daughter contracted glandular fever and ended up in hospital on a drip for nearly eight days.  In such a scenario, this girl would not be able to afford &euro;750 for hospital expenses because her parents certainly cannot afford it.  I reiterate it is fair enough if this applies across the board but one cannot pick and choose whereby some students are assessed on their means while others are assessed on those of their parents.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Moloney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2356\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2356&amp;amp;pid=MarieMoloney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I wish to know when the criteria were changed because I did not hear about it and I am sure many other Members have not heard about it.

She will be aware that, in accordance with the Health Act 1970, as amended, full eligibility and a medical card is awarded where a person cannot arrange GP services for himself or herself and his or her family without undue hardship, having regard to his or her financial circumstances.<\/p> <p>In the situation outlined by the Senator, it is possible for a student who has income of &euro;164 or more to be assessed in his or her own right for a medical card and the medical card status of the parents is not a relevant factor.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has not been made aware of any instances where problems referenced by the Senator have arisen and she has not provided details of any individual case.  Should the Senator wish to provide information concerning a specific applicant, the national medical card unit would be happy to undertake a review and revert directly.<\/p> <p>Eligibility under the medical card scheme for persons aged 16 to 25 years is assessed by reference to the HSE's medical card and GP visit card national assessment guidelines which state that persons aged 16 to 25, who are dependent on medical cardholders, are eligible for a medical card.  A 16 to 25 year old is classed as a dependant if he or she is living with parents or a guardian or living away from home attending school or college and has no income or a weekly income less than &euro;164.  Where an applicant in this age bracket is earning more than &euro;164 per week, then he or she is assessed as being financially independent.  The figure of &euro;164 is the current medical card income guideline for a single person living with family.<\/p> <p>Where deemed appropriate, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card where an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, for example, costs arising from an illness.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.  Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE as is evidenced by the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation, which has increased from approximately 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 96,000 on 1 November this year.<\/p> <p>On foot of the Keane report, published last year, the HSE established a clinical advisory group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  The group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Senator and reassures her that the HSE endeavours to operate in a fair manner within its legislative framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#B00200","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The reason I did not supply the details is because I am talking about a policy rather than an individual but I will supply the details to the Minister of State to show that what I outlined has happened.

I raise the need for the Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for primary care, social care, disabilities and older people, and mental health to introduce Ireland's first ever national autism awareness week from 1 April to 8 April 2016 and to have Ireland's first ever national autism awareness day on 2 April 2016 as a commencement debate.  This is a very important matter and one which I will champion.  The reason I have suggested 1 April to 8 April is that it coincides with World Autism Week, and 2 April coincides with World Autism Day.<\/p> <p>For too long, people with autism have suffered in silence, many not even knowing that they have the condition.  More must be done in order to highlight autism and its effects.  I have been in contact with Irish Autism Action which agrees with me that we need to educate society about autism.  It is its belief and mine that the people of Ireland are unaware how many suffer with autism.  Irish Autism Action refers to a study which shows that one in 100 people in Ireland suffer with this condition at some level on the spectrum.  However, that might be a conservative estimate, as in the UK it is believed that one in 88 people are on the autism spectrum.<\/p> <p>The purpose of this Commencement debate is to raise awareness about autism.  For every one that has the condition, five to six other people in the family are also affected.  It is important that this message is delivered throughout society, and to one and all, to let people who are dealing with autism on a daily basis know that they are not on their own.  The Government has implemented a number of measures to help improve the lives of people with autism.  An additional &euro;4 million was allocated in 2014 to assist in the implementation of the progressing disability services programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million has been provided this year to support the programme's ongoing implementation.<\/p> <p>Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Additional funding of &euro;12 million was allocated by the Health Service Executive to meet the needs of approximately 1,400 young people who required continuing health-funded supports on leaving school or rehabilitative training this year.  However, we can and must do more.  We can also look to the Step Ahead programme and, in turn, roll out the programme throughout the country.  Step Ahead is a unique 14 week interdisciplinary programme, providing both direct intervention and parent training and education to children under the age of five diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder.  The child receives four hours of direct support weekly, two hours each Monday and Thursday, by skilled interventionists under the guidance and direct supervision of the team's speech and language therapist, occupational therapist and board certified behaviour analyst.  The aim of the programme is to provide meaningful assessment across all early learning domains to establish strengths and needs, identify the most effective individualised intervention strategies and support parents to learn the intervention techniques to promote continued growth beyond the duration of the programme.  Ultimately, the goal is to encourage at as young an age as possible those skills necessary to benefit from the most naturalistic and inclusive settings.  We need to help extend this model to more families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#B00800","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Sheahan for raising this issue today and I compliment him on his presentation and its content.

This is a very good way of maintaining focus on citizens with autism and their families.  However, what has struck the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, again and again, is that the one thing that people with a disability want more than any other, regardless of their condition, is to live as normal a life as possible in the community and to have the same opportunities as all other citizens to participate in their community.  Government policy in relation to disability is not condition specific and encompasses all citizens who have a disability.

This process is being led by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.

This work by the NDA, which has included consultation with families, has been of significant assistance in informing how best to address the needs of people with ASD as part of the national disability strategy, which covers a wide range of policy areas across Departments and agencies, so that we can be sure that they are appropriately reflected and included in policies and actions.  The proposed approach was also discussed with the national disability strategy steering group.  A programme of specific measures has now been agreed for delivery by the relevant Departments and agencies, including specific actions to be delivered by the NDA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#B00900","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Deenihan for his reply on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.

I wish to discuss the position in respect of the charities regulator.   Even though the relevant legislation was enacted in 2009, the regulator was not put into place until 18 months ago.  The Minister of State is very involved in the area of philanthropy, fundraising and charity.  I am here to speak on behalf of the Exchequer, the public and the charity sector.  One has to look into every section of the Government.  We gave between &euro;4.5 billion and &euro;5 billion to the charity sector.  I have read the answer given by the Minister for Justice and Equality in reply to a question in the D&aacute;il recently.  The regulator is in place but when will the Minister seek to give it teeth?  There are problems and Christmas is coming.  I am involved in a very good charity, the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation, of which the Minister of State.  Trust is a word that is terribly precious in our society.  The Irish are incredible givers but trust is in short supply with charities because of events that occurred in recent years.

It has 55 employees and a budget of &pound;3.5 million.  I am glad the Minister of State has increased the budget of the Irish regulator to &euro;2.66 million for 2016.  Perhaps this will help us to reach the necessary level.  I hope the Minister of State will not give me the comforting answer that the regulator has compiled the statutory register of charities and is waiting for the remaining charities not established under the Companies Registration Office, CRO, to put in their paperwork and register.  Before this regulator was put in place, the Irish Nonprofits Knowledge Exchange, INKEx, had a register ready to go and most charities are registered with the CRO, so most of that work has been done.  The public needs to know that charities are using their resources correctly and who exactly is responsible for running a particular charity.  It also wants to know that the Government has an up to date database of charities, that charities are compliant, what is spent on marketing and payroll and where exactly their money is going. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#C00500","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, I thank Senator Mary Ann O'Brien for raising this important issue.  The Minister regrets that she cannot be present here this morning because of pressing issues.<\/p> <p>The Charities Regulatory Authority was established as an independent agency on 16 October 2014 under the provisions of the Charities Act 2009.  The aim of the authority is to provide better regulation of charitable organisations through a framework of registration, regulation and support.  This framework is intended to enhance public confidence in the vast majority of charities who do immense work to improve outcomes and circumstances for those they are established to help.  As was indicated by the Minister for Justice and Equality on the establishment of the authority, it has a wide range of functions under the Charities Act 2009, which are being introduced on a phased basis, beginning with the compilation of the statutory register of charities.  The initial priority of the authority was the development of the register.  Some 8,500 CHY charities with tax exemption status were registered automatically on the register of charities on the establishment of the authority.  In addition, any charity established before 16 October 2014 and not automatically registered must apply directly to the authority for inclusion on the register by 16 April 2016.<\/p> <p>The authority has undertaken a variety of work since its establishment, including the establishment of the register of charities and a fully online system for registration and annual reporting by charities; communication with the 8,500 CHY charities with tax exemption status regarding the additional information and legal documentation required to support their registered status; development of an online system for organisations to apply for inclusion on the register of charities; provision of information to the charities sector on its obligations and duties under the new regulatory regime; and the continuation of services hitherto provided by the commissioners of charitable donations and bequests for Ireland.<\/p> <p>The range of services to be provided by the authority is being developed on an ongoing basis.  These services include the development of an annual reporting framework for registered charities, the development of a monitoring and compliance programme and the development of the investigative role of the authority under Part 4 of the Act, which has not yet been commenced.  The register, when more advanced, will underpin the investigative and other regulatory work of the authority.   In the meantime, the authority has put in place an interim process for the handling of complaints it receives about suspected abuse of charitable status or fraud in charities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jimmy Deenihan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=306\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=306&amp;amp;pid=JimmyDeenihan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Under this process, all complaints received in writing will be subject to an initial review and assessment by the authority to determine whether any further action is appropriate.

This includes additional funding of &euro;1.25 million which will enable an expansion of staffing levels and other resources available to the authority in 2016.  The approval of additional staff for the authority during 2015 and the provision of significant additional resources in the 2016 Estimate to facilitate the recruitment of further staff amount to clear evidence that the Minister is determined to ensure the authority is appropriately resourced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#C00600","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply from which I do take comfort.

It must be noted that the authority is just more than one year old and still very much in a capacity building phase.

A wave of EU parliaments, including those in the United Kingdom, France and Spain, have passed similar motions.  In most cases, recognition is part of an overall approach to the Middle East peace process.  In May 2015 the Vatican concluded its first treaty formally recognising the state of Palestine, with an agreement on church activities in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority.<\/p> <p>After this House and the D&aacute;il passed the motions referred to last year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, stated in the D&aacute;il that he was open to early recognition, if that would be helpful.  The Minister said he would reflect on the question, including by engaging in a reflection at EU level on the European Union's overall approach to the Middle East process.  This reflection was initiated by High Representative Mogherini.  The Minister has also stated a move towards recognition would help to jump-start a peace process that has stalled. <\/p> <p>One year on I am very disappointed that the Government has not acted on the recommendation of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  The latest direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in March 2014 and there is no expectation of a resumption of the negotiations in the foreseeable future.  There is no political or peace process in being.  The latest Israeli Government, formed by Prime Minister Netanyahu in May, is a coalition of nationalist and religious parties, most members of which are openly hostile to the establishment of a Palestinian state and support ongoing expansion of the legal settlements.  On the Palestinian side, the Palestinian factions are fragmented.  The West Bank and Gaza are disconnected and there are serious leadership and legitimacy issues.<\/p> <p>The Minister appears to be waiting for a broader EU consensus to grow on the issue of recognition of Palestine.  One third of the member states of the European Union already recognise Palestine, with Sweden being the most recent, having done so last year.  Given the division among EU member states on the issue, consensus is unlikely to be reached in the short term.  Granting recognition is a member state competency; it is not one which is reserved to the European Union.  This would be a progressive measure for Ireland to take and one which does not require consensus at EU level.  A full year on since the motions were passed by the Oireachtas, it is clear that it is time for Ireland to follow the example of Sweden and recognise Palestine without further delay.  <\/p> <p>I have tabled this matter to draw the Minister's attention to it and, in particular, to the fact that more than one year has passed since the motions were passed by the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  Will Ireland now move to recognise Palestine without further delay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#D00500","speaker":"1200"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The Minister regrets that he cannot be in attendance and wishes for me to convey his apologies to the Senator in that regard.  <\/p> <p>The achievement of a sovereign Palestinian state, recognised not just by Ireland but by everyone, including Israel, has been a major foreign policy objective of the Government since it took office.  It is something we seek to achieve in reality, not just in words, and all of the Government's actions in relation to the Middle East conflict are directed towards that end.  Only a two-state solution, with a Palestinian state existing alongside and in peace with Israel, can satisfy the need of both peoples for security and prosperity.<\/p> <p>Last year the Seanad, on 22 October, and the Dail, on 10 December, passed motions calling on the Government to recognise Palestine and to help to achieve a two-state solution.  The Government did not oppose or seek to amend the motions which were calling for something on which we were already working.  There were similar motions in other European parliaments, prompted by the decision of Sweden in October to recognise Palestine.  In Ireland, as in most countries, recognition of sovereign states is a matter for decision by the Government.  The views of the Oireachtas are, of course, a very important factor in that consideration, but it remains for the Government and, in the first instance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to consider if this would be an appropriate step and, if so, when it might be best to take it.<\/p> <p>With other Ministers, the Minister spoke in the Dail debate on 9 and 10 December.  They set out in detail the Government's view on the issue.  The Minister made it clear that, while successive Governments had always seen recognition as part of an overall peace agreement, he had no difficulty with early recognition by Ireland if he felt it could be helpful to the situation, that is, the efforts to reach such a peace agreement.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jimmy Deenihan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=306\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=306&amp;amp;pid=JimmyDeenihan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The statements in that debate also set out, in more detail than I can state today, the many and various factors which the Minister would weigh up when making that decision.  We all know that recognition by Ireland will not of itself bring a Palestinian state into being.  We need to consider not just the positive symbolic significance that recognition might have for Palestinians but also what effect it might have on the Israeli side whom we seek to influence and persuade.  We must consider how it might affect Ireland's influence and voice on the issue both in the region and in international discussions, particularly at EU level, and any impact it might have on Ireland's ability to continue its work on the ground.  There are potential downsides to be considered as well as gains.<\/p><p>In terms of timing, clearly some events in the past year would have weighed on the consideration as regards when might be the right moment for a decision to be made on recognition.  These include the lengthy election and coalition building process in Israel in the first half of the year, the continuing debate in the EU on Middle East policy and latterly the upsurge of violence in Jerusalem and elsewhere.  During that period, the Minister has visited Israel and the Palestinian territory.  He has also discussed the recognition question with some EU colleagues and the Palestinian Foreign Minister.  It is also worth noting that no further EU partner has followed Sweden's example and recognised Palestine.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is continuing to consider the question of early recognition by Ireland of the state of Palestine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#D00600","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and appreciate that he will bring this issue to the attention of the Minister.  I wish to stress that recognition by itself will not end occupation and only Israel can do so.  Ireland's recognition of the state of Palestine would have enormous symbolic significance.<\/p> <p>Last year, after this House passed a motion that I had initiated, I was invited to speak at a UN conference on Palestine that was held in New York.  At the conference other countries warmly welcomed the fact that Ireland had taken such a step and there was a sense that it would be positive and helpful if more countries did so.  I also pointed out that Sweden had been the only EU state to have recognised Palestine.  Twelve to 18 months have elapsed and one third of the EU already recognise Palestine so there is a significant group.<\/p> <p>Throughout its history Ireland has had a proud tradition of standing out and not just following the herd, and waiting for common consensus.  On issues of human rights and international justice, we have proudly stood out and led the way and this is another area where we need to do so.  As Tr&oacute;caire has pointed out, the recognition of the state of Palestine would be anti-occupation and not anti-Israel.  Ireland has recognised the State of Israel and recognising the state of Palestine would help to create a parity of status which could only be helpful in getting the peace process off the ground and jump starting it which the Minister said was necessary a year ago.

If he can solve the mystery of how to spend time without spending money, he might share it with all of us in this House.  I am sure that Paddy Cullen would have been delighted with Bernard's services when Kerry scored that famous goal.  Paddy was described at the time as being like a woman who smelled the cake burning but if Bernard had been on the field at the time, he might have prevented that famous goal.<\/p> <p>I am delighted that the Minister for Health will be in the House today to discuss the situation in emergency departments but I note that he will only be here for 40 minutes, which is not a lot of time.  There is an issue about the length of time it takes emergency ambulances to reach patients in some instances.  In Roscommon, it took over three hours for an emergency ambulance to arrive at the house of a stroke victim, even though the house is located next door to the ambulance depot.  There are numerous similar cases all over the country.  The 40 minutes that the Minister is granting to this House to debate the issue is the same amount of time it takes ambulances to reach stroke and heart attack victims and the scenes of car accidents.  The term \"death by geography\" is relevant here.  A report by Dr. Browne of UCC points out that people in Kerry, Donegal, Roscommon and other parts of the country are dying because there is a shortage of emergency ambulances, never mind them actually reaching the accident and emergency departments.  This is due to the Minister's lack of management.  He says that his popularity is due to his better bedside manner but he is like a doctor who, instead of using his knowledge as a doctor to treat the patient, just gives tea and sympathy and says, \"If only there was something I could do\".  If only he had been elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, had been in the Cabinet and was appointed as Minister for Health.  All he is at present is an apologist for the health service.  I am delighted he is coming into the House this afternoon.  I am disappointed that he will only be here for 40 minutes but, as I said, that is about the length of time it will take an emergency ambulance to reach someone who needs it.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to reconsider the plan to take all Remaining Stages of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2015 this afternoon and to consider just taking the Report Stage debate today.  I also ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the case of Ibrahim Halawa.  My party will be tabling a motion on same in the context of a report published by Doughty Street Chambers, the legal team representing this Irish citizen.  Mr. Halawa has been on hunger strike for 35 days in a prison in Egypt.  His legal team's report contradicts the stance of this Government in not pursuing the same course of action as that pursued by the Australian Government.  The Irish Government is saying that nothing can happen in Mr. Halawa's case until such time as the trial is completed but Mr. Peter Greste was released by the Egyptian authorities prior to his trial being completed and while he was still on remand in prison.  He was sent back to Australia because the Australian Prime Minister got involved in his case.  That has not happened in the case of this Irish-born citizen and we must ask why that is so.  If the Australians can do it for their citizens, why are the Irish not doing it for theirs?  I ask the Leader to support the aforementioned motion next week because Mr. Halawa has been in prison for two years and has now been  on hunger strike for 35 days.  However, the Irish Government, a bit like the Minister for Health, is saying \"Sure, what can we do about it?\".

This is a crucial part of Labour Party policy and our manifesto states that we will be seeking repeal of the eighth amendment if elected to Government at the next general election.

It calls on all drivers to be very drink aware over Christmas.  It is frightening that a survey conducted on behalf of the RSA shows that up to 284,000 drivers admit to having driven while under the influence of drink in the past 12 months and that 150 people are arrested every week for drink driving.  Men are by far the worst culprits, at 85%.  Some 50% of those people who drank and drove are in the age category 20 to 39.  Most arrests take place on Saturdays and Sundays.  As we come into the Christmas party season, I advise everybody to leave the car at home and organise a taxi or designated driver.  We do not want to hear any more heart-rending stories, such as Gillian Treacy&rsquo;s account of the heartbreak her family has endured as a result of the loss of her four-year-old son.  As well as the potential loss of life, people need to be conscious of the loss of their livelihoods as a result of a driving ban.  No family should ever be bereaved as a result of a drink driving accident.

There are large advertisements that suggest one will be sexually, socially and financially successful if one has a good slop of a particular brand of beer, gin or whisky, and then at the bottom appear the words \"drink carefully\".  That is not what they want at all.  They want us to gorge ourselves on their products and make profits for them.<\/p> <p>It is no longer Uncle Arthur, who was a fairly benevolent figure in this city and did contribute; it is now Diageo, which makes underground railway trains, lavatory paper, contraceptives - I do not know what else it makes but it is not a bit interested in the welfare of people here.

Please remember that the entire business plan of the tobacco industry is summed up in four words - \"addict children to carcinogens\".  When you lose 50 of your customers every day from smoking-related illnesses, you must replace them.  The overwhelming majority of smokers start as children.  The majority of smokers wish to stop and the majority of those who wish to stop fail to stop.  Our best strategy is to stop people starting in the first place and we need to be eternally vigilant in our attempts to do this, so I was appalled to discover that there is a new and discretely available product that is often labelled \"good things come in small packages\".  These are starter cigarette packs - small little pouches that contain tobacco and cigarette paper - that are sold in small amounts at a price that is substantially below that which applies to the smallest pack of cigarettes that are currently available.  These products are placed within the price range where children on pocket money or small change can afford to purchase them.<\/p> <p>The tobacco industry is extraordinarily well-resourced.  In case people do not know, it is the second largest lobbying industry in the EU after the agricultural sector.  Members will know I attempted to bring in an anti-tobacco lobbying Bill here when it was disclosed that the Taoiseach and two senior Ministers had breached the international guidelines of the WHO in their dealings with the tobacco industry.  Prior to that debate, we found in the well of this Chamber the business card of a public relations candidate who works with the tobacco industry.  Given this, it is apparent this is an issue we need take relentlessly seriously.  I propose to the Leader that we have a debate on this House not just on tobacco policy but specifically on the issues of marketing and how we can strengthen the regulatory process in terms of limiting the eternally clever ways the industry has of getting around the tobacco regulations in this country.  <\/p> <p>I also propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 59 be taken before No. 1.  As I have stated previously, the reason for this is because I have three outstanding Bills.  They are outstanding in the sense that they have not gone anywhere.  While I do not suggest they are outstanding legislative measure, hopefully, history will deem that they are.  However, I am not that ambitious.  These Bills have passed Second Stage and in the time-honoured tradition of Pyrrhic victories in this House, I am supposed to be happy as an Opposition backbench Independent Senator that they have got this far and am then expected to let them die with the Oireachtas.  I do not want them to die.  I want them to be either passed or defeated.  That is why I was elected to this House - to introduce legislation - and that is why I am asking for an amendment to the Order of Business, to take No. 59 before No. 1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#L00200","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I second Senator Crown's proposed amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p> <p>I join with colleagues in sending my best wishes to Bernard Hand.  Since the day I became a Member of this House, he has been very courteous, polite, unassuming and helpful.  I thank him for that.  As has been stated here by other colleagues, he is an avid GAA fan.  I understand he got his love for the GAA from his late father, Benny, who was from a quiet village in County Monaghan called Scotshouse.  The people of Scotshouse are very proud people who love their GAA.  They are just unfortunate in that they are on the Cavan border and nearly made it as far as becoming Cavan people.  Bernard always had a great interest in Cavan GAA and would regularly ask me how we were getting on.  It was not very difficult to answer that question because it was only asked about once a year or twice a year at the most.  Things are improving and we are getting there.  Bernard always reminded me that his father was a great Cavan supporter in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s.  We look forward to the day when Bernard not only has Dublin to support but will be able to go back and support the Cavan team in the not too distant future.

I concur with what has been said about Senator Norris as he collects another award of distinction tomorrow.<\/p> <p>I support Senator Bacik's call for a debate in the House on abortion services because a democratic debate is always useful and helpful.  The Senator put on record her pleasure at the pronouncement of the Labour Party's proposal on abortion.  While I disagree in every respect with the Senator on the matter, she is absolutely entitled to her opinions and I am sure she will fully respect mine.  I am sure she will fully respect my view that what she and the Labour Party are proposing is absolutely akin to the British and American regimes on abortion, about which I and many other people in the country are deeply disturbed.  Let us have that debate.<\/p> <p>It appears the Taoiseach has reflected and revised his views on how a Government should operate and he might well allow a free vote of his parliamentary party colleagues on the matter.  I am not sure if it is a question of Sunningdale for slow learners or a question of trying to rewrite history.  I regret the Taoiseach did not allow such a facility when he and his Government presided over the abortion introduction in this country in 2013.  If he had been as willing then to allow the free vote he now claims he might allow, things would be different.  It is important that in a House of democracy, we debate all subjects - the difficult ones as well as the easier topics.

I thank him for all that he has done and I hope to see him often into the future.<\/p><p>As politicians, we know that full disclosure and transparency increase public confidence in our institutions.  The register of Members' interests, the SIPO requirements and other statutory provisions in ethics all give the public confidence, hopefully, in the Oireachtas and in public representatives.  Referring to transparency, the former US Supreme Court Justice, Louis Brandeis said, &quot;Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants&quot;.  Touching on some of what Senator Crown said, allowing the public full disclosure on financial matters, including payment and commercial interests, fosters accountability and prevents obvious corruption.  It is remarkable that for so long in Irish life, secrecy and lack of transparency around pay packages and salaries of senior staff in representative organisations continue to be an issue.<\/p><p>Speaking as a son of the land and as somebody whose family farm would take about 200 or 300 years of activity to match the pay packet of the famous retiree from the IFA, I do not find it surprising that farmers are outraged and horrified that they, as members, were contributing to what can only be described as grossly inflated pay and compensation packages for senior management.  The <i>Irish Independent<\/i>revealed that over the past 14 months, the IFA refused repeated requests to furnish details of the general secretary's package and also the level of compensation paid to the president.  I can only assume the ordinary rank-and-file members were also kept in the dark, which is not good enough.  How many more unions and representative organisations throughout the country conceal the pay and compensation packages of senior managers from their members?<\/p><p>We need an urgent debate to establish what options are open to compel transparency in this sector.  In the charity sector, the Oireachtas was required to pass legislation so that practices could be reformed.  Perhaps it is time to consider covering unions and representative organisations also.  There used to be a line that senior trade union officials needed to earn as much money as their industry counterparts so they could eyeball them across the table effectively.  Where did that nonsense come from?  What a lack of idealism.  What a lack of a sense of service to the people they represent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#M00500","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#M00600","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Of course, it was all about spin and justifying the padded cushion on which they sat because it should not require-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#M00700","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>The Senator is way over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#M00800","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>-----exorbitant salaries to give good service to the people they represent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#M00900","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I join other Senators in passing on best wishes to Mr. Bernard Hand on his retirement, which, I hope, will be long and happy.

He was always a gentleman as far as I was concerned.<\/p> <p>This matter may have been mentioned on the Order of Business; I was late coming in.  Irish Water has firmed up on its plans to extract water from the River Shannon and to pipe it through the midlands and into Dublin.  I was chairman of the Shannon water advisory board when that plan was first mooted eight years ago.  The initial reaction was a kneejerk one.  The people in the west were of the view that their water was being stolen and so on.  I think people have had a better look at it since.  I hope when this is going ahead, the local authority members will be consulted first and last because they are the people who know most about the environmental impact it will have on their area.<\/p> <p>It is disappointing Bord na M&oacute;na'a plans to create an eco-lake in the midlands as part of the scheme seem to have been shelved.  Apparently, it will be one pipeline with offshoots in the various counties where water is required.  It is a big project that will create a great number of jobs.  It is not exactly draining the Shannon as was promised in these Houses for decades.

I presume it is the intention of every party that we would do everything possible to try to secure his release, and the Government is doing that.<\/p> <p>Senator Bacik also spoke about the Halawa case.  In addition, she called for a debate on the Paris talks on climate change.  We will try to facilitate that in the new year.

I believe attitudes to drink driving have changed significantly over the years but there is a need to continue monitoring it.  The message must be conveyed that if one drinks, one does not drive.  Obviously, that message has not got through to everybody but let us hope it will get through, especially during the Christmas period.<\/p> <p>Senator Leyden referred to a point he raised yesterday about motor insurance.

Tourism has been a tremendous boost for the economy.  I recall that when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, took office four years ago he emphasised that tourism would be one of the engines that would drive our economy.  That is the reason the 9% VAT rate was introduced.  He was proved correct and it has proven to be a great boost to the economy and to the growth we are witnessing at present.  Long may it continue.  I will try to arrange for the debate the Senator requested but I doubt that it will be held before Christmas due to the amount of legislation we must deal with between now and then.<\/p> <p>Senator Mooney corrected the record of the House in respect of the wearing of seat belts and the number of people killed on our roads as a result of not wearing them.  Irrespective of the numbers involved, it is crazy that people do not wear seat belts in their cars in this day and age.  The message must be conveyed that people must belt up at all times when in a car.<\/p> <p>I referred to Senator Craughwell earlier.  He spoke about the expansionary nature of the budget.  I assure him there will be no return to what we witnessed in the economy over many years.  The Senator will have the opportunity to discuss that during the debate on the Finance Bill.<\/p> <p>Senator Crown rightly highlighted the ploys of the tobacco companies and the tobacco industry to get young people to start smoking.  I will try to organise a debate on the matter in early course.  With regard to the proposed amendment to the Order of Business to take No. 59 before No. 1, No. 59 deals with not just finishing Second Stage but also taking Committee Stage of that Bill.  I cannot afford the opportunity of holding Committee Stage of that Bill today before No. 1.  It was pointed out yesterday that a number of Bills had concluded with five seconds or so left on Second Stage.  It would be appropriate to try to deal with those.  I ask the Members concerned either to remove them from the Order Paper or to deal with the concluding seconds of the Bills.  I will facilitate them in doing that if they wish.  If a vote is required to conclude Second Stage, we can deal with that.  I will consider what can be done with regard to the Bill mentioned by Senator Crown.<\/p> <p>Senator Wilson called for a debate on the Defence Forces.  I agree that such a debate is long overdue.

As he knows, these amendments were thoroughly thrashed out in the D&aacute;il.  I have resubmitted tham as a matter of procedure and will outline the rationale for them.  I am sure the Minister will respond with his own interpretation.<\/p><p>A stated objective of the winding back of the FEMPI legislation, as the Minister said, was, in the first instance, to give relief to public and civil servants on low and middle incomes.  I acknowledged on Second Stage that those on lower and very low incomes in the civil and public service would receive some relief under this legislation.  I also said any alleviation would be welcomed.  <\/p><p>With respect to the amendments, the point was made to the Minister during the debate on the legislation in the D&aacute;il - I make it again now - that in terms of equity and delivering maximum relief to those on middle, low and very low incomes in the civil and public service, efforts should have been totally focused on those in the lower income brackets, but we note in this legislation that the only incomes in respect of which complete income restoration is envisaged and set out stage by stage are those above &euro;65,000 and &euro;110,000.  This series of amendments seeks to remedy this.  Some of them seek to deal with the issues of salaries and pensions. <\/p><p>The Minister rejected similar amendments in the D&aacute;il and I imagine he will reject these amendments also.  The reason I have resubmitted them is to outline what could be interpreted as a more favourite position for those on higher incomes.  The question that arises is how in the staged process of full restoration of pay and conditions and all other aspects the process is not similar for people on lower incomes?  This measure purports to unwind the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation, but this should be done in a way that is fair and equitable to all.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 6 sets out that nothing in this section will provide for an increase in the salaries of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or Ministers of the Government.  In the debate on the legislation in the D&aacute;il the Minister stated current Ministers would voluntarily forgo any portion of income returned to them.  However, it should be noted again that it is very much a voluntary action and not set out in legislation.  We believe that is a mistake.  For how long will that voluntary measure last?  Can we rely on politicians' goodwill?  Circumstances change and those who voluntarily forgo such income may decide they do not want to do so anymore.  Given that Members of the Oireachtas, particularly members of the Government, brought forward previous FEMPI legislation which introduced broad menus of cuts, it is appropriate that Members of the Oireachtas should lead from the front in the recovery.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 9 is a similar amendment with respect to pensions.  Amendment No. 15 is particularly controversial.  I know that the Minister has mentioned the constitutionality issue, but this amendment focuses specifically on former Members or Ministers.  There has, rightly, been much public concern about this issue, particularly the very high pensions of which former Ministers and politicians are in receipt.  It is not lost on many people that some of those in receipt of these pensions were at the helm of the economy and subsequently when the economic crash occurred.  The Minister has mentioned that the constitutionality aspect could bring down the FEMPI legislation, but I have tabled this amendment not least to make the political point that there is considerable concern that while those on lower incomes will not have their incomes totally restored, the big players with big pensions will have their pensions increased.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#Q01000","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I do not agree with these amendments.  This is the typical public relations stunt to attack the salaries and pensions of Members of the Oireachtas.  Whatever about the pensions of former Taoisigh, the pensions of former Members are not enormous by any means.  Those who serve the country well deserve to be properly treated.<\/p> <p>Senator Kathryn Reilly spoke about relying on the goodwill of Members.  Of course, we can rely on their goodwill; politicians fall over themselves to sacrifice themselves and take pay cuts and all the rest.  I was around when some of the allowances were created by the then Minister, Mr. Charlie McCreevy.  It was sleight of hand because Members of the Oireachtas had decided not to accept the pay increases members of the general public were to receive.  It was sleight of hand compensation for the trade unions.  Civil servants had them streamed into their pay.  Our pay was supposed to be linked with pay rates in the Civil Service, but that coupling was undone.  I do not agree with this idea and do not think the public pays much attention to the self-sacrifice of politicians.  I have said previously that if we were to strip ourselves naked, give all of our possessions to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and jump off the roof of Leinster House, the general public would be quite unimpressed.  I stand alone in public in saying I  think we should receive proper remuneration for the job. <\/p> <p>On an allied subject, the allowances paid, they are a mess.  The interpretation of the regulations is chaotic.  Why does the Government not just consider giving Members of the Oireachtas the proper rate for the job?  It should have an outside person look at our work ratios and all the rest, pay the rate for the job and cut out all of the allowances.  That would cut out the controversies and we would then receive the rate for the job.  In the New Year I am seriously contemplating throwing the old allowances back in the face of the Government and saying: \"Keep them, they are not worth a tuppenny damn.\"    I do not agree that Members of the Oireachtas should be sacrificed.  I do not see why we should be excised from a public movement of pay restoration.  Why should we?  Why should Members of Parliament be exceptional in being penalised when everybody else's income will be restored gradually by the Government?  Ours should be too and I say this quite openly and publicly, although I know that it will not be popular, but I do not give a damn.  It is what I believe.

There is no question but that it is a populist measure.  However, there are a number of contrary views.  One is that the Government, in its attempt to abolish the Seanad, played on what the focus groups seemed to suggest would go down well with the general public, that not only would it get rid of a bunch of politicians but that it would save the State some money.

I will always defend the right of people in these Houses to a pension.  The question of how that pension is calculated should be a matter for outside agencies.  It is important to remind people that the pay and conditions of politicians were not set by politicians.  We need to go back to the infamous benchmarking exercise of 2002, which I consider to be the most anti-democratic action taken in the course of the 15 years or so in which my party was in government.  It involved the Government of the day and the trade union movement cooking up this wonderful agreement to ensure politicians and public servants were looked after.  Of course, as public servants ourselves, Oireachtas Members gained from that.  However, I recall being very uncomfortable at the time about all the money that came pouring out of that agreement in 2002 and in subsequent years.  It was morally wrong, as I said when it was done.  I remember getting cheques and not having a clue what they were, the only reference being to &quot;arrears&quot;.  There was a lack of transparency because of the manner in which the deal was done, which was behind closed doors and without any involvement by either House.<\/p><p>Going back to the survey to which I referred, it really brought home to me the point Senator Norris made and on which I am in full agreement with him.  Every politician in this and the other House would agree with him, privately if not publicly.  The fact is that people in this country generally do not care to know that politicians have taken pay cuts or, if they do know, they very quickly forget it.  The general view, irrespective of any reality, is that politicians are lining their own pockets.  The reality, of course, is that the reductions Deputies and Senators have taken in the past five or six years amount to a cut of well in excess of 30% of their pay.  I am not complaining about that but am simply pointing out that reality and public perception do not always align.<\/p><p>Another source of irritation to me is the lack of acknowledgment of the fact that over the past 30 or 40 years, the average turnover of Members of both Houses at each general election was 30%.  As a result of the fluidity of the political situation in the past six years or so, that average might even be higher.  The rate of turnover was certainly higher at the 2011 election and it could be high again at the next election.  What happens to the people who leave their jobs to come into Oireachtas, serve one term and then have to try to pick up the pieces of their career?  It is not easy for them but there is no attention given to their situation by the media.  Instead, the focus is on the amount of money Deputies and Senators receive in their salaries.  Moreover, the impression is effectively conveyed that Oireachtas Members receive that money from the cradle to the grave.  In reality, a significant cohort of people are elected to these Houses for one term only before having to relaunch their career on the outside.  What is worse, some accrue so many expenses in the course of their election campaign, they are left paying off bills right through their term.<\/p><p>To be clear, what I am saying here does not amount to a plaintive cry.  I am merely articulating certain realities that do not always seep into the public awareness.  The only view presented to people is one that says Deputies and Senators are out to look after themselves.  There is a human dimension behind the statistics I mentioned that is forgotten about.  It is neither remarked on nor even conceded that there are people trying to keep body and soul together and who, once they leave the Oireachtas, find it very difficult to return to their previous line of work.<\/p><p>To reiterate, I am not against these amendments but am taking the opportunity to point out a few facts.  As I said at the outset, I realise I will not gain any friends by saying what I have said.  I probably will be accused of defending the indefensible.  All I am trying to do is point out the political and human realities behind the facts and figures.  Despite all the efforts by the last Government, the results of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>survey show people's views are not in line with the reality.  I have no doubt that if a similar question were put to the public in respect of this Government, the majority would go for option A, that politicians have increased their pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#R00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":150,"content":"<p>The sentiments behind these amendments are understandable.  It is important to iterate, however, that there is a very strong bias in this legislation towards the lower paid.

The point was made on Second Stage that although more is going back to the lower paid, everybody is getting something back.  It is more a statement of gratitude and appreciation for the work all civil and public servants have done and the Minister, rightly, has put the emphasis on the lower paid.<\/p> <p>Oireachtas Members are public servants and our pay is linked to a pay grade within the public services.  Deputies are linked to principal officers, Senators are linked to Deputies and councillors are linked to Senators.  The independence of that link is valuable and it should be retained rather than going down the road of a commission that would evaluate the work of public servants.  As Senator Mooney noted, there is a danger in asking for the work that is done by Oireachtas Members to be appropriately recognised.  The best thing is to have a link with the public service generally.  The work we do is a public service role and that is where it rightly belongs.  As I said, the sentiment behind the amendments is understandable but it is also misplaced.  We are public servants and we, like others, have given up of our salaries.

They are not employees but officers, a role for which they get a miserable &euro;16,000 per year.  For 33% of them, it is the only income they have, but they are being hit with pension levy, universal social charge, tax and so on.

I sit in this House alongside people who can work in the private sector and earn up to &euro;100,000 on top of their Senator's salary.<\/p> <p>There is something very wrong with the way in which we balance things in this country.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

Both he and I know that we are approaching an election and it is likely that some senior Government people will lose their seats.  When they waive this, will it be underpinned by some form of statutory instrument so they cannot come back and say they have changed their minds, are no longer waiving it and would like to have it included their pensions?  Is that the case?  Is it that waiver voluntary for as long as one wants it to be but not thereafter?<br\/><br\/>We sought some small changes to the Bill.  One of such change, as I pointed out, imposed no cost whatsoever but it was ruled out of order, which is totally unacceptable.  I complimented the Minister the other day, and will do so again, on the Lansdowne Road agreement and on the Haddington Road agreement, in which I was involved.  As far as I am concerned, and as distasteful and all as the agreements were for those at the receiving end, the agreements were without doubt the saving of this country at the time they were brought in.  The Minister took a huge political risk when he brought them in and I commend him for doing so.  I hold him in the highest esteem but we have got it slightly wrong in this case.  I have found myself having to walk a thin tightrope because many of my trade union colleagues will benefit significantly from this, which is commendable.  However, there are a few who are outside of the frame.  None of them is looking for money but rather negotiation on things like flexible hours in universities.  It was a bit disingenuous of the Minister the other day to discount the 78 hours given up by lecturers in institutes of technology as just 78 hours.  We both know that those 78 hours have found their way into the <i>de facto<\/i>timetable which means people work far in excess of 78 hours.  My colleague, Senator Healy Eames, has estimated that there is four hours per hour of delivery.  The 78 hours have become delivery hours, so it is a substantial number of hours.<br\/><br\/>Colleagues in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have taken great exception to the fact the Minister has discounted the 30 hours they gave through the Haddington Road agreement.  It has been thrown away; it is at the bottom of the scale and it is not considered that important.  I want some form of guarantee that senior Ministers, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste will not benefit from this.  We need to look at cases where people in this House have sizeable incomes outside it.  Decent people gave their lives to this country and have taken massive cuts in their pensions and yet those who have lived a fairly comfortable life through the public service, including public representatives at the top of the public service scale, will benefit to the tune of more than the pension payable to the people at the bottom.  That shows there is something terribly wrong with this.<br\/><br\/>I want to see the Lansdowne Road agreement agreed, over the line and working.  The colleagues I left behind in the teaching profession do not want money.  Instead, they want somebody to sit down and discuss their concerns, which is not a lot to ask.  The Minister could say today that he will see to it that happens.  I also want my colleagues who are not on a full salary to be looked after.  The other day I gave the Minister the example of the teacher on &euro;23,500 who will not benefit from this.  If his or her next door neighbour who is a civil servant on &euro;23,500, he or she will get all of the benefit because, unfortunately, the teacher, or casualised public servant, does not get any benefit from the pay rise <i>per se<\/i>because it is based on the salary for the scale and not the income of the individual, a matter which needs to be addressed.  The Minister said he would address any anomalies if we specify them to him.  I am having the costings done on those scenarios and I will send them to the Minister, who I believe will try to resolve them.  I see a situation where we will probably finish up with 50 different points on every salary scale in the public service where casualised people are employed.  I do not want to trip this up but I need some serious answers which will allow me to support the legislation in some way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#R00500","speaker":"1196","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Has Senator Brennan indicated a wish to speak?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#S00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>No, I am just a keen listener.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#S00300","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":155,"content":"<p>We had a fairly good and open debate here on Tuesday.

As it stands, a huge number of pensioners will not have full restoration of pension under the FEMPI Bill and some have estimated that up to half of retired pensioners will be affected.  The Minister can clarify if the estimate is wrong because that is the whole purpose of a debate.

The Government has implemented a lot of cuts and brought about considerable change which should be enunciated and acknowledged.  The cuts were progressive, with those earning less than &euro;65,000 protected.  The pay of Senators was reduced by only a small amount.<\/p> <p>Many colleagues have spoken about councillors, but they were not affected by the cuts because they were not earning more than &euro;65,000 per year.  They would love to be earning even &euro;30,000, but they are actually in receipt of &euro;16,000 per annum.  Their wages were cut in accordance with the terms of the local government reorganisation.  They now travel more, but they are paid less.  When I was a councillor back in 1991, I was able to fulfil my role while holding down a full-time job.  However, when I was elected mayor, I had to give up my job.  I probably could have continued to do both, but I could not have done either of them right.  As a Senator, one must be here and if one cannot, one must make sure someone will stand in.  There are both full-time and part-time Senators in this House, but I contend one cannot be in two places at once.  <\/p> <p>On the issue of the restoration of pay for public servants, legal issues may arise with the differentiation between elected and non-elected public servants.  Under the Regulation of Lobbying Act, county councillors are defined as public office holders and designated as having to report on A, B and C.

It is a full-time job and many councillors cannot take up other full-time employment.  They have to accept part-time employment if they want to serve those who elected them well.  One could take on a full-time job if one simply signed in as a councillor and did not take the role seriously.  That is possible, but most councillors are totally committed to performing their role.  <\/p> <p>As I said, I would have no problem with delaying the restoration of pay and pensions for politicians and Ministers.  However, I ask that the Minister facilitate teachers, although I must declare a conflict of interest because my husband is a teacher.  It is important that I declare such a conflict of interest as it could be argued I stand to benefit from the legislation we are discussing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#U00500","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":192,"content":"<p>This is a difficult set of amendments to which to respond because not only were many of the contributions not germane to the amendments, they were not even germane to the Bill.  Senators spoke with passion, but some of the issues raised were well outside the remit of my ministry.  However, I will do my best to address them.<\/p> <p>I will begin in a pedestrian manner by speaking to the amendments.  All of the amendments boil down to one issue, namely, that nobody in receipt of a salary above &euro;65,000 should receive one cent by way of pay restoration.  That is what the amendments are about.  The first amendment in the group provides for this, while the remainder are not necessary because there is no point in saying nobody earning more than &euro;100,000 should have his or her pay restored because we have already said nobody earning more than &euro;65,000 should enjoy pay restoration.  Equally, there is no point in saying Ministers should not benefit from pay restoration for the same reason.  I do not agree with this.  <\/p> <p>We have structured the reductions in a very progressive way.  The only reductions in pay the Government of which I am a member introduced for the public service - there were two reductions before our time in office under previous FEMPI legislation - were for those earning more than &euro;65,000.  As part of the negotiated settlement, namely, the Haddington Road agreement, with which Senator Gerard P. Craughwell, in particular, will be familiar, the pay-back period was an intrinsic part of the settlement presented by the Labour Relations Commission and endorsed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Government.  I am not going to come before the House and accept a recommendation to break the terms of that agreement because that would completely undermine the basis for engagement with any union in the future.  I do not recall any political party asking for such a straightforward reneging on a solemn agreement.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Brendan Howlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=535\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=535&amp;amp;pid=BrendanHowlin&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Members might also recall that even the reductions in salaries above &euro;65,000 were carried out on a progressive basis, ranging from 5.5% to 10%.  The higher the pay, the greater was the impact.  The Lansdowne Road agreement was the restoration element of it.  That agreement is exclusively about restoration to the lower paid.  Obviously, everybody gets something, but it is focused on the lower paid.  On a percentage basis it hugely advantages the lower paid, as I promised it would do.  That point is acknowledged by Senator Craughwell.  However, I cannot ignore a pre-existing agreement, the Haddington Road agreement, which is what Senator Reilly is taking into account.<\/p><p>I will move to the more contentious issue of whether politicians should be excluded.  There is a school of thought that if we all had sackcloth and ashes and went out on the plinth to flagellate ourselves, it would not be enough.  I respect the business of politics, and I am sorry Senator Norris is not here at present.  I am also in the business of hoping people will get involved in politics and get a decent living from it in a fair way, so they can afford to pay their way and maintain their families.  I am a member of the Labour Party and I am mindful of the fact that one of the first measures sought by the Labour Party in Britain, when it was first elected to parliament early in the 20th century, was to have salaries for Members of Parliament, so it would not be an exclusive club for the landed gentry or the barristers, with all due respect to the barristers present, who could breeze in after hours.  When I was first elected to the Oireachtas, the sitting hours were often designed to suit some of the professions, so its members could come to the Houses after hours.<\/p><p>That is not how a modern parliament works.  Modern parliaments work on the basis of having decent remuneration appropriate to the skills set demanded for the job.  Certainly, I would be interested to see the salary scales of the people I have been negotiating with in the trade union movement for the last time.  There were many blanks in the newspapers yesterday, but perhaps we will find out what everybody is paid in the future.  Transparency should be part of all of this.<\/p><p>Some people perceive that there is a political advantage in making that argument.  It is not one that I make.  It is actually protected by a more fundamental argument.  Reducing people's pay or pension is an extraordinarily exceptional measure.  As I have said repeatedly, it can only be justified by a set of circumstances, one of which is the existence of a financial emergency.  That is the reason all of the legislation that does these things is called financial emergency legislation.  Please God, and I am confident the day is not far away, there will be no justification for an emergency.  This legislation will end entirely, and there will be full pay restoration for everybody when that day arrives.  This matter has been repeatedly-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#U00600","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Will that include the increment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#V00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>No, not what was foregone.  However, from the date of the ending of the emergency and the certification of that, there will be full restoration.  I was mindful of that when early this year I set about negotiating an orderly unwinding rather than a sudden unwinding, which would be catastrophic for the State.  The cost of losing the measures that are implicit in the FEMPI suite of legislation is &euro;2.2 billion per annum.  If I was asked to pony up that amount of money to restore pay for pensioners and public servants right now, I would have to find it by cutting services.  That is not a way I could possibly go.  It was on the basis of having that dialogue in negotiation with the trade union movement, which fully accepted and understood this, that we have reached a situation where we have a negotiated agreement.<\/p> <p>Not only must the financial emergency continue to exist for this legislation to be valid, I am legally advised that there are also other criteria.  One is that it must have general application.  In other words, it cannot be arbitrary.  I cannot decide that I do not like a certain category of public servants, so they will be excluded from any pay restoration or will have particular cuts.  That is what the Senator is doing.  Legally, that would not last jig-time in the courts.  Imagine saying to the judge that the Minister has taken it upon himself to be selective about individuals in respect of pay restoration or, in the first instance, pay cuts.  It must have general application across a negotiated agreement.  That is the reason we couched it in a formal negotiated agreement, agreed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.<\/p> <p>There are a number of other issues, some of which have nothing to do with the Bill, but I will do my best to respond.  One of them is pension restoration.  We intend to deal with pension restoration separately.  We are dealing with pay restoration in this suite of measures.  Under this Bill when it becomes operable, and we have tabled an earlier signature motion so it can have effect from 1 January next, there will be three restoration payments in terms of pensions alone - one on 1 January 2016, one on 1 January 2017 and one on 1 January 2018.  It is a 24 month period.  At the end of that period everybody who has a pension of up to &euro;34,152 will have full restoration.  That is 80% of all public sector pensioners.  Everybody will have some restoration.  To deal with the specific point made by Senator Healy Eames, if somebody is on &euro;35,000 or &euro;36,000 they will get their &euro;34,152 as the impact is the same as on everybody else.  It might be more helpful if I give the figures.  Up to the level of &euro;34,152 there is no further pension reduction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#V00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112600002#V00400","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1448533800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>On &euro;35,000, one currently has a deduction of &euro;2,280.
