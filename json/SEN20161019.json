Roscommon has drawn three of the Commencement matters today, which shows how active are Roscommon Senators.  There is also one from Mayo.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to resolve the outrageous circumstance in which a two-year old child is being pursued for &euro;100 by Intrum Justitia for attending the accident and emergency department at Portiuncula Hospital in November 2015.  Like all children under six years of age, this child from Roscommon town has a GP visiting card.  Her parents' income is just &euro;400 per week.  She was rushed to the accident and emergency service at Portiuncula Hospital last November.  Unfortunately, as the Minister of State knows, we have no accident and emergency service in Roscommon at the moment thanks to a decision taken by Senator Reilly when he was Minister for Health in the Fine Gael Government in 2011.  Her distressed mother phoned Westdoc when her daughter took ill in the middle of the night last November.  The Westdoc personnel told her to give the child Calpol, which the child then vomited up.  Her temperature continued to rise.  It was the middle of the night and Westdoc told her to go and get Nurofen.  No shops were open locally which sold Nurofen and the Westdoc personnel said there was nothing else they could do.  The family then drove to Portiuncula Hospital to seek immediate medical attention for their very ill child.<\/p> <p>The Westdoc doctor should have seen a child whose temperature was rising out of control and who was vomiting.  Had a Westdoc doctor seen her and been unable to address her symptoms, he or she would have signed a letter for the accident and emergency department exempting her from any charge.  As a former chairman of the Western Health Board, I find it morally wrong that a two-year old child, who is covered under the GP visit card and was not provided with a service by Westdoc, is now receiving threatening letters from Intrum Justitia in respect of legal action on a bill of &euro;100.  It is an international company and I have named already the directors from Sweden and elsewhere.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Terry Leyden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=636\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is an international company and I have already named its directors who are from Sweden and elsewhere.  This issue must be resolved immediately for the family concerned and an assurance given that all children under six attending accident and emergency departments will not be billed and their families pursued by a legal debt collection agency.  <\/p><p>It should be noted that the child in question had to be brought to Portiuncula Hospital as the accident and emergency department for Roscommon town which was located in Roscommon hospital was closed by the last Fine Gael-led Government weeks after taking office in the summer of 2011, despite promises delivered in the square of the town to keep the department open.  The current situation is totally inadequate and unacceptable to the people of Roscommon and surrounding areas who have had no accident and emergency services at Roscommon County Hospital, now known as Roscommon University Hospital.  The name was changed but the hospital did not have its status improved.  The HSE has failed to deliver a rapid response ambulance service in County Roscommon which was promised since the wrongful closure of the accident and emergency department five years ago.<\/p><p>The family to which I refer then received a letter from Saolta requesting the money.  When I was chairman of the former Western Health Board and such issues came before me, I would have dealt with them more pragmatically, especially given the fact that the family made the effort to contact WestDoc but that service would not see the child and would not give the family a referral letter.  Indeed, WestDoc could have supplied such a letter retrospectively, pointing out that the family had contacted the service.  The family made an effort to contact a GP before attending the accident and emergency department at Portiuncula Hospital.  Given the circumstances, this matter should be resolved and the fee waived.  Frankly, the bill has been sent to the child but the child is only two years old and does not have &euro;100.  The family is simply not in a position to pay it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#A00500","speaker":"1393","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Leyden for the opportunity to address the House on this matter.<\/p> <p>First, it is important to point out that it is not appropriate for me to comment on any individual or specific case.  However, I have been advised that this issue has been resolved favourably for the people involved.  I cannot go into any more detail in that regard.<\/p> <p>Regarding charges for attendance at emergency departments, there is a statutory fee of &euro;100.  This fee is payable by patients who do not have a medical card and who attend an emergency department without a referral letter from a GP.  The fee is, of course, applicable to a patient's first visit as part of an episode of care but patients with medical cards do not have pay this fee.  It is important to remember that this fee for presenting at and emergency department is the only outpatient charge currently payable in our public hospital system.<\/p> <p>Expanding and utilising primary care services to best effect is a core element of an integrated approach to alleviating pressures on our emergency departments.  There are now 13 community intervention teams in place and in the first half of 2016, these have reduced hospital bed requirements by approximately 73 beds per day.  A total of 92 primary care centres have opened with a further 39 at the preliminary stages of development.  A project to increase access to diagnostic services in GP surgeries is currently delivering approximately 1,300 ultrasound scans per month while the GP minor surgery pilot project has delivered just over 4,200 procedures since commencement.  Also, in the first half of 2016 usage of out of hours GP services increased by 14% over 2015.  In September the HSE published the winter initiative 2016-17 which provides &euro;40 million of additional funding for winter preparedness.  Under this initiative, community intervention team services are being expanded in four regions and the availability of aids and appliances in primary care has been increased to facilitate patients being discharged from hospital back to their own homes.  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE to develop and expand primary care services but also to ensure that these services work effectively in order to reduce the necessity for patients to attend emergency departments.  <\/p> <p>Without going into the details of the particular case referred to by the Senator, we must make sure that when doctors or nurses on call feel that they can fast track a patient to the appropriate care, that is taken into account and the charges are not applied.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to highlight what is an extremely important issue for many rural communities.  No one has ever denied that the turf cutting ban has been very difficult for all concerned.  Despite this, I and many other stakeholders were determined, at the beginning of the term of the last Government, to work long and hard to address in a meaningful way the challenges posed by the EU Habitats Directive for turf cutting communities, especially in the special areas of conservation, SACs.<\/p> <p>I was one of the first politicians to travel to Brussels to meet the relevant EU Commissioner in order to highlight the impact of the turf cutting ban on those affected.  I went there with Mr. Conor Skehan, Deputies Paul Connaughton and Martin Heydon and Councillor Jimmy McClearn from Galway to meet the Commissioner, Mr. Janez Poto&egrave;nik.  We told him that a new Government had just been formed and that the situation regarding the Habitats Directive was very serious.  Mr. Skehan pointed out that there had been a ten-year derogation and that all we wanted was another six months.  We were absolutely shocked when Mr. Poto&egrave;nik and his officials said, \"What derogation?\".  The Fianna F&aacute;il Government had decided that this issue was so explosive that they would tell the people that there was a derogation and they could continue to cut turf.  At the same time, solicitors' letters were coming from Europe.  We were absolutely shocked.  Indeed, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v admitted in the D&aacute;il a few months later that Fianna F&aacute;il thought there was a derogation but then found out that there was not.  It was a shameful way to deal with one of the most important issues in rural Ireland at the time.  <\/p> <p>I am glad that the Government of which I was a member dealt with the issue.  As part of my campaign on behalf of rural communities, I called for an independent commission and was very glad that this call was heard and a mediation process, in the form of the Peatlands Council, was established.  I believe the council and the setting up of the peatlands forum allowed the genuine views and concerns of the turf cutting communities to be taken on board in a formal manner.  All of this ultimately led to the setting up of a compensation and relocation scheme for turf cutters affected by the Habitats Directive.  One of my primary objectives throughout the whole process was to make sure that those affected would be financially recompensed and thankfully that happened.<\/p> <p>In my own region, I fought for and helped to deliver compensation for more than 1,000 turf cutting families.  That equates to a sum of &euro;23,000, tax free, to each turf cutter over a 15 year period.  That is a huge amount of money for people in Roscommon, east Galway and other areas.  There are other counties that do not have SACs and they wish they were part of this compensation scheme.  I understand that this issue has been considered for more than four years.  It is also important to remember that the concerns of turf cutters wishing to relocate to other bogs were duly recognised by the Department.  These turf cutters received a one-off payment of &euro;500 and are also entitled to receive 15 tonnes of turf each year until the relocation bog is ready.<\/p> <p>Today I would like to take the opportunity to ask the Minister for an up to date appraisal of the turf cutters' compensation scheme and the related bog relocation scheme.  The latter is more complex, as everyone will acknowledge.  These schemes have recognised the genuine concerns of the affected communities who have been carrying on the turf cutting tradition for generations.  To conclude, I would like to pay tribute to all the stakeholders, particularly the turf cutting community which understood that the last Government was forced to deal with a very difficult legacy issue but came up with practical solutions for those affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#B00700","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Feighan for putting down this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  I commend Senator Feighan for his work in regard to the turf cutting compensation scheme and the relocation scheme in recent years.  I want to acknowledge the work of the last Government in sorting out a mess that was left behind.  There was a debate in the D&aacute;il last night where similar sentiments were heard from the Opposition that the last Government had tackled something that had been left unresolved for a number of years.<\/p> <p>Since 2011 huge efforts have been made to solve the issue of the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation within the framework of the EU habitats directive.  This has included intense and ongoing engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and the European Commission.  In addition, a long-term compensation scheme has been introduced to compensate cutters for their loss arising from the cessation.  This cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme comprises a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked for 15 years, or relocation to a non-designated bog, where feasible, together with a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500.  Over 3,200 applications have been received and the total expenditure under the scheme amounts to in the region of &euro;19 million.  Some 11,086 annual payments, 1,649 once-off incentive payments of &euro;500 and 896 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of these applications.<\/p> <p>The Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network, published in January 2014, concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network.  The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 has been presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and published.  Its purpose is to provide for the implementation of a reconfiguration of the natural heritage area network arising from the 2014 review.  The cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme has been extended to land owners and turbary rights holders affected by the proposals arising from the natural heritage area review.  Some 246 applications have been received under the scheme and 342 annual payments have been made at a cost of just over &euro;525,000 to applicants from these sites.  Thirteen once-off incentive payments have also been made in respect of these sites.<\/p> <p>Details in regard to the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme for each raised bog site are available on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.  The county or counties in which each bog is located are also shown.  I  am making available to the House a table illustrating the amount of compensation paid under the scheme on a county by county basis.  Some 633 applicants to the cessation of turf cuffing compensation scheme have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog.  My Department has written to over 400 turf cutters seeking expressions of interest in relocation to specific non-designated sites.<\/p> <p>The relocation of turf cutters is a complex process.  Notwithstanding the complexity involved, 62 turf cutters have been accommodated on non-designated bogs in counties Offaly and Galway.  For a number of special areas of conservation, the relocation site identified may not be suitable or may not have the capacity to cater for the number of turf cutters who may wish to relocate there.  In such cases, my Department, in consultation with turf culling interests, is considering the available options in terms of relocation and the provisions of Article 6 of the habitats directive.  The national raised bog SAC management plan will set out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed.  The measures to address these needs include financial compensation, relocation to non-designated bogs and considering the possible utilisation of the provisions of Article 6 of the habitats directive.<\/p> <p>There has been a significant reduction in turf cutting activity on the 53 raised bog special areas of conservation since the cessation of turf cutting has come into effect on these sites.  Final resolution of all issues in regard to the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s protected raised bogs will only be brought about by everyone working together, within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established for the purpose of ensuring input from all stakeholders.<\/p> <p>I have provided a table for Senator Feighan highlighting the amounts paid to different counties.  There is some overlap, given some bogs overlap county boundaries, and the table reflects this.  He will see there are payments of &euro;22,815 for Roscommon; &euro;695,000 for Galway-Roscommon; &euro;17,000 for Longford-Roscommon; &euro;220,000 for Galway-Roscommon-Sligo; and &euro;2,536,000 for Roscommon-Longford-Westmeath; and a sum total of &euro;19,881,602.35.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#C00100","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The details are that the sum is possibly more than people would have anticipated.  A sum of &euro;19,881,000 is a significant amount going into rural communities in lieu of the cessation.  It demonstrates the commitment of Government to those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog conservation areas.<\/p> <p>The majority of those who were active on these sites are remaining in the scheme.  Engagement with turf cutting interests continues with a view to resolving the issues relating to the raised bog special areas of conservation.  As I said, the national raised bog conservation management plan was developed arising from a motion in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in March 2012 which was supported by the D&aacute;il.  This is in line with A Programme for a Partnership Government, which outlines that the Government recognises that domestic turf cutters have a traditional right to cut turf, a right which is balanced with the conservation objectives and legal obligations of the State.<\/p> <p>I would again state that, having inherited an economic and financial mess in 2011, we also inherited a mess in regard to bogs and what had not been done.

The school is in a rural area with dispersed national schools.  Every other school in the vicinity has DEIS status, which means they get certain educational supports so children can come through their education with a fair chance in life.  Inver national school meets all the DEIS criteria, such as high unemployment, low wages and low academic standards, which it shares with the other national schools in the area.<\/p> <p>This has been going on for 11 years.  If DEIS means anything, and if we can have confidence in it supporting people in educational disadvantage and social disadvantage, something needs to be done now.  The Minister of State could be the person to do that.  The reality is that this school had disadvantaged status up to 2005.

The school has to pay twice the amount for visiting experts and workshops than every other primary school in the area.  How can this be acceptable?

Will the Minister of State and his senior Minister stand over and ameliorate one outstanding source of division, which is the discrimination the children in Inver national school have experienced for the past 11 years?  There can only be one answer because other than that, the benefits of DEIS will mean nothing.  Over the years, successive Ministers have lauded and praised the success of DEIS in promoting school attendance, general well-being, mental health, and outcomes with children staying in school longer.  This community and these children should be given a chance.  It is an exceptional case through no fault of their own.  The principal who was charged with taking care of these children failed to do their duty.  This cannot be left to civil servants.  Action has to be taken by the Minister of the day.  Successive Ministers have failed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#C00400","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>As the Senator may be aware, an extensive identification process to select schools for inclusion in DEIS was conducted in 2005.  This process took the form of an invitation to schools to apply to participate in the programme by way of a completed survey of their pupil cohort.   This is new to me but she is correct that a number of reminders were issued to the school in question by my Department, a completed survey form was not received and, therefore, it could not be assessed for participation in the programme.  Departmental officials say those are the criteria they laid down; I did not lay them down.  They say on a number of occasions they contacted the school.  Further, an appeal mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the DEIS programme, but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage sufficient to warrant their inclusion.  lnver national school did not participate in that process.  I do not know if the Senator is aware of that.  I accept there is a difficulty with the school and based on what she has said, it should probably be included in the programme.  Officials say reminders were sent on two occasions and the school did not participate in the process.  The Department has no information about the school, apart from that furnished by Members when raising the issue in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.<\/p> <p>Many representations were made to my predecessors on behalf of this school seeking its inclusion in DEIS.  These representations were unsuccessful.  No schools which were unsuccessful in the initial identification and subsequent review processes were ever admitted Into the DEIS programme.  As the Senator may also be aware, a process to review DEIS, which began last year, is almost complete and it is my intention to publish a new plan for educational inclusion before the end of this year.  The review is examining all aspects of DEIS, including the range and impact of different elements of the school support programme, and the potential for innovation within and between schools and its scope for increased integration of services provided by other Departments and agencies.<\/p> <p>No new school has been included in DEIS since 2009, but now a new assessment framework is being developed using centrally held CSO and DES data for the identification of new schools for inclusion.  The number of schools to be included in the programme will be determined by this proposed new identification process, which will assess all schools in the country, including those not currently participating.  It is important to note that it will not be necessary under this new arrangement - this may solve the problem for the Senator - for schools to make an application as all schools, including Inver national school, will be automatically assessed.  The school will not have to apply for the new assessment and it appears, based on the school's history and the Senator's contribution, it will be included.  That could be sorted following the automatic assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#D00200","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

This is a health and financial policy issue, because tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in Ireland and is an enormous strain on our health system.  We always want to see the NTMA generate a significant income for the taxpayer through prudent and strategic investments.  The strategic investment fund has a statutory mandate to invest on a commercial basis, and I fully acknowledge the independence of the NTMA in carrying out its important work.  The long-term strategic investment of taxpayers' money is something that can and should be done professionally and devoid of political interference.<\/p> <p>My Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, Deputies Sean Fleming and Michael McGrath, have previously raised this broad issue on ethical investment with the Minister of Finance and the CEO of the NTMA, Mr. Conor O'Kelly.  We know from the NTMA's most recent annual report that the State held more than &euro;7.2 million in quoted equity and debt instruments for Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and other major tobacco firms.  This is incredible and is part of almost &euro;35 million of taxpayers' money invested in the alcohol, tobacco, aerospace and defence industries.<\/p> <p>I wish to concentrate on the tobacco companies for health and financial reasons.  A detailed study, an assessment of the economic cost of smoking in Ireland, was produced by the Department of Health in 2016.  The estimated cost of smoking on the health care system is more than &euro;500 million per year.  This is made up of direct costs in three areas.  These are hospital-based costs of &euro;211 million, primary care costs amounting to an enormous sum of &euro;256 million, which could solve our primary care crisis at least five times over, and domiciliary costs of &euro;40 million.  It is estimated that approximately 6,000 people are killed annually by smoking.  This is equivalent to the population of an entire town such as Bandon in County Cork, Westport in County Mayo, Kells in County Meath or Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary.  The direct cost of &euro;500 million year does not include lost productivity from ill-health and other huge drains on our public services.  Department of Health data from three years ago shows an average cost of &euro;5,400 every time a smoker was admitted to hospital with a tobacco-related illness, for example chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD.  In 2013, which is the most recent year for which I have statistics, there were 31,000 such admissions at &euro;5,400 per admission.  This does not include the primary or GP care costs and associated costs such as medication.<\/p> <p>I am aware that investment by the NTMA in specific companies is made through fund managers, lest it be suggested the NTMA actively seeks to invest in such companies.  However, it is the case that over the summer, the NTMA CEO told the Committee of Public Accounts that armaments is the NTMA's only restricted investment category.  In 2015, information made available by the Minister for Finance outlined that the strategic investment fund has excluded 14 companies from its investments.  These companies are not named, but it beggars belief the Irish taxpayer still has &euro;7.2 million in equity and debt instruments in tobacco giants such as Philip Morris and British American Tobacco.  In case anyone has forgotten, these are some of the same companies that threatened to sue my Seanad colleague, Senator James Reilly, and his successor as Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for doing their job.<\/p> <p>This area is above party or partisan politics.  We all need to address it and provide leadership on it.  When he was Minister with responsibility for health, Fianna F&aacute;il leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, led the way in pioneering our move in Ireland towards a tobacco free society with the ban on workplace smoking.  Other countries followed suit once they saw the success it was having.  The area of ethical investment is another area in which we should take the lead because while wholly independent, the strategic investment fund's investment policy is set out by the National Treasury Management Agency Act 2014.  According to the Minister for Finance, the strategy is determined, monitored and kept under review in accordance with the Act.  This is the basis for my call for a process to be put in place to put investment in tobacco companies on the list of prescribed investments.<\/p> <p>I struggle to understand how holding equity and debt instruments in such companies is in keeping with what various Ministers said regarding their intention to establish the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  Former Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, spoke on Second Stage of the legislation in 2014.  He stated, \"The intention is that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, will channel its resources towards productive investment in the Irish economy and leverage its resources with private sector co-investment and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#E00300","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Swanick for raising the matter of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, commonly referred to as the ISIF, and certain investments made by that fund.  I raised this issue as an area of concern in the previous D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>By way of introduction and context, it is helpful to consider the evolution of the ISIF's investment portfolio.  On the 22 December 2014, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, transitioned to the ISIF.  The ISIF has a statutory double bottom line mandate to invest on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment creation in Ireland.  Certain shareholdings which were inherited from the NPRF and which are in companies based outside Ireland are held in the ISIF's global portfolio.  The global portfolio has undergone significant restructuring since 2014 and is being sold, over time, to fund Irish investment commitments as they arise.  This approach provides capital for investment in Ireland.<\/p> <p>The ISIF commits to reviewing all of its investments for exposures to sectors and-or companies with potentially controversial business exposures and associated reputational risks, to ensure they are addressed and mitigated as appropriate.  I can inform the Senator that the ISIF currently has equity holdings in four companies operating in the brewers, distillers and vintners category.  These investments have a value of &euro;3 million.  The ISIF also has equity holdings in three tobacco companies.  These investments have a value of &euro;1.6 million.  As of 30 August 2016, these alcohol and tobacco investments in total represent 0.06% of the lSlF's total assets.  These investments are within the ISIF's global portfolio.  They are legacy investments inherited from its predecessor, the NPRF.  These investments do not form part of the ISIF's new mandate, which was formed at the time of its establishment in December 2014.<\/p> <p>Such investments should be considered in the context of the broader portfolio of the fund and the fund's commitment to responsible investment.  The ISIF's mandate is aligned with sustainability principles, in terms of investment opportunities and risk management.  The fund recently published its sustainability and responsible investment policy, which is available on its website.  The fund operates to high international standards and invests in line with the UN-sponsored principles for responsible investment, which focus on the management of environmental, social and governance factors to improve sustainability of investment returns, and the Santiago principles, which are the globally accepted best practice principles for sovereign investment funds such as the ISIF.  The fund implements its sustainability and responsible investment policy in a number of ways, but primarily by focusing on the integration of environmental, social and governance factors into its investment decision making pre-investment; and by being an engaged and active owner of its investments to positively influence companies.<\/p> <p>Exclusion has not been part of the fund's responsible investment strategy, with the only exclusions from the fund being mandated by legislation.  To date, the Cluster Munitions And Anti-Personnel Mines Act 2008 is the only relevant legislation, and the ISIF operates a prohibited securities list of 14 companies on this basis.  There is currently no basis for tobacco or alcohol exclusions in legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The ISIF has committed to a review of its exclusionary policy.

A review of the ISIF exclusionary policy is under way and is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2017.  The review of the ISIF exclusionary policy is under way separate to the ISIF investment strategy review.  Given the new and unique mandate of ISIF as a sovereign development fund, and because of the uncertainty regarding the investment opportunities in Ireland, it was agreed at the time of the establishment of ISIF in December 2014 that a formal review of the ISIF investment strategy would take place after 18 months.  This allows for a sufficient period of time having elapsed before considering the operations and impact of the fund. <\/p><p>I am informed by ISIF that preparatory work in respect of this formal review of its investment strategy has commenced and the review is due to be completed by the end of 2016.  The review will include an appraisal of the success of ISIF's mandate to date.  The NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014 provides that ownership of the fund vests with the Minister for Finance.  It also provides that the fund shall, in reviewing its investment strategy, consult the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The review of the ISIF will be conducted in accordance with these provisions.  In addition, the legislation provides that the Minister for Finance may consult with other Government Ministers, as appropriate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#E00400","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

It was also an attempt to build a framework through which we could include other types of ethical investments and to address the need for certain divestments on an ethical basis.  Issues being considered in the context of the review include what exclusions should be contained in the policy of the new fund as it moves away from legacy investments into new investments as per legislation.

The Irish health system is pockmarked by the failures of the service itself and of politicians in terms of devising systems that do not work.  In 2013, we highlighted that in the House with the recall of the Seanad to discuss organ donation.  In one calendar year, 65 people on our organ donor waiting lists will die.  Currently, there are 650 people waiting for liver, lung and heart transplants, of whom one in ten will die waiting.  Other countries have systems that work to the point where they actually have an excess of donated organs.  It has nothing to do with the generosity of the Irish people; it is simply a systems failure.  Not only that, if we improved our system, it would save the taxpayer money.  As the Leader knows, the cost of dialysis over a ten-year period is almost &euro;325 million.  Every organ transplant put in place would save money.<\/p> <p>The issue I raise specifically today relates to the Orkambi drug therapy for cystic fibrosis.  The genetic profile of the Irish population means that Ireland has the highest rate in the western world of people who suffer with cystic fibrosis and who carry the gene which leads to that condition.  Orkambi has transformed lives.  There are a number of people who are on a trial of this drug therapy and the Government is carrying out a review of that.  The cystic fibrosis website has welcomed the review, which is the second or third so far.  Not all of the 500 cystic fibrosis sufferers in Ireland will benefit from the therapy, but it appears that the majority will.  Research from the British Management Institute has outlined that every report commissioned by a Government Department over 20 years has ended up agreeing with that Department's initial viewpoint.  It is the case that he who pays the piper calls the tune.  We are not, therefore, hopeful about the outcome of the Orkambi review.  We realise the drug is expensive.  Everybody understands that.  However, the transformation in the lives of those who benefit from it is enormous.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to find an answer to the question.  We have had debates on this in the House.  The former Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, attended the House to discuss the review.

These are qualified staff who must stay overnight due to the type of work they doing, in some cases in 24 hour shifts.  Some of them are on duty for seven days but there are broken shifts.  Prior to 2004, most of these people were receiving no remuneration because they were sleeping on the premises at night, which was considered inactive activity.  They are key, trained care workers.  There are issues here of child safety and health and safety more generally.  There are a range of reasons for which people must stay overnight, supervise and be there for vulnerable people who are in their charge.  It is very disappointing to read in our national newspapers this morning the suggestion that the Department of Health should write to the Government to ask it to hold back.

I have nothing against Seetec, but it is a company that is based in Essex in the UK.  One of my questions to the Department of Social Protection is if we had a choice in the matter of social welfare and job activation being privatised or was it an instruction from the EU? I believe our Government had a choice in the matter.  It is basically saying that the local employment services, LES, and Intreo were not able to do their job and did not have the resources to do their job properly.

For example, if somebody living in Belmullet is taken randomly off the social welfare list and is instructed to take up a position which may be up to one hour away in Castlebar or in Ballina, they do not have a choice the in matter.  The only payment they would be given is to keep the social welfare payment.  How much would that person then be given in travel allowance?  It says there are travel supports available but there are no set out travel costs available.  If a person is required to travel for up to one hour to a position, if they do not have the option of public transport then they have the cost of getting a car and insurance, including meeting the rising cost of motor insurance.  It is grossly unfair to do that and will end of costing people.<\/p> <p>It is also said that there are supports for child care costs but again there is ambiguity around that and how much people would get for child care.  If it is decided to grant a child care allowance to them can that be given to a relative or to somebody who is a non-registered childminder? Again, there is no answer to that and it is at the discretion of the Department of Social Protection.  I asked the Department if the person concerned has mental health difficulties will the Department accept a letter from a mental health practitioner or a GP to say that this person is not fit to travel or to take up that position?  Again, I could not get any answers to that.<\/p> <p>I am gravely concerned about the destruction being caused to people who are being forced onto these schemes just to take them off social welfare and to massage the figures so that the Government can say that another person has been taken off social welfare or that they have been put on a boat or a plane and are no longer our responsibility.  It is a matter of urgency.  I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Social Protection to the House to answer some of those questions. There are already dozens of complaints lodged about JobPath.  Of course it is not only JobPath, it is also about many other schemes into which people are being forced or about their payments being cut completely, which is the nub of the problem.  People are then dependent on St. Vincent de Paul to provide a roof over their head or to provide them with food for the week.  It is wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#H00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I call for a debate in the House on Ireland's response to the Syrian crisis and in particular our plans to help the child refugees who are fleeing Syria alone.  This issue has been raised by other Members of the House, including by Senator Ray Butler last week.  Night after night on television we watch helplessly the heartache of ordinary people.  These people are like us and we wonder what we can do.  There is something we agreed to do this time last year.  Ireland agreed to take 4,000 refugees in the wake of what has been the biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War.  In establishing the Irish refugee protection programme, The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald highlighted the plight of unaccompanied children and she promised that special arrangements would be put in place to help these children.<\/p><p>However, in the year to 19 September, despite the promised special effort, Ireland has only accepted one child according to the Ombudsman for Children.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported recently that Ireland has agreed to accept a further 20 children by the end of 2016.  Over 109 unaccompanied children have applied for asylum in the EU since the beginning of 2015.  We can do so much better than helping just 21 children.  Given Ireland's painful history with emigration and famine, it is so disappointing that we have not stepped up to the mark.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald said in the D&aacute;il last year, &quot;Ireland has always lived up to its international humanitarian obligations&quot; and that the Government is fully committed to playing its part in addressing the current crisis.  We need urgent action to live up to this promise, especially for vulnerable children.  I would be grateful if the Leader could invite the Minister to the House to lay out her plans as to when we will reach the 4,000 target for refugees and our involvement in measures to support unaccompanied minors across Europe, particularly the children in Calais, and to explain why Ireland has not helped more children.  We can, and we must, do so much better than we have to date to help the ordinary citizens and children of Aleppo and Syria who are caught in a living hell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#H00300","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Over the last number of years Ireland has enjoyed some level of relative industrial peace.  At this stage, however, we have reached a grave situation.  We are facing strike action by second-level teachers and by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Today's advertisement in the national newspapers seeking members of the public to go in to schools to perform supervision and substitution work is, at best misguided and at worst it completely misunderstands the nature of schools and how they operate.  Yesterday the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, thought it was a good idea to say that the public would never view members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the same way again if they were to go on strike.  That is an outrageous statement.  It is clear that this Government, and in particular Fine Gael, has no comprehension as to how industrial relations work or how best to deal with trade unions or the public sector in general.<\/p> <p>I suggest to the Leader that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, should be invited to the House to discuss his announcements in the budget of a public pay commission to report by next summer.  Surely we must realise that the situation in which we find ourselves is grave, that schools will close and that garda&iacute; will not be on the streets.  The response from Government seems to be a complete misunderstanding of the sensitivities involved, of the public sector and of how to deal with industrial relations.  The response has been a \"face them down\" attitude which is not going to work.  What the House does not need is any more hyperbole so I ask the Cathaoirleach and the Leader to respectfully request the Minister to attend to the matter to overcome the situation where our schools are going to close down and where garda&iacute; are not on the street.  If that was to happen in any other European member state, the assumption would be that their Government had completely lost control of the situation.<\/p> <p>I ask that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform come to the House to expand on his one line statement in the Budget Statement as to what is his vision for the public sector.  It might contribute to a conversation on how we might avoid the situation of our schools closing, of garda&iacute; not being on the street and of bitterness and rancour being in our schools and in our police force for years to come.<\/p> <p>If the Government's tone is to continue along the line of what the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar said yesterday, then I would worry that the situation would completely unravel<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#H00400","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I support Senator Kelleher's request that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality should come to the House to speak on the refugee situation.<\/p><p>I thank all the Senators here this morning who sent e-mails after I spoke about Aleppo last week.

There will be plenty of opportunities on Mondays, Fridays and weekends to use the facility for lectures, which would be in beautiful surroundings with the furniture from this room.

As the Leader will know, it was the site to which POWs who took part in the Easter Rising were relocated and held during that period.  The site was dubbed as the university of revolution.  It was a place and time where Republican activists honed their political craft, studied guerrilla warfare and many other acts of revolution around the world in preparation for the revolutionary years of the Tan war that lay ahead of them.  The site would be of massive historical significance at any time but as we move towards the end of 2016, it reminds us that this last remaining hut, which has fallen into a degree of disrepair, is in need of being salvaged and retained for future generations.<\/p> <p>The hut is no longer on the site that was used to hold the prisoners.  It has been relocated about a mile up the road.  The man who owns the land has diligently worked to preserve and direct people who make the pilgrimage to Wales to the hut.  He has tried to retain artefacts and to build up information in a voluntary capacity to make it a worthwhile trip for people.  As we continue to mark this historic year, it is not over yet, it would be an opportune time for Members of the Seanad to raise our voices in support of the site.  Today, I contacted the Minister responsible and raised the issue.  I am happy to share my information but I would like us to collectively raise our voices to ensure the hut is not lost but is preserved for future generations to visit.  It would mean that the spirit and ideals honed and crafted in the POW camp can be learned about and put to good use. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#J01100","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Many small businesses were lost during the downturn.

She did secure extra funding for LEOs in this budget but more funding is required.  LEOs can help to create start-up small businesses.  They could act as a lifeblood and be the first port of call in local authorities for small businesses.  LEOs can provide guidance and funding to get many small businesses off the ground.  Such an initiative will play an important part in the future.  We need small business enterprises in this country now more than ever.

For example, we often think of the iconic image of nine year old Kim Phuc, the girl pictured naked as she fled horrific violence in south Vietnam in 1972.  In the midst of the carnage and the suffering she experienced as a result of severe burns on her back, there can seem to be no hope at times.  Seventeen surgical procedures were performed during her 14-month stay in hospital.  She survived and today lives with her husband and two children in Toronto.  She also established the KIM Foundation in the United States, with the aim of providing medical and psychological assistance for children of war.<\/p><p>Much closer to home, we have seen the images of a three year old Syrian boy, Alan Kurdi, who perished in the Mediterranean and was washed ashore in Turkey in September 2015.

Ahmed Soda, an 11 year old Syrian refugee, recently helped Patrick Sarsfields GAA Club win its first Antrim juvenile hurling title in many years.  Ahmed and his family who are originally from Aleppo arrived in Belfast last December.<\/p><p>The crisis in Syria, specifically the humanitarian catastrophe in Aleppo, has been mentioned by many Senators.  Last week, for example, the issue was raised by Senator Ray Butler.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party spokesman in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has been forthright in his condemnation of recent attacks on United Nations and Red Crescent convoys.  I echo this condemnation and despair when I see media reports of medical and United Nations facilities being targeted and destroyed.  In this context, I wholeheartedly support the comments of the Taoiseach who wants Ireland to introduce a Naval Service hospital ship to deal with global emergencies.  It is perhaps fitting that he made this pronouncement earlier this week while launching a new Naval Service patrol vessel, the <i>LE William Butler Yeats<\/i>, named after a former Senator who served in the House in the 1920s.

As a medic working on the west coast, I regularly liaise closely with the Irish Coast Guard and experience at first hand its members' bravery and commitment to serving the public while putting their lives in danger.  They face danger on every call-out.  The crews of Naval Service vessels working in the Mediterranean deal with hundreds of traumatic scenarios daily.<\/p><p>The image of young Ahmed Soda with his hurley among friends in west Belfast provides an important counter-balance to the awfulness unfolding in his home city and country.

The demonstration is a response to the Cassels report published earlier this year which suggested that one possible solution to third level funding problems would be the introduction of an income contingent loan scheme.  Such a scheme would effectively mean hiking fees up to &euro;5,000 per annum, thereby leaving students with debts of up to &euro;25,000 on graduation.  This figure does not take into consideration the cost of accommodation and living expenses incurred during four years of study.  Third level education is already a two-tier system in which some can afford to go to college, while others are forced to miss out, emigrate or enter low paid employment.  An income contingent loan scheme would exacerbate existing inequalities in the third level education system.  Those who would find the money to afford such a scheme would become members of a generation of young people who would have an education mortgage hanging from around their necks.  Such a scheme would condition young people to take the first job that came along, regardless of whether it paid low wages or had poor working conditions, all of which would result in young workers undervaluing their worth in the labour force. <\/p> <p>It is great that the Union of Students of Ireland has organised today's march and good that it has the support of SIPTU, IMPACT, the TUI, the National Youth Council of Ireland and Sinn F&eacute;in Republican Youth.

This is shocking as it contravenes recommendations from international health organisations that babies and children under two years should have as close as possible to a zero sugar intake.  According to a prominent study by the American Heart Association, there is strong evidence to support the association of added sugars with an increased cardiovascular disease risk in children.

When it comes to Crumlin children's hospital, the irony of it is that sick children are being served disease-inducing sugary foods in a State health facility while a large sugar awareness poster is hanging in its corridors.

I completely agree with Senator Daly on the need to transform the organ donation infrastructure in our country.  The committee I chaired in the last Oireachtas completed a comprehensive report on organ donation and, in particular, on the need to change the model to a soft opt-out system.  That is part of the difficulty, and the Senator is right.  Advertising, or awareness raising, in itself, will not create the need for people to give organ donations.  There needs to be a change in infrastructure around the whole issue of dialysis in our hospitals.  The retirement of Dr. David Hickey has highlighted the vacuum that exists.  There is a need for consensus and buy-in from all sides with regard to organ donation.  As somebody who, when in college, worked in a dialysis unit in Cork University Hospital, I saw first hand the importance of it.  I saw the whole range of emotion and trauma around organ donation and dialysis.  The Senator is right that we need to have a completely different system and change of approach.  I hope we can work to do that.<\/p> <p>Senator Daly referred to Orkambi and he knows quite well that the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics and the HSE make the decision.  I am told the HSE is in negotiations with the manufacturer of the drug to reduce the cost, particularly for cystic fibrosis patients.  I agree with the Senator completely.  We must look at ways in which we can make medication and life-changing or life-altering drugs available to people.  Whether they are high-tech or high-cost, it is immaterial.  It is about the preservation of life and the quality of life that we can give to people, such as the people the Senator referred to.  We have already done so with some of the cystic fibrosis drugs and with other drugs for multiple sclerosis as well.  I do not see any reason we cannot see that change.  It is important we keep the pressure on the Department and the HSE in regard to the drug the Senator referred to.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan also raised the issue of organ donation.   With regard to the Senator's Private Members' business this afternoon, I am not aware if the Minister will be in the House because he was away yesterday.  I cannot give the Senator a definitive answer on that but I am sure one of the Ministers of State will be here.   I do not have an answer for the Senator on the issue of the payment to the 4,000 people working overnight, but I will raise this with the Department.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of social protection and the need for the Minister to come to the House again to discuss it.  To be honest, the most likely date for that will be as part of the social welfare Bill, which I think might be an appropriate vehicle.  If we can arrange a stand-alone discussion, I will certainly try to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#L00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I just think that JobPath deserves a focused session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#L00400","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I will certainly try to do that.

We can argue about a sentence or a word here or there in a motion, but the overwhelming response from us should be a unified one in condemnation of what is taking place there.  We can apportion blame in a different debate.  The example Senator Swanick gave and the imagery Senator Butler used with regard to the response he received from the Russian Ambassador are points we can argue until the cows come home.

This report sets out the approach to reviewing and enhancing fire safety in local authority-provided Traveller accommodation.  The review was undertaken in the aftermath of the tragic deaths of ten members of the Traveller community in the fire tragedy in Carrickmines just over a year ago.  I take this opportunity to again offer sincere condolences on behalf of the Government to the Connors, Lynch and Gilbert families.  I had the privilege to be at the one-year commemoration last week, which was an extremely moving occasion, and I took the opportunity to meet some of the family members involved who are clearly still struggling to come to terms with the enormity of what happened a year ago.  Nothing I can say and nothing in this report will alleviate the suffering of the families concerned.  However, the report describes the work undertaken in the intervening period to plan, audit and implement fire safety measures and improvements focused on protecting families from the dangers of fire.<br\/><br\/>While the report covers the period up to 1 July 2016, my officials have verified with local authorities that progress continues to be made on a series of outstanding remedial issues.  In recent years, the statistics on fire deaths have been some of the lowest for more than 40 years, placing Ireland in the league of the most fire-safe nations, with an annual fire fatality rate of six deaths per 1 million of population.  Having said that, the Carrickmines tragedy was a stark reminder of the speed at which a small fire can develop into an enormous human tragedy.  It also reminds us that we need to focus our ongoing fire safety efforts on those most vulnerable to the dangers of fire.  <br\/><br\/>Following the tragic loss of life in Carrickmines, my Department's national directorate for fire and emergency management was mandated to lead and oversee at national level a programme to review fire safety in local authority-provided Traveller accommodation.  From the outset a collaborative approach, incorporating the concerns, views, advice and knowledge of Travellers and Traveller organisations, including Pavee Point, the National Traveller Women's Forum and the Irish Traveller Movement, was adopted, working with fire safety professionals in the local authority fire service and staff in the local authority housing sections.  While recognising broader issues related to Traveller accommodation, the review process focused on life safety and on ensuring that practical and appropriate fire safety measures, which contribute to preventing loss of life and injury in local authority Traveller accommodation, have been applied systematically across the country.  This involved appraising fire safety in Traveller accommodation against the standards set out in the working draft, <i>Guide to Fire Safety in Existing Traveller Accommodation<\/i>, which was prepared by the national directorate to assist local authorities in conducting the review.  It also involved running a series of community fire safety initiatives aimed at Traveller organisations and the wider Traveller community so that awareness of fire risk and fire safety is developed and maintained over a longer period.<br\/><br\/>The review focused on local authority Traveller-specific accommodation such as halting sites and group housing schemes.  As I mentioned earlier, the report on the programme to review and enhance fire safety in local authority-provided Traveller accommodation was published on 21 September.  The report enumerates fire safety measures and actions implemented as of 1 July this year.  However, and critically from my perspective, it also proposes and recommends a series of further actions by relevant stakeholders to sustain fire safety into the longer term.  The review process, which was driven at national level by the national directorate and implemented across the country by local authorities, has effectively concluded.  Local authorities submitted returns to the national directorate detailing the work that was undertaken up to 1 July 2016, which was the cut-off point for the submission of data for inclusion in the report.  This information was analysed by the national directorate, resulting in the generation of the report, which I am sure some Senators have seen or read.<br\/><br\/>The report highlights that as of 1 July local authorities reported having appraised fire safety in 95%, or 2,042, of the 2,144 Traveller accommodation units identified for the purpose of the review.  Five per cent, or 102, accommodation units were not subject to a fire safety appraisal as some were closed and undergoing renovations, some were unoccupied and in a small number of cases the local authority was unable to gain access.<br\/><br\/>The report recommends that relevant local authorities revisit the possibility of appraising this very small percentage of Traveller accommodation units which were not covered as part of the review.  Following the appraisal stage, local authorities set about carrying out the necessary remediation works and prepared implementation plans detailing short, medium and long-term timeframes for action.  Short-term plans typically included the installation of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms and fire blankets and the marking of fire safety points in halting sites.  Medium-term plans generally dealt with matters such as the provision of appropriate electrical connections and the reconfiguration of units, where feasible.  There was a lot of this type of work.  Long-term plans covered the provision of alternative or additional accommodation where needed.<br\/><br\/>As of 1 July, local authorities reported having carried out enhancements in 74%, or 1,501, of the accommodation units appraised and by the end of September this had risen to 85%, or 1,745 accommodation units.  When making their submission at the end of June, a number of local authorities pointed out that while other enhancement works were ongoing this was not reflected in their return which only detailed enhancements that had been completed.  In some cases, official halting sites and group housing schemes were found to be well-managed and maintained and, as a result, little or no enhancements were required.<br\/><br\/>The three main issues arising from the review process were: the absence of smoke alarms which would alert families to the dangers of fire at an early stage and enable them to evacuate quickly; the danger posed in multi-unit accommodation by the lay-out of units, in terms of a fire in one potentially preventing people escaping to safety from another unit; and the dangers of fire posed by inappropriate electrical connections between units.  The absence of a working smoke alarm was identified as an issue in 1,654 accommodation units.  Of these, just over three quarters, or 1,274 units, have been fitted with smoke alarms as of 1 July.  I would like to point out that in some cases there was reluctance and some persons did not wish to be provided with smoke alarms or to have them fitted.  This points to the need for further work in raising awareness among Travellers of fire dangers and the value of appropriate, functional fire safety measures in the home.<br\/><br\/>Separation distances between Traveller accommodation units and the configuration of adjacent units within bays were determined to be issues affecting roughly half of the sites appraised.  I understand that adjustments in lay-out have been undertaken, where feasible.  However, in many cases, the works required to remedy separation or configuration issues involves the provision of alternative or additional accommodation and this is not usually something that local authorities can address in the short or medium term.  Where the reconfiguration of units is not sufficient to address lay-out issues, the provision of alternative or additional accommodation will be considered by local authorities over the longer-term.  My Department is providing capital funding of &euro;9 million for Traveller-specific accommodation in 2017, an increase of &euro;3.5 million, or 64% on the 2016 allocation, which I think was also slightly increased last year.  I think we are moving in the right direction and we need to continue to do so.  As I mentioned, this is the second consecutive year that the Traveller accommodation capital budget has been increased.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, whether it will be enough remains to be seen.  We will appraise that again next year with a view to making decisions for 2018.<\/p><p>In addition to capital funding for the provision and refurbishment of Traveller-specific accommodation, the Department also provides current funding for accommodation-related supports to operate in tandem with the capital programme.  Current funding of &euro;4.3 million is being provided in 2016 and a similar amount will be provided again in 2017.  Traveller-specific funding is ring-fenced and is additional to the general social housing funding, which will see a huge increase for next year because of the overall pressures in respect of social housing provision and from which many Traveller families may also benefit.  No other group in Ireland has this additional accommodation option, which demonstrates, I hope, a clear commitment to providing culturally appropriate accommodation for Traveller families.<\/p><p>The condition of electrical installations generally and, in particular, the external use of multiple-plug adaptors, was identified as an issue in 62% of the sites appraised.  Of these, a little more than half have had remedial works carried out.  Therefore, there remains a sizeable number of accommodation units in which this is an ongoing issue and collectively we need to address that.  In such cases, discussions and communication between local steering groups and the individuals involved to develop remedies or solutions to make safe these electrical installations have taken place or are ongoing.<\/p><p>In addition to the physical works, a parallel programme of community fire safety has been undertaken by local authorities incorporating education and training for key workers and engagement with community groups on fire safety awareness.  Current community safety programmes are regarded as a significant contributor to the overall downward trend in the instances of domestic fires and fire fatalities.  Engaging people to take responsibility for their own safety, in so far as they can, is seen as a particularly effective approach.  I understand that 90% of local authorities have already carried out community fire safety talks or demonstrations and that this element of the review has been generally well received by Traveller organisations and the Traveller community.  Fire services have also carried out pre-incident planning visits as part of their fire prevention work to ensure familiarity of the local fire service with the location of Traveller accommodation within their functional area, which is very important.  This is to identify access, layout of sites, hazards on sites and hydrant locations to access large volumes of water.  This aspect of the review is considered to have worked very well and pre-incident planning for Traveller accommodation sites has now been included in the fire service's annual pre-incident planning programme.<\/p><p>A more complete picture of the work undertaken as part of the review can be obtained from the report which is available on my Department's website.  Overall, though, I am satisfied that the work undertaken to date as part of this review programme has improved considerably fire safety in local-authority-provided accommodation.<\/p><p>On the broader housing issue as it relates to the Traveller community, this report has just been published, and we are learning lessons from it and want to try to invest in ensuring that we implement its recommendations.  We have made decisions regarding next year's budget, anticipating that we will need to spend much more on Traveller-specific accommodation, an increase from &euro;5.5 million to &euro;9 million.  The Housing Agency is also undertaking a broad review of housing provision for the Traveller community and should report to me before the end of the year, I think.  Therefore, a lot is happening in this area, but that does not mean there is not more to be done and more to learn.  I look forward to hearing what Senators have to say on the topic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#O00200","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Before I call Senator Murnane O'Connor, I welcome Bernard Joyce and other representatives of Traveller groups throughout Dublin city and county to the Visitors Gallery.

It was devastating.  The whole country was devastated about it.  However, who is responsible for fire safety in Traveller accommodation?  There are about 10,000 Traveller families resident in Ireland.  We have learned through bitter experience that self-regulation of fire regulations does not work.  In 1998 the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act was enacted.  The legislative framework we have today mandates all local authorities to draw up a five-year plan for Traveller accommodation.  This legislation is patchy and, according to many Travellers, has resulted in no real change.  For many years, the Traveller community has been calling for a housing watchdog in co-ordination with all agencies responsible for housing the Traveller community.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il support the setting up of this housing agency.  The majority of the board would be Travellers in order to provide suitable accommodation for Travellers throughout this State.  Improving Travellers' accommodation must be a priority for all parties.  Some fire safety works have taken place in local authorities for Traveller accommodation rights.  The absence of smoke alarms, the danger posed by multi-unit accommodation and the dangers of fire all need to be urgently addressed.  I ask the Minister to make sure that every local authority carry out safety procedures on these factors for the Traveller community.  Fianna F&aacute;il proposes a national building inspectorate, as opposed to the assigned certificate system.  I have massive concerns about the certificate system, which I believe does not address the issue.  A building inspectorate, much like the national car test, NCT, system, with dedicated specialist staff monitored by the local authority, would be more cost-effective.<\/p> <p>I welcome the &euro;9 million the Government has planned to go into Traveller accommodation.  However, I heard the Minister a few weeks ago address the matter of local authorities not using their Traveller accommodation funding but sending it back over the years.  The Minister needs to address this issue because at the end of the day, he is accountable to every local authority.  I want to make sure this &euro;9 million is put to the best use for the Traveller community because we must make sure that nothing like that fire ever happens again in this country.  I welcome the extra money and the fact that fire safety is now an issue in the Traveller community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#Q00300","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his comprehensive report.  I also welcome all the guests to the Visitors Gallery.  I have no difficulty with the Minister's report.  I have read it in detail.  In the recommendations he has short-term, medium-term and long-term objectives, which is clearly strategic and makes absolute sense.  The report is based on resources, and practical things can be done.  I have no difficulty with that.<\/p> <p>I want to spend my time talking about the Traveller accommodation issue in its broadest sense.  I have come to the Seanad from a local authority.  I commiserate because I was around on the very night that massive inferno took place in Carrickmines, in the local authority of which I was an elected member.  However, it is the same local authority that is on record as opposing Traveller accommodation.  I do not like to say it to the Minister, but he is a leading member of the Fine Gael Party, and Fine Gael councillors put out publicity and literature during the last general election campaign opposing Traveller accommodation.  I know that does not sit comfortably with the Minister, because he is an innately decent person driven to deliver the policies, but that is the reality and it goes for most parties.  They constantly oppose Traveller accommodation.  There is nearly an incitement to hatred in some of the language used.  I am amazed it has not been pursued as a hate crime because it is really irresponsible of any politician to talk in such derogatory terms and to frustrate and oppose the provision of Traveller accommodation.  The big problem I see is that the county managers and chief executives, by their nature, wheel and deal to get things done.  I say that in the best sense of the term.  I also see the pressure mounted by elected representatives, who call themselves democrats, and community representatives who oppose Traveller accommodation.  I am encouraged by a sentence in the Minister's contribution in which he talked about specific Traveller accommodation to address the specific needs of Traveller communities.  He has acknowledged that here, which is good, and I welcome that.  However, how can we progress the matter?  It is not acceptable that we have a large number of caravans crammed into very tight sites.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The question must be asked as to why they are on very tight sites in the first place.  The reason is because the local authorities have not been able to get the cross-party political support, on the ground, to deliver Traveller accommodation.  This issue needs to come back centrally into the Minister's Department, and there needs to be quarterly reports on his website, not the local authorities' websites.  We know they have failed to deliver on appropriate, safe, good accommodation and sites.<\/p><p>The work, trade and pursuits of Travellers must also be acknowledged, be they involved in horses, metalwork, crafts or mechanics.  These are the things they want to do, that give them access to work and a meaningful day.  That also has to become part of the overall view of what we are looking for in appropriate accommodation for Travellers' needs.<\/p><p>If I can leave the Minister with one message it is that he needs to bring the matter centrally back into his Department.  He needs to bring out quarterly reports on how councillors are delivering other accommodation programmes.  Consider D&uacute;n Laoghaire west pier.  There are four caravans facing the easterly winds with a timber lattice around them because nobody will provide appropriate accommodation for the needs of a family that has been there for 25 years.  That is the reality of a situation in D&uacute;n Laoghaire which is a very affluent part of the world and it is happening on the watch of all parties.  The issue needs to be taken back centrally and we need to have quarterly deliverables.  We need to have people asking councils why they are failing, why they are not doing it, where they are not delivering on it.  It is not enough for people they have washed their hands of the Customs House or that they have washed their hands of this into the local authorities.  The Minister needs to take control.  I appeal to him to go back to his parliamentary party and to issue a circular to councillors that he knows and works with to tell them of their responsibilities, that they must respect and acknowledge the dignity of Travellers in the political literature and in the councillors' language and discourse.  Unless we change councillors' attitudes - and that goes for all of us - we are not going anywhere.  I would ask that the Minister puts on record with the membership of his party, where he stands and what he expects of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#Q00400","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>It is one year since the Carrickmines tragedy and it is important to have this debate to let all views be heard across the House.  One year ago it was a very human tragedy when ten lives were lost on a halting site in Carrickmines.  It was a very real tragedy that affected not only that family but the wider Traveller community as well.<\/p> <p>To be fair to the Minister and his officials, they have outlined the immediate steps that were taken at that time.  I have listened carefully to the Senator and he is right.  I say that as a Fine Gael representative.  There are councillors in our party that have actively campaigned against Travellers' rights and entitlements but that goes for every party also.  We need to show leadership and the Senator is right to raise that issue.  These are the issues that we do not talk about, unfortunately, a lot of the time.  This House should take a step forward in showing leadership on the wider Traveller accommodation issue.  A consequence of last year's tragedy was a real reminder about standards and the ability of local authorities to carry out their obligations as housing authorities.<\/p> <p>Reference was made to funding, and the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson spoke about the drawdown of funding.  It is a fact that approximately 80% of funding for Traveller accommodation of the last ten years was drawn down and 20% was handed back.  There are reasons for that and it is important we look at that to analyse why the full drawdown is not occurring.  It is quite obvious to me, and Senators have alluded to it, that there are local issues where local authorities are the housing authority and elected members oppose the establishment of Traveller accommodation in their local electoral areas and that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>I recognise that Traveller representative groups are looking for a national Traveller accommodation forum or committee that would allocate housing.  It is my personal view that I am unsure this is the right way to go.  It could cause further division between local authorities and when allocations happen.  I believe it is about building capacity and confidence within the local authority system, but that cannot be done unless there is some element of sanction or accountability for local authorities.  If we are to be honest about it, since the Traveller accommodation committee was established some local authorities have been successful and some have been deplorable.  There are reasons for that.  I feel it is very unfair to point the finger at Travellers.  They are a minority and they want further inclusivity and I believe we should all agree with that.<\/p> <p>I recall when I was a member of a local authority putting my neck on the line in my local authority area and saying to members in my own area that certain Travellers needed to be accommodated.  There was some kickback on that electorally and, I will be honest, some of my electorate disagreed with me.  I probably suffered a bit for that view.  Travellers genuinely need housing accommodation or accommodation to suit their requirements, to a high standard.  Last week the Department made recommendations for local and national levels.  I shall not go over them again as they are in the public record.  It is an obligation on local authorities, as housing authorities, not only for social housing tenants but also for Travellers, to ensure that people who have a need in their respective areas are accommodated to the standard that, at the very least, ensures fire safety and meets the accommodation needs that exist.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the increased funding for Traveller accommodation in the 2017 budget but it is not just about providing money.  There are deeper issues that must be resolved by Traveller representative groups, Travellers and communities engaging together, sitting around the table and building confidence and capacity within communities.  It should not be about them and us.  That is part of the problem.<\/p> <p>I return to the issue, as outlined by the other Senators, of public leaflets being put out by some people.  It is unacceptable for Fine Gael representatives to do that, and I say this as a Fine Gael Senator.  It is unacceptable for any representative to do that.  We should all show leadership with regard to our obligations and our needs.  The Minister can only do so much.  He provides the policy, the framework and the funding and that has been put in place.  He has directed local authorities and he has provided the audit of all local Traveller accommodation sites, be they unofficial or official.  The record speaks for itself, but now we need to follow through.<\/p> <p>The Traveller accommodation committees around the State need a national review.  The Housing Agency has a role to play in this regard as an independent body that can give independent oversight to how successful those committees are.  We need to be very frank about where the barriers are.  Some people will cite anti-social behaviour and other issues but that is as much evident in the settled community as in the Traveller community.  Many of us are experienced representatives and we have represented all sectors of society, and that is the way it should be, but anti-social behaviour happens as much in a settled community as it does with Travellers.  It must be acknowledged that there are a few, a minority, who give the Traveller community a bad name.  That is where the confidence building issues need to be built upon.  We need to have further engagement with communities.  We need the local authorities on the ground to engage, face to face, with Traveller representatives and we need to bring them forward to community representatives and work together to provide high standards of accommodation.  The funding is there and it has been proven over the last ten years that only 80% of the funding has been drawn down.  There are deeper, underlying issues that we all need to be honest and upfront about.  Senators have referred to those issues.<\/p> <p>With regard to local representatives, we speak in this House about local councillors, their increased workload and their mandate.  This is a very fundamental mandate for councillors.  Why should we hand it back to a central Department and to bureaucrats.  Councillors should take this on board and stand up four-square.  It is a responsibility, whether they like it or not.  I know that councillors elect Senators to this House, but it is a responsibility they need to deal with on the ground and show leadership on.  It is only by taking that route that it will work.  By taking it away from local communities and councillors we are allowing them to abdicate that responsibility.  I do not believe that is the answer.  The Minister needs to have a national oversight and overview, provide the framework, the policy and the funding.  Ultimately it is down to the housing authorities, supported by their local elected representatives, of all parties and none, to provide that accommodation.  Until that leadership happens, along with the leadership in the Traveller community, unfortunately we are not going to resolve many of the outstanding issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#R00200","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>T&aacute; bliain ann &oacute; cailleadh an deichni&uacute;r saor&aacute;nach de chuid na t&iacute;re seo i dtine uaf&aacute;sach i mB&oacute;thar Ghleann na Muc i gCarraig Mhaighin sa gcontae seo.

In the past seven years, funding for Traveller accommodation has been cut by 93%, from &euro;70 million in 2008 to &euro;4.3 million this year.  A total of 1,536 Traveller families are living in overcrowded or unsafe conditions and many Travellers do not have access to basic facilities such as sanitation, water and electricity.  Travellers fare badly in all key indicators of disadvantage, including employment, poverty, health, infant mortality, life expectancy and education.  At the root of all these problems are the levels of prejudice, discrimination and social exclusion experienced by these citizens. <\/p> <p>A total of 34 Travellers have been criminalised under legislation, namely, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, which allows the Garda to move families on demand and without notice.  Failure to comply with such a demand may result in a heavy fine or term of imprisonment.  This in itself constitutes a major human rights violation.<\/p> <p>Little consideration has been given to the cultural values of Travellers when providing accommodation.  As a result, much of this accommodation has not been designed in a way that meets Travellers' specific needs.  In addition, some current Traveller accommodation programmes do not meet basic standards.<\/p> <p>For too long, bigotry and discrimination have been allowed to hinder the provision of Traveller accommodation.  We must ensure that funding for Traveller accommodation is used and the provision of homes for the Traveller community is no longer allowed to be used as a political football.  In this regard, I concur with many of the points made by Senator Coffey.  It is appalling, for example, that the Mayor of Galway, who is a member of the Traveller action programme committee, is also canvassing in opposition to Traveller accommodation in certain areas of the city.  It beggars belief that an elected representative is engaging in such an appalling practice.  Public representatives must show leadership and engage in proper consultation at local and national level to ensure the problem is alleviated. <\/p> <p>The report was commissioned in the wake of the Carrickmines tragedy.  I note from the introduction that co-operation took place between statutory agencies, local authorities and the Travelling community and I hope such co-operation continues on the work that will need to be done to find a permanent solution. <\/p> <p>There are fears the report will be used as another excuse to evict people from sites or in circumstances that are not acceptable.  These fears need to be addressed.  The report is a starting point or roadmap, not an end in itself, and it must not be viewed as putting the matter to rest.  Carrickmines was the result of a legacy from the foundation of the State.  <\/p> <p>The report gives a qualified welcome, as I do, to the measures carried out in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy.  There is, however, much more to be done and Sinn F&eacute;in has argued for more to be done for a long time.  In our most recent alternative budget, instead of tax cuts for the well-off, we proposed significant investment to provide adequate, secure and culturally appropriate accommodation for Travellers.  We are committed to restoring the Traveller accommodation budget to the 2008 level of &euro;40 million.  We would achieve this by increasing the current allocation by &euro;36 million in 2017.  Sinn F&eacute;in also had Traveller accommodation at the heart of our Better for Housing document, which will underpin our housing policy when we are in government.<\/p> <p>My party is often accused of not making positive recommendations.  Our proposals include the introduction of a Traveller ethnicity Bill; front-loading of funding to local authorities with a good track record of drawing down funds and delivery of Traveller accommodation and penalties for local authorities which refuse to build necessary Traveller accommodation; reform of all legislation that penalises Traveller culture and ways of life; the introduction of amending legislation to make the Traveller accommodation programme a mandatory consideration on an application for planning permission; empowerment of the national Traveller accommodation consultative committees to take charge of the provision of Traveller accommodation with an annual budget and targets; the establishment of an all-Ireland programme for provision for nomadism in co-operation with all local authorities in the Six Counties and Twenty-six Counties; incorporation of local development plan zoning objectives with provisions of the Traveller accommodation programme, especially for the use of temporary or transient halting sites; prescribing that the use of land as a transient halting site for a specified number of weeks per annum should be as an exempted development; bringing the development of private halting sites within the \"open for consideration\" or \"acceptable\" categories under agricultural zoning; using external mediation of disputes where Traveller and settled communities come into conflict over Traveller accommodation issues; and developing a broader, meaningful Traveller-settled community reconciliation process.<\/p> <p>As for the report, there are concerns about carbon monoxide alarms not being installed.  This is vital because most Traveller accommodation is not linked to a service provider such as the gas network and many housing units rely on solid fuel burners or appliances run off gas canisters.  All of this occurs in a confined space where ventilation may be a problem.  This issue needs to be tackled immediately because unlike in the case of fire, there will be no prior warning of a build-up of this lethal gas. <\/p> <p>Access to Traveller sites for emergency vehicles was identified as a problem, albeit one that could be solved through a ministerial order to the local authorities to improve access from public roads and remove barriers that may impede access for emergency vehicles.  Urgent action is needed on this point. <\/p> <p>The issue of electrical connections appears to be the most urgent matter.  In 62% of the sites assessed, a requirement to carry out remedial works was identified and the use of multiple adaptors was also identified as an issue.<\/p> <p>It is important that this report and other reports are not used as a mechanism for seeking changes in accommodation arrangements.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see the fire safety appraisals and any resultant fire safety enhancement works undertaken in partnership with the relevant Traveller community.  Current legislative enforcement provisions must not be invoked as part of this process to try to effect change. <\/p> <p>The reason for the long delay in implementing many of the recommendations is the substantial reduction in funding for Traveller accommodation.  In addition, as has been noted by certain local authorities, there is a reluctance to draw down and utilise the money available to provide proper and safe accommodation.  In one incident in County Dublin, local councillors actively campaigned through leaflets not to have a site used for accommodation, while ostensibly claiming that the proposed scheme would have been a waste of money.  <\/p> <p>Even when moneys are allocated for Traveller accommodation, for example, the &euro;4.3 million allocated under the watch of Senator Paudie Coffey, when he was the Minister of State with responsibility for Traveller accommodation, no moneys were allocated to many local authorities, including Carlow, Cavan, Donegal, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, South Dublin, Galway, Laois, Leitrim, Louth and Mayo County Councils and Galway City Council.  Many of these council areas have long waiting lists for Traveller accommodation.  <\/p> <p>In Galway, we see very little activity but hear much talk about Traveller accommodation.  While I welcome the project under CENA to develop a halting site, compared with the group housing initiative under CENA in County Offaly, the project in Galway is very slow to be developed and the halting site proposed under the council's Traveller accommodation policy appears to have gone by the wayside.  Sinn F&eacute;in would, as I indicated, immediately tackle these issues by front-loading funding to local authorities with a good track record of drawing down funds.  <\/p> <p>While it was great that so many parties adopted a united position in the wake of the Carrickmines tragedy and that the report was published, there is a need to match rhetoric with action, which means confronting those who hold anti-Traveller bias in council chambers at local authority level and in the community.  Nothing will change unless it is made known to these people that they can no longer block progress.  The polite protestations of certain politicians that some areas are more suitable than others for Traveller accommodation is a cowardly retreat into seat-saving and renders the holding of political office as nothing more than self-preservation. <\/p> <p>T&aacute; an t-am istigh.

I extend a warm welcome to the visitors in the Gallery who have travelled especially to be present.  Some of them live with the daily reality of what we are discussing.  On 27 September, on the Order of Business, I read out the names of the ten people who tragically died in the Carrickmines fire and called on the Government, as a matter of urgency, to prioritise the issue of overcrowding on halting sites and respond to mounting international and moral pressure for action.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colette Kelleher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I am glad that the Minister has come before the House to respond to these matters of life and death.  Will the measures outlined in the report by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management prevent more unnecessary and tragic deaths?  <\/p><p>Local groups have acknowledged that work has been done, as the Minister outlined here this afternoon.  The consensus is that Travellers are still not safe in their homes.  The response to Carrickmines needs to go much further and beyond fire alarms and fire blankets.  We must tackle the underlying causes like chronic overcrowding.  Until such time as that is addressed many halting sites are unsafe places for men, women and children.  <\/p><p>The national directorate's Report on Programme to Review and Enhance Fire Safety in Local Authority Provided Traveller Accommodation noted that \"protecting people from the dangers of fire is particularly challenging in the confined and cramped conditions that families living in caravans or non-standard accommodation may find themselves\".  This challenge is compounded by overcrowding.  In the report separation distances were identified as an issue of concern in 57% of sites.  The number of families forced to share accommodation has increased from 663 in 2013 to 862 in 2015 and 534 families live on unauthorised sites.  That translates into more than 4,000 men, women and children.  Such overcrowding is a direct result of policy failures and neglect.  The State has a duty of care to Travellers and that duty has not been fulfilled.  Successive Governments have failed to provide and continue to fail to provide adequate housing and accommodation for Travellers.  It is not just me who says so, it is not just Irish Travellers who say so and it is not just the Traveller groups that say so.  The eyes of the world are on us and on the way we treat Travellers.  The eyes of the world are not going away.<\/p><p>In the past year we have had two landmark judgments.  One came from the European Commission of Social Rights, a body of the Council of Europe, and the other from the European Commission.  Last May, a collective complaint, that is a form of class action, was taken against Ireland by the European Roma Rights Centre, supported by the Irish Traveller Movement, to the European Committee of Social Rights.  The landmark judgment found that the Government has violated Travellers' rights in five respects under the social chapter.  The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted the findings on 5 October.  How does the Minister plan to put into effect changes in policy and practice in the light of those findings?  Some key grounds were cited - the insufficient provision of accommodation for Travellers; that many sites are in inadequate condition; and, that there are inadequate safeguards for Travellers threatened with eviction.  The committee noted that of the 1,000 transient bays identified as needed in a 1995 taskforce report there are only 54 in existence and not all function as proper transient sites.  <\/p><p>The second judgment came in recent weeks from the European Commission Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers, and gender equality, and threatened infringement proceedings against Ireland for its treatment of Travellers.  Officials from the Commission are here this week in respect of this matter.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's response to the European Commission's inquiries.  The damning remarks from the European bodies have been echoed by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  Is the Government listening now?  I fear not when we examine the actions of recent Governments.<\/p><p>The budget for Traveller accommodation will be a welcome &euro;9 million next year but it was &euro;40 million in 2008.  That means there has been a 92% cut between 2008 and 2014.  I ask the Minister to name another group that has suffered a 92% cut in funding support during the financial crisis.  Let us remember that there was no Traveller in the Cabinet when the country went bust.  There was no Traveller on the boards of our banks when they went bust.  For those who might accuse me of going off topic, I am not.  Recent Governments have used the cry of the crisis to disproportionately and unfairly cut funding for Traveller accommodation and supports.  As a result we have halting sites that are death traps.  No-one deserves to live in such circumstances and no-one deserves to die like the people who died at the Carrickmines site.   At the same time the Government cut funding some local authorities, as mentioned by other Senators, underspent their Traveller accommodation budgets to the tune of 36%.  That was at a time when thousands of Travellers were in need of support.  This amounts to a damning dis-investment by the State in the Traveller community that has had a devastating effect. <\/p><p>Minister, in our home city of Cork, there is a halting site in Blackpool called Spring Lane that was built for ten families but now houses 30.  Many families remain without water or toilets, some families continue to live in old damp mobile homes and all of the families live with overcrowding on a daily basis.  Even though almost 100 children live on the site they have nowhere to play.  We know that there is a direct relationship between the quality of housing and health and safety.  Traveller infants are 3.6 times more likely to die than infants in the general population.  The suicide rate among male Travellers is 6.6 times higher than in the general population.  <\/p><p>Last week I spoke to a friend who works in Traveller health and she told me that there have been three deaths from suicide in Cork in the past few weeks.  In 2008, the life expectancy for Traveller men was 15 years shorter than for settled men and a decade shorter for women.  As we all know, ten people died in the fire that triggered this report.  We are shaving decades off people's lives by not providing them with adequate and safe homes.<\/p><p>Every day Travellers experience marginalisation, discrimination and racism due to their ethnicity.  It is time to respect this distinctive culture that can be traced back to at least Tudor times.  A core part of the Traveller culture is expressed through housing.  Living in a caravan and moving about is an integral part of Travellers' ethnic identity that was superbly explored in the recent RTE television series called \"John Connors: The Travellers\".  We must recognise and provide for their identity.  As the European Commission noted, Travellers are the most marginalised community in Ireland yet two weeks ago in the D&aacute;il a criminal justice Bill was supported and moved to Committee Stage without a distinct reference being made to their ethnic minority status.  Their status is not recognised by the State and, therefore, will not benefit from automatic inclusion in the proposed Bill.  For me, this is a matter of conscience and rights.  The current situation is intolerable and shameful.  Urgent meaningful action is required to remedy the situation for Travellers in Ireland.<\/p><p>The Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness - Rebuilding Ireland is a commendable and ambitious plan but it is short on specifics in respect of Traveller accommodation.  The plan commits to having an expert independent review by the Housing Agency, which is needed, but it does not reference or recognise the scale of the issue that needs to be addressed.  Travellers need to know when overcrowding will end, how much will be spent on Traveller accommodation, when, by whom and where.  Can the Minister confirm that the promised review mentioned in the Rebuilding Ireland action plan will, at a minimum, reinstate Traveller accommodation funding to the 2008 level of &euro;40 million?  A budget of &euro;9 million is going in the right direction but it is not enough.  I ask the Minister to increase the provision of appropriate resourcing of accessible, suitable and culturally appropriate accommodation, to support Traveller nomadism with well managed and serviced transient sites and to introduce a moratorium on evictions.  Given that there have been successive failures of leadership and political will at local level, I ask him to consider creating new independent national Traveller accommodation.<\/p><p>We must never again lose ten Irish citizens to fire like we did in Carrickmines.  We must respect Irish Travellers in words and deeds.  We can and must end the marginalisation of Travellers.  We must end the causes of early death and ill health whether it is mental or physical.  We must end overcrowding through properly resourced housing.  We owe this to the ten people who died in Carrickmines last year.  We owe this to the thousands of Irish Travellers desperate for a decent home and life.

As only 42% of remedial steps were implemented, will he explain the reason the remaining remedial steps were not implemented?  <\/p><p>In regard to smoke alarms, 81% of accommodation units were appraised and 77% were supplied with smoke alarms.  As is the norm in mainstream local authority housing - where the local authority has an input into the provision of the units - I would have thought the provision of a smoke alarm would be compulsory.  I fully understand the concerns of people with regard to smoke alarms in Traveller accommodation.  Will the Minister address that issue?  The report states there was extensive discussion on smoke alarms and while a smoke alarm will assist in all practical senses, there is resistance to installing one and I ask the Minister to address that issue.  A key recommendation is to change the code of practice under the provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981 and the 2003 amending Act and I ask the Minister to implement that change.<\/p><p>I know the Minister has a great interest in this issue, but in his opening statement he stated the statistics here are low with \"six deaths per 1 million of population\".  With respect, Minister, no death is acceptable.  I acknowledge the Minister accepts this but that statistic, with parts of the report not implemented, means there is a great deal more work to be done.  <\/p><p>I will now deal with the broader issue of Traveller accommodation.  When I went to primary school in the Mercy school in Carrick-on-Suir, I sat alongside a Traveller in my first year, which was known as low babies.  That Traveller remained in school with me up until fifth class in primary school.  The family then left.  They had been living in a canvass tent in the field next to the castle in Carrick-on-Suir.  I wonder how that boy ever got on in life after that.  What chance did he have, compared with the chances I got?<\/p><p>I fundamentally disagree with Senator Boyhan's comment that we should recentralise the responsibility for Traveller accommodation.  I commend Senator Coffey on what he said today.  I totally agree with him when he said this was an abdication.  We have 949 elected councillors.  One of their responsibilities is to deal with Traveller accommodation.  They must deal with the issue in the same way as they deal with other issues as elected representatives and not hand back that control to the Minister or to an official in the Department.  In 2002, in my capacity in a previous job, I had an opportunity to train Traveller women for their role when they were on the Traveller accommodation committees in County Tipperary.  I was a member of the council at the time.  I got an insight into the issues they faced on a daily basis.  Their input into the committee was extremely successful, not because of my training but because of their interest in representing their community on the committee.  I met the then chairman of the council, now deceased, at a funeral and he told me about the Traveller accommodation committee meeting he had attended that day.  He was bowled over by the Traveller women on the committee.  I will never forget his line when he said \"I cannot handle those women\".  Obviously I did not tell him that I had trained them but it showed me that if the Travelling community get an opportunity, they will engage in what we would call the mainstream.<\/p><p>I am aware of a former councillor in Senator Coffey's county of Waterford who took up the position of chairman of the Traveller accommodation committee.  When he was asked at the time why he took the position of chairman, his answer was it was to make sure there were no Travellers in his local area.  He said he would keep them out of his area.  If we still have that attitude, we must deal with it.  The Minister has to deal with this bigotry head on.  Senator Coffey also mentioned briefly but did not develop a point I will now develop regarding councils that do not spend their allocation for Traveller accommodation on an annual basis and refuse to deal with the issue.  The Minister, who sanctions funding for other pet projects, must make it hurt if that local authority is not prepared to address Traveller accommodation.  Most councils are responsible and want to deal with this issue, but there are some, to which Members have alluded, which do not want to address it and have a bigoted attitude to the Travelling community.  That must stop.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#T00200","speaker":"1387","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Senator Davitt has four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#U00200","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to comment on the report.  I extend my sympathy to the families and people who lost loved ones and friends in the Carrickmines tragedy.  I welcome the representatives of the Traveller community who are present.<\/p> <p>While the Minister has provided an outline of the &euro;9 million for Traveller accommodation, what safeguards are in place for the councils' expenditure of this money on Traveller accommodation?  It is a similar question to that asked by many others today but I think it is the key to the matter.  Does one penalise a council that does not spend its allocation?  Is it feasible, as Senator Landy suggested, to link it to moneys being spent on other projects?  I do not know the answer but this is the nub of the matter.  If what happened in previous years is a gauge, the best part of &euro;2 million will not be spent on Traveller accommodation this year.  It is a fair concern that the money will not be spent.<\/p> <p>An issue that keep recurring is whether responsibility for Traveller accommodation should remain with the county councils or, as Senator Boyhan suggested, be centralised.  I veer in the  direction of local responsibility.  As has been pointed out, responsibility should rest with the council and in the first instance, the Traveller accommodation committees, together with the chairperson, elected representatives and council staff should spend the money.  I think centralisation could be a problem.  Senator Murnane O'Connor made a helpful and important suggestion to have a building inspectorate oversee projects and works to ensure they are done to a standard, as it is not good enough to send out a message that sub-standard work would suffice.  When Senator Coffey served as the Minister of State in the previous Government, money was spent on projects in Athlone and different areas and one could see the benefits of it.  These projects were respected.  I call on the Minister to try to force, in whatever way possible, the spending in these communities of the allocation of &euro;9 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#U00300","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>There are time constraints.

I wish to take the opportunity to sympathise with the families from Carrickmines who suffered a great loss and tragedy.<\/p><p>I inspected a local halting site quite recently and have to say I was not at all impressed with what I saw from either a fire safety or an accommodation point of view.  I have no doubt but that the local authority will address the fire safety issues by carrying out the inspections.  The local authority has assured me it has carried out those inspections and will address the shortcomings around fire safety.  Like the other Senators, I too would like to ask the Minister to address the accommodation issue.  The accommodation I have seen in the halting site in my local constituency in Castlebar is inadequate and poor and needs to be addressed urgently.  I am surprised to hear local authorities are sending back some of the funding that has been earmarked for Traveller accommodation over the years.  I ask that the Minister address that issue.  In my view, no local authority should be returning funding for Traveller accommodation to the Department.<\/p><p>In the halting site in Castlebar, I have seen the accommodation at first hand.  In some areas, it was a fire trap.  In some cases they had the walls painted with oil paint, which is highly inflammable.  I hope the council in this case will address that issue.  I acknowledge the local authority has to be invited in to do all the inspections but I hope all the inspections were carried out.  I hope the Minister will address the many issues raised here about Traveller accommodation.  From what I have seen, I believe it is the poorest accommodation of any group of people right around the country.  While the &euro;9 million is welcome, it is totally inadequate to address the Traveller accommodation issue in the short term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#U00500","speaker":"1380","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":101,"content":"<p>The Minister has indicated he is willing to give Senator Mac Lochlainn a minute of his time.

I thank Senator Colette Kelleher, who took the initiative to call for this debate.  I thank the Minister for agreeing and being here today.  I welcome the members of the Traveller community who are present to witness this today.  I want to focus my comments on the big challenge that faces us.  Many of the issues around cutbacks to Traveller accommodation programmes, overcrowding and a lack of cohesion in checking fire safety standards are due to a lack of political leadership right across this State.  Let us be honest about it - it has been said here today - very few elected representatives are fighting proactively in partnership with the Traveller community to facilitate the cultural rights that are important to both the Traveller community and to all of us in terms of our history.  I had the privilege of being rapporteur for the justice committee in the previous Oireachtas.  That committee unanimously recommended that this State recognise - not grant, because it is not the State's right to grant it - the ethnicity of the Traveller people.<\/p><p>I  refer to the virus that started.  In 1963, there was a Commission on Itinerancy.  I want to read into the record its terms of reference, because they say it all:<\/p><blockquote>(1) To enquire into the problem arising from the presence in the country of itinerants in considerable numbers [Note how it refers to &quot;itinerants&quot;, not Travellers];<br \/><br \/>(2) To examine the economic, educational, health and social problems inherent in their way of life;<br \/><br \/>(3) To consider what steps might be taken (a) to provide opportunities for a better way of life for itinerants,<br \/><br \/>(b) to promote their absorption into the general community <br \/><br \/>(c) pending such absorption, to reduce to a minimum the disadvantage to themselves and to the community resulting from their itinerant habits.<\/blockquote> <p>Those were the terms of reference.  No Travellers were represented on that commission, which denied the ethnicity, culture and history of the Traveller people.  That commission was a stain on the history of this State.  It has haunted us for all the decades since.  We decided that the Traveller community's history was to be denied and that it was to be absorbed into settled society and so-called civilisation.<\/p><p>I want to commend Mr. John Connors and his team on the recent series on RTE.  They have made a massive contribution to educating people on the real history and the real issues facing the Traveller people.  Mr. Michael Collins, Ms Sindy Joyce, Ms Geraldine McDonnell and Ms Anne-Marie McDonnell, and Mr. Michael McDonagh undeniably are real leaders to the Traveller people.<\/p><p>I will briefly go through the reasons all parties and members of our committee unanimously recommended that the State recognise Traveller ethnicity.  It is massively important.  It would reverse the harm done by that commission all those years ago.  The remaining excuses that we identified were the likes of it not being in the best interests of Travellers, that granting Traveller ethnicity would be too costly to the State, that Traveller ethnicity is not proven, other academic reasons and the need for full consensus amongst Travellers.  We saw absolutely in the evidence given to our committee that every one of those excuses was slam-dunked and rebutted completely, not least by the then Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  Those bodies are objective observers that have written extensively on this issue.  The weight of academic, anthropological and sociological evidence is overwhelming.  In the next while, there will be deliberations on this State recognising the ethnicity of the Traveller people.  I believe that any fair and objective person who watches the documentary series laid out by Mr. John Connors or who reads the all-party unanimous report that has been there for two and a half years would have to accept that this needs to happen.<\/p><p>I thank the Acting Chairman for his patience.  My final point is we need to do this together.  We need to send a collective political message.  All political parties and Independents in these Houses must send a message together that the report of 1963 was a stain on the State.  We need to begin a new journey together, right the wrongs, teach the history of the Traveller people in our schools and remove the denial of their history, contribution, culture and vibrancy in this State.  It is not going to be easy and there are major problems to overcome.  However, the recognition of ethnicity would be a massive step in that direction.  I urge the Minister, along with his Cabinet colleagues and others, to look at this issue and make this year - the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising - the last year in which the State denies the ethnicity of our wonderful rich cultural Traveller people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#V00300","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>We have three minutes remaining.

I thank the Minister for coming in today.  I had a speech ready but my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, just said it all.  What she said in her speech is fantastic.  I welcome the citizens of the Traveller community who are here today and I convey my condolences to the families of Carrickmines.  When I heard my colleague's speech, it reminded me of being born and reared in Charlemont Street.  There was a halting site at the end of my street.  My mother had a small shop and it was the only shop on the street that would serve the Traveller community.  We got to know the Traveller community well, particularly one family with whom we became really friendly.  I was a child at the time so I used to play with the younger children of that family.  I remember there was a fire in the caravan in which the family lived.  I suppose I am only talking from my heart here, but the fire killed the mother of those beautiful four or five children and the husband was heartbroken.  My colleague's speech brought back to me the devastation that family suffered.  Their lives were destroyed.<\/p> <p>I welcome the report and the good work the Minister is doing.  Because I believe the Minister has a good heart, I ask him to take it as his own responsibility to look at the needs of the Traveller community and how important accommodation is.

As such, I want to pick up on one or two themes.  I thank Senator Colette Kelleher for a very impassioned speech today.  I have known Senator Kelleher for a long time and have rarely heard her speak as she did today.  As such, I am certainly taking on board what she has said.  I will also comment on Senator Mac Lochlainn's comment.  It is not often he calls for unity of purpose across political parties.  Normally, I am at the sharper end of his comments.  However, I agree with him on this issue.  On something as fundamental as how a country treats a sector of the community, in this case the Traveller community, we should try to agree and have a real resolve to deliver what we have agreed.  How can we deal with something that requires a much more comprehensive solution than has been provided to date?  I will do what I can to give leadership in that regard.  We will have to tease through some of those issues and it may be that we do not agree on everything.  However, we will probably agree on the fundamentals.<\/p> <p>I am more than aware of what is taking place in Spring Lane in Blackpool, Cork.  I have taken a personal interest in trying to resolve that and am meeting with the city council and others who are trying to resolve it, including the former Deputy, Kathleen Lynch.  The current conditions in which families are living is not acceptable in modern Ireland.  There are other similar examples in other parts of the country I am sure, but the Spring Lane issue is the one with which I am most familiar.  The solutions are not easy.  There have been many efforts to try to provide solutions.  I tried to get involved as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We made &euro;1 million available for Traveller community horse projects so that we could try to put some structure on the facilitation of the Traveller community to interact with horses, which is a strong connection they have.  None of that money was drawn down because we could not find political agreement.  We also had real challenges in trying to find agreement within the Traveller community - let us be honest - in terms of sharing facilities and so on.  Families did not want to share.  Of course, leadership is needed all around from representatives and I am delighted that so many are here today to listen to this debate.  However, the core leadership needs to come from Government and those who have power to make decisions and allocate significant resources.  We also have to give leadership at local government level.<\/p> <p>Comments were made on individual political parties.  Of course, the local decision-making process has to allow people to disagree on locations and sites, but what is not acceptable is to prevent the provision of Traveller accommodation at a certain site while not having an alternative that is better and can actually provide solutions.  Simply blocking solutions without having an alternative is not acceptable.  I was in Galway recently and I met a number of Traveller families who were anxious to speak to me because there is particular pressure in Galway city currently in relation to trying to find accommodation.  In the absence of that, there are families who are simply being evicted from short-stay accommodation which is not acceptable or legal in particular areas.  That is creating a lot of friction between the settled community, the Traveller community and garda&iacute;, which is not good for anybody.<\/p> <p>This is a bigger political problem than it is anything else.  We have an obligation to try to create acceptance within communities as well as to give leadership as political parties.  It is easier to do that if there is a combined approach across political parties.  I hope and expect that we will have another debate when I have a bit more time to go into some of the detail on some of the broader Traveller issues which have been raised here today.  I was asked to come here to focus specifically on the fire safety issues which are very current.  On some of the questions as to why there has not been 100% implementation or response, there are valid reasons that is the case.  In fact, the figures are a lot higher than they are in the report because the period it covers ended on 1 July.  A great deal has happened since then.  However, there is a need for consensus building, education and awareness-raising as well as the implementation of practical measures like smoke alarms, fire blankets and so on.  We need the help of representative groups for the Traveller community, many of which are represented here, to actually change approaches within the Traveller community as well as to change attitudes within the settled community.  If we can do that, we can make significant progress.<\/p> <p>My final point is on budgets.  We have increased the budget significantly for next year.  My understanding is that the budget was reduced because of a change in policy in order to accommodate the Traveller community through the standard social housing model to a greater extent rather than to simply allocate all money for Traveller families to Traveller-only accommodation.  That switch resulted in a change of emphasis in budgets.  Clearly, it has not worked.  More funding is not the answer on its own given that the funding which is there already is not even being drawn down and spent.  However, I accept that it is part of the equation.  The commitment in a budget is, in many ways, the proof of a political commitment to get something done.  That is why it is important that we have seen an increase for next year.  It is also important to have a plan as to how to approach and spend the budgets that are there because the current approach is simply not working.  We need to recognise that and change accordingly.  I look forward to the support of other political parties if and when we decide to change the approach to get more effective results.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#W00100","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and colleagues.

When their advocacy funding was cut, they received a letter which informed them that they could call the Department to discuss the issue.

With much embarrassment, the Department said they could write.<\/p> <p>The fact that they could not access their own Parliament, as any other citizen accesses it, due to the lack of legislation giving them equal rights, is a more stark example of why this Bill is necessary.  When the advocacy funding was cut, we decided to organise a protest.  It was, however, not to be a protest outside the Parliament, but one inside it.  Needless to say, it was to be a silent protest.  We asked that the members of the deaf community be allowed into the Visitors Gallery of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, their Parliament, and that sign language interpreters would be allowed into the D&aacute;il Chamber to let them understand what was going on.

This Bill is necessary not only for this Parliament to understand why we need to treat all citizens of the nation equally but because it is a life and death issue.  While we have procedures of sorts in place in our accident and emergency departments there is no requirement for our health services to have in place procedures for members of the deaf community.  With funding issues causing pressure across the health services, we need protocols in place and legislation that require the provision in our accident and emergency departments, other Departments and local authorities of services for members of the deaf community.  I again praise Deputy Joan Burton who when Minister for Social Protection put in place a system in that Department which ensured interpreters are made available to members of the deaf community, most of whom, because of their circumstance, require social welfare assistance.  How does one access social welfare assistance if one does not know one's rights?  As a result of the actions of a particular Minister, this is no longer a problem area.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will be aware that we are breaching international law.  Provision is made in the Good Friday Agreement for Ulster Scots, Irish Sign Language and British Sign Language.  In Northern Ireland, Irish Sign Language and British Sign Language are underpinned by legislation.  People have rights in regard to communicating with the state be that by way of Irish Sign Language, British Sign Language, the Irish language, English or Ulster Scots.  In the South, we have ignored the international agreement we signed up to.  We do not recognise Irish Sign Language even though we committed in the Good Friday Agreement to putting it on a legislative footing.<\/p> <p>When it comes to communications with Departments, modern technology allows this to happen without the need for interpreters.  There are already in place systems and services that allow online interpretation.  This means that a member of the deaf community who is in Dublin can interact effectively and efficiently with, say, Kerry County Council without an interpreter.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, is committed to this cause.  This is not an easy issue.  The Bill also crosses the remit of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and RTE, our national broadcaster, which is another reason for the enactment of this legislation.  There are guidelines in respect of the provision of sign language interpretation on our national airwaves and in regard to captions for programming.  However, these are only guidelines and there is no consequences for not adhering to them.  RTE, the national broadcaster, which receives hundreds of millions of euro in taxpayers' money does not even meet those guidelines for the most marginalised in our community.  The most watched programme by the deaf community is not \"Coronation Street\" or any other soap opera such as \"Emmerdale\", it is \"Ros na R&uacute;n\" because it has captions and subtitles.  What we are attempting to do by way of this Bill is ensure that members of the deaf community can understand what is going on in the outside world not only in terms of entertainment but in terms of news.  <\/p> <p>I was delighted to be at the launch of the report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  I thank members of that committee, some of whom are members of this House, who following two weeks of hearings on this issue recommended that this legislation be supported by the Government.  I also thank the Chairman, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who recommended the passing of this Bill, which is a rare event in itself.  The key point, repeatedly referenced in that report, is the \"extreme marginalisation\" of members of the deaf community.  That is the issue we are addressing today.<\/p> <p>I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, was involved in many of the 1916 commemorations.  In terms of the issues faced by the deaf community, the most quoted line from our Proclamation is \"...cherishing all of the children of the nation equally.\".  I will end on this anecdote.  During the commemorative parade in Dublin of the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising, some members of the deaf community could not understand what the commentator was saying.  While there were sign language interpretation for those on the streets, members of the deaf community who were at home could not understand what the commentator was saying.  Again, it was a lack of understanding on the part of the hearing community of the issues faced by members of the deaf community.  I hope that the Minister of State will support this Bill and not only at this Stage but on Committee Stage when work in terms of amendments and necessary improvements to it will be dealt with.  Fianna F&aacute;il looks forward to its amendments in that regard being accepted and to working with the Government and various agencies to ensure that the ambition of the Proclamation that all we cherish all of the children of the nation equally is fulfilled.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take this Bill.  I also thank him for his support for this cause over the past number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#Y00900","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I take this opportunity to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to the House.

That the Gallery is full shows how important this Bill is.<\/p> <p>It is an honour for me to second the Bill.  I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Mark Daly, for his dogged commitment to this Bill, which deals with an issue on which he has tirelessly campaigned for over six years.  Senator Daly brought this Bill before the House on two separate occasions during the lifetime of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government but on each occasion it was rejected.  I am hopeful that there will be a change of heart on this occasion and that the Bill will receive cross-party support today.  I also pay tribute to the Irish Deaf Society which has been campaigning on this issue for over 30 years.<\/p> <p>As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, I was delighted to support our report which recommends the passage of this Bill.  We were fortunate enough to have excellent contributions from members of the Irish deaf community who outlined to us in stark terms the hurdles facing their community when trying to access the health system, the justice system and the education system.  They also outlined how transformative it would be if Irish Sign Language was recognised as a native and independent language.  The contributions were all the more poignant when we learned a short time after these presentations to the committee of the tragic deaths of brothers of Daniel and William McCarthy in their own home.  This illustrated the urgent need for the rights of the deaf community in Ireland to be officially recognised and to end the social isolation experienced by these people.  Recognition of this Bill and of the Irish Sign Language would allow members of the deaf community to play a full part in society, which we should all support and encourage.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I call on all Members to support the Bill strongly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#Y01000","speaker":"1376","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives of the deaf community to the Chamber, many of whom I have got to know in recent years as a result of the very intensive and appropriate campaign they, in particular Dr. John Bosco Conama, have run.

It was the best or worst kept secret, but it is the right thing to do and we are all here to do the right thing.  This is a classic example of the new politics.  People such as Senator Mark Daly and I who are on opposite sides in many debates are at one on this issue, as are the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, Sinn F&eacute;in and all of my good friends and colleagues on the Independent benches.  We all want to see this happen.  Yet again, Seanad &Eacute;ireann has stood up to the plate to delivers something tangible which will really make a difference to the lives of well in excess of 5,000 citizens of the country who are among the most marginalised not because they do not have the intelligence, ability or focused determination which many of the rest of us possess but because society has not provided them with the equipment and the level playing pitch that facilitates equality.  What society can call itself a society of equals, one that represents equals, when people cannot go a public office and gain access to simple information on their entitlements?  It is crazy.  The one section of society which has been forward-thinking in this regard is educational institutions.  I pay tribute to Trinity College Dublin, in particular, and other third level colleges which have done their duty to ensure people can obtain qualifications, degrees and diplomas, and have access to information.<\/p> <p>I agree with the Deputy Mark Daly that RTE is a thundering disgrace.  It is shocking to think Ros na R&uacute;n is the only tangible option available to members of the deaf community simply because the captions necessary for them to watch other soap operas are not provided.  This organisation has a public service obligation, but it is not honouring it for the deaf community.  Everyone sees the interpretation of the news for three or four minutes before the main bulletin at night, but this is not enough.  In a modern era on the eve of ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, a five or ten minute tick the box exercise by the national broadcaster is not something that should be acceptable.  The Minister of State should be banging down the door every day of the week, telling RTE that it needs to get its act together and live up to its responsibilities in this regard.  Then again, how can the Minister of State do this when the Bill is still on the books and not been passed?  How can the Government, irrespective of what political party or creed it is, take on public bodies and point to their obligations and responsibilities when we as a House have not legislated properly and effectively to deal with it?<\/p> <p>In the previous term members of the deaf community attended the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and I were proud members.  They did so again this term, under the chairmanship of Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee is quite right - it was a very powerful interaction.  They provided practical examples of how they simply could not connect or communicate because of the lack of availability of interpreters.  The lack of a right to the availability of interpreters is frightening.  There are approximately 40 or 50 qualified interpreters in the country and there is no continuous professional training available to them.  All of this will have to change.  I am clearly of the view that the Bill will pass not just through this House.  When we put it up to them, Members of the other House will have little option but to pass it because, thankfully, we are in the era of new politics which can ensure the voices of small minority groups are heard.  When the Bill is passed into law, the responsibility will very much fall on the State to put the necessary structures in place.  Perhaps the young people from Bishopstown might consider doing a degree course in sign language interpretation because plenty of work will be available.<\/p> <p>The Bill must be passed and we all have an obligation to ensure it does, but it will not be easy.  As Senator Mark Daly said, the work will begin on Committee Stage when the Government will outline the practical challenges and Senators will try to identify ways to overcome them.  The fact that Seanad &Eacute;ireann will pass the Bill on Second Stage today means that it agrees with the principle that we need to extend recognition to Irish Sign Language.  This is a very good day not just for members of the deaf community who are citizens but also Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I look forward to the rest of the debate and hope that within a short period we will see the Bill passed into law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#Z00800","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Senator Victor Boyhan.  <\/p> <p>This is certainly a day of debate on justice and equality issues.

It is clear that he has shown great commitment to this most important cause.  The Bill is primarily about equality, ensuring equal opportunities for all citizens and I will lend it my full support.  Recognition of Irish Sign Language by the State is something that should have occurred many years ago.  Irish Sign Language is recognised in Northern Ireland but not in the Republic.  The lack of recognition impacts on members of the deaf community in almost all of their interactions with the State, in education, health care provision and even the justice system, ultimately marginalising them.<\/p> <p>This is a matter which affects almost 40,000 citizens.  Irish Sign Language is used by deaf people, their families, friends and colleagues.  Members of the deaf community do not have the same access to public services as other citizens.  Lack of access to Irish Sign Language in education, in particular, is a source of great concern.  It impacts further on the employability of members of the deaf community.  As such, many members of the deaf community feel marginalised, economically and socially.  This important legislation should provide improved access for members of the deaf community to education services, benefiting, in particular, the youth and, I hope, reducing their sense of marginalisation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Billy Lawless:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2485\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2485&amp;amp;pid=BillyLawless&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Within the justice system, excluding criminal court proceedings, there is no automatic right of deaf people to an Irish Sign Language interpreter.

Then I came in this morning to find a letter from a 17 year old student from Waterpark in Carrigaline, County Cork.  I want to share some of it with the House because it crystalises and summarises everything about this issue.<\/p><blockquote>Dear Senator,<br \/><br \/>[I] am proudly Deaf.  I am 17 years old.  I go to Bishopstown Community School in Cork.  My first language is Irish Sign Language (ISL) and I am using it to communicate with my friends and my family since I cannot speak.  I am writing this letter to ask you to pass the law for Irish Sign Language to be recognised.  I think it's extremely important that we, deaf people, have our primary language which is Irish Sign Language recognised.  Deaf people have fought for the bill for Irish Sign Language to be recognised for many years.  My primary language is Irish Sign Language and I love learning different ... languages such as American Sign Language.  In fact, ... the United States of America have already passed the law for American Sign Language (ASL) to be recognised.  [In] other countries such as Finland, Finnish Sign Language is already recognised there in 1995, 21 years ago!  That was before I was ... born.<br \/><br \/>...<br \/><br \/>My disability doesn't stop [and shouldn't stop] me reaching my goal [and my potential].<br \/><br \/>A young woman came to visit me in my school on Thursday 6th of October ... She is a Mexican deaf person who works in the White House in America as a receptionist to Barack Obama.  The first deaf receptionist.  This amazes me a lot.  She is an inspiration to me.<br \/><br \/>...<br \/><br \/>Please can you pass this bill for Irish Sign Language to be passed and recognised as a third official language?  I would be extremely happy.  It would end the &quot;silent war&quot; between deaf people and the government.  This would give ... people more equality and more rights.<br \/><br \/>Thank you for your time and your concern to read this letter.<\/blockquote> <p>Why would I not read this letter?  It says it all.  I urge all of us to come together and unite in support of the Bill, not only here today, but also as it progresses.  We can pass all the legislation and Bills we want, but I appeal to the Minister for the necessary resources and funding to give effect to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#AA00400","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Is c&uacute;is br&oacute;id agus sonais dom go bhfuil m&eacute; in ann ard&uacute; chun tac&uacute; leis an mBille seo inniu.  A part of me thinks that maybe the rest of us would be wise to shut up and not say any more because Senator Boyhan was right: that letter very much said it all.  I have been overwhelmed and very impressed by the level of correspondence to us over the past weeks, not least from the students of Bishopstown.  I sat down, like Senator Boyhan, to write a speech to fill eight minutes.  However, when I reflected on and thought about the contribution the Irish Deaf Society made at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality a few weeks ago, its representatives did not work off any notes or prepared speeches or statements.  All of it came from a very sincere, personal experience.  I thought I would try to do the same because of the thoughtfulness we encountered at that presentation in the committee.  The presentation was very profound in its simplicity.  I say that because it took a presentation and an engagement like that with the deaf community for someone like me, and I am sure many others on the committee, to realise the very basic, small and sometimes minute levels to which the difficulties faced by deaf citizens go.  It is about accessing hospital care, getting into shops, what TV programmes they are able to watch and access to the courts and the criminal justice system.  The range therefore goes from the macro elements that are so significant and important aspects of many of our lives right down to the mundane, day-to-day things.<\/p> <p>Senator Mark Daly, who has done sterling and powerful work on this campaign, referred to this important year of the centenary of 2016 and the challenge that era and the Proclamation throw down to us to fulfil the aspirations contained in it that we cherish all the children of the nation equally and that we afford rights and equality to all our citizens.  That is what this Bill and this issue is about.  It is as simple as that.  It is about human rights, equality of access, equality of service, equality of aspiration and equality of ability.<\/p> <p>Reflecting on it from a personal perspective, I was trying to relate to the difficulties and the issues faced by deaf citizens.  While Irish Sign Language and British Sign Language are legislatively recognised in the North, the Irish language, which is the language in which I was brought up and educated, is not afforded those legislative or legal protections.  While I have the luxury - when one listens to the issues faced by members of the deaf community, it is a luxury - of being able to communicate in a second language, I do relate to the issue of not being recognised or not being afforded the same rights or entitlements based on something so personal to someone; something so deep-rooted in someone; something so simple; something that is in the first instance merely a form of communication; and something used as a tool to share one's passions, concerns, fears and love.  It is as simple as that, and that is all people want and that is all that they deserve, as modest and simple a request as it is, so I commend the motion.  It has the full support of Sinn F&eacute;in and myself.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan made a critical point when he said that we can pass all the Bills we wish.  I do not doubt the sincerity of all the contributions that have been made and will be made in the time ahead, but this needs to be resourced.  It needs the adequate resources to go alongside it to ensure we have not just wasted everyone's time here today; that the students, in particular those from Bishopstown who have joined us today, can take a degree of hope and faith when they leave this Chamber today; that we, as the second House, the Upper House of the Oireachtas, will work on their behalf and will stand up diligently for their rights and entitlements; and that this Bill, while in one aspect a culmination of a campaign, is hopefully just the first step on another journey, that is, a journey of the deaf community having full rights, full entitlements and full recognition by this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#AA00500","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>May I share a minute or so with Senator Buttimer, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#AA00600","speaker":"1375"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Six minutes and two minutes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#AA00700","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Yes or thereabouts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#AA00800","speaker":"1375"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Does the Senator mean five minutes and three minutes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#AA00900","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Six and two.

Are we committed to the inclusion of people with disabilities or are we merely paying lip service to it?  It is right and proper that we meet the needs of these vulnerable people.  Currently, we have over 5,000 users of Irish Sign Language in the State and it is fair that public services provide them with interpretation services when questions of statutory entitlement are at issue.<\/p> <p>What do we mean by inclusion?  We mean that all people with all types of disabilities are part of our society.  However, living in the community is not enough.  People with disabilities have the same right to participate fully in society if they choose.  Without access to language, many people with hearing impairments do not have that choice.  People with disabilities have a right to competence and have a right to any adaptations they need to show that competence.  Above all, people with disabilities have the right to the same dignity and respect as every other citizen.<\/p> <p>Our accomplishment as a society is measured by the extent to which people with disability achieve those rights.  Recognising Irish Sign Language as the third official language of the State would render our society far more equal than it is now.  This Bill is important not just for people with hearing impairment.  Like the marriage equality Bill, this Bill is about our maturity as a society.  It is about our growing ability to embrace diversity.  It is about equality.  It is good for all of us.  I am happy and proud to support the Bill.<\/p> <p>I would like to thank all those who contacted me and others so respectfully and so appropriately over the last number of weeks, especially the lovely notes that came from the students of Bishopstown Community School.

As Members have referenced, it is about equal access and about working with Government rather than Government working against this.  The important point today is that this House will not be divided and, from what I gather, we will all support the Bill.  We are fortunate that in the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, and before him, the former Minister of State, Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, we have people who understand the impact of disability and the importance of working together to bring change, as members of political parties or otherwise.<\/p> <p>I would invite Members to visit Cork Deaf Enterprises and to talk to the people in Bishopstown Community School who have been pioneers over many decades in highlighting and in bringing change for members of the deaf community.  As Leader of the House, I know it is important that we understand this legislation is not perfect.  I commend Senator Daly for his work in the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  We must ensure we use this day, not as the beginning or the end, but as a staging post on the road to what we all want to see, namely, recognition of Irish Sign Language and making life better for all of our citizens so we can all enjoy and celebrate life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#BB00900","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Senator Lynn Ruane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#BB01000","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I commend Senator Mark Daly on the fantastic work he has done in the Committee on Justice and Equality on the issue of the Irish Sign Language Bill and in bringing the legislation forward.  I was not aware of this so I appreciate the education I got on this issue in the committee.  I was initially appalled when I realised Irish Sign Language was not officially recognised in this country, despite the fact the deaf community use it on a daily basis to communicate with their loved ones, educators, statutory agencies and advocators.<\/p> <p>As I have said before and will say again, we are judged in this country by how we treat our fellow citizens.  It is a disgrace that, in 2016, our nation does not recognise Irish Sign Language.  It is imperative that we ensure that Irish Sign Language gets the full recognition it deserves and that those who use it get full and equal access to information via Irish Sign Language.  No child in this country should suffer at school due to the lack of teachers qualified in Irish Sign Language.  We want to build a nation of well-educated young people, regardless of the barriers that are in front of us.  Every person who engages with Government bodies on a daily basis has a right to receive information in a way they understand and can use to communicate.  It is rare that Irish Sign Language is made available in Government and statutory agencies.  Senator Daly has brought up the issue and we should not shy away from wanting to provide this service.  By doing so, we are embracing social inclusion and equality for the deaf community.<\/p> <p>Senator John Dolan makes his apologies for not being present today because he is away in Brussels.  He is working tirelessly to ensure the Government ratifies the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The right to use one's own language is an important human right.  The convention mentions sign language in its five articles.  We should do the right thing and ratify the convention and recognise Irish sign language officially.  The European Parliament has passed two resolutions calling on member states to recognise their respective national sign languages but only five EU countries have done so - Denmark, Finland, Portugal, Sweden and the UK.  We have not been shy in implementing what Europe has asked us to do in the past, so why have we stalled on this for such a long time?<\/p> <p>The cross-community groups of deaf-related organisations should be commended for their outstanding campaign, and we have received lovely letters in the last few weeks.  We should also commend the councillors in Donegal and Limerick who voted to have Irish Sign Language recognised at a national level.  As elected representatives, we have a duty to tear down the barriers and make equality of opportunity a national right by implementing this Bill.  We will be on the right side of history for the deaf community in Ireland.  If we get Irish Sign Language recognition, this will ensure more legal rights for Irish Sign Language users, better access to public services, better education for deaf children, better third level education and training for deaf adults and better interpreting, quality and monitoring.  We have nothing to fear from this and we should embrace it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#BB01200","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Mark Daly for bringing the Bill before the House.  I am delighted to be here on the second or third occasion it is debated and to, hopefully, see it pass.  I would also like to thank Dr. John Bosco Conama and everyone from the Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College for their work on this Bill and their ongoing dedication to fighting for equality for the deaf community.<\/p> <p>For the approximately 5,000 deaf people in Ireland, the lack of language recognition has had the effect of ingraining discrimination into their everyday lives.  It has exacerbated the problems of isolation for most.  We saw earlier this year a court in Donegal proceed with a case when the defendant was deaf and had no interpreter present.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We would be up in arms about that situation if it happened to one of our citizens facing court proceedings abroad where they did not understand the native language.  Here in this State we allow such an obvious violation of a person's human rights to take place.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, those inequalities exist throughout the State, in our health system and in our education services.  The incredibly sad deaths of Daniel and William McCarthy earlier this month, tragically brought to the fore the extent of the social isolation endured by members of the deaf community.  I have spoken about this recently in Trinity College Dublin, and I feel the need to say it again as a community development worker.  If someone like a community development worker never made the effort to communicate at all with those two brothers, in their very small community of Bluebell, then what chance do other people have?  Their own community services did not recognise them.  People who have disabilities are more likely to experience income poverty than the rest of society.<\/p><p>Among the deaf community those statistics speak for themselves.  People who are deaf have significantly lower employment expectations with only 40% in employment, well below society's average.  Those who are employed are likely to be paid low wages, they are significantly less likely to go to college and in many cases have low life expectancy.  As it stands, service providers are under no obligation to recognise sign language.  Children who are deaf do not have the right to education through Irish Sign Language.  There are no automatic rights to interpreters and the Government has continuously failed to recognise the rights of children who are deaf, under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Under Article 2 of the convention, children are entitled to access all the rights of the convention without discrimination.  In Ireland, however, children who are deaf are being indirectly discriminated against as they are not guaranteed access to the curriculum through the medium of Irish Sign Language, their first language.  This means the child cannot always fully participate in and benefit from education, their language and cultural needs are unmet and the children are hindered in achieving educational outcomes on a par with their hearing peers.  Ireland is just one of three countries in Europe yet to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath has given a commitment to address this and I hope he does so without delay so Ireland can join the other 167 countries that have ratified the convention.<\/p><p>Hearing people need to shift their focus from thinking of deafness as a purely medical phenomenon and we need to attempt to understand that there is a culture and a language that we have ignored and that deafness becomes problematic because of the discrimination inflicted by society.  If Irish Sign Language is viewed as a minority language rather than as a disability it will help us to understand it better.  When people who are deaf gather together, for example in the deaf village in Cabra, there is no communication barrier and no discrimination.  It is only when they leave that setting that their language becomes a problem or a disability because we have not catered for their inclusion.  We make their language a disability.<\/p><p>It is perhaps because those 5,000 people are spread across the State they have not been a powerful enough lobby group to make politicians care about their issues, but that should not be our motivation.  We should be motivated to do the right thing.  Suppressing their right to self expression is an attack on their human rights.  We need to stop discriminating against these citizens and ensure they are given the same rights as everyone else.  The lack of language recognition has led to the disempowering of one of the most socially excluded groups in the country.  We have the chance now to take a stride forward by recognising Irish Sign Language and by ensuring that all children who are deaf have access to education through sign language.  We should also be teaching basic sign language to hearing children at school.   This could have huge long-term benefits in terms of social inclusion for the deaf community.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill.  The Civil Engagement group and I will be voting in favour of Irish Sign Language recognition.

I also welcome those from the deaf community who join us here today; the young people and the signers who are interpreting for the people in the Visitors Gallery.  Sometimes in this Chamber one knows something special is about to happen because of the attendance of Senators, the Visitors Gallery is full and because there is something in the air.  In view of the campaign which was undertaken by those who feel passionately about this, there is something in the air.  This issue is about silence, it is about empowerment and it is about citizenship.<\/p> <p>If the Leas Cathaoirleach will allow, I shall speak directly to the young people here today who have been mentioned by other Senators.  Often it is very difficult to stand up for yourself but it can be even more difficult to stand up for others.  If you were here earlier you would have heard a conversation in the Chamber about the Traveller community.  Speakers across the House spoke about the necessity to stand up and recognise the Traveller community and do better by them.  If you had been in the Chamber this morning you would have heard Senators across the House speak about the issues in Aleppo and Ireland's responsibility to do something with regard to what is happening in Syria and to open our arms and our State to those who need us most.  It has been said that when it comes to issues that you feel strongly about as young people, you should ask yourself, \"If not me then who, and if not now then when?\".  As young people you have taken on this issue, you have brought it to the heart of the Oireachtas and you have made all of us who walked into this Chamber this afternoon know that something special is happening.  You should be absolutely commended for that, and you should realise the power that you have.<\/p> <p>Martin Luther King said, \"Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter\".  Much has been said about the 1916 Rising and the commemorations.  Maybe only now are we beginning to realise the depth of the wound caused by the recession in the State, which is about eight or nine years old, and the depth of the wounds it has caused to a generation of Irish people who may know nothing else but this financial crisis.  We can now reimagine the type of country we want to live in.  It is about citizenship, but how can you be a citizen if you are forced to live in silence? This is not a case of Government or politicians granting something to a section of our society, because the empowerment in these situations is very important.  It is about all of us, collectively, recognising the importance of citizenship.<\/p> <p>Let us realise what is happening across the world, in the United States of America, across Europe and in the United Kingdom.  Politics is turning into a section of Irish society pointing fingers and blame at others and saying the reason they are unhappy is because of that group or those people.  What you are doing today is allowing people to come in and be part of the common citizenship.  Often, this House and politics struggles to connect outside of these walls.  What you have done, and what the deaf community is asking for, is to become part of that common citizenship.<\/p> <p>I contend that the system should be bending over backwards to recognise a mechanism to break the silence.  The Labour Party supports this Bill absolutely.  I am glad that everyone in the House, across party lines, agrees - as happened this morning with the Syrian issue and as happened this afternoon with the Travellers' rights, and is happening now with regard to Irish Sign Language recognition.  It brings a level of political legitimacy to the House and also gives the message to young people, to old people, to citizens who are here in the Chamber today, of the power they have.  If you really want to make a change and if you believe in it enough, then there is nothing you cannot achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#CC00200","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I have a message for the House from the Oireachtas broadcasting unit.

It was tremendous when he was appointed given he also has a watching brief at Cabinet.  This is an important day for Senator Mark Daly, who has pioneered this issue for a long time.  As a result of the new dispensation and new politics, we are now in a position to pass legislation regardless of whether the Government likes it or not.  The Government has certainly proved in the past that it was not prepared to support this legislation.<\/p> <p>This Bill was counter-signed by Senators Keith Swanick and Catherine Ardagh and supported by the Fianna F&aacute;il group in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is a step in the right direction.  Senator Mark Daly, in particular, deserves credit because he has put a lot of work into this Bill, as have members of the deaf community, including Dr. John Bosco Conama from County Roscommon.  Dr. Conama, who works in Trinity College Dublin has pioneered the use of sign language.  We have all been proud to see him on RTE providing a service to the deaf community, particularly during the six o'clock news, on which he served for many years.  The work he is doing is very important.<\/p> <p>It is 100 years since the Rising.  It is surprising that the deaf have not been recognised in their country during those 100 years of freedom.

It covers every area and will assist deaf people in their dealings with the education system and the courts as well as other public authorities and services.<\/p> <p>To be deaf is to be in a lonely place.  I have met people with different disabilities.  This is a serious and profound disability, but people who are deaf have achieved an enormous amount in work as well as in serving the community.  In so many ways, they have been active members of their communities.  This Bill will ensure they will have a real voice in the State.  I urge the Government not just to pay lip-service to this - the House might excuse the pun - but to go along with the Bill proposed by Senator Daly and the Seanad.<\/p> <p>As I stated this morning, this House provides a service which is second to none.

I am, therefore, delighted to support this Bill and congratulate Senator Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#DD00500","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>We are very fortunate with this Minister of State.  I have known him for quite a number of years and I know he has a full and personal commitment in the area of disability.  I spoke with him yesterday and he indicated his absolute support for the Bill.  The last time such legislation was introduced in the House, it was defeated by three votes.  I am sorry and ashamed that happened.  I do not think it will happen today.  I do not think there will be a single voice raised against the Bill in this House.  Perhaps, therefore, it is not necessary to have a vote, although it might be good to have a vote to show the support of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>This afternoon demonstrates the relevance of Seanad &Eacute;ireann as an instrument for social change.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is very often not recognised as a fact but, as Senator Leyden said, this would not have happened without Senator Daly and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This is a personal initiative of Senator Daly.  I asked him whether the Bill was provided to him by the Irish Deaf Society.  He indicated it had helped, but he constructed the Bill himself with the assistance, and this is an important innovation, of a draftsperson supplied by the Oireachtas.  This will help us introduce more and more legislation.<br\/><br\/>The legislation is comprehensive.  I will not go into it in great detail as we can do so on Committee Stage, but I should say it needs a little bit of updating.  It speaks about the level of interpretive services and states we need 18,000 hours with a maximum of 60 hours per person by 1914.  I must inform the House that 1914 is well and truly past.<br\/><br\/>Last night, by coincidence, I was visiting a neighbour of mine in North Great Georges Street and I discovered that Dr. Charles Orpen, who started the first school for the deaf and used sign language, lived in the house in 1816 when he was running the school.  It is a curious little personal memoir.<br\/><br\/>I must pay tribute to the Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity.  Senators Ruane and Daly and I spoke at a very interesting meeting there.  I learned a great deal from the stories of deaf people.  I could not believe that until recently sign language was more less outlawed in educational institutions.  Children had their hands tied behind their backs.  This is a frightful violation of the human rights of deaf people and for that, as a hearing person, I apologise.  This is really shocking.<br\/><br\/>There are 5,000 deaf people and 40,000 additional people who are members of families, friends or relatives.  As hearing people, we do not really think about these things, but for these people sign language is not just sign language, it is their first language.  It is the language they use and the language they have.  As a hearing person, this had not really struck home with me.<br\/><br\/>It is astonishing that service providers such as Government agencies are not required to have interpreters.  Very often we see Polish translations, Rumanian translations and even Chinese translations, but we do not have translations for our own citizens.  I find this very shocking.  The ways in which the people are deprived of proper access to medical services, educational establishments and social services is dreadful.  It is one of the hidden crimes of this society.<br\/><br\/>More than 40 local authorities have passed motions accepting this legislation.  In Northern Ireland, sign language is recognised.  Is this not an astonishing thing?  Here is partition again.  The North has it and we do not have it.  There is no automatic right for deaf people to have an interpreter in court.  How astonishing that a person can be in court and not actually understand what is going on in a case being prosecuted for or against him or her.  I find this quite incredible.  I received a note from the students of the Holy Family School for the Deaf in Cabra.  They pointed out that if they have to go to hospital or to other places, they are stranded and are isolated.  They also strongly support the Bill.<br\/><br\/>I received an e-mail from a very interesting young woman in her early 30s.  She has been profoundly deaf since she was eight months old.  She spoke about her educational experience.  She did very well at maths but she was useless at English.  The reason was perfectly simple.  She had an interpreter for the maths class who was able to speak sign language.  This brought her on to the level of the other students.  In English class, there was no assistance, so she was trapped in a world of silence and fell behind.  When people's education suffers, their job prospects and social prospects also suffer so there is a continuing deprivation.  Last year a man crashed into her car.  The police came but there was no interpreter.  She could not understand what the garda or the other motorist were saying.  Again, she was absolutely stranded.  She had no possibility of a really positive interaction.<br\/><br\/>I received a note from somebody who was an interpreter, and I pay tribute to the interpreters here today and thank them for coming here.  It is splendid that Seanad &Eacute;ireann provided these facilities when D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann found it could not.  This shows the flexibility of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Very often there are no interpreters at parent-teacher meetings.  Interpreters cost &euro;120 to &euro;150, which is a lot of money for somebody on a small income.  The interpreter who wrote to me has been asked to go along on a<i>pro bono<\/i>basis to help out in these circumstances.  She also instanced the case of a woman whose daughter had been involuntarily put into a mental institution.  The mother wanted to discuss with the doctors her continuing treatment and what would happen to her, but there was no interpreter and she could not follow it.  In another case, that of a woman whose parent was dying, the doctors called a family meeting.  This woman looked after the parent but there was no interpreter and she could not take part in the meeting.<br\/><br\/>I pay tribute to students at Bishopstown Community School.  They are absolutely marvellous.  I received a terrific letter from them, which was really from the heart, about the number of deaf people and the fact there is only one interpreter for every 643 people.  It was signed by a couple of hundred signatures.  This is wonderful.  It shows the genuine decent support of ordinary people for their deaf colleagues.<br\/><br\/>I very much hope the Bill will pass.  It will help people like Mary, a woman who was sent at five years of age to a deaf school and came back when she was 22 to a little farm in the midlands.  For four years, she had no social interaction whatever until somebody who had been at the school with her invited her to a party.  Her parents did not want to go because they were afraid for her safety.  She went and met other young people there.  All of these people will be helped by the Bill.  I congratulate Senator Daly and the deaf community.  It is a good day for Ireland that we will pass the Bill this afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#DD00600","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I support in principle the thrust of the Bill, which will help to bring about equality and inclusion.

I understand the Minister has promised legislation to ensure that all public bodies provide Irish Sign Language users with free interpretation when availing of their statutory entitlements.

It is an issue of core principle because it is one of equality and justice, and it is important that we underscore that equality.  I commend all those who have already been commended, particularly Senator Mark Daly and others who have put this principle on the agenda repeatedly.  During times when we have been told to roll back our ambition for society, Senator Daly has said &quot;No&quot;, that this is a core question of justice and has put the issue forward again and again.  Again, I am very happy to see there is support across the House for the Bill.<\/p><p>However, it is also a matter of taking those principles and putting them into practice.  Senator John Dolan, our colleague in this group, and many of the other Senators in the Civil Engagement group have been pushing and pressing for the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I recognise that the Minister of State has also committed now to ratifying that.  This Bill is a very real example of what it means when one ratifies such a treaty.  It does not just mean that one signs one's name or gets applauded.  It means real resources.  It means the kind of detailed, practical, actual, meaningful offers and proposals set out in such detail in this Bill.  This is what happens when principle is translated into practice, and I hope this will set a template for that meaningful translation of principle into practice across so many areas of disability in Irish life.<\/p><p>I want to highlight two other specific issues on participation.  Before I talk about participation, I will talk about privacy.  It is all Ps for me today.  Privacy is something that was spoken about very eloquently by Senator Norris as well.  Communication has many functions.  One of the important questions is the discretion and dignity of human beings and their ability to communicate and to have their discretion and dignity respected, not to rely on <i>ad hoc<\/i>solutions or a family member to be immediately privy to all their information and not to have people stepping in - children in many cases - as interlocutors for family members when they should not have to do so.  Each person has the right to communicate as an individual person and to be facilitated in that by use of his or her preferred language, in this case Irish Sign Language, ISL.  We have been read many letters - I will not recite any; others have spoken of them - in which people talked about how it compromised their privacy and dignity, for example, in medical situations, not to be able to communicate themselves as themselves.  I again welcome the fact that the Bill sets out such real and clear procedures surrounding the registration of those supports.  What does it mean when we supply real, qualified, appropriate translation in all aspects of our State?<\/p><p>Lastly, I want to speak briefly about participation.  We have heard about the participation of citizens.  This is not just the services received, but also participation given by citizens.  This facilitates people to give into society and to participate fully.  That is why it is important we remember that the recognition of ISL is not just an issue that affects a minority.  When everyone participates in society we make better decisions and get better outcomes, and when a minority cannot be part of a debate in society, we all lose out - all of society - so again I welcome the Bill.<\/p><p>My last point concerns cultural participation.  It is not just a matter of functional participation.  It is about culture as well.  When we recognise ISL, our whole culture and society will be deepened.  We can all look forward to what we might hear from those who will now be putting a new language on the agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#FF00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>At this stage we have 20 minutes before I call the Minister of State.

One particular letter expressed very clearly how important it was that Irish Sign Language be recognised.  The writer, a lady who has been deaf since the age of two years when she contracted meningitis, was kept in a mainstream school by her family where she struggled terribly to follow teachers and obtained poor leaving certificate examination results.  She subsequently completed a post-leaving certificate course in Dublin, which she barely passed.  Her letter describes how her self-esteem and self-confidence were shattered by her inability to achieve what she believed she could achieve.  She later discovered the deaf community and started to learn Irish Sign Language.  Ten years later she completed a course and successfully graduated with a degree in adult education and training.  It took her 16 years after taking the leaving certificate examinations to get a degree because she did not have access to Irish Sign Language.  The point she makes is that she faces a constant struggle to access health services, justice and information.  She describes having to constantly ask, beg and fight for access to Irish Sign Language.  <\/p><p>This is an important day.  It is vital that we treat deaf people as equal citizens by recognising Irish Sign Language and empowering them to communicate and achieve all they can.  I thank those members of the deaf community who have contacted Senators.  They should keep their campaign going.  I will vote in favour of the Bill and hope it will proceed through the Houses as quickly as possible.  I also hope resources will be provided to ensure members of the deaf community have access to proper services and an ability to achieve the best they can.

I would like to add my voice in support of this excellent Bill and commend Senator Daly on bringing it forward.  I also welcome those from the coalface, the experts and the members of the deaf community who have joined us here today.<\/p> <p>Like others, I too was impressed to be contacted by so many people.  I noticed two things in particular.  I heard from a lot of people I know who either have family or professional connections.  These include people working in chaplaincy, members of the deaf community themselves and others who are involved in education.  We get so many e-mails and there is so much lobbying, but the content and the people who were writing to us made it impossible to ignore what we were getting.<\/p> <p>The other thing that struck me was the richness of the real-life stories, although on occasion they were also very sad.  We have heard some of them here today.  We were reminded of cases where, for example, deaf people were badly treated in hospitals.  In one case a number of years ago, a man set out to walk 50 miles home to Clifden but was killed on the way.  Having been delivered by taxi to a hospital, he was not helped in the appropriate way to get transport home.  That is just one of many stories.  We have been reminded, of course, that it is not all doom and gloom, that there is a vibrant deaf community and that Irish Sign Language is rich and capable of expressing every kind of concept.  <\/p> <p>It is our duty to ensure what will happen, hopefully, in legislation will be followed up with resources and practice.  I have also heard from people who are anxious to keep the St. Joseph's centre open.  We were reminded of just how difficult it can be when members of the deaf community find themselves isolated in nursing home situations and have no one they can contact.  While the HSE might have a particular policy about care within the community as opposed to congregated settings, which might be very wise, it is also important to have facilities that can provide top notch attention and amenities to those in the deaf community.  We need to honour and respect that viewpoint as well. <\/p> <p>I conclude with words of thanks and continuing support.  I know the Minister of State cares about this issue and we hope the Government follows up with the necessary action. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#HH00200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I thank all Members for their co-operation.

I thank Senators for their wonderful contributions and their sincere and heartfelt views.  If I have the opportunity, I would love to respond to all the points raised by the Senators.<\/p> <p>As I listened to the Senators' contributions and heard their passion for and commitment to human rights and the great sense of social justice, I thought of Martin Naughton, the great disability rights campaigner, whose funeral I attended last Saturday in Baldoyle and who was buried in An Spid&eacute;al in County Galway.  I had recently appointed that great Galway man, who fought for many years for the rights of all people with disabilities, to the task force dealing with disability issues.  It is relevant that people such as Martin are remembered on days like this one.  May he rest in peace.  The battle for disability rights goes on and the Seanad did that ethos proud today. <\/p> <p>I am happy to have the opportunity to join in the debate on the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016.  There are approximately 5,000 users - although I suspect the number is much higher - of Irish Sign Language in the State and it is fair that public services provide them with interpretation services at no cost to the user when questions of statutory entitlement are at issue.  I will not oppose this Bill and, when I raised it, there was no opposition to it at Cabinet yesterday.  It is important to let people know that as well. <\/p> <p>The sponsors of the Bill, including Senator Mark Daly, have done a valuable public service by putting the need to cater for the rights of users of Irish Sign Language on our agenda in the Oireachtas.  I look forward to continuing the discussion on the Bill once it has completed the necessary pre-legislative scrutiny phase.  Our discussion is particularly appropriate as we move toward ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, something which was touched on by many Senators today.  As Members will be aware, the Government is committed to ratification of the convention and we are working on finalising the details of the necessary legislation to remove the final legislative barriers to that ratification.  Government hopes to be in a position to publish this Bill in the very near future.  We also intend to ratify the convention&rsquo;s optional protocol at the same time as the convention itself is ratified.  I have set my heart strongly on that.<\/p> <p>Members will know that interpretation services for deaf people on a State-wide basis are provided by the Sign Language Interpreting Service, SLIS, which was established by the Citizens Information Board in 2007.  The SLIS is a limited company with a board of directors comprising representatives of key stakeholders such as the Citizens Information Board, Deaf Hear and the deaf community.  SLIS receives State funding directly from the Citizens Information Board.  In 2016 it has an allocation of &euro;275,000.  It is generally acknowledged that the SLIS does superb work in its provision of an extensive range of services.  That it intends to build on its current capacity is clear from its statement of strategy document for 2015 to 2020.  In particular, the service intends to increase availability of interpreting services in key areas of daily life, particularly where deaf people are exercising their rights or entitlements.  We need to move on that. <\/p> <p>I have to flag a number of questions about specific provisions in the Bill, which I am sure will be examined carefully in the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  While the central principle of the Bill is sound, it seems to take a perhaps disproportionate approach to the provision of services for users of Irish Sign Language.  Even prior to the publication of this Bill, I had approved a draft of the new national disability inclusion strategy, which we are working on.  It proposes the following action for public consultation: &ldquo;We will propose legislation to ensure that all public bodies provide Irish Sign Language (ISL) users with free ... interpretation when availing of their statutory [entitlements]&rdquo;.  More work will be needed - and I take on board the Senator's points in the debate today - to tease out the detail of how this will operate but, in principle, we need an approach focused directly on statutory entitlements.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We know from our experience of the Irish language and the Official Languages Act that what is really important is developing the capacity to provide services in the language of the customer's choice and that enacting legislation or a constitutional protection will not resolve the practical service delivery issues that need to be planned for.  This matter needs to be examined closely.  We need a pragmatic and feasible approach backed up by statutory recognition of the rights of users of Irish Sign Language but also to ensure we can guarantee the service can be delivered in practice.  A number of Senators spoke about the importance of delivery and the provision of resources.  I got the message.  <br\/><br\/>The following are elements of the Bill at which we need to look.  The preambles are not a feature of how we draft primary legislation and do not seem to be necessary.  I am not sure anything useful would come from the proposal to impose an obligation on public bodies to develop three-year action plans for Irish Sign Language, as provided for in section 9.  The establishment of a new public body to be named the sign language interpreting service by the Citizens Information Board rather than allowing the board to continue to develop an ISL service, as it has been doing, does not seem to be necessary.<br\/><br\/>Section 18 includes a provision to offer the annual accounts of the new body for sale.  It is usual practice to publish accounts online and it is difficult to see how this provision is necessary.  <br\/><br\/>Section 19 provides for borrowing by the public body to be established under section 12.  Allowing an Exchequer-funded public body to borrow money is manifestly not a good idea.  Of particular concern is how the loans would be controlled and repaid.  <br\/><br\/>Section 29 provides for a sentence of 12 months imprisonment for either offering interpretation services or teaching Irish Sign Language on a commercial basis without being registered.  I accept that there is a need for proper standards, but this approach is unnecessarily punitive and will do nothing to address the real issue - the need to develop the availability of Irish Sign Language interpreters.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has considered the proposed amendment of section 43 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as set out in Part 4 of the Bill in consultation with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, and makes the point that the proposed approach would remove an important part of the broadcasting regulatory framework from its natural and appropriate statutory focus, namely, the Broadcasting Act 2009.  Section 43 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the preparation of statutory rules by the BAI which place a range of statutory obligations on broadcasters.  In the case of persons who are deaf or have a hearing impairment, persons who are blind or partially sighted and persons who have a hearing impairment and are partially sighted, the BAI has adopted access rules which contain specific target percentage ranges in regard to, <i>inter alia<\/i>, sign language and subtitling with which broadcasters are required to comply.  These are revised by the BAI from time to time in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  In addition, sections 53 to 55, inclusive, of the Act provide for an investigation and potential enforcement action in circumstances where there has been an apparent breach of a broadcasting rule.  It is noted that this latter aspect is not provided for in the proposed Bill.  Furthermore, section 43(6) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for biennial reviews of the access rules to be undertaken by the BAI, thereby allowing for potential revisions to be made to the rules.  In Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the proposed Bill, however, it is proposed to incorporate a number of percentage targets for the period 2017 tjo 2019 which appear to have been taken from the current access rules.  The Bill makes no provision for any review or potential revision of these targets.  As such, the Schedule would become outdated every two years, which is a matter to be reflected on.  <br\/><br\/>It should also be noted that Part 1 of Schedule 1, as proposed, omits certain services such as Oireachtas TV, Irish language TV and UTV Ireland.  Following on from the BAl's extensive and ongoing consultations with user groups, it is evident that the quality and reliability of access service provision is as, if not more, important than the achievement of targets which are only a quantitative measure as such.  The BAI's regulatory approach facilitates a far more flexible and consultative approach that takes account of improvements in the quality, reliability and range of access service provision, for example, increased live subtitling, subtitled Irish content, etc., rather than just quantitative targets as envisaged in the proposed Bill, thereby providing a regulatory approach that delivers in a more comprehensive and nuanced way on the wishes of users and intended beneficiaries of the services.  <br\/><br\/>All of these points will need to be considered carefully as the examination of the Bill moves forward in the Houses.  I am happy that the Bill will move to the pre-legislative scrutiny stage and that in due course, in the light of the assessment by the Oireachtas of the Bill&rsquo;s proposals, we can work together to see what amendments are needed to create the focused right to interpretation which I would welcome and to remove some of the other elements that do not seem to be appropriate, as mentioned.  <br\/><br\/>The new national disability inclusion strategy I mentioned is relevant.  The strategy which it is intended will be in place before the end of 2016 includes, as I stated, a specific action to create a statutory right for a person to receive free Irish Sign Language interpretation services when availing of statutory services.  In taking this approach we will still need to tease out in detail several issues, including how statutory services are to be defined and whether advance booking of the service would be required.  This approach will provide a more fruitful way forward in that rather than the overly elaborate approach provided for in the Bill, it will be focused on meeting real needs in a pragmatic and cost-effective way.  One of the issues Senators might consider is whether it would be better to build on the existing supports provided for the provision of interpretation services by the Citizens Information Board or to establish a new pubic body, as proposed in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the contributions of all Senators to the debate, during which some very serious issues were raised.  I share the sentiments expressed by Senators Lorraine Clifford-Lee and Mark Daly about the tragic deaths in Dublin of the McCarthy brothers.  We need to focus our attention not only on the issue of isolation but also on the need for change in broader sections of society.  As Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities, I have met approximately 3,000 people with physical, intellectual and other disabilities, as well as service providers, from whom the message is that broader society has to change and that the mindset has to change in dealing with this issue and, in that context, this legislation.  <br\/><br\/>As I said, I am not opposing the Bill.  For me, it is about equality and respect, but it is also about citizens' participation.  I take the opportunity to thank Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for his work on this issue.  As the Deputy is not a Member of this House, perhaps his Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues who are Members of this House might bring that message to him.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Billy Lawless raised the important issue of employment and also referred to the justice system.  Senator Victor Boyhan spoke about the urgent need not only for the enactment of legislation but also about the provision of resources to back it up.  Employment of members of the deaf community is a huge issue.  There are many talented deaf people, with many of whom I have engaged.  The unemployment rate among members of the deaf community is too high.<br\/><br\/>Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile spoke about the important issue of rights and equality.  Senator Gabrielle McFadden has made the very good point that we must ensure we will not pay lip-service to this issue.  While, in this instance, we are speaking about the needs of the deaf community, meeting the needs of all people with disabilities is an important issue.  Language is important in the context of inclusion and respect within broader society.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Jerry Buttimer, a former teacher, mentioned that we should look at Cork Deaf Enterprises.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is something I would like to visit as part of my portfolio.

We have to make political decisions.  Senator Higgins also spoke about the important matter of participation in broader society and in this debate.  I have learned that it lifts everybody.  I was in Donegal on Monday, and I met many children with physical disabilities in Dungloe.  I saw children of seven or eight years of age with major physical elements and how they participated in society.  I thought about their future.  I spoke to their young parents, who are still very upset about finding themselves in this very difficult situation.  The issue is the interaction between the people in the preschool services and other social care services and the key word is participation.  It was refreshing to see that a group of young parents of young children with disabilities are coming through the system who will not let their children be treated as second-class citizens.  It is important that we send this message.<\/p> <p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell thanked the students and mentioned the importance of communication and how this particular legislation has been handled.

I want to preface my remarks by saying we have an exemplary Judiciary and in no way does anything I am suggesting today seek to undermine the calibre or integrity of the Judiciary, which has served this nation with distinction.<\/p><p>The independence of the Judiciary is a central tenet of our democracy and is enshrined in the Constitution.  Article 35.2 of the Constitution states: &ldquo;All judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law&rdquo;.  Judicial independence does not just exist for the benefit of judges; it exists also for the people.  It ensures public confidence in the administration of justice, and without that confidence, the rule of law would be threatened.<\/p><p>The objective of a judicial council was not set out as an objective of the Government in the current programme for Government and there is no reference to such a council in the document that guides Government policy.  That is not to say it is not supportive in principle, and I have spoken to a number of people in government who are sympathetic and supportive of the principle of a judicial council.  In order to safeguard public confidence in the Judiciary, I propose this motion and I call on the Minister to publish a judicial council Bill without further delay.<\/p><p>With regard to the background to the motion, in 1999 the Working Group on a Courts Commission provided a report to the then Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, now deceased, on the question of judicial conduct and ethics.  This was against a backdrop of the resignation in that year of a High Court judge in what was known as the Sheedy affair.  One of the recommendations of the working group was the establishment of a judicial council which would promote excellence and efficiency in the performance by judges of their judicial functions, and would provide a process for investigating complaints of alleged breaches of judicial ethics.  The Chief Justice established a committee to examine the general issue and it produced a report in December 2000, known as the Keane report.  The report concluded that the existing structures for dealing with concerns as to judicial misconduct were inadequate.  It contained reasonably detailed proposals for new legislation.<\/p><p>In 2010, the then Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, Mr. Dermot Ahern, introduced the general scheme of a Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the 2000 report, the Judicial Council Bill 2010.  The general scheme of the Judicial Council Bill was published in August 2010 and it took into account the recommendations of the 2000 report.  The purpose of general scheme of the Bill was to establish a judicial council of all judges to promote high standards of conduct among judges and supports for judges.  Central to the Bill is provision for effective remedies for complaints about judicial behaviour.<\/p><p>The provisions include the establishment of a judicial conduct committee, with lay participation in the investigation and consideration of complaints.  This is very important and I hope it will be taken on board when a new Bill is finally published.  The Bill envisaged the establishment of the judicial council as an independent corporate entity with its own board.  It would also facilitate the ongoing support and education of judges through the Judicial Studies Institute and by the establishment of a judicial support committee.  The general scheme of the Bill proposed the establishment of a judicial council of all serving members of the Judiciary which shall be independent in its functions and have its own seal.  Functions of the judicial council should be to maintain and promote the following: excellence in the exercise by judges of their judicial functions; high standards of conduct among judges; the efficient and effective use of judicial resources; continued education among judges; and respect for the independence of the Judiciary.  I acknowledge the last point and want to stress it today.  The judicial council might consider other matters, perhaps a register of interests for judges, but that is a matter for it.  I am very conscious of the separation of powers and of the issue of interference by the Executive in the workings of the Judiciary.<\/p><p>In conclusion, the establishment of a judicial council is not just being called for by me but also by the Chief Justice, Ms Susan Denham.  In an article in the October edition of the <i>Law Society Gazette<\/i>, the Chief Justice said the lack of action in establishing a judicial council was a matter of real concern both for the Judiciary and the State.  She added that the Judiciary had been advocating for its establishment for over 20 years.  The establishment of a judicial council is long overdue.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, to the House.  I concur fully with and support completely what has been said by Senator Boyhan.<\/p> <p>By way of background, I was appointed Attorney General in 1999.  I succeeded David Byrne as a member of a Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics which had been established, as Senator Boyhan said, in the wake of the Sheedy affair.  I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2002 and my Department set about the preparation of legislation to give effect to the judicial council idea as recommended in the report.  It was my intention at the time that we should do so in consultation with the Judiciary and I set about, through the usual channel, seeking the views of the Judiciary rather than seeking to impose on them without consultation the model that had been recommended in the report.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is a matter of record, one about which I was reminded recently while reading about it in a newspaper, that the process never came to fruition while I was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The impatience on the part of the current Chief Justice was to be found at that time in the Department.  As far as it was concerned, the reason the matter was not being dealt with as a matter of urgency lay in the Four Courts, although precisely where the blame lay in the Four Courts is a different matter.<\/p><p>Whatever the history of the issue, the heads or scheme of a Bill were published in 2010, as Senator Boyhan stated.  Six years later, the need for a judicial council is as obvious now as it was then.  Such an institution is badly needed to protect the Judiciary and guarantee its independence.  In these circumstances, we should have an assurance from the Government that the scheme is about to be published in Bill form.<\/p><p>There has been controversy in recent times about whether there is an arrangement in place, at Cabinet level at least, between some members of the Government and the Independent Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, that no new appointments will be made to the Bench until the Bill the Minister favours is passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas and made into law.  There is no evidence that the exact scheme, as adumbrated in the programme for Government, has the support of a majority in either the other House or this House.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has tendered a Bill which is a better model and one that is more likely to produce better recommendees for appointment to the Bench.  I do not know what other Senators' views are on the matter.  Whether Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill is progressed, whether the Government introduces a Bill or whether some kind of consultative process commences between the Government and the Deputy that gives rise to the early progressing of his draft legislation is beside the point.  The real point is that there cannot and should not be a circumstance where members of the public are told by one Minister's political advisers, through the media, that there is a moratorium on the appointment of judges.  I note the chairman of the Bar Council has pointed out that this is improper.  It is wrong to hold up the process of appointing badly needed judges pending the delivery of legislation, which has not even be drafted, let alone put before a committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Judiciary should not be used in this manner and the issue of appointments to the Judiciary should not be hijacked to make a political point. <\/p><p>If the Government has so little confidence in its members collectively to select good judges, it says more about it than anybody else.  The Government is not even bound to accept recommendations made by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  If it has so little confidence in its ability to select good members from either side of the legal profession to become judges - people of quality, integrity and independence - it speaks very badly of the board.  <\/p><p>I fully accept that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Independent Alliance have an appetite for reform of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  While the two Houses are putting in place reforming legislation, there is no reason the board cannot be trusted to carry out its constitutional duty to select good people to be appointed to the Bench.  It is a scandal that one Minister could give the Government the impression that he has effectively put his foot on the brake to stop such appointments because he does not trust himself and his colleagues to make proper appointments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#LL00300","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Good point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#MM00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach.  It is great to have a busy Minister of State take time to come to the House and show respect for the Seanad and the work it does.  I thank Senator Victor Boyhan for proposing the motion.  He and his team put much thought into justice issues, as is reflected in the important motion before us.<\/p> <p>I listened carefully to Senator Michael McDowell outline his experience as Attorney General and subsequently as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform over the eight-year period between 1999 and 2007.  During that period, it was not only problematic but nearly impossible to move on this issue.  This shows how slowly the wheels are turning on this issue.  I have no doubt that the fault lies in the Four Courts, as the Senator noted.  The Department may be much maligned but it would certainly not delay a measure by eight years.  Large bodies move slowly and many traditional bodies do not want change, as was evident during the previous Government's term when the Legal Services Regulation Bill was challenged.  While some of the concerns raised about that legislation were genuine, and they were addressed in the final product, as it were, they were symptomatic of a profession that is slow to embrace change, although to be fair, when it embraces change it does so fully. <\/p> <p>I share the concern expressed by Senator McDowell on media speculation that a certain Minister has an issue with the making of judicial appointments and wants specific legislation passed before any meaningful judicial appointments are made.  This does not say much for the eminent judges who were appointed in the past 20 years by various Governments under what may be described as the old system.  Ireland is extremely fortunate to have judges of the utmost integrity and it is appropriate that the separation of the Judiciary, Executive and Legislature is observed to the nth degree.  <\/p> <p>When legislation finally comes before the House it will introduce safeguards and proper checks and balances to ensure a procedure is in place for dealing with a member of the Judiciary who is not following the eminent traditions of the Judiciary, if one likes.  Such legislation is necessary and would bring us into line with many of our European neighbours in respect of the appointment of judges.<\/p> <p>In my experience, motions of this nature in the Seanad are important because they ensure a Minister comes to the House to account for the Government's position on the subject of the motion.  I am pleased to note the Government is not opposing this motion.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is a very positive statement that they agree with the principle of the motion.<\/p><p>We have a unique facility here in Seanad &Eacute;ireann by which any one of us can table a motion.

I certainly look forward to what the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, will have to tell us, particularly in terms of the timeline.  We all know this legislation is imminent.  We all know that it is on the autumn legislative programme, known as the A list.  If it is on the A list, it means that it is the Government's absolute intention that it should be with us prior to the Christmas recess.  We are talking about seven or eight weeks, probably.  The Minister of State may even be in a position to tell us which week it will come before us.  He will be delighted to know that we in Seanad &Eacute;ireann will have no problem initiating the Bill and putting it through this House in the first instance, as we have done with many other Bills, in the unlikely event that the D&aacute;il schedule is packed with legislation.  From where I am standing, the D&aacute;il has plenty of time to discuss legislation because there is precious little going through it.  In the event that the D&aacute;il has a problem and there are difficulties with timetabling, we would be very happy to initiate the Bill in this Chamber.<\/p><p>I offer many congratulations to Senator Boyhan and his assistant for putting this together.

The establishment of a judicial council is a hugely important matter and one which the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and I fully support.  As outlined by Senator Boyhan, Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward a judicial council Bill in 2010 in an attempt the ensure continued public confidence in judicial integrity.  As a result, an interim judicial council was established in 2011.  It was tasked with dealing with pending legislation to provide for a judicial council.  Following this, the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government pledged to legislate to establish a judicial council with lay representation to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints against judges.  The pledge was not honoured and the Government reneged on yet another of its promises.  I therefore find it difficult to believe, as the T&aacute;naiste stated in this Chamber last week, that a Bill to provide for the establishment of a judicial council would be produced in this session.<\/p> <p>The establishment of a judicial council would go a long way to ensuring that Ireland fulfils its commitments under the Council of Europe's group of states against corruption, GRECO, report recommendations.  GRECO's evaluation report published in November 2014 stated that Ireland should establish a judicial council within 18 months following the adoption of the report and that it should report to the group on the actions it has taken in response to the recommendations.  This deadline was extended to the end of September 2016, yet still no serious action has been taken by a Government that continues to drag its heels on the issue.  The current placement of the judicial council Bill under all other legislation displays the demotion of its status from previous Government legislative agendas.  The Irish Judiciary and other concerned bodies have been advocating for the establishment of a judicial council for more than 20 years in an attempt to ensure that the Irish Judiciary would have a forum for the professional development of judges, a standard-setter in the area of judicial ethics and a safeguard for the separation of powers.  A judicial council would facilitate interactions between the Judiciary and other branches of Government, supporting the independence of the Judiciary and providing a mechanism for the investigation and handling of complaints around judicial misconduct.<\/p> <p>Once again, I commend Senators Boyhan, McDowell and Craughwell on bringing this issue before the Chamber.  I hope that this House can put pressure on the Government and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to act on the GRECO recommendations and finally establish a judicial council to promote and support the continued excellence of our judges in performing their judicial functions.

My party and I agree 100% with the sentiments that are in it.  It is outrageous, frankly, how long it has taken to address this issue.  It is indefensible.  The Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, has repeatedly raised the need for this.  We talk about ombudsmen, oversight and all the various institutions that have emerged over the past two decades.  Clearly, there has been a need for judicial oversight.  In terms of the separation of powers, that obviously has to be a judicial council.  There is also a need for the training of members of the Judiciary on an ongoing basis and a need to ensure consistency in sentencing, accountability and so on.  It is absolutely vital.  I would argue it is fundamental to our democracy.  I hope the Minister of State's comments today will give some indication of a timeframe in which we will see a Bill and this issue moving forward.<\/p> <p>I want to make some related comments on the issue of judicial appointments.  It is very unfortunate that there has been a perception that some members of the Judiciary were appointed not because of their ability but because of their political affiliations.  That is unfortunate because I believe if someone has been a member of or an adviser to a political party, it should not rule him or her out of being appointed to the Judiciary.  There is a process that is better than the one we have now.  I tabled a Bill in the previous Oireachtas that laid out that there would be a shortlist of three for every judicial vacancy, that the shortlist would be given by the relevant body that is in place now to the Government to make a decision and the reasons would be published.  There would be full accountability as to the reason each person had been appointed to the Judiciary.  That would take away any perception of criticism or any question over the decisions the Judiciary would make.<\/p> <p>A problem also presents itself at Supreme Court level.  One of the main tasks of the Supreme Court judges is to interpret the Constitution.  Obviously, it is critical that there is a Supreme Court that is representative of society.  There must be a balance of progressive and conservative, of left and right within that Judiciary.  If one member of the Judiciary is seen to be representative of the political establishment or to have been appointed by the political establishment, whether correct or not it impacts on confidence in the decisions that are made.  The Chief Justice is rightly concerned about the delays.  By the way, the Bill that I tabled was interestingly exactly the same system that the Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, recommended herself, as it happened.  She is obviously a very respected person and has been advocating for changes to the way judicial appointments are made, for more accountability and for a judicial council.  We need to sort this out.<\/p> <p>Finally, I want to comment on a sentencing council.  In England and Wales, there is a commendable model of a sentencing council.  I know the Minister of State is familiar with it.  I am a big supporter of that system.  There is a council that is significantly made up of the Judiciary, other experts from academia and so on.  They consult with the wider public around the range of sentencing that is appropriate for a particular offence.  There is still a degree of flexibility.  One is not saying to a member of the Judiciary that he or she must give a sentence of two years for a particular offence.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A range of sentences is available but whatever sentence they hand down, judges must be clear on the reasons for it.  The public has been consulted about what is appropriate, a range of sentencing has been put in place and it has been ensured that the judiciary is accountable.  If a decision is made in the Circuit Court in Donegal, Cork or Waterford, there must be a commonality in sentencing in order that people can have more confidence in the system.  A sentencing council should be established.  I published legislation on this and presented it to the previous D&aacute;il and I may well reintroduce it in this Seanad.<\/p><p>The Government needs to sort out judicial appointments, introduce legislation to establish a judicial council and a sentencing council.  It must be ensured the public can have full confidence in the sentencing the Judiciary is tasked with and in the training and the ongoing dialogue between judges to ensure consistency across the State.<\/p><p>I commend the Senators on their motion, which is spot on and which is well drafted, and I hope it will create an impetus for the Government to act in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#NN00500","speaker":"1400","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I thank the Senators for tabling the motion.  It is important that we discuss this matter because it has been discussed for more than 16 years and we should now try to move forward.  Members have outlined the delays but it is important to recognise the changes that have been made in the courts in recent years, in particular, the establishment of a Court of Appeal, which has taken a significant workload from the Supreme Court.  I recall waiting for three years for a case to be listed for hearing in the Supreme Court, as a result of which many decisions were delayed.  The Court of Appeal helps the process and it is dealing with cases efficiently and quickly.  Recently a matter was referred by way of case stated from the High Court to the Court of Appeal because there had been two conflicting decisions in the High Court.  When the matter came before a High Court judge, she referred it by way of case stated to the Court of Appeal and the matter was dealt with and a decision given in a short time, which is a welcome development.<\/p> <p>I agree that a judicial council is needed.  The Chief Justice and all other members of the Judiciary have been looking for this for some time and it is important that there is not a further delay in introducing it.  I also agree with colleagues that there should not be delays in judicial appointments.  It is important that at all times we have an efficient judicial system.  A number of years ago, there was a four-year wait to get a High Court case heard in Cork.  There were 6,000 cases on a waiting list to be heard in Cork at the time.  We have come a long way since then.  Recognition should also be given to the Courts Service, given the significant increase in commercial law work because of the downturn.  This took the form of liquidations and receiverships.  The courts dealt with them efficiently, despite that the fact that their workload increased dramatically.  A proper system of checks and balances is needed and a judicial council is the way forward in this regard.  It has been talked about for a long period.  The Judiciary are in favour of it and they have given their views as to how it should be dealt with.  The Government is drafting a Bill and it should be brought forward and dealt with at an early date.  We would have no difficulty if the legislative process commenced in this House.  There are enough Members who can give their views on the draft legislation and it could be processed efficiently.  Given the new system of pre-legislative scrutiny, it is important there are not further delays and that the council be established.<\/p> <p>I also agree with colleagues that we have been fortunate down the years to have had a good and fair system.  People felt some judicial appointees over the past 20 or 30 years would follow a particular line but they went down a contrary line to make sure they maintained their independence.  They took a number of constitutional cases, which established good law.  In these cases, the legislative process had been delayed and, unfortunately, the courts had to intervene to make sure that what was in place was appropriate for the times we lived in.  The courts are not in place to formulate legislation but where the Legislature falls down, they have to make sure that citizens can access services and that their constitutional rights are protected in the process.<\/p> <p>I welcome the debate and I agree this legislation should be brought forward at the earliest date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#OO00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and I also welcome the motion.  My colleague, Senator Black, is our spokesperson on justice and equality and she would normally have contributed but she is unable to be present.  I had the opportunity last week to participate at the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe in the election of new judges to the European Court of Human Rights.  It was interesting to observe that process in action.  A shortlist had been selected and scrutiny and oversight was transparent.  The curricula vitae and qualifications were scrutinised fully and only a few candidates were allowed to go forward on a shortlist before we had the opportunity to vote.  I do not suggest that is the system for Ireland but it sent a great signal of confidence because people fully trusted and engaged with it to appoint judges.  There is an opportunity here to instill that sense of strength, confidence and engagement.  I do not impugn the processes followed in this State but this system presents an opportunity for something better.<\/p> <p>The Group of States against Corruption, to which Ireland subscribes, has explicitly among its 11 recommendations for Ireland, in terms of ensuring the visible absence of corruption and sending a strong signal to others across Europe, the establishment of a judicial council.  We had that signal from Europe but we also have champions in the State in respect of this issue.  Ms Susan Denham, Chief Justice of Ireland, has been emphatic and strong in pleading for progress on this issue following many years of delay.  She described a council \"as a necessary element of the infrastructure of a modern democratic state\".  She has made a strong and credible case but she also referred to something which is more important now than at any point previously, which is that the council should be instrumental in promoting public confidence in the administration of justice.  There is a lack of public confidence in justice in Ireland and in many other parts of the world.  People must not only experience justice as being fair and equal but it must be seen to be transparently so.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Building and strengthening public confidence in our justice system is vital.  I recognise, of course, the complete independence of the Judiciary and that, as public representatives, we have a separate and different role.  However, there are things within these proposals which could serve to strengthen and underscore public confidence in the Judiciary.  One of them was spoken about by Senator Boyhan who referred to a judicial conduct committee with lay participation.  That is a constructive and positive proposal which can build public confidence.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mac Lochlainn spoke about the idea of a sentencing committee which might engage with NGOs and civic society.  There is a huge role to build public confidence and engagement in the area of training.  It is an area on which I wish to focus in particular.  As an appropriate and positive way to strengthen judicial training, one area where that might be looked at I suggest respectfully and constructively, is violence against women.  The <i>UN Handbook for Legislation on Violence Against Women<\/i>has highlighted the importance of training and capacity building for judiciaries in areas like this.  It has also been highlighted in respect of the introduction of new legislation.  For example, as Ireland ratifies the Istanbul convention, access to justice will be part of the process.  It is important that there is an appropriate, independent mechanism to facilitate that kind of training and engagement.<br\/><br\/>Recognising that it is a question for a judicial council and not for us here, I support the idea of a register of interests for the Judiciary.  It is a very constructive proposal.  While it is not for us to determine, it would be constructive and strengthen and underscore public confidence in all our judges.  This is an opportunity.  It is a positive and constructive step forward.  Whichever Bill it comes through, whichever proposals are adopted and whatever shape it takes, what is important is to hear from the Minister how she can respond as to how this will move forward in the next year.  How will she send that kind of signal at a time when it is most needed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#OO00300","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, to the House.  It was a pleasure to work with him on the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence in the lifetime of the last Seanad and D&aacute;il.  I look forward to working with him on many of the issues the joint committee worked so hard on over those few years.  It is also worth paying tribute to the proposer and seconder of the motion, Senators Boyhan and McDowell.  It is a motion which deserves wide support, which I understand it has received on a cross-party basis.<\/p><p>The principle of the establishment of a judicial council has been with us for a long time.  Senator Boyhan kindly gave me a copy just before the debate of the <i>Law Society Gazette<\/i>article from October 2016 with the headline &quot;Chief Justice Slams Government over Judicial Council Delay&quot;.  I said to Senator Boyhan that I had the full text of the Chief Justice's speech from 26 September 2016.  While the position is perhaps somewhat overstated in the headline, she was certainly very critical of the 20-year delay in enacting legislation on a judicial council.  This proposal has been around for a long time and there is widespread support for it.  As we know from the Chief Justice and others, the Judiciary has been to the fore in calling for this legislation.<\/p><p>Before turning to the substance of the motion and legislation, I note that we debated the issue of judicial appointments this day last week.  In that context, I spoke about the need for diversity in the Judiciary.  It is something I have worked on for a long time.  In 2003, we published a report in Trinity College on gender injustice which looked at gender discrimination in the legal profession and the lack of women among senior judges.  That is something that has changed since the report was published in 2003.  We have seen a much better representation of women among the Judiciary, albeit there are still low numbers of women represented at senior ranks in the Law Library among senior counsel and, indeed, at senior ranks in the solicitors' profession also.<\/p><p>However, the great improvements made in the numbers of women appointed to the Judiciary must be acknowledged.  It is very welcome because greater diversity is to be welcomed in general.  In that context, I put down a motion in the lifetime of the last Government seeking clarity on whether maternity leave would extend to serving judges, an issue which the then-Minister acknowledged had not actually come to light previously.  It had simply not arisen given the particular demographic make-up of the Judiciary until then.  It is now clearly an issue and it is very welcome to see that we are moving on it.  I got a good response from the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and I will certainly be renewing my work on that issue.<\/p><p>Turning to the substance of this motion, the proposal for a judicial council has been with us for 20 years as the Chief Justice and others have explained.  It was mooted in the 1996 report of the Constitutional Review Group which recommended that judges themselves should regulate judicial conduct within a legislative framework embracing all courts.  Part of the difficulty has been the different approach taken between judges of the Superior Courts and judges of the District Court.  In accordance with Article 35 of the Constitution, there is a distinction between such judges.  Looking at the language of Article 35, we see the particular problem as identified by Hogan, Whyte and others which is the lack of a definition of &quot;incapacity&quot; or &quot;stated misbehaviour&quot;.  Article 35.4.1<sup>o<\/sup>provides that a judge of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal or the High Court shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity and then only upon resolutions passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann calling for his removal.  It does say &quot;his&quot;.  Part of the difficulty is how one defines &quot;incapacity&quot; and, in particular, &quot;stated misbehaviour&quot;.<\/p><p>As we know, there have been a number of instances in which there have been issues around the potential impeachment of judges, notably the Sheedy affair in 1999 and the Curtin affair.  In those instances, three judges in total resigned before any action was taken or could have been taken under the Constitution.  The Chief Justice and others have identified that part of the difficulty has always been the extremely difficult burden of moving an impeachment motion.  It is a very onerous requirement.  If we look at examples from elsewhere, as the Oireachtas Library and Research Service did in its spotlight paper of 2014, there are other jurisdictions in which different procedures are in place.  Mixed systems are in place where we see processes equivalent to a judicial council having been introduced.  That is the sort of model we should follow.  Others have commented on the international impetus for this.  We see in the GRECO recommendations that a judicial council should be established and that Ireland should report on the action within 18 months of the GRECO report of November 2014.  That 18-month period expired in April this year and was extended to September 2016.<\/p><p>The heads of the Bill have been published and others have spoken about them.  There is a momentum behind this idea, including domestically.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties and other bodies have also called for the establishment of a judicial council.  There is a great deal of consensus on the issue and we simply need to see movement on it now.  The motion calls on the Government to legislate and to commit to the early publication of a Bill.  Others have called for a timeframe.  I echo those calls.  We need a timeframe.  The principle is clear and the consensus is evident.<\/p><p>I commend those who moved the motion for bringing it forward and keeping it on the political agenda.  At a time when there is controversy around judicial appointments, this is an issue where there is no controversy and everyone is agreed on the need.  We need simply to see the early publication of legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#PP00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their welcome.

I have listened carefully to Senators and congratulate them on the issues they have raised and the quality of the debate so far.  I am happy to note that the Government has decided to accept the motion as proposed and welcomes the opportunity it provides to reflect on core issues in terms of the proper functioning of our judicial system.<\/p> <p>The motion calls on the Government to legislate for the establishment of a judicial council and to commit to the early publication of a Bill to provide for that establishment.  As indicated in the current legislative programme, a judicial council Bill is among those Bills which are a priority for publication this session.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->To be clear, that is before the next session starts in January.  This session will end when the D&aacute;il and Seanad rise in December.  There is intensive work taking place to ensure that the timetable will be adhered to.<\/p><p>As colleagues have said, the value of an independent Judiciary cannot be disputed.  It is fundamental to the working of our democracy and essential in terms of upholding the rule of law upon which all citizens rely, whether in the private family zone, in commercial relationships, in protecting against criminality or in vindicating rights where the State itself is often the opposing party.<\/p><p>Senators will be aware that, as matters now stand, Article 35.4.1&deg; of the Constitution provides that a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only upon resolutions passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann calling for his or her removal.  This constitutional process has been extended by statute to the question of removal and dismissal of Circuit Court and District Court judges.  Otherwise, with the exception of statutory provisions dealing with investigating and reprimanding judges of the District Court, there is no means of investigating or dealing with allegations which are not sufficiently serious to merit the invocation of the constitutional provisions.<\/p><p>Both this Government and previous Governments have been conscious of the fact that there is a need for an alternative structure to be put in place to deal with allegations of that nature, and the development of such a structure is a key driver behind the judicial council Bill.  Any legislative proposals must be mindful of Article 35.2 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann which, as acknowledged in the motion, provides that judges shall be independent in the exercise of their functions and subject only to the Constitution and the law.  The principle of independence derives further strength from international best practice.  I need only reference Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which proclaims the entitlement to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, and Articles 6 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, respectively, which also affirm the values of judicial independence and impartiality.<\/p><p>It is well known that the judicial council Bill has had a rather long gestation period.  The first key milestone was in 1999 when the Working Group on a Courts Commission reported to the then Chief Justice on the question of judicial conduct and ethics.  That was against the background of the Sheedy affair, as has been referenced here, the background to which need not be revisited on this occasion.  Subsequently, in December 2000, the report which is known colloquially as the Keane report, was published.  As Members are aware, it found that the existing structures for dealing with concerns about judicial misconduct were inadequate as there was no mechanism in being which would allow for the investigation of instances of judicial misconduct which were not so serious as to bring the constitutional sanction into play.  The report contained reasonably detailed proposals for legislation which were subsequently fleshed out in the form of a draft Bill prepared by Mrs. Justice Denham, who is now Chief Justice.<\/p><p>While that activity was happening on the domestic front, there was also activity taking place at an international level.  In 2000 the United Nations Centre for Crime Prevention invited a group of chief justices from common law jurisdictions, known as the Judicial Integrity Group, to address the loss, in many countries, of confidence in judicial systems.  The Judicial Integrity Group recognised that the principle of accountability demanded that the national judiciary should assume an active role in strengthening judicial integrity by effecting such systematic reforms as are within the judiciary&rsquo;s competence and capacity.<\/p><p>The group also recognised the need for a universally acceptable statement of judicial standards which, consistent with the principle of judicial independence, would be capable of being respected and ultimately enforced at national level without the intervention of either the executive or legislative branches of government.<\/p><p>Following extensive consultations with other common and civil law jurisdictions, the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct emerged.  The principles recognise fundamentals which are widely accepted in regional human rights instruments and in many countries, whether enshrined in domestic constitutions, in statutory provisions or flowing from the common law.  The core values which they reflect include independence, impartiality and integrity.  Propriety, equality, competence and diligence are also acknowledged.  The Bangalore Principles remind us of the need to ensure public confidence in the judicial system and in the moral authority and integrity of that system.  They aim to ensure that judges, both individually and collectively, respect and honour judicial office as a public trust, and strive to enhance and maintain confidence in the system which they operate.  They provide guidance to judges and to legislators.  They also offer a framework for regulating judicial conduct.<\/p><p>It is generally accepted, in relation to the regulation of judicial conduct, that such regulation must be undertaken by a body which consists in the main of members of the Judiciary.  There are two reasons for that.  First, regulation of this nature will ensure that independence is maintained.  Second, it recognises that the primary responsibility for the promotion and maintenance of high standards of judicial conduct lies with the Judiciary itself.<\/p><p>As I stated earlier, successive Governments have held the view that a structure needs to be put in place to deal with allegations of judicial misconduct and to facilitate the establishment of a platform for the promotion of excellence and high standards of conduct by judges.  However, despite the best efforts of many who have collaborated on this project over the years, it has not yet proved possible to publish a judicial council Bill.  That is not because of any conspiracy or hidden agenda.  Rather, I will echo Harold Macmillan in saying \"It&rsquo;s events\".  Drafting of the Bill has had, in the past, to give way to other pressing priorities.  Some of those arose from our troika commitments, and some concerned important social and societal issues such as the establishment of the Court of Appeal, the enactment of the Children and Family Relationship Act 2015 and last year&rsquo;s marriage referendum.  However, every effort is now being made to bring the drafting of the Bill to a timely conclusion to ensure the Bill is published this term, before the next session starts.<\/p><p>I will now turn to specific elements in the motion before us.  I note that its proposers have called on the Government to provide for effective remedies for complaints about judicial misconduct which will include lay participation in the investigation of those complaints.  In that regard the current draft of the Bill provides for the establishment of a judicial council and board which will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges.  It also provides a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct and, in this context, envisages the establishment of a judicial conduct committee with lay representation.  The motion also calls on the Government to provide ways to support and improve the operation of the Judiciary by providing for judicial studies and support committees.  It is intended that the Bill will make provision for such committees in order to facilitate the ongoing support and education of judges in a structured and focused manner.<\/p><p>It may be useful at this stage to outline briefly the Bill&rsquo;s main provisions, as currently envisaged, with the health warning that the provisions may be further developed during the ongoing drafting process.  Central to the Bill&rsquo;s provisions is the establishment of a judicial council of all serving members of the Judiciary and of a board which will exercise, on behalf of the council, the functions conferred upon it by the Bill.  Those functions are intended to include: the maintenance and promotion of excellence in the exercise by judges of their judicial functions; high standards of conduct among judges; the efficient and effective use of judicial resources; continuing education among judges; respect for the independence of the Judiciary; and public confidence in the Judiciary.<\/p><p>In the area of judicial conduct, the Bill will define \"judicial misconduct\" and will establish a judicial conduct committee comprising both judges and lay members.  The committee will be independent in the performance of its functions.  Those functions will include the consideration and investigation of complaints, with the possibility to resolve a complaint by informal means.  Additional functions will include the preparation and submission to the board of the council of draft guidelines concerning judicial conduct and ethics, and the specification and publication of the procedures to be followed in investigating a complaint, including the publication of guidelines for resolving a complaint by informal means.<\/p><p>Formal investigations will be conducted by a panel of inquiry.  Such a panel will have the power to make various recommendations to the judicial conduct committee, which may accept or reject them as appropriate.  Recommendations which could be made include the issue of advice to the judge concerned, recommending a course of action the judge should follow, for example, that the judge should attend a specified course, the issue of a reprimand to the judge concerned, the issue of a recommendation to the president of the court of which the judge is a member, and a recommendation for procedural or organisational change.<\/p><p>In bringing my contribution to a close, I wish to draw the attention of Senators to the provision in the recent budget of more than &euro;30 million in additional funding for the courts.  The increased funding brings the total gross allocation to &euro;140 million next year.  Included in the enhanced provision is capital funding of approximately &euro;23 million.  Provision is also made for expenditure of &euro;4.5 million for information and communications technology in courthouses and to upgrade and enhance ICT functionality in the courts.  The additional funding will also boost staffing across the Courts Service, in areas such as probate, wards of court and change management as well as in provincial court offices, thus driving reform and alleviating delays in front-line services.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I assure the House that the Government is mindful of the need to introduce legislation which has regard to the requirements of a modern Judiciary in a fully functioning democratic society.  As already indicated, publication of the judicial council Bill is a priority for Government and hopefully the Bill will be debated before this House in the near future.  For now, I look forward to hearing the further contributions of Senators on this important matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101900002#PP00300","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476869400,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank all the Senators who participated in the debate.

I am delighted that in recent times somebody decided, for whatever reason - I would like to think it was due to many of us here raising the issue - that the Bill found itself in recent times on the A list.  That is great, but as the Chief Justice, Mrs. Susan Denham, has pointed out in the past, there has been promise after promise after promise.  To be fair, Fine Gael has been in government for the past five years.  We need a timeline.

There are serious constitutional implications in terms of what the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, might be suggesting on which we need clarification.  We will have an opportunity to raise that matter again tomorrow in the Seanad and it is my intention to do so.  We need clarification in this House on whether, as has been expressed repeatedly over the past few days, a special, cast-iron agreement has been done with a member or some members of the Independent Alliance regarding appointments to the Judiciary.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  If there are vacancies in the Courts Service for judges they should be filled, regardless.  This is about justice and not politics or politicians.  <\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, for coming to the House for this debate.
