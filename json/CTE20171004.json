I also thank the members of the committee.  On behalf of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet in this module of its deliberations.  I would like to briefly outline the institutional structure and legislative basis of the commission for members of the committee and members of the public who may be less acquainted with our work.  The commission is Ireland's independent national human rights and equality institution.  It was established in primary legislation in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, following the merger of the precursor bodies of the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission and it has been in operation since November 2014.<\/p> <p>  Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally and I are two of 15 members of the commission, appointed by the Head of State, the President, following an open competition and resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have no reporting relationship to Government and account directly to the Oireachtas for our statutory functions.  We appear today, to represent the views of the commission, which for the record, are contained in our recent policy statement on a new legal and regulatory framework on abortion in Ireland, in light of its international human rights obligations.  The statement was submitted to the committee on Monday.  It will come as no surprise to the committee that we do not have consensus at the commission on this matter but, procedurally, section 16 of the Act facilitates majority decision making.  In practice, that means that when we meet in plenary we take a vote on matters that are contested and this matter has been put to the commission on ten occasions since its inception in 2014.  What we bring before the committee today represents the views of 13 out of 15 members of the commission.  Two members of the commission do not support the document in its entirety.  The commission's independence has been recognised internationally and we have been awarded A status accreditation at the United Nations, under the UN Paris Principles.  Those principles set out the necessary guarantees required to ensure that a national human rights institution can carry out its functions in full independence, free from any form of political or other pressure.  Through a range of legal powers determined by the Oireachtas, we are mandated to promote and protect human rights and equality in the State.<\/p> <p>  Of most relevance to today's discussion, is section 10(2) of the 2014 Act, which is to \"keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of human rights and equality\".  Under section 10 of the Act the commission is also mandated \"to consult with such national, European Union or international bodies or agencies having a knowledge or expertise in the field of human rights or equality as it sees fit\".  Ireland has ratified six of the nine core UN human rights treaties and is bound by those obligations as a matter of international law.  For each treaty, there is an expert independent monitoring committee that oversees compliance.  Ireland's compliance with the treaties is examined on a periodic basis and under our legislative mandate, the commission formally participates as the national independent monitor of human rights in this process and monitors the State's compliance with the recommendations.<\/p> <p>  UN treaty monitoring committees have regularly raised concerns regarding the current legal position in Ireland in relation to abortion.  Most notably, in 2016 and 2017 the UN Human Rights Committee found that Ireland had violated a number of rights of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, following complaints taken by Amanda Mellet and Siobh&aacute;n Whelan, both of whom experienced pregnancies with fatal foetal abnormalities.  I use that term as it is well understood.  I know it offends some but it is important that we all know what we are talking about.  In Amanda Mellet's case the UN Human Rights Committee found a violation of Article 7, namely, the prohibition on cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  The committee took the view that many of the negative experiences could have been avoided if Ms Mellet had not been prohibited from terminating her pregnancy in the familiar environment of her own country and under the care of the health professionals whom she knew and trusted.<\/p> <p>  The committee also found a violation of Article 17, namely, protecting the right to privacy, stating that: \"the interference in Ms Mellet's decision as to how best to cope with her non-viable pregnancy was unreasonable and arbitrary\".  The committee also found a violation of Article 26, namely, equality before the law, taking into account the financial cost of travelling to the UK.  The facts of the 2017 Siobh&aacute;n Whelan case were similar to those in the Mellet communication and relying on the same reasoning, the committee also found a violation of Articles 7, 17 and 26, namely, the prohibition against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, protecting the right to privacy and equality before the law.<\/p><p>The State&rsquo;s response to the UN Human Rights Committee&rsquo;s views in the Mellet case, which included an acknowledgment by the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, of its views, an <i>ex gratia<\/i>sum of &euro;30,000 and a detailed itemisation of the steps being taken by the State on foot of the case, further demonstrate the significance of Ireland&rsquo;s international legal obligations for domestic law and policy.<br\/><br\/>UN treaty monitoring bodies are the pre-eminent interpreter of Ireland&rsquo;s binding obligations in international law under the human rights treaties it has ratified.  Their views on Ireland are, therefore, authoritative and have a significant role in the interpretation, application and development of Irish law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily Logan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>It is the view of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission that the State should approach reforms on access to abortion in Ireland primarily as a matter of health care policy.  To do so would be in keeping with its obligations under international human rights law.<br\/><br\/>As the committee is aware, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 allows for terminations of pregnancy where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  This limited access does not meet the requirements of international human rights law.  Concerns about the barriers placed by the existing legal framework on women&rsquo;s right to the highest attainable standard of health, the right to privacy, to equality before the law, to non-discrimination and to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, as well as the State&rsquo;s special obligations towards minors, in particular the girl-child, have been raised by several international human rights bodies.<br\/><br\/>The position taken by UN human rights treaty bodies differs from the position taken by the European Court of Human Rights.  In the case of ABC <i>v<\/i>. Ireland, the court concluded that abortion law in Ireland struck a fair balance between the competing interests presented.  The court relied in particular on the right to travel abroad for abortion, as being significant in applying the fair balance test and in assessing the proportionality of the interference with a woman&rsquo;s right to private life.  A wide margin of appreciation was applied by the court.  Ultimately, the court concluded that the constitutional prohibition on abortion in situations where a woman&rsquo;s health or well-being were at risk pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of morals, and reflected the profound moral values of the Irish people.  The court did not accept that sufficient evidence had been presented of a change in those values since the adoption of the eighth amendment.  I would be happy to expand on this judgment in our discussion and subsequent case law from the court.<br\/><br\/>The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has made clear the &ldquo;realisation of women&rsquo;s right to health requires the removal of all barriers interfering with access to health services ... including in the area of sexual and reproductive health&rdquo;.  It has identified the criminalisation of abortion and restrictive abortion laws as among these barriers.  The committee has also specifically expressed its concern on the discriminatory impact on women who cannot afford to travel abroad to access abortion services or access the necessary information.<br\/><br\/>These concerns were reiterated in the views of the UN Human Rights Committee.  In her concurring opinion in the Mellet case, Professor Cleveland stated &ldquo;the committee&rsquo;s finding of a violation of Article 26 in the author&rsquo;s case ... is fully justified on grounds of discrimination arising from gender stereotyping&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is of the view that the key areas that require attention by this committee include the development of a legislative and regulatory framework that provides for access to abortion for reasons of risk to life and health; socio-economic or family circumstances; pregnancy as a result of rape or incest; and fatal foetal abnormality.<br\/><br\/>The commission has in the past raised concerns about the number of examinations a girl or woman may be subjected to where she seeks treatment under the current legislation, as well as the effect this may have on a woman&rsquo;s right to respect for her private and family life.  The commission has also raised concerns about the barriers that assessment and certification requirements place before women with restricted access to medical practitioners or health information, such as women from poorer socio-economic backgrounds, from ethnic minority groups, or with intellectual disabilities.<br\/><br\/>A reformed framework for access to abortion services under a wider set of circumstances should avoid the creation of new processes where vulnerable women and girls may be subject to trauma, re-victimisation, delays in treatment or other harms.  The commission is of the view that a new framework for access to abortion should place the decision-making process primarily in the hands of the pregnant woman in consultation with her physician.  The commission stresses the importance of ensuring that constitutional reform avoids replicating the barriers to human rights and equality that are in place.<br\/><br\/>Given these considerations, the commission recommends the referendum announced should allow for the development of a framework governing access to abortion that has a basis in primary legislation and regulation.<br\/><br\/>As has been highlighted at the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly and in other fora, the criminalisation of abortion constitutes a potentially serious chilling factor for women seeking medical care, as well as for health care staff providing such care.  The commission, therefore, is of the view that, notwithstanding limitations that may be placed on access to abortion by legislation and regulation, the State should decriminalise abortion in all circumstances, as required by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in its concluding observations on Ireland adopted in 2016.<br\/><br\/>The commission and others have highlighted serious shortcomings in Ireland&rsquo;s sexual and reproductive health education system.  In parallel to a reformed legislative and regulatory framework for access to abortion, it is crucial the State develop a comprehensive, scientifically objective, sexual and reproductive health education policy.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for its attention and we welcome questions and further discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally"},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Thank you, Professor Mullally.

In the practice of international human rights law, there is nothing that prevents protection for prenatal life.  However, in terms of what the UN human rights treaty bodies have said, for example, the draft general comment on the right to life from the UN Human Rights Committee suggests this should not preclude the protection of a woman's rights to have access to abortion, which is seen as part of the right to life, the right to health, the right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment and as part of the right to privacy and non-discrimination.

She highlighted in particular the discriminatory impact on women who may not be able to afford to travel due to socio-economic circumstances.  This has come up before several UN human rights treaty bodies.  It is also something that was commented on and found by the committee on social rights under the revised European Social Charter in the context of the collective complaint against Italy.  In that case, there was a finding of a violation of the right to health, read in conjunction with what were deemed to be multiple grounds of discrimination, including in particular socio-economic situations and location.

As such, we have been very slow to recognise the importance of educating girls.  Ultimately, we are saying that we should look at prevention.  While we are looking at the hard edge of abortion here, we must also wake up to the fact that we need to properly educate young people, not just girls, who may be sexually active, however uncomfortable that may be for some people.

There is no doubt that this is an emotive topic which divides opinion in all areas of society.  Indeed, opinion is divided in many households.  Both sides of the debate have very different views and it is important to listen to all views before we make a decision.  Not only that, we must respect each other's views and opinions.  Personally, I am against abortion on demand.  My fear is that if abortion on demand is introduced, it could become another form of contraception.  We all know that it is not simply a case of either introducing abortion or not introducing it.  My personal view is that we need to look at cases where a pregnancy is the result of incest or rape, where it could place the life of the mother at risk or where it could result in fatal foetal abnormalities.  I have specific questions for the witnesses and I address them also to all members.<\/p> <p>  We all know friends and family who have family members with Down's syndrome.  Statistics show that 90% of babies diagnosed with Down's syndrome have their lives terminated by abortion.  Even more alarming is the fact that 100% of babies diagnosed with Down's syndrome are aborted in Iceland.  I would be very interested to hear people's views on this and on whether they accept that we could have the same situation here should abortion on demand be introduced.<\/p> <p>  I listened very closely to each of the opening statements and was shocked that no one mentioned the rights of the unborn.  I would be very interested to hear people's views on the rights of the unborn and whether they believe they have any.  What measures can we take to ensure that the rights of the unborn, along with those of the mother, are protected?  I said last week here that a baby's heart beats 21 days after conception.  Facial features start to form at week 4, internal lungs begin to form at week 6, the nervous system is responsive at week 8, babies are swallowing, yawning and sucking at week 9 and the baby stretches and jumps at week 11.<\/p> <p>  Professor Mullally stated that the commission is of the view that a new framework on access to abortion in Ireland should place the decision-making process primarily in the hands of the pregnant woman in consultation with a doctor.  What would happen if both parties had a different view?  For example, what if the woman wanted to terminate the pregnancy but her doctor was against it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#G00400","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick.

This does not mean that we do not listen to those opinions.  In less than three years, the commission has had ten very serious submissions whereby it has commented on this issue.  That has meant we have had to listen to everybody's views.  It is contested but that does not mean we can set aside our respect for each other as human beings.  As such, we do our level best to try to do it within the commission.  I respect, of course, that the Deputy does not share our views.

One of the things that was called for in the past was a review of the SAVI report of 2002 which looked at sexual violence in Ireland.

It should be possible to ensure that decisions are made in a timely way and that access is not theoretical but is practical and available to all without discrimination on grounds of socioeconomic circumstance or location.

There are two parts to that question, the first being the possible challenge to the UN's competence.  That is not uncommon in jurisdictions.  Certainly in the past 14 years I have been involved a lot with and been in front of UN bodies.  I know it is a political response, so it is not uncommon that politically a government may seek to undermine the competence of the UN Human Rights Committee.  The committee has said that it is well aware of this and recognises it.  The UN Human Rights Committee prints what are called general comments that are thematic elaborations on its thinking on things.  The committee has said in individual communications that it recognises that while it is not a judicial body, it arrives at its decisions in a judicial spirit, which undermines the principles of impartiality and independence.  The second part of that question relates to the legal basis for those decisions, which speaks to the Deputy's question about the response of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  In linking this with the international law principles of the Vienna Convention, there is something called the \"good faith principle\".  If a government ratifies a treaty, it creates a legitimate expectation that it is going to comply with the terms of that treaty.

My first question is for Ms Logan.  I have read the new position paper released today, Human Rights and Equality Considerations in the Development of a New Legislative and Regulatory Framework on Abortion.  I respectfully put it to Ms Logan that it is very noticeable that there is not a single mention in the entire document that recognises or speaks up for the rights of the unborn child.  Am I correct in concluding that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission believes that unborn babies are unworthy of any meaningful protections in law?<\/p> <p>  It is a fact that the eighth amendment has saved countless lives.  I am privileged to know personally families who were considering abortion but changed their minds at the last minute before travelling abroad.  These families openly admit that had abortion been legal in Ireland and had there been abortion clinics close to where they lived, their son or daughter would most likely not be alive today and enjoying the same chance of life as Ms Logan, me and everyone else present here today and all those in the wider community.  Has the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission spent any time considering all the good that has been done by the eighth amendment?  Why is there not as much of a mention in the document published today on all that is positive about the eighth amendment?<\/p> <p>  I wish to address a question to Christina.  I thank the witness for her paper and I listened very carefully to what she had to say.

First, with regard to our international legal obligations and the status of international law, which is the core of the question, when Ireland ratifies an international treaty it accepts a legal obligation in good faith to implement that treaty, so it is a sovereign decision taken by the State to ratify a treaty and thereby to comply with it and give effect to it.  That is part of international treaty law.  We have a good faith obligation - that is the terminology used - to give effect to our obligations under international treaties and to ensure effective remedies in any case of a violation of those treaties.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the decisions of a UN human rights treaty body, as in Mellet or Whelan, those are authoritative interpretations of the bodies that are competent as a matter of law under the relevant treaty, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to interpret those.  Not only have we ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but we have also recognised the competence of treaty bodies to receive and consider decisions and to give their views on these.  That was an additional step we took in ratifying the first optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  As a State, we have accepted those obligations as a matter of law.<\/p> <p>  The second question was with regard to uncertainty.  As was also said last week, while it is not possible, as a matter of law, to achieve absolute certainty with any legal text, the protections that are afforded should ensure that a woman has effective access to a lawful abortion, that timely decisions are made and that procedures are accessible.  That was precisely the problem in the A, B and C case with regard to the third applicant, C, where there was a finding of a violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights where, the court found, there had been no access to an abortion that was lawful.  This has also come up in the cases before the European Court of Human Rights in regard to Poland.  Again, there was such a lack of clarity that women and girls had been subject to humiliating situations, and moved around from one place to another, because of the absence of timely and effective access to lawful abortions.  That level of uncertainty has been referred to as a chilling factor both for medical practitioners and for women and girls with regard to their lawful rights to abortion.<\/p> <p>  On the third question in regard to criminalisation and decriminalisation, we referred in the policy document and also in our statement specifically to the views of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2016, where it called for decriminalisation in all circumstances.  Again, this goes directly to the point around access to a safe and legal abortion being part of the right to the highest attainable standard of health and the need to ensure that the criminal law does not act as barrier to access to health services.<\/p> <p>  The final question was in regard to conscientious objection and religious freedom.  In the extended policy document and in the submission we had made earlier to the Citizens' Assembly, we referred to the relevant provisions of international European human rights law and, with regard to the Polish decisions from the European Court of Human Rights, to the collective complaint from the European social rights committee on how health care services are organised.  While there must be recognition of the right to conscientious objection, health services must be organised in such a way that there is effective access so that a health service provider, a medical practitioner, must ensure onward referral to a non-objecting practitioner, and any right to conscientious objection, of course, should not impede the right to life of a woman and to their lawful rights under an abortion regime.  Therefore, there is an obligation of onward referral.  Reference has also been made in the Polish context to decisions being given in writing to be justified to a greater level of transparency and clarity to avoid that kind of confusion and uncertainty for any woman or girl seeking access to a lawful abortion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally"},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  The terminology \"abortion on demand\" has been used here today a couple of times.  I want to tease that out a bit from the perspective of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  When it is spoken about, as it has been here today, I suppose the question is: on demand by whom?  I would see it as being the woman who may potentially be \"demanding\" the abortion.  Would the witnesses have an issue with that sort of terminology in the sense of it then being a question of who has a right to block that woman's right?  Do they understand where I am coming from?  If we are using terminology which suggests a woman can demand an abortion if she feels like it, has the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission any view on who might be the judge and jury in such a situation?  While I may not be explaining myself well, the witnesses might be able to give me some answer on how they feel about that.<\/p> <p>  Another point raised here today is that the eighth amendment has saved so many lives.  If somebody is prohibited from travelling for either financial or other reasons to another country, would the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission see it as a good thing that women are prevented from travelling abroad to seek abortion and, therefore, we have all these children who, allegedly, are alive as a result?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses referred to the question of health versus life.

What springs to my mind is high blood pressure, preeclampsia, the risk of stroke and the risk, therefore, of permanent disability to the woman as opposed to death.  Perhaps the witnesses could elaborate on that sort of terminology.<\/p> <p>  Finally, to give my own view, and I do not expect the witnesses to agree or disagree, as public representatives in a public forum such as this, we have to be very careful of listing out the gestational progression of the foetus within the womb.  Untruths have been put out here today, things that are not factually correct.  I am very concerned about the public looking on and putting a certain weight or gravity to comments of elected members who are just putting out lies.  It is very serious for this committee's work.  Reference was also made to these botched abortions which I hear being spoken about.  Again, there is absolutely evidence to suggest this.  I know Deputy McGrath has left the room.  I think it is very concerning and not helpful to the committee's work if people are somehow, wherever they are getting this information from, not checking it before they put it into the public domain.  I would like to put that on the record today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#J00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Connell.

Therefore, if comments are made at this committee, people should be entitled, and have a responsibility, to comment.<\/p> <p>  This links with the point that was made about the lack of sexual and reproductive health education in Ireland.  Regarding the term \"a baby's heart beats at 21 days\", an embryo does not even have a four-chamber heart at 21 days.  People are throwing these claims out, so they should be commented on and challenged.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses agree that the opposite of abortion on demand is forced pregnancy?  Is that not the alternative?  If we put restrictions in the way of someone who is seeking an abortion, we are forcing her to stay pregnant.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses might comment on a point that was made about the idea of abortion being another form of contraception.  It is highly insulting.  Abortion involves pain, expense - no matter what way it is procured - and a significant amount of difficulty, particularly for someone in Ireland, so it is belittling to suggest that.  Do the facts from various countries that the witnesses have put forward not speak to Ireland's abortion rate being no less than any other country's where abortion is available?  The idea about saving lives seems to be a myth.<\/p> <p>  Regarding sexual health, or the lack of it, Professor Mullally called for a scientifically objective policy.  This committee should use scientifically objective terms.  Last week and this, a number of members used the word \"child\".  The scientific terms are \"morula\", \"blastocyst\", \"zygote\", \"embryo\" and \"foetus\".  There are stages, and most people see the difference between them.  It is not the case that everyone in Ireland is undivided on this.  A minority of people may believe that the stages are equal, but most see the difference.  I just wanted to challenge some points.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses agree that it is significant that a State-sponsored body such as the IHREC has proposed at a public forum like the Citizens' Assembly the idea that there needs to be abortion provision for socioeconomic reasons if people's human rights are to be upheld?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of rape, the witnesses stated that they opposed intrusive medical examinations for pregnant women.

The commission has not gone so far in our paper as to give the committee an answer on what that should be, but we have stated that any gestational term limit included in a reformed framework for access to abortion service should be devised in keeping with best medical practice and with the health of the pregnant woman as the primary focus.

There are no circumstances in which that should be avoided, including for general health reasons.  This has come to my attention in cases where young children were the victims of rape were frightened, unsure of what to do and were afraid to tell their parents or guardians.  In those circumstances there is a serious void in what the witnesses have correctly drawn attention to in terms of the quality and availability of sex education in schools, but there is also a serious void in terms of what parents should know about what happens to their children.

Apart altogether from the legal procedures taken against the perpetrator of a violent criminal act, there needs also to be a recognition that to allow the victim to become a victim again, as it were, and to have to continue to live with that, is unfair, unjustified and to my mind illegal in terms of an act against the person going unchallenged in that regard, apart from the-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#K01200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan is now over three minutes.

I am an international human rights lawyer with almost 20 years&rsquo; experience of working on sexual and reproductive rights issues.  I have done consultancy work for UN agencies such as the World Health Organization and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and have worked for international NGOs.  I am here in my capacity as legal fellow in the faculty of law at the University of Toronto.  My first job involved working for a Senator from New Jersey in the US Senate and I have also worked with parliamentary organisations since then and, therefore, have first-hand experience of the work of parliamentarians and its challenges and the very important contribution they make to the realisation of human rights in their countries.  My presentation will primarily focus on human rights standards in relation to abortion and state obligations in that regard, which is what the committee has asked me to present upon.  I hope it can be helpful to members as they address the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.<\/p> <p>  States create international human rights law and it is based on humankind&rsquo;s common understanding of the inherent dignity and rights of every human being, which is a notion shared across religious and non-religious ethical frameworks.  Ireland has been an important player in the development of the human rights system through helping to create binding treaties and voluntarily ratifying them and by nominating and electing members to UN treaty bodies, which are comprised of independent experts that monitor state compliance with such treaties.  Ireland has also sat on the Human Rights Council, which is the UN&rsquo;s most important inter-governmental body on human rights.  Ireland has time and again respected its human rights obligations in many ways.  It has done so not just because those treaties are legally binding under international law but because they provide guidance on how to address complex and sometimes competing interests in light of what people are experiencing.<\/p> <p>  Reproductive rights have long been recognised as human rights and are enshrined in international treaty provisions.  International human rights bodies have long recognised that a wide range of human rights guarantees are undermined when women and girls do not have access to safe abortion services, particularly if abortion is restricted and-or criminalised.  Those rights include the rights to life, health, privacy and the right to be free from discrimination, torture and other ill-treatment and gender-based violence.  The right to health requires states to take legal and policy measures to prevent unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions.  Such measures include respecting the right of women to make autonomous decisions about their sexual and reproductive health and also the liberalisation of restrictive abortion laws to guarantee women and girls access to safe abortion services and quality post-abortion care.<\/p><p>Human rights bodies have considered such failures to ensure women's and girls' access to abortion to be forms of discrimination and inequality in the enjoyment of rights.  The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW, has confirmed that measures to eliminate discrimination against women and girls are inappropriate if a health care system lacks services to prevent, detect and treat health concerns specific to women and girls, noting that it is &quot;discriminatory for a State party to refuse to provide legally for the performance of certain reproductive health services for women&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The urgency of the human rights concerns in Ireland is reflected in serious human rights violations amounting to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, as found in the Mellet and Whelan cases.  The UN Human Rights Committee held in these two cases that prohibiting and criminalising abortion in situations of fatal foetal impairment subjected these women to conditions of intense physical and mental suffering, and that no justification could be invoked nor were there extenuating circumstances to excuse such harm.<br\/><br\/>Human rights bodies have also held that a woman's decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy falls within the sphere of private life, which includes bodily integrity, holding that restrictive laws and practices interfere with a woman's decision, violating this right.  Human rights bodies have long stated that to comply with human rights obligations, states should decriminalise abortion, liberalise restrictive laws and remove barriers that hinder access to legal abortion.  While they have noted that states must ensure access at a minimum in cases of threat to the woman's life or health, in cases of rape or incest and in cases of severe or fatal foetal impairment, they have also called on states which allow abortion only on such minimum grounds to liberalise their laws.  This is because human rights bodies are recognising the problem of narrow laws framed around minimum grounds in that, first, they do not guarantee effective access to lawful abortion and, second, women and adolescent girls seek abortions for various reasons, many of which do not fall under these grounds, and that there are harms and human rights implications in these cases as well, especially for marginalised women.  Last year four UN experts issued a joint global statement recommending the good practice found in many countries that provide women access to safe abortion services on request during the first trimester.<br\/><br\/>UN human rights treaty bodies have also recognised this reality by directing states to address abortion in a more general manner without delineating grounds.  For example, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recommends that states should ensure access to safe abortion and post-abortion care.  It also recently made this recommendation to Ireland.  Another expert body, the UN Working Group on Discrimination against Women recommends that states should recognise women's right to be free from unwanted pregnancies, noting that many countries where women have the right to abortion on request supported by affordable and effective family planning measures have the lowest abortion rates in the world, and that states should allow women to terminate a pregnancy on request during the first trimester or later, on minimum grounds.<br\/><br\/>The World Health Organization also recognises that restrictive legal grounds for abortion and other legal, regulatory and administrative barriers contribute to unsafe abortion because they deter women from seeking care, cause delay in access to services which may result in denial of services due to gestational limits on the legal grounds, and create complex and burdensome administrative procedures.  The Citizens' Assembly recommendation on access to abortion without restriction as to reason is in line with these human rights and health standards.<br\/><br\/>Although a wide range of laws and policies ultimately determine whether women's and girls' equality and right to be free from discrimination are a priority for states, trusting women and adolescents to make autonomous decisions about their sexuality and reproduction is central, including deciding whether to carry a pregnancy to term.  The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has explicitly articulated increased access to abortion, as well as other sexual and reproductive health services, within states' obligation to respect the right of women to make autonomous decisions about their health.<br\/><br\/>The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has called on countries, including Ireland, to ensure that the views of the pregnant girl are always heard and respected in abortion decisions.  The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has expressed concerns about one country's convoluted abortion law, which makes women dependent on the benevolent interpretation of a rule which nullifies their autonomy, and noted that the state party should review the abortion law and practice with a view to simplifying it and to ensuring women's autonomy to choose.<br\/><br\/>Having respect for women's and girl's decision-making agency reflected in the law is a key indicator of the degree to which women's equality is respected.  The achievement of substantive equality requires states to understand how women, and subgroups of women, are disadvantaged in practice by laws, policies and institutions.  Laws which do not place women at the centre of care and do not respect their decision-making, wherever those laws are, undoubtedly cause harm to all women, but particularly to marginalised women.<br\/><br\/>I have observed in my almost two decades of work on this issue that undoubtedly in every country with a restrictive law, the most impacted are vulnerable populations, such as women migrants, women with low economic status, women with disabilities, and adolescents.  Ireland is no exception.  The United Nations human rights bodies have time and again, including in findings against Ireland, recognised the discriminatory effects of restrictive and criminal regulation on women's access to lawful abortion on the basis of sex, age, geographical location and income.  The World Health Organization has underlined that restricting legal access to abortion leads to illegal and often unsafe abortions, and to social inequities, including because of the burden of travel.  It does not result in fewer abortions or in significant increases in birth rates.<br\/><br\/>Women and girls encounter many barriers to abortion, one of which is its criminalisation.  Human rights bodies have called on states to decriminalise abortion, which means that abortion is no longer regulated by criminal legislation and is not a criminal offence.  The Children's Rights Committee has urged states, including Ireland, to decriminalise abortion in all circumstances.  The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW, has also stated that criminalisation, as well as denial or the delay of safe abortion and post-abortion care, are forms of gender-based violence that may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and that countries should repeal criminal legislation.<br\/><br\/>Human rights bodies recognise that criminalisation of abortion contributes to stigmatisation and creates a chilling effect on access to lawful services.  In the Mellet case, the UN Human Rights Committee recognised how the criminalisation of abortion degraded and stigmatised Ms Mellet through separating her from the standard way of treating patients and forcing her to travel, and that the shame and stigma associated with the criminalisation of abortion had exacerbated her suffering.<br\/><br\/>Human rights bodies have also recognised the chilling effect of criminal law on the exercise of professional judgment in providing women and girls with care and have called on states to alleviate its effects.  In ABC <i>v<\/i>Ireland, the European Court of Human Rights noted that it &quot;considered it evident that the criminal provisions of the 1861 Act would constitute a significant chilling factor for both women and doctors in the medical consultation process, regardless of whether or not prosecutions have in fact been pursued under that Act&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Criminal provisions present barriers not only in the context of abortion, but also to other reproductive health services, impacting the quality of care that women receive in pregnancy and childbirth, including in the context of miscarriage.  Some national courts understand that the criminal law, as well as other ways of restricting abortion, cause harm and are not a proportionate means to achieve a state's objective to protect prenatal life.  For example, European Constitutional Court decisions across Europe have upheld abortion on request laws when faced with challenges due to claims of constitutional protection for prenatal life.  While these courts acknowledge that the state has a legitimate interest in protecting prenatal life, the select means of protecting it must be consistent with women's rights.  In doing so, these courts have referenced their countries' respective obligations under international human rights treaties.<\/p><p>Placing women at the centre of care does not mean that states should ignore foetal interests.  The objective of protecting prenatal life is legitimate but this can be achieved in ways that are consistent with women's rights and which support women.  In addition, the evidence is clear that criminal abortion laws are not effective in meeting the state's objective of protecting prenatal life.  They do not affect the overall incidence of abortion; they just make it unsafe and burdensome.<\/p><p> This approach is in line with international and European regional human rights norms.  No international or European human rights treaty or treaty monitoring body or court has provided that right-to-life treaty provisions apply before birth.  This was confirmed by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights in his report on his visit to Ireland last year.  That report states, \"The Commissioner stresses that the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution [...] departs from the position consistently held by human rights bodies that the right to life, as enshrined in relevant international treaties, does not apply to prenatal life.\"  In addition, in a landmark case against Peru in which a sexually assaulted child was not provided with an abortion, in part because of state measures to protect prenatal life, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women found violations of the convention, confirming that foetal interests cannot trump the human rights of women and girls.<\/p><p> Human rights bodies have long referenced achieving reductions in the rate of abortion, not through restrictive abortion laws or mandating recognition of \"the right to life of the unborn\" but by means of increased access to family planning services and comprehensive sexuality education, to safe motherhood services and prenatal assistance, including to reduce spontaneous miscarriage, and to social and economic protection to ease the burdens of having children.  Human rights bodies have also recognised that any procedural or other barriers to abortion can impact the ability to access legal services in practice.  Human rights require that \"in cases where abortion procedures may lawfully be performed, all obstacles to obtaining them should be removed\".<\/p><p> Human rights bodies have recommended that states remove barriers such as mandatory parental consent requirements and financial barriers to abortion services.  They have also specified that where, under domestic law, health practitioners are allowed to refuse to provide abortion services on grounds of conscience, states must adopt regulatory frameworks that guarantee access to abortion is not hindered by such practices.  They have never mandated a state to recognise conscientious objection in the context of provision of abortion services.  They have also raised concerns over judicial or prosecutorial authorisation prior to obtaining an abortion on grounds of rape, and multiple provider authorisation requirements, including in recommendations to Ireland regarding the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  They have also urged states to eliminate and refrain from adopting mandatory counselling and medically unnecessary waiting periods prior to abortion and to \"[e]nsure that health care professionals provide medically accurate and non-stigmatizing information on abortion\".  The World Health Organization has also confirmed these as \"barriers [to] abortion [that] should be removed\".<\/p><p> Access to information is critical to the realisation of all human rights.  In the context of health care, including sexual and reproductive health care, states have an obligation not to censor, withhold, misrepresent or criminalise information to the public in general or to individuals.  The European Court of Human Rights, in two cases concerning lack of access to lawful abortion, found Poland in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights for lack of proper counselling and information on abortion.  Human rights bodies have criticised Ireland's Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995 as not being compliant with human rights.  The World Health Organization also emphasises that the information given to women seeking abortion services must be unbiased, non-directive and provided only on the basis of informed consent.<\/p><p> These human rights standards show that narrow exceptions to abortion bans are inadequate to eliminate the harms that such laws impose on women and girls.  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act is an unfortunate testament to how grounds-based laws can hinder women's and girls' rights and harm their health.  The urgency of the problem is reflected in the recent decisions of the UN Human Rights Committee against Ireland.  Well-functioning abortion laws are guided by and directed at protecting women's and girls' health and human rights.  The human rights framework and its obligations provide a common-sense, evidence-based, practical approach, not only to permit expanded access to abortion but also to ensure the delivery and availability of quality abortion services.  Combined with guidance from the public health field, including the World Health Organization, human rights enable states to help realise women's equality, regardless of their age, income or background.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Christina Zampas","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Zampas for her presentation.

It is doing excellent work for Ireland, for the good of Ireland and for the people who live in Ireland.  I have prepared an opening statement but I will not inflict it upon the committee.  I thought it might be useful, in light of the good, long, two-hour discussion the committee had with the members of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission earlier this afternoon, to telegraph the debate a little in discussion.  I wish to make three substantive points to the committee in my opening remarks.<\/p> <p>  Before doing so, I will state my value position, which is one that is at the core of human rights philosophy.  We are not simply talking about rules and regulations here; what we are talking about is an insight, a value judgment, as to the human condition.  What human rights philosophy is about is a very simple value.  One may accept it or reject it - some people do reject it - but the value is the equal, inherent worth of every human being - his or her equal value.  That is it.  Whether rich or poor, old or young, early developmental stage or late developmental stage, no matter his or her mental capacity - you name it - it does not matter.  That value says all human beings, by virtue of their humanity, are entitled to protection and respect.  They have inherent dignity.  It is not given to them by human rights committees, by members of this committee, as legislators, or by courts; neither is it taken away from them by courts or by legislators.  It is their inherent value by virtue of being human beings.  Can I prove that statement to the committee?  Can anyone who subscribes to this essential core philosophy of human rights prove that statement to the committee?  Absolutely not.  It is not provable empirically, but one either accepts or rejects it.  If one accepts the principle of equal human rights, it has implications in the area the committee is dealing with, namely, the protection of unborn human beings.  We can describe them scientifically as blastocysts, foetuses and embryos and then, when we get to the post-birth stage, we can describe that little entity, which is utterly limited in its relational capacity and absolutely dependent on other human beings, as a neonate but, frankly, that is not very human language.  Young little babies who have recently been born are human beings and small unborn children are human beings.  My essential argument presented to the committee is this: let us stay real, let us keep our eyes open and let us recognise the genuine humanity and equal worth of every human being.  That is the premise on which my remarks are based.  That is my value position.<\/p> <p>  As I said, I wish to talk about three matters: the Citizens' Assembly's recommendations to the committee, which are totally familiar and which form the subject matter of the committee's establishment; human rights treaties and monitoring bodies; and the recommendations of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  I will speak briefly; I do not believe I will speak for longer than the ten minutes allocated.<\/p> <p>  The committee is so familiar with the first matter, the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, that we can shorten that discussion.  I think members will agree that it is notable that the Citizens' Assembly recommends, among a range of other measures, that abortion should be available for no stated reason, on request, and on grounds of disability.  The recommendations do not use the word \"disability\", but that is how it translates in any meaningful sense if we stay real.  When one talks about foetal anomaly, one is talking about disability.  Let us think about both of these grounds.  The first is abortion in wide-ranging circumstances, without control.<\/p><p>We have the discussion about the expression, &quot;abortion on demand&quot;.  I do not particularly want to use it necessarily to stigmatise the phenomenon but merely to describe it.  Let us take another expression which is used by those who are enthusiastic for legalised abortion, which is &quot;abortion based on the right to choose&quot;.  I have always been struck, and perhaps the committee has too, that nobody ever finishes the sentence, &quot;the right to choose&quot;.  If the sentence is finished, it becomes not so self-evidently obvious but highly disturbing to any person of humane sensibility: &quot;the right to choose to take the life of another person&quot;.  As a general proposition in our understanding of ethical relationships between human beings, do we accept that anyone has the right to choose to hurt another person or take the life of another person?  It is a proposition which is absolutely contentious, yet in the context of abortion, the half sentence, &quot;the right to choose&quot;, is articulated as though it were a self-evident, obvious good.<br\/><br\/>It is worth probing this a little and examining precisely what this means.  I say that because the Citizens' Assembly's clearly is a right to choose proposal, the right to choose to have abortion on request.  If one goes back to the basic premise of the humanity of every human being and the equal right to life of every human being, I would respectfully say this is an unacceptable proposition.  The assembly also recommended abortion for disability.  If one is in favour of the right to choose, why would one be against abortion for disability?  What are the moral, justice and human rights objections to it if one embraces the principle that one can have abortion for any reason unstated and not even mention the reason?  Clearly, an unmentioned reason might in some circumstances be abortion for disability.  Regarding those who say they are against abortion for disability but are in favour of the right to choose, frankly, further reflection has to be given in this area.  If the committee thinks about the right to abortion based on disability, I was a member of the UN Human Rights Commission for 11 years and I was in New York deputising for Professor Gerard Quinn, who is the Irish world expert in the area of the rights of human beings with disability.  It was interesting to listen to the discussion on the formulation of the UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and especially the area of the right to life of persons with disabilities.  Article 10 of the convention says essentially that state parties recognise the right to life of every human being and guarantee to protect that right without discrimination on the basis of disability.  If the committee is going to address the question of human rights, it is important for it to address that consideration of recognising the rights of every human being without discrimination and specifically without discrimination on the basis of disability.  Manifestly, the Citizens' Assembly violates that human rights protection.<br\/><br\/>I refer to international human rights treaties and their monitoring bodies.  States can agree or not agree to ratify a convention.  They are perfectly free not to.  They are involved in the UN in the formulation of treaty negotiations in this area.  As chief commissioner Logan correctly said, most of those treaties, if not all, when it comes to the area of the right to life and dealing with areas which could impact on the area of protection of unborn children or abortion, have been discreet in the sense of banning abortion because to do so would mean many countries would not, and could not, ratify the convention.  They leave it open, as she said, in order that each state can make its own mind up to ratify the convention on the basis of its interpretation of what that particular provision means.  Let us assume Ireland is against the idea of abortion.  Ireland can ratify all those various conventions and covenants and has done so.  Another state with wide-ranging abortion can equally do so on the basis that its interpretation will not ultimately yield an outcome which says that what it is doing is contrary to the convention in question.  Its support and ratification is solicited specifically on that basis.  Ireland ratified many of these conventions and covenants before and after 1983.  This is a consistent State policy of Ireland at all stages, and nobody has suggested, nor could they suggest, for a second that Ireland, in doing so, was agreeing to undertake to change its Constitution to introduce abortion.  That is clearly contrary to the good faith basis on which its support and ratification was sought.  None of those treaties provides for a right to abortion.  I outline that proposition with full certainty.<br\/><br\/>We then move to the monitoring committees.  Each of the treaties has a monitoring committee to police and support its implementation in individual countries, and they do excellent work as a general proposition in encouraging states to adhere to their human rights obligations, which they have undertaken by ratifying the treaties in question, but let us stay real.  I implore committee members that if they stay real, they will have to accept the value system, in the past decade or so especially, of the monitoring body members, some of whom are judges and lawyers and very many of whom are enthusiastic proponents of what might be called a right to choose philosophy.  That is their value system, they are perfectly entitled to it, they hold it conscientiously and those are their views.  The monitoring bodies do not articulate law, judgments or obligations that are based on the treaty, which incorporate a treaty obligation.  The relationship between states in international law and the relationship between international law and domestic law is a subtle system, but given the manner in which it is structured, the treaty is the obligation.  The monitoring committees have certain functions with certain implications, but it does not matter what they say.  Ireland is not required to act in a manner which is contrary to the obligations it took on when it ratified the relevant treaties in question.  If one stays real, one will say, if one is speaking as a legal analyst and not a partisan, the manner in which the monitoring committees have simply wiped off the stage any consideration of the right to life or, indeed, any rights of the unborn child is striking.  If members read the various decisions they have taken and recommendations they have made, the unborn child just is not there.  That is a striking critique that can be made.  One Irish commentator has suggested that the manner in which the committees have operated is so manifestly at variance with what is sound international law that their findings in this area should be regarded as <i>ultra vires<\/i>.  That is the situation about the monitoring committees.  I greatly respect Ms Zampas.  I have had an opportunity to chat with her and I like her very much.  We disagree on this particular issue.  She has articulated in her very coherent paper many findings of monitoring committees.  These findings represent the values of those committees, do not penetrate domestic law, and are inconsistent with the values which Ireland understood it was importing when it ratified the conventions in question.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, recommendations.  The committee has had a long discussion about those recommendations, but if it was contemplating adhering to the commission's proposals, I will spell out in more real terms what they mean.  They mean a right to choose philosophy or abortion on demand.  It does not matter how it is described, it means essentially abortion without any meaningful restrictions.  Abortion based on the test of well-being, which is proposed by the commission, would not be a ground that would constitute a limited ground, and I think the committee would agree.  Abortion based on socio-economic or familial status or circumstance equally would not constitute a limiting ground.  The commission says that the scrutinising process whereby these grounds would be implemented should be as minimalist as possible.  The committee and the commission had some discussion about late term abortions and there is some discussion about that in the commission's submission, but there is no indication whatsoever on the part of the commission that it had any concern with late term abortions from a human rights perspective.<\/p><p>From a human rights perspective, the commission did not think it appropriate to mention any human rights concerns about an unborn child in the seventh month of a pregnancy.  It talked about the issue but it did not talk about it from a value perspective in regard to the protection of the unborn child.  If one goes through the text of the paper, as with so many of those decisions and recommendations by the monitoring committee of the various treaties and covenants, one will be searching almost in vain for a reference to the unborn child, foetus, blastocyst or embryo - let us not worry about the terminology.  One will search in vain for a reference to that flesh and blood human being who constitutes a human being whose life is worthy of protection.  I think the committee has caught my drift and I hope I have not overstated it.  <\/p><p> If the committee believes, which it may not, that every human being has an inherent worth and dignity and is worthy of respect, the idea it would contemplate the Citizens' Assembly recommendations to the effect there should be wide-ranging abortion or that it should contemplate implementing the proposals by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which are effectively wide-ranging abortion, then I strongly recommend it not to take that course of action.<\/p><p> I will say one last thing, which might seem to be a slight tangent but which nonetheless might be important for future discussion, about the European Convention on Human Rights, which is a regional convention as opposed to global ones from the UN, and the European Court of Human Rights.  My invitation to the committee is to get real and stay real.  The European Court of Human Rights has a problem - I think the committee will agree - and always had a problem with the right to life provision in Article 2 of the European Convention, which recognises the right to life.  How will it, as a political body that has to maintain the support of countries throughout Europe, deal with the right to life?  It is one thing to create a treaty such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and let each state ratify it with its own interpretation of rights' holders and the right to life.  It is another thing when there is a European convention that actually has teeth, real sanctions and practical political implications.<\/p><p> What the European Court of Human Rights has done will come as no surprise.  It is not a criticism of it but a comment and I defy anybody to say otherwise.  Over the past 30 years, the court has adopted a political interpretation of Article 2 and a strategy of margin of appreciation by not saying Article 2 has any particular meaning.  Each state has the entitlement to interpret it as it wishes in terms of how it understands rights' holders under Article 2.  That is just about okay from a political-pragmatic point of view.  When one then throws in a consensus doctrine, which is the idea that when a number of states move in a particular direction, the court follows them once they have reached a certain critical mass, then human rights have been moved into the area of majoritarian head-counting.  That is the way the court operates.  It has not done so yet in the context of abortion but there are apprehensions and concerns that it might do so in the medium future.  If a human right depends on whether 30 or 40 countries have adopted a particular strategy, I think the committee will agree it is a form of positivist law.  We have moved well away from the value that there is respect attributable to a human being by virtue of their very humanity.<\/p><p> The European Court of Human Rights is a political animal.  It operates in a political context and will behave in a manner which it sees as politically pragmatically appropriate.  In the medium term, that presents challenges to Ireland.  What the committee and Ireland should not do is simply roll over and wait for the consensus doctrine to apply in Europe or simply say we will go along with the \"Right to choose\" philosophy of the individual members of so many of the monitoring committees.  If Ireland believes the unborn child is worthy of protection, it should absolutely assert that right.  When we do get a referendum, as we most likely will next year, that will be the issue.  It will be whether we recognise that unborn children are entitled to respect for their dignity and worth or not.  It is a stark issue.<\/p><p> Having promised to finish, I will now finish and say I think it was clear from the discussion that lasted two hours with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission that it is a stark choice.  Those so called half-way house grounds are not in practice or intended to be limiting grounds; rather they are grounds that open the door to wide-ranging access to abortion.  They are intended by those who propose them to be so.  That is not in any sense to make a bad faith accusation - they are actually intended to be wide-ranging grounds.  The choice is a stark one however it is described in language.  It is a choice on one side between protection of unborn children based on their equality, equal respect for their mother, the right to life of the mother and absolute assurance in those circumstances that the mother's life is not imperilled in any way and, on the other side, wide-ranging abortion.  I do not believe there is a half-way house in practice, if we stay real.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Professor William Binchy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Binchy and Ms Zampas for their presentations.

When Ireland ratifies treaties, for example the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, the Human Rights Committee monitors Ireland's adherence to the treaty.  That is the committee that issued the decision in the Whelan and Mellet cases.  Article 2 of the ICCPR clearly states that the State will fulfil its obligations under the provisions of the treaty to all persons within its territory without discrimination.  One of the treaty's provisions actually creates the human rights body that monitors State compliance.  When Ireland ratified that, it ratified itself to come before a committee that has an interpretive mandate.  By way of example, on its own the right to privacy means nothing - it is just a phrase.  There must be interpretive bodies to define what it means.  Ireland has ratified the treaty which creates this interpretive body and also the optional protocol which Ms Mellet and Ms Whelan used when they filed cases against Ireland.  Ireland agreed to provide that individuals within its territory can file individual complaints against Ireland.  If Ireland were to ignore that, it would ignore the essence of ratification of the optional protocol to begin with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Christina Zampas"},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I will move on to Deputy Clare Daly, who has ten minutes in total.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#T00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank both contributors.

They are negotiated politically in New York or in Europe as the case may be, or in whatever region we are talking about, and they have this conscious diplomatic, ambiguous language which is used.  It is precisely to allow for ratification by states that have had wide-ranging abortion going back many years and states that are against legalised abortion and that protect the unborn child.  That is the whole strategy that is used by those who are formulating the treaties.  Believe me, that is absolutely on record.  It is not an opinion but an absolute acknowledged fact by everybody who is involved in the negotiation of treaties.  The Deputy can read it and see it for herself.  When it comes to the area of abortion, there is high alert in the discussions and tiptoeing.  Those who are formulating these treaties want them to be implemented.  If they were to have what might be regarded as a pro-life treaty, they would have relatively few ratifiers in the present international climate.  The Deputy is absolutely correct to say that in the international climate, particularly in certain quarters, there is wide-ranging support for legalised abortion.  That is obvious.  We would not dispute that.<\/p> <p>  I think the Deputy said I mis-described the Citizens' Assembly recommendations.  I actually said there were recommendations based on disability.

We can exchange quotes later on.  I notice that none of his contribution was referenced but we can deal with that now.  We are trying to develop guidance for changing our legislation.  I would like to ask a question of Ms Zampas.  International human rights law is evolving all the time.  Our challenge here is to change our law to be in compliance with that.  Ms Zampas spent a lot of time dealing with the difficulties of bringing about a restrictive regime or a reasons-based regime.  Will she expand on that?  Would introducing legislation which permitted abortion in cases of, for example, rape, fatal foetal abnormality or serious risk to health satisfy our obligations under international human rights law?  Under international human rights law, when is it permissible to delay or withhold a pregnant woman's access to health-preserving medical care in order to preserve the life of the foetus?  Is it more acceptable if the risk to her health is less severe?  How are those issues dealt with?  Ms Zampas has had experience in El Salvador.  She may like to look at the area of when it is permissible under international human rights law to detain a pregnant person in a hospital or psychiatric facility in order to prolong her pregnancy.<\/p> <p>  It may also be important to touch on the point which Ms Zampas made in her submission, which was that placing women at the centre does not mean that states should ignore foetal interests.  That is a very important point.  Will Ms Zampas elaborate on it?  How could a state like Ireland protect both women and foetuses in the context of abortion law?  What is the best way of doing that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#U01800","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I will begin with the Deputy's first question on grounds-based regimes and how they function.  The only one of the 47 member states of the Council of Europe that has a minimum grounds-based regime which international human rights law speaks to is Poland.  Ireland has the second most restrictive law in Europe.  Malta has a total ban, Ireland has a life exception and Poland has these four grounds.  As was referenced earlier by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, there have been three cases before the European Court of Human Rights in respect of Poland's abortion law.  Those cases did not seek an expansion of the grounds but challenged the fact that these two women and one girl, in separate cases, did not get access to lawful abortion services in Poland.<\/p> <p>  One case concerned a woman's health, one was a case concerning rape and the other case was a foetal impairment case.  These are essentially the grounds in Poland.  In each of those cases, women were not allowed to access abortion and in each of those cases the women who experienced those violations were vulnerable women.  One woman had a disability, another was a child, and another was on a low income.  These are the people who restrictive laws impact.  In each of these three cases, the court found violations of the European Convention on Human Rights in Poland's failure to actually implement its law.  The court said that a right cannot be theoretical or illusory.  It must be real and practical and the state must implement practical measures so that women can access lawful services.  It found that, in these cases, it did not.  In two of the cases, the court also found a violation of the prohibition on inhuman and degrading treatment in not allowing the women access to lawful abortion.  <\/p> <p>  It is very difficult to regulate a grounds-based abortion regime, first of all because there are usually exceptions in the criminal code.  There is criminal liability, which creates a chilling factor.  It is also very difficult for the Legislature to define a health risk specifically.  Human rights bodies have not done that, and neither has the European Court of Human Rights.  These bodies tend not to go into a medical analysis of whether or not there is a health risk.  They just do not like to do that because most of them are lawyers and not doctors or health care providers.  <\/p> <p>  New Zealand also has a minimum grounds-based approach and human rights bodies have heavily criticised New Zealand for its multiple provider authorisation.  New Zealand has something like the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 in that the approval of multiple doctors is required.  It is far less restrictive than Ireland but there is still a requirement for numerous doctors to approve.  It really impacts rural areas where doctors are just not available to give approval.  The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW, has called it a convoluted law which strips away women's autonomy and does not really grant them the right to abortion in the cases provided for in New Zealand's law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#U01900","nonspeaker":"Ms Christina Zampas"},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Would it be fair to say that reasons-based legislation is increasingly out of kilter with international best practice from the point of view of complicating access?

He clarified the position but the use of that word is particularly inflammatory.  He used the words \"enthusiastic for legalised abortion\".  Again, I have an issue with that.  I do not believe a woman is ever enthusiastic about having a termination.  He is quite dismissive of the right to choose and I take issue with that.

What does the witness see as an unborn child having an inherent right to life?  Which one should be protected?  He replied to Deputy O&rsquo;Connell that he does not believe the right to travel should be taken out.  He is saying some people should be able to travel.  In reality it is quite an elitist view of an inherent right to life.  Is it only those in minority groups?  What unborn children actually have that right if it will not be protected at all costs?  This inherent right to life makes the whole argument incoherent.<\/p><p> The presentation started with a list of premises and a conclusion.  As a philosophy graduate of logic, premise No. 1 fell down when it said that foetal life and human life have an equal right to life.  Everything else fell from thereafter for me.<\/p><p> I agree with the presentation on disability down to the last sentence.  While I agree with the first part, what about the right to life of people, the child or young girl with a disability who needs to access abortion but cannot travel in some situations due to a disability?  When one talks about the rights of someone with a disability, one is not talking about foetal life and a possible disability they will have, one is talking about a person in the world.  Will Ms Zampas elaborate on that in a human rights context?  If the unborn child has a significant foetal abnormality that is not likely to result in death before or shortly after birth, how can the State's duty to combat discrimination against disabled people be balanced against its duty to ensure women have access to abortion?  Are they comparable in the sense that when we talk about discrimination against disabled people, we are in fact not talking about foetal life?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#W04200","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Human rights bodies, as I said in my presentation, have recommended that countries ensure access to abortion in cases of severe or fatal foetal impairment.  They go back and forth and are not always consistent.  Looking back at the recommendations over time, they have always been severe.  Lately, they use the term &ldquo;fatal&rdquo; and sometimes they use &ldquo;severe or fatal&rdquo;.  It is hard for a legislator or a committee member to decide for a woman how it will impact them.  These are very difficult decisions.  These are always wanted pregnancies.  They get the determination very late and it is a difficult decision to make.  Women make those decisions, oftentimes with a heavy heart.  We have to keep that real and see that those are not easy decisions for women to make.  They are very individual decisions.<\/p> <p>  The treaty bodies have never said the foetal impairment grounds should be eliminated in a law.  The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recently issued a general comment on women and girls with disabilities.  It recommended states should ensure access to sexual and reproductive health services, the same as any other women, taking into consideration their disability and their needs.  It never addressed the issue of abortion on the grounds of foetal impairment.  That says a lot in its first general recommendation on women with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  The best way to address the problem of discrimination against persons with disabilities is to address the underlying discrimination.  Why is this happening?  Society needs to take steps to make the individual's life, but also the family life of the parents, easy.  There should be benefits, social and educational supports.  It is about time Ireland ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities because it would really help setting its policies straight on helping persons with disabilities.  That is the best way to address this.  Restricting abortion on impairment grounds is not going to limit access to abortion.  Some countries do not have explicit foetal impairment exceptions, but they read health exceptions very broadly to include any sort of health issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Christina Zampas"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>What Ms Zampas said is important because it does provide corroborative evidence of what I said to the committee generally about the enthusiasm of the members of monitoring bodies for a particular value system.

I apologise to Ms Zampas regarding the misunderstanding and I thank her for coming.  I have listened and read carefully what she has said.  In all her work as an international human rights lawyer has she ever raised concerns about barbaric practices, like the treatment of babies born alive after botched abortions and left to die alone without receiving any medical attention or loving care as they breathe their last breaths?  It is a harrowing image I present, but, sadly, it is a real one.  Is Ms Zampas aware &ndash; she probably is &ndash; that England and Canada are two countries where such abuses routinely arise and have been well documented?  Has Ms Zampas ever taken a stand against such horrific abuses?  Is it the singular goal of Ms Zampas in this area to push for wider access to abortion?  I am deeply concerned at the complete absence of reference to infants born alive after abortions.  What exactly are the views of the guests on that?

Is this not a question of the pregnant individual's autonomy rather than the country's autonomy?<\/p><p>Does Professor Binchy accept that if the aim of Ireland's abortion ban was to save so-called unborn lives, it is not doing a very good job?  Given that ten women a day are leaving the country and at least three others are having abortions in their own bedrooms in this country, the ban is certainly not working.<\/p><p>I have a third question for Professor Binchy.  Does he favour forced pregnancy?  Does he favour forcing a pregnant woman who does not want to be pregnant to continue with that pregnancy?  He said earlier that he does not favour injunctions to prevent women from travelling.  It seems to me that he did at one point, when he served as legal adviser to the pro-life amendment campaign, but he just will not get away with it now.  He has said he wants the sources of all claims that are made.  During a lecture Professor Binchy gave in the Coombe in 1980, he said:<\/p><blockquote>If we are to allow sympathy for the woman to stop us from regarding abortion as criminal... why should that sympathy simply stop at our shorelines?  ...A strong argument can be made that our law should give such effect as it can to the principle that unborn life is entitled to be protected.<\/blockquote> <p>He accepted that this would cause a lot of criticism, but he felt there was a strong argument to be made for it.  He seems to have changed his mind since then.  Is that fair enough?<\/p><p>My fourth question relates to a claim Professor Binchy has made about the Citizens' Assembly's proposal that abortion should be available up to birth.  He has suggested that this would lead to abortion with little or no restrictions in place.  Has he not been scaremongering like this for a long time?  He made similar comments in 1992 in response to the ruling in the X case.  He claimed in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>of 6 March 1992 that the ruling had &quot;introduced an abortion regime of wide-ranging dimensions, beyond any effective control or practical limitation&quot;.  He went on to say that as a result of the Supreme Court judgment, &quot;those who authorise and carry out abortions in Ireland [will be placed] beyond the reach of criminal law&quot;.  Nothing could be further from the truth in relation to the X case.  We have seen how it is practically impossible for a woman to access an abortion by claiming she is suicidal.<\/p><p>In 1992, around the time of the X case, Professor Binchy was asked whether he thinks suicidal women should be allowed to have abortions.<\/p><p>He was asked if a woman went on to commit suicide after being refused an abortion, what would he say?  He said that it would be very regrettable.  He also said that there should not be any legal sanctions attaching to travel abroad, which was a change from his previous position.  <br\/><br\/>Professor Binchy is asking politicians to listen to him but did they not listen to him in 1983 and is that not why we are here today?  He says he favours the equal right to life of the unborn child and the woman, which is practically impossible to adjudicate over in any case.  Was it not his original proposal in the pro-life amendment campaign, PLAC, that: &quot;The State recognises the absolute right to life of every unborn child from conception, and accordingly guarantees to respect and protect such a law.&quot;  I believe that is stated on page 63 of <i>Marital, Privacy and Family Law, Studies<\/i>, but I can check that.  Is Professor Binchy not in favour of a lot more than he has said here today?<br\/><br\/>Ms Christina Zampas said that if restrictions are put in place on abortion law, it effectively means that people's human rights cannot be guaranteed.  The witnesses in the previous session said something similar.  Would Ms Zampas be concerned that politicians outside this committee are saying that the type of proposals from the Citizens' Assembly would not be passed by the people and, therefore, they are talking about quite restrictive legislation?  Would that not lead to a continuation of Ireland contravening best practice in human rights laws?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#Z03200","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":327,"content":"<p>There is a limited time for the witnesses to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#AA00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I will respond briefly.

Most of the 40 member states of the Council of Europe that allow abortion on request range from having a period of 12 to 18 weeks on request.  They allow from ten to a maximum of 18 weeks on request and afterwards they allow for abortion on other minimum grounds.

The notion of it being false advertising was dismissed.  I understand it is also the case that an actuarial study in Ireland estimated conservatively that a similar figure of lives, 100,000, had been saved on the assumption that had there not been the eight amendment legislation would have followed at some stage, gradually, to legalise abortion on increasingly wide grounds.

In other words, they see only one life worthy of being accorded respect for human dignity and human rights whereas Professor Binchy and those of his ilk on the human rights scene have always seen two people.

No human rights body has ever criticised a liberal abortion law or asked a country to restrict its abortion-on-request law.  That is clear.  It is not of late that human rights bodies have not interpreted the right to life to apply to prenatal life; this position goes back to the development of the human rights treaties to begin with, just like with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, CRC.  In every case, including the CRC, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there were attempts to include in the text a right to life from conception or later foetal rights and they were rejected by the states that were in committee and adopted the treaty.

That is how the Committee on the Rights of the Child and many other human rights bodies have addressed the interests of prenatal life, not by calling for bans on abortion or protection of the unborn because we know that such measures do not reduce the number of abortions but only increase illegal abortions and force women to travel.  The WHO is very clear that criminalisation of abortion does not lead to a decrease in the number of abortions.
