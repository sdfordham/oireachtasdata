I also thank the members of the committee.  On behalf of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet in this module of its deliberations.  I would like to briefly outline the institutional structure and legislative basis of the commission for members of the committee and members of the public who may be less acquainted with our work.  The commission is Ireland's independent national human rights and equality institution.  It was established in primary legislation in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, following the merger of the precursor bodies of the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission and it has been in operation since November 2014.<\/p> <p>  Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally and I are two of 15 members of the commission, appointed by the Head of State, the President, following an open competition and resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have no reporting relationship to Government and account directly to the Oireachtas for our statutory functions.  We appear today, to represent the views of the commission, which for the record, are contained in our recent policy statement on a new legal and regulatory framework on abortion in Ireland, in light of its international human rights obligations.  The statement was submitted to the committee on Monday.  It will come as no surprise to the committee that we do not have consensus at the commission on this matter but, procedurally, section 16 of the Act facilitates majority decision making.  In practice, that means that when we meet in plenary we take a vote on matters that are contested and this matter has been put to the commission on ten occasions since its inception in 2014.  What we bring before the committee today represents the views of 13 out of 15 members of the commission.  Two members of the commission do not support the document in its entirety.  The commission's independence has been recognised internationally and we have been awarded A status accreditation at the United Nations, under the UN Paris Principles.  Those principles set out the necessary guarantees required to ensure that a national human rights institution can carry out its functions in full independence, free from any form of political or other pressure.  Through a range of legal powers determined by the Oireachtas, we are mandated to promote and protect human rights and equality in the State.<\/p> <p>  Of most relevance to today's discussion, is section 10(2) of the 2014 Act, which is to \"keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of human rights and equality\".  Under section 10 of the Act the commission is also mandated \"to consult with such national, European Union or international bodies or agencies having a knowledge or expertise in the field of human rights or equality as it sees fit\".  Ireland has ratified six of the nine core UN human rights treaties and is bound by those obligations as a matter of international law.  For each treaty, there is an expert independent monitoring committee that oversees compliance.  Ireland's compliance with the treaties is examined on a periodic basis and under our legislative mandate, the commission formally participates as the national independent monitor of human rights in this process and monitors the State's compliance with the recommendations.<\/p> <p>  UN treaty monitoring committees have regularly raised concerns regarding the current legal position in Ireland in relation to abortion.  Most notably, in 2016 and 2017 the UN Human Rights Committee found that Ireland had violated a number of rights of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, following complaints taken by Amanda Mellet and Siobh&aacute;n Whelan, both of whom experienced pregnancies with fatal foetal abnormalities.  I use that term as it is well understood.  I know it offends some but it is important that we all know what we are talking about.  In Amanda Mellet's case the UN Human Rights Committee found a violation of Article 7, namely, the prohibition on cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  The committee took the view that many of the negative experiences could have been avoided if Ms Mellet had not been prohibited from terminating her pregnancy in the familiar environment of her own country and under the care of the health professionals whom she knew and trusted.<\/p> <p>  The committee also found a violation of Article 17, namely, protecting the right to privacy, stating that: \"the interference in Ms Mellet's decision as to how best to cope with her non-viable pregnancy was unreasonable and arbitrary\".  The committee also found a violation of Article 26, namely, equality before the law, taking into account the financial cost of travelling to the UK.  The facts of the 2017 Siobh&aacute;n Whelan case were similar to those in the Mellet communication and relying on the same reasoning, the committee also found a violation of Articles 7, 17 and 26, namely, the prohibition against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, protecting the right to privacy and equality before the law.<\/p><p>The State&rsquo;s response to the UN Human Rights Committee&rsquo;s views in the Mellet case, which included an acknowledgment by the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, of its views, an <i>ex gratia<\/i>sum of &euro;30,000 and a detailed itemisation of the steps being taken by the State on foot of the case, further demonstrate the significance of Ireland&rsquo;s international legal obligations for domestic law and policy.<br\/><br\/>UN treaty monitoring bodies are the pre-eminent interpreter of Ireland&rsquo;s binding obligations in international law under the human rights treaties it has ratified.  Their views on Ireland are, therefore, authoritative and have a significant role in the interpretation, application and development of Irish law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily Logan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>It is the view of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission that the State should approach reforms on access to abortion in Ireland primarily as a matter of health care policy.  To do so would be in keeping with its obligations under international human rights law.<br\/><br\/>As the committee is aware, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 allows for terminations of pregnancy where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  This limited access does not meet the requirements of international human rights law.  Concerns about the barriers placed by the existing legal framework on women&rsquo;s right to the highest attainable standard of health, the right to privacy, to equality before the law, to non-discrimination and to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, as well as the State&rsquo;s special obligations towards minors, in particular the girl-child, have been raised by several international human rights bodies.<br\/><br\/>The position taken by UN human rights treaty bodies differs from the position taken by the European Court of Human Rights.  In the case of ABC <i>v<\/i>. Ireland, the court concluded that abortion law in Ireland struck a fair balance between the competing interests presented.  The court relied in particular on the right to travel abroad for abortion, as being significant in applying the fair balance test and in assessing the proportionality of the interference with a woman&rsquo;s right to private life.  A wide margin of appreciation was applied by the court.  Ultimately, the court concluded that the constitutional prohibition on abortion in situations where a woman&rsquo;s health or well-being were at risk pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of morals, and reflected the profound moral values of the Irish people.  The court did not accept that sufficient evidence had been presented of a change in those values since the adoption of the eighth amendment.  I would be happy to expand on this judgment in our discussion and subsequent case law from the court.<br\/><br\/>The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has made clear the &ldquo;realisation of women&rsquo;s right to health requires the removal of all barriers interfering with access to health services ... including in the area of sexual and reproductive health&rdquo;.  It has identified the criminalisation of abortion and restrictive abortion laws as among these barriers.  The committee has also specifically expressed its concern on the discriminatory impact on women who cannot afford to travel abroad to access abortion services or access the necessary information.<br\/><br\/>These concerns were reiterated in the views of the UN Human Rights Committee.  In her concurring opinion in the Mellet case, Professor Cleveland stated &ldquo;the committee&rsquo;s finding of a violation of Article 26 in the author&rsquo;s case ... is fully justified on grounds of discrimination arising from gender stereotyping&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is of the view that the key areas that require attention by this committee include the development of a legislative and regulatory framework that provides for access to abortion for reasons of risk to life and health; socio-economic or family circumstances; pregnancy as a result of rape or incest; and fatal foetal abnormality.<br\/><br\/>The commission has in the past raised concerns about the number of examinations a girl or woman may be subjected to where she seeks treatment under the current legislation, as well as the effect this may have on a woman&rsquo;s right to respect for her private and family life.  The commission has also raised concerns about the barriers that assessment and certification requirements place before women with restricted access to medical practitioners or health information, such as women from poorer socio-economic backgrounds, from ethnic minority groups, or with intellectual disabilities.<br\/><br\/>A reformed framework for access to abortion services under a wider set of circumstances should avoid the creation of new processes where vulnerable women and girls may be subject to trauma, re-victimisation, delays in treatment or other harms.  The commission is of the view that a new framework for access to abortion should place the decision-making process primarily in the hands of the pregnant woman in consultation with her physician.  The commission stresses the importance of ensuring that constitutional reform avoids replicating the barriers to human rights and equality that are in place.<br\/><br\/>Given these considerations, the commission recommends the referendum announced should allow for the development of a framework governing access to abortion that has a basis in primary legislation and regulation.<br\/><br\/>As has been highlighted at the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly and in other fora, the criminalisation of abortion constitutes a potentially serious chilling factor for women seeking medical care, as well as for health care staff providing such care.  The commission, therefore, is of the view that, notwithstanding limitations that may be placed on access to abortion by legislation and regulation, the State should decriminalise abortion in all circumstances, as required by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in its concluding observations on Ireland adopted in 2016.<br\/><br\/>The commission and others have highlighted serious shortcomings in Ireland&rsquo;s sexual and reproductive health education system.  In parallel to a reformed legislative and regulatory framework for access to abortion, it is crucial the State develop a comprehensive, scientifically objective, sexual and reproductive health education policy.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for its attention and we welcome questions and further discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally"},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Thank you, Professor Mullally.

In the practice of international human rights law, there is nothing that prevents protection for prenatal life.  However, in terms of what the UN human rights treaty bodies have said, for example, the draft general comment on the right to life from the UN Human Rights Committee suggests this should not preclude the protection of a woman's rights to have access to abortion, which is seen as part of the right to life, the right to health, the right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment and as part of the right to privacy and non-discrimination.

She highlighted in particular the discriminatory impact on women who may not be able to afford to travel due to socio-economic circumstances.  This has come up before several UN human rights treaty bodies.  It is also something that was commented on and found by the committee on social rights under the revised European Social Charter in the context of the collective complaint against Italy.  In that case, there was a finding of a violation of the right to health, read in conjunction with what were deemed to be multiple grounds of discrimination, including in particular socio-economic situations and location.

As such, we have been very slow to recognise the importance of educating girls.  Ultimately, we are saying that we should look at prevention.  While we are looking at the hard edge of abortion here, we must also wake up to the fact that we need to properly educate young people, not just girls, who may be sexually active, however uncomfortable that may be for some people.

There is no doubt that this is an emotive topic which divides opinion in all areas of society.  Indeed, opinion is divided in many households.  Both sides of the debate have very different views and it is important to listen to all views before we make a decision.  Not only that, we must respect each other's views and opinions.  Personally, I am against abortion on demand.  My fear is that if abortion on demand is introduced, it could become another form of contraception.  We all know that it is not simply a case of either introducing abortion or not introducing it.  My personal view is that we need to look at cases where a pregnancy is the result of incest or rape, where it could place the life of the mother at risk or where it could result in fatal foetal abnormalities.  I have specific questions for the witnesses and I address them also to all members.<\/p> <p>  We all know friends and family who have family members with Down's syndrome.  Statistics show that 90% of babies diagnosed with Down's syndrome have their lives terminated by abortion.  Even more alarming is the fact that 100% of babies diagnosed with Down's syndrome are aborted in Iceland.  I would be very interested to hear people's views on this and on whether they accept that we could have the same situation here should abortion on demand be introduced.<\/p> <p>  I listened very closely to each of the opening statements and was shocked that no one mentioned the rights of the unborn.  I would be very interested to hear people's views on the rights of the unborn and whether they believe they have any.  What measures can we take to ensure that the rights of the unborn, along with those of the mother, are protected?  I said last week here that a baby's heart beats 21 days after conception.  Facial features start to form at week 4, internal lungs begin to form at week 6, the nervous system is responsive at week 8, babies are swallowing, yawning and sucking at week 9 and the baby stretches and jumps at week 11.<\/p> <p>  Professor Mullally stated that the commission is of the view that a new framework on access to abortion in Ireland should place the decision-making process primarily in the hands of the pregnant woman in consultation with a doctor.  What would happen if both parties had a different view?  For example, what if the woman wanted to terminate the pregnancy but her doctor was against it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#G00400","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick.

This does not mean that we do not listen to those opinions.  In less than three years, the commission has had ten very serious submissions whereby it has commented on this issue.  That has meant we have had to listen to everybody's views.  It is contested but that does not mean we can set aside our respect for each other as human beings.  As such, we do our level best to try to do it within the commission.  I respect, of course, that the Deputy does not share our views.

One of the things that was called for in the past was a review of the SAVI report of 2002 which looked at sexual violence in Ireland.

It should be possible to ensure that decisions are made in a timely way and that access is not theoretical but is practical and available to all without discrimination on grounds of socioeconomic circumstance or location.

There are two parts to that question, the first being the possible challenge to the UN's competence.  That is not uncommon in jurisdictions.  Certainly in the past 14 years I have been involved a lot with and been in front of UN bodies.  I know it is a political response, so it is not uncommon that politically a government may seek to undermine the competence of the UN Human Rights Committee.  The committee has said that it is well aware of this and recognises it.  The UN Human Rights Committee prints what are called general comments that are thematic elaborations on its thinking on things.  The committee has said in individual communications that it recognises that while it is not a judicial body, it arrives at its decisions in a judicial spirit, which undermines the principles of impartiality and independence.  The second part of that question relates to the legal basis for those decisions, which speaks to the Deputy's question about the response of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  In linking this with the international law principles of the Vienna Convention, there is something called the \"good faith principle\".  If a government ratifies a treaty, it creates a legitimate expectation that it is going to comply with the terms of that treaty.

My first question is for Ms Logan.  I have read the new position paper released today, Human Rights and Equality Considerations in the Development of a New Legislative and Regulatory Framework on Abortion.  I respectfully put it to Ms Logan that it is very noticeable that there is not a single mention in the entire document that recognises or speaks up for the rights of the unborn child.  Am I correct in concluding that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission believes that unborn babies are unworthy of any meaningful protections in law?<\/p> <p>  It is a fact that the eighth amendment has saved countless lives.  I am privileged to know personally families who were considering abortion but changed their minds at the last minute before travelling abroad.  These families openly admit that had abortion been legal in Ireland and had there been abortion clinics close to where they lived, their son or daughter would most likely not be alive today and enjoying the same chance of life as Ms Logan, me and everyone else present here today and all those in the wider community.  Has the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission spent any time considering all the good that has been done by the eighth amendment?  Why is there not as much of a mention in the document published today on all that is positive about the eighth amendment?<\/p> <p>  I wish to address a question to Christina.  I thank the witness for her paper and I listened very carefully to what she had to say.

First, with regard to our international legal obligations and the status of international law, which is the core of the question, when Ireland ratifies an international treaty it accepts a legal obligation in good faith to implement that treaty, so it is a sovereign decision taken by the State to ratify a treaty and thereby to comply with it and give effect to it.  That is part of international treaty law.  We have a good faith obligation - that is the terminology used - to give effect to our obligations under international treaties and to ensure effective remedies in any case of a violation of those treaties.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the decisions of a UN human rights treaty body, as in Mellet or Whelan, those are authoritative interpretations of the bodies that are competent as a matter of law under the relevant treaty, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to interpret those.  Not only have we ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but we have also recognised the competence of treaty bodies to receive and consider decisions and to give their views on these.  That was an additional step we took in ratifying the first optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  As a State, we have accepted those obligations as a matter of law.<\/p> <p>  The second question was with regard to uncertainty.  As was also said last week, while it is not possible, as a matter of law, to achieve absolute certainty with any legal text, the protections that are afforded should ensure that a woman has effective access to a lawful abortion, that timely decisions are made and that procedures are accessible.  That was precisely the problem in the A, B and C case with regard to the third applicant, C, where there was a finding of a violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights where, the court found, there had been no access to an abortion that was lawful.  This has also come up in the cases before the European Court of Human Rights in regard to Poland.  Again, there was such a lack of clarity that women and girls had been subject to humiliating situations, and moved around from one place to another, because of the absence of timely and effective access to lawful abortions.  That level of uncertainty has been referred to as a chilling factor both for medical practitioners and for women and girls with regard to their lawful rights to abortion.<\/p> <p>  On the third question in regard to criminalisation and decriminalisation, we referred in the policy document and also in our statement specifically to the views of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2016, where it called for decriminalisation in all circumstances.  Again, this goes directly to the point around access to a safe and legal abortion being part of the right to the highest attainable standard of health and the need to ensure that the criminal law does not act as barrier to access to health services.<\/p> <p>  The final question was in regard to conscientious objection and religious freedom.  In the extended policy document and in the submission we had made earlier to the Citizens' Assembly, we referred to the relevant provisions of international European human rights law and, with regard to the Polish decisions from the European Court of Human Rights, to the collective complaint from the European social rights committee on how health care services are organised.  While there must be recognition of the right to conscientious objection, health services must be organised in such a way that there is effective access so that a health service provider, a medical practitioner, must ensure onward referral to a non-objecting practitioner, and any right to conscientious objection, of course, should not impede the right to life of a woman and to their lawful rights under an abortion regime.  Therefore, there is an obligation of onward referral.  Reference has also been made in the Polish context to decisions being given in writing to be justified to a greater level of transparency and clarity to avoid that kind of confusion and uncertainty for any woman or girl seeking access to a lawful abortion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally"},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  The terminology \"abortion on demand\" has been used here today a couple of times.  I want to tease that out a bit from the perspective of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  When it is spoken about, as it has been here today, I suppose the question is: on demand by whom?  I would see it as being the woman who may potentially be \"demanding\" the abortion.  Would the witnesses have an issue with that sort of terminology in the sense of it then being a question of who has a right to block that woman's right?  Do they understand where I am coming from?  If we are using terminology which suggests a woman can demand an abortion if she feels like it, has the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission any view on who might be the judge and jury in such a situation?  While I may not be explaining myself well, the witnesses might be able to give me some answer on how they feel about that.<\/p> <p>  Another point raised here today is that the eighth amendment has saved so many lives.  If somebody is prohibited from travelling for either financial or other reasons to another country, would the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission see it as a good thing that women are prevented from travelling abroad to seek abortion and, therefore, we have all these children who, allegedly, are alive as a result?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses referred to the question of health versus life.

What springs to my mind is high blood pressure, preeclampsia, the risk of stroke and the risk, therefore, of permanent disability to the woman as opposed to death.  Perhaps the witnesses could elaborate on that sort of terminology.<\/p> <p>  Finally, to give my own view, and I do not expect the witnesses to agree or disagree, as public representatives in a public forum such as this, we have to be very careful of listing out the gestational progression of the foetus within the womb.  Untruths have been put out here today, things that are not factually correct.  I am very concerned about the public looking on and putting a certain weight or gravity to comments of elected members who are just putting out lies.  It is very serious for this committee's work.  Reference was also made to these botched abortions which I hear being spoken about.  Again, there is absolutely evidence to suggest this.  I know Deputy McGrath has left the room.  I think it is very concerning and not helpful to the committee's work if people are somehow, wherever they are getting this information from, not checking it before they put it into the public domain.  I would like to put that on the record today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#J00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Connell.

Therefore, if comments are made at this committee, people should be entitled, and have a responsibility, to comment.<\/p> <p>  This links with the point that was made about the lack of sexual and reproductive health education in Ireland.  Regarding the term \"a baby's heart beats at 21 days\", an embryo does not even have a four-chamber heart at 21 days.  People are throwing these claims out, so they should be commented on and challenged.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses agree that the opposite of abortion on demand is forced pregnancy?  Is that not the alternative?  If we put restrictions in the way of someone who is seeking an abortion, we are forcing her to stay pregnant.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses might comment on a point that was made about the idea of abortion being another form of contraception.  It is highly insulting.  Abortion involves pain, expense - no matter what way it is procured - and a significant amount of difficulty, particularly for someone in Ireland, so it is belittling to suggest that.  Do the facts from various countries that the witnesses have put forward not speak to Ireland's abortion rate being no less than any other country's where abortion is available?  The idea about saving lives seems to be a myth.<\/p> <p>  Regarding sexual health, or the lack of it, Professor Mullally called for a scientifically objective policy.  This committee should use scientifically objective terms.  Last week and this, a number of members used the word \"child\".  The scientific terms are \"morula\", \"blastocyst\", \"zygote\", \"embryo\" and \"foetus\".  There are stages, and most people see the difference between them.  It is not the case that everyone in Ireland is undivided on this.  A minority of people may believe that the stages are equal, but most see the difference.  I just wanted to challenge some points.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses agree that it is significant that a State-sponsored body such as the IHREC has proposed at a public forum like the Citizens' Assembly the idea that there needs to be abortion provision for socioeconomic reasons if people's human rights are to be upheld?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of rape, the witnesses stated that they opposed intrusive medical examinations for pregnant women.

The commission has not gone so far in our paper as to give the committee an answer on what that should be, but we have stated that any gestational term limit included in a reformed framework for access to abortion service should be devised in keeping with best medical practice and with the health of the pregnant woman as the primary focus.

There are no circumstances in which that should be avoided, including for general health reasons.  This has come to my attention in cases where young children were the victims of rape were frightened, unsure of what to do and were afraid to tell their parents or guardians.  In those circumstances there is a serious void in what the witnesses have correctly drawn attention to in terms of the quality and availability of sex education in schools, but there is also a serious void in terms of what parents should know about what happens to their children.

Apart altogether from the legal procedures taken against the perpetrator of a violent criminal act, there needs also to be a recognition that to allow the victim to become a victim again, as it were, and to have to continue to live with that, is unfair, unjustified and to my mind illegal in terms of an act against the person going unchallenged in that regard, apart from the-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#K01200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan is now over three minutes.

I am an international human rights lawyer with almost 20 years&rsquo; experience of working on sexual and reproductive rights issues.  I have done consultancy work for UN agencies such as the World Health Organization and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and have worked for international NGOs.  I am here in my capacity as legal fellow in the faculty of law at the University of Toronto.  My first job involved working for a Senator from New Jersey in the US Senate and I have also worked with parliamentary organisations since then and, therefore, have first-hand experience of the work of parliamentarians and its challenges and the very important contribution they make to the realisation of human rights in their countries.  My presentation will primarily focus on human rights standards in relation to abortion and state obligations in that regard, which is what the committee has asked me to present upon.  I hope it can be helpful to members as they address the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.<\/p> <p>  States create international human rights law and it is based on humankind&rsquo;s common understanding of the inherent dignity and rights of every human being, which is a notion shared across religious and non-religious ethical frameworks.  Ireland has been an important player in the development of the human rights system through helping to create binding treaties and voluntarily ratifying them and by nominating and electing members to UN treaty bodies, which are comprised of independent experts that monitor state compliance with such treaties.  Ireland has also sat on the Human Rights Council, which is the UN&rsquo;s most important inter-governmental body on human rights.  Ireland has time and again respected its human rights obligations in many ways.  It has done so not just because those treaties are legally binding under international law but because they provide guidance on how to address complex and sometimes competing interests in light of what people are experiencing.<\/p> <p>  Reproductive rights have long been recognised as human rights and are enshrined in international treaty provisions.  International human rights bodies have long recognised that a wide range of human rights guarantees are undermined when women and girls do not have access to safe abortion services, particularly if abortion is restricted and-or criminalised.  Those rights include the rights to life, health, privacy and the right to be free from discrimination, torture and other ill-treatment and gender-based violence.  The right to health requires states to take legal and policy measures to prevent unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions.  Such measures include respecting the right of women to make autonomous decisions about their sexual and reproductive health and also the liberalisation of restrictive abortion laws to guarantee women and girls access to safe abortion services and quality post-abortion care.<\/p><p>Human rights bodies have considered such failures to ensure women's and girls' access to abortion to be forms of discrimination and inequality in the enjoyment of rights.  The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW, has confirmed that measures to eliminate discrimination against women and girls are inappropriate if a health care system lacks services to prevent, detect and treat health concerns specific to women and girls, noting that it is &quot;discriminatory for a State party to refuse to provide legally for the performance of certain reproductive health services for women&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The urgency of the human rights concerns in Ireland is reflected in serious human rights violations amounting to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, as found in the Mellet and Whelan cases.  The UN Human Rights Committee held in these two cases that prohibiting and criminalising abortion in situations of fatal foetal impairment subjected these women to conditions of intense physical and mental suffering, and that no justification could be invoked nor were there extenuating circumstances to excuse such harm.<br\/><br\/>Human rights bodies have also held that a woman's decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy falls within the sphere of private life, which includes bodily integrity, holding that restrictive laws and practices interfere with a woman's decision, violating this right.  Human rights bodies have long stated that to comply with human rights obligations, states should decriminalise abortion, liberalise restrictive laws and remove barriers that hinder access to legal abortion.  While they have noted that states must ensure access at a minimum in cases of threat to the woman's life or health, in cases of rape or incest and in cases of severe or fatal foetal impairment, they have also called on states which allow abortion only on such minimum grounds to liberalise their laws.  This is because human rights bodies are recognising the problem of narrow laws framed around minimum grounds in that, first, they do not guarantee effective access to lawful abortion and, second, women and adolescent girls seek abortions for various reasons, many of which do not fall under these grounds, and that there are harms and human rights implications in these cases as well, especially for marginalised women.  Last year four UN experts issued a joint global statement recommending the good practice found in many countries that provide women access to safe abortion services on request during the first trimester.<br\/><br\/>UN human rights treaty bodies have also recognised this reality by directing states to address abortion in a more general manner without delineating grounds.  For example, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recommends that states should ensure access to safe abortion and post-abortion care.  It also recently made this recommendation to Ireland.  Another expert body, the UN Working Group on Discrimination against Women recommends that states should recognise women's right to be free from unwanted pregnancies, noting that many countries where women have the right to abortion on request supported by affordable and effective family planning measures have the lowest abortion rates in the world, and that states should allow women to terminate a pregnancy on request during the first trimester or later, on minimum grounds.<br\/><br\/>The World Health Organization also recognises that restrictive legal grounds for abortion and other legal, regulatory and administrative barriers contribute to unsafe abortion because they deter women from seeking care, cause delay in access to services which may result in denial of services due to gestational limits on the legal grounds, and create complex and burdensome administrative procedures.  The Citizens' Assembly recommendation on access to abortion without restriction as to reason is in line with these human rights and health standards.<br\/><br\/>Although a wide range of laws and policies ultimately determine whether women's and girls' equality and right to be free from discrimination are a priority for states, trusting women and adolescents to make autonomous decisions about their sexuality and reproduction is central, including deciding whether to carry a pregnancy to term.  The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has explicitly articulated increased access to abortion, as well as other sexual and reproductive health services, within states' obligation to respect the right of women to make autonomous decisions about their health.<br\/><br\/>The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has called on countries, including Ireland, to ensure that the views of the pregnant girl are always heard and respected in abortion decisions.  The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has expressed concerns about one country's convoluted abortion law, which makes women dependent on the benevolent interpretation of a rule which nullifies their autonomy, and noted that the state party should review the abortion law and practice with a view to simplifying it and to ensuring women's autonomy to choose.<br\/><br\/>Having respect for women's and girl's decision-making agency reflected in the law is a key indicator of the degree to which women's equality is respected.  The achievement of substantive equality requires states to understand how women, and subgroups of women, are disadvantaged in practice by laws, policies and institutions.  Laws which do not place women at the centre of care and do not respect their decision-making, wherever those laws are, undoubtedly cause harm to all women, but particularly to marginalised women.<br\/><br\/>I have observed in my almost two decades of work on this issue that undoubtedly in every country with a restrictive law, the most impacted are vulnerable populations, such as women migrants, women with low economic status, women with disabilities, and adolescents.  Ireland is no exception.  The United Nations human rights bodies have time and again, including in findings against Ireland, recognised the discriminatory effects of restrictive and criminal regulation on women's access to lawful abortion on the basis of sex, age, geographical location and income.  The World Health Organization has underlined that restricting legal access to abortion leads to illegal and often unsafe abortions, and to social inequities, including because of the burden of travel.  It does not result in fewer abortions or in significant increases in birth rates.<br\/><br\/>Women and girls encounter many barriers to abortion, one of which is its criminalisation.  Human rights bodies have called on states to decriminalise abortion, which means that abortion is no longer regulated by criminal legislation and is not a criminal offence.  The Children's Rights Committee has urged states, including Ireland, to decriminalise abortion in all circumstances.  The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW, has also stated that criminalisation, as well as denial or the delay of safe abortion and post-abortion care, are forms of gender-based violence that may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and that countries should repeal criminal legislation.<br\/><br\/>Human rights bodies recognise that criminalisation of abortion contributes to stigmatisation and creates a chilling effect on access to lawful services.  In the Mellet case, the UN Human Rights Committee recognised how the criminalisation of abortion degraded and stigmatised Ms Mellet through separating her from the standard way of treating patients and forcing her to travel, and that the shame and stigma associated with the criminalisation of abortion had exacerbated her suffering.<br\/><br\/>Human rights bodies have also recognised the chilling effect of criminal law on the exercise of professional judgment in providing women and girls with care and have called on states to alleviate its effects.  In ABC <i>v<\/i>Ireland, the European Court of Human Rights noted that it &quot;considered it evident that the criminal provisions of the 1861 Act would constitute a significant chilling factor for both women and doctors in the medical consultation process, regardless of whether or not prosecutions have in fact been pursued under that Act&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Criminal provisions present barriers not only in the context of abortion, but also to other reproductive health services, impacting the quality of care that women receive in pregnancy and childbirth, including in the context of miscarriage.  Some national courts understand that the criminal law, as well as other ways of restricting abortion, cause harm and are not a proportionate means to achieve a state's objective to protect prenatal life.  For example, European Constitutional Court decisions across Europe have upheld abortion on request laws when faced with challenges due to claims of constitutional protection for prenatal life.  While these courts acknowledge that the state has a legitimate interest in protecting prenatal life, the select means of protecting it must be consistent with women's rights.  In doing so, these courts have referenced their countries' respective obligations under international human rights treaties.<\/p><p>Placing women at the centre of care does not mean that states should ignore foetal interests.  The objective of protecting prenatal life is legitimate but this can be achieved in ways that are consistent with women's rights and which support women.  In addition, the evidence is clear that criminal abortion laws are not effective in meeting the state's objective of protecting prenatal life.  They do not affect the overall incidence of abortion; they just make it unsafe and burdensome.<\/p><p> This approach is in line with international and European regional human rights norms.  No international or European human rights treaty or treaty monitoring body or court has provided that right-to-life treaty provisions apply before birth.  This was confirmed by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights in his report on his visit to Ireland last year.  That report states, \"The Commissioner stresses that the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution [...] departs from the position consistently held by human rights bodies that the right to life, as enshrined in relevant international treaties, does not apply to prenatal life.\"  In addition, in a landmark case against Peru in which a sexually assaulted child was not provided with an abortion, in part because of state measures to protect prenatal life, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women found violations of the convention, confirming that foetal interests cannot trump the human rights of women and girls.<\/p><p> Human rights bodies have long referenced achieving reductions in the rate of abortion, not through restrictive abortion laws or mandating recognition of \"the right to life of the unborn\" but by means of increased access to family planning services and comprehensive sexuality education, to safe motherhood services and prenatal assistance, including to reduce spontaneous miscarriage, and to social and economic protection to ease the burdens of having children.  Human rights bodies have also recognised that any procedural or other barriers to abortion can impact the ability to access legal services in practice.  Human rights require that \"in cases where abortion procedures may lawfully be performed, all obstacles to obtaining them should be removed\".<\/p><p> Human rights bodies have recommended that states remove barriers such as mandatory parental consent requirements and financial barriers to abortion services.  They have also specified that where, under domestic law, health practitioners are allowed to refuse to provide abortion services on grounds of conscience, states must adopt regulatory frameworks that guarantee access to abortion is not hindered by such practices.  They have never mandated a state to recognise conscientious objection in the context of provision of abortion services.  They have also raised concerns over judicial or prosecutorial authorisation prior to obtaining an abortion on grounds of rape, and multiple provider authorisation requirements, including in recommendations to Ireland regarding the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  They have also urged states to eliminate and refrain from adopting mandatory counselling and medically unnecessary waiting periods prior to abortion and to \"[e]nsure that health care professionals provide medically accurate and non-stigmatizing information on abortion\".  The World Health Organization has also confirmed these as \"barriers [to] abortion [that] should be removed\".<\/p><p> Access to information is critical to the realisation of all human rights.  In the context of health care, including sexual and reproductive health care, states have an obligation not to censor, withhold, misrepresent or criminalise information to the public in general or to individuals.  The European Court of Human Rights, in two cases concerning lack of access to lawful abortion, found Poland in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights for lack of proper counselling and information on abortion.  Human rights bodies have criticised Ireland's Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995 as not being compliant with human rights.  The World Health Organization also emphasises that the information given to women seeking abortion services must be unbiased, non-directive and provided only on the basis of informed consent.<\/p><p> These human rights standards show that narrow exceptions to abortion bans are inadequate to eliminate the harms that such laws impose on women and girls.  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act is an unfortunate testament to how grounds-based laws can hinder women's and girls' rights and harm their health.  The urgency of the problem is reflected in the recent decisions of the UN Human Rights Committee against Ireland.  Well-functioning abortion laws are guided by and directed at protecting women's and girls' health and human rights.  The human rights framework and its obligations provide a common-sense, evidence-based, practical approach, not only to permit expanded access to abortion but also to ensure the delivery and availability of quality abortion services.  Combined with guidance from the public health field, including the World Health Organization, human rights enable states to help realise women's equality, regardless of their age, income or background.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Christina Zampas","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Zampas for her presentation.

It is doing excellent work for Ireland, for the good of Ireland and for the people who live in Ireland.  I have prepared an opening statement but I will not inflict it upon the committee.  I thought it might be useful, in light of the good, long, two-hour discussion the committee had with the members of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission earlier this afternoon, to telegraph the debate a little in discussion.  I wish to make three substantive points to the committee in my opening remarks.<\/p> <p>  Before doing so, I will state my value position, which is one that is at the core of human rights philosophy.  We are not simply talking about rules and regulations here; what we are talking about is an insight, a value judgment, as to the human condition.  What human rights philosophy is about is a very simple value.  One may accept it or reject it - some people do reject it - but the value is the equal, inherent worth of every human being - his or her equal value.  That is it.  Whether rich or poor, old or young, early developmental stage or late developmental stage, no matter his or her mental capacity - you name it - it does not matter.  That value says all human beings, by virtue of their humanity, are entitled to protection and respect.  They have inherent dignity.  It is not given to them by human rights committees, by members of this committee, as legislators, or by courts; neither is it taken away from them by courts or by legislators.  It is their inherent value by virtue of being human beings.  Can I prove that statement to the committee?  Can anyone who subscribes to this essential core philosophy of human rights prove that statement to the committee?  Absolutely not.  It is not provable empirically, but one either accepts or rejects it.  If one accepts the principle of equal human rights, it has implications in the area the committee is dealing with, namely, the protection of unborn human beings.  We can describe them scientifically as blastocysts, foetuses and embryos and then, when we get to the post-birth stage, we can describe that little entity, which is utterly limited in its relational capacity and absolutely dependent on other human beings, as a neonate but, frankly, that is not very human language.  Young little babies who have recently been born are human beings and small unborn children are human beings.  My essential argument presented to the committee is this: let us stay real, let us keep our eyes open and let us recognise the genuine humanity and equal worth of every human being.  That is the premise on which my remarks are based.  That is my value position.<\/p> <p>  As I said, I wish to talk about three matters: the Citizens' Assembly's recommendations to the committee, which are totally familiar and which form the subject matter of the committee's establishment; human rights treaties and monitoring bodies; and the recommendations of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  I will speak briefly; I do not believe I will speak for longer than the ten minutes allocated.<\/p> <p>  The committee is so familiar with the first matter, the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, that we can shorten that discussion.  I think members will agree that it is notable that the Citizens' Assembly recommends, among a range of other measures, that abortion should be available for no stated reason, on request, and on grounds of disability.  The recommendations do not use the word \"disability\", but that is how it translates in any meaningful sense if we stay real.  When one talks about foetal anomaly, one is talking about disability.  Let us think about both of these grounds.  The first is abortion in wide-ranging circumstances, without control.<\/p><p>We have the discussion about the expression, &quot;abortion on demand&quot;.  I do not particularly want to use it necessarily to stigmatise the phenomenon but merely to describe it.  Let us take another expression which is used by those who are enthusiastic for legalised abortion, which is &quot;abortion based on the right to choose&quot;.  I have always been struck, and perhaps the committee has too, that nobody ever finishes the sentence, &quot;the right to choose&quot;.  If the sentence is finished, it becomes not so self-evidently obvious but highly disturbing to any person of humane sensibility: &quot;the right to choose to take the life of another person&quot;.  As a general proposition in our understanding of ethical relationships between human beings, do we accept that anyone has the right to choose to hurt another person or take the life of another person?  It is a proposition which is absolutely contentious, yet in the context of abortion, the half sentence, &quot;the right to choose&quot;, is articulated as though it were a self-evident, obvious good.<br\/><br\/>It is worth probing this a little and examining precisely what this means.  I say that because the Citizens' Assembly's clearly is a right to choose proposal, the right to choose to have abortion on request.  If one goes back to the basic premise of the humanity of every human being and the equal right to life of every human being, I would respectfully say this is an unacceptable proposition.  The assembly also recommended abortion for disability.  If one is in favour of the right to choose, why would one be against abortion for disability?  What are the moral, justice and human rights objections to it if one embraces the principle that one can have abortion for any reason unstated and not even mention the reason?  Clearly, an unmentioned reason might in some circumstances be abortion for disability.  Regarding those who say they are against abortion for disability but are in favour of the right to choose, frankly, further reflection has to be given in this area.  If the committee thinks about the right to abortion based on disability, I was a member of the UN Human Rights Commission for 11 years and I was in New York deputising for Professor Gerard Quinn, who is the Irish world expert in the area of the rights of human beings with disability.  It was interesting to listen to the discussion on the formulation of the UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and especially the area of the right to life of persons with disabilities.  Article 10 of the convention says essentially that state parties recognise the right to life of every human being and guarantee to protect that right without discrimination on the basis of disability.  If the committee is going to address the question of human rights, it is important for it to address that consideration of recognising the rights of every human being without discrimination and specifically without discrimination on the basis of disability.  Manifestly, the Citizens' Assembly violates that human rights protection.<br\/><br\/>I refer to international human rights treaties and their monitoring bodies.  States can agree or not agree to ratify a convention.  They are perfectly free not to.  They are involved in the UN in the formulation of treaty negotiations in this area.  As chief commissioner Logan correctly said, most of those treaties, if not all, when it comes to the area of the right to life and dealing with areas which could impact on the area of protection of unborn children or abortion, have been discreet in the sense of banning abortion because to do so would mean many countries would not, and could not, ratify the convention.  They leave it open, as she said, in order that each state can make its own mind up to ratify the convention on the basis of its interpretation of what that particular provision means.  Let us assume Ireland is against the idea of abortion.  Ireland can ratify all those various conventions and covenants and has done so.  Another state with wide-ranging abortion can equally do so on the basis that its interpretation will not ultimately yield an outcome which says that what it is doing is contrary to the convention in question.  Its support and ratification is solicited specifically on that basis.  Ireland ratified many of these conventions and covenants before and after 1983.  This is a consistent State policy of Ireland at all stages, and nobody has suggested, nor could they suggest, for a second that Ireland, in doing so, was agreeing to undertake to change its Constitution to introduce abortion.  That is clearly contrary to the good faith basis on which its support and ratification was sought.  None of those treaties provides for a right to abortion.  I outline that proposition with full certainty.<br\/><br\/>We then move to the monitoring committees.  Each of the treaties has a monitoring committee to police and support its implementation in individual countries, and they do excellent work as a general proposition in encouraging states to adhere to their human rights obligations, which they have undertaken by ratifying the treaties in question, but let us stay real.  I implore committee members that if they stay real, they will have to accept the value system, in the past decade or so especially, of the monitoring body members, some of whom are judges and lawyers and very many of whom are enthusiastic proponents of what might be called a right to choose philosophy.  That is their value system, they are perfectly entitled to it, they hold it conscientiously and those are their views.  The monitoring bodies do not articulate law, judgments or obligations that are based on the treaty, which incorporate a treaty obligation.  The relationship between states in international law and the relationship between international law and domestic law is a subtle system, but given the manner in which it is structured, the treaty is the obligation.  The monitoring committees have certain functions with certain implications, but it does not matter what they say.  Ireland is not required to act in a manner which is contrary to the obligations it took on when it ratified the relevant treaties in question.  If one stays real, one will say, if one is speaking as a legal analyst and not a partisan, the manner in which the monitoring committees have simply wiped off the stage any consideration of the right to life or, indeed, any rights of the unborn child is striking.  If members read the various decisions they have taken and recommendations they have made, the unborn child just is not there.  That is a striking critique that can be made.  One Irish commentator has suggested that the manner in which the committees have operated is so manifestly at variance with what is sound international law that their findings in this area should be regarded as <i>ultra vires<\/i>.  That is the situation about the monitoring committees.  I greatly respect Ms Zampas.  I have had an opportunity to chat with her and I like her very much.  We disagree on this particular issue.  She has articulated in her very coherent paper many findings of monitoring committees.  These findings represent the values of those committees, do not penetrate domestic law, and are inconsistent with the values which Ireland understood it was importing when it ratified the conventions in question.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, recommendations.  The committee has had a long discussion about those recommendations, but if it was contemplating adhering to the commission's proposals, I will spell out in more real terms what they mean.  They mean a right to choose philosophy or abortion on demand.  It does not matter how it is described, it means essentially abortion without any meaningful restrictions.  Abortion based on the test of well-being, which is proposed by the commission, would not be a ground that would constitute a limited ground, and I think the committee would agree.  Abortion based on socio-economic or familial status or circumstance equally would not constitute a limiting ground.  The commission says that the scrutinising process whereby these grounds would be implemented should be as minimalist as possible.  The committee and the commission had some discussion about late term abortions and there is some discussion about that in the commission's submission, but there is no indication whatsoever on the part of the commission that it had any concern with late term abortions from a human rights perspective.<\/p><p>From a human rights perspective, the commission did not think it appropriate to mention any human rights concerns about an unborn child in the seventh month of a pregnancy.  It talked about the issue but it did not talk about it from a value perspective in regard to the protection of the unborn child.  If one goes through the text of the paper, as with so many of those decisions and recommendations by the monitoring committee of the various treaties and covenants, one will be searching almost in vain for a reference to the unborn child, foetus, blastocyst or embryo - let us not worry about the terminology.  One will search in vain for a reference to that flesh and blood human being who constitutes a human being whose life is worthy of protection.  I think the committee has caught my drift and I hope I have not overstated it.  <\/p><p> If the committee believes, which it may not, that every human being has an inherent worth and dignity and is worthy of respect, the idea it would contemplate the Citizens' Assembly recommendations to the effect there should be wide-ranging abortion or that it should contemplate implementing the proposals by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which are effectively wide-ranging abortion, then I strongly recommend it not to take that course of action.<\/p><p> I will say one last thing, which might seem to be a slight tangent but which nonetheless might be important for future discussion, about the European Convention on Human Rights, which is a regional convention as opposed to global ones from the UN, and the European Court of Human Rights.  My invitation to the committee is to get real and stay real.  The European Court of Human Rights has a problem - I think the committee will agree - and always had a problem with the right to life provision in Article 2 of the European Convention, which recognises the right to life.  How will it, as a political body that has to maintain the support of countries throughout Europe, deal with the right to life?  It is one thing to create a treaty such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and let each state ratify it with its own interpretation of rights' holders and the right to life.  It is another thing when there is a European convention that actually has teeth, real sanctions and practical political implications.<\/p><p> What the European Court of Human Rights has done will come as no surprise.  It is not a criticism of it but a comment and I defy anybody to say otherwise.  Over the past 30 years, the court has adopted a political interpretation of Article 2 and a strategy of margin of appreciation by not saying Article 2 has any particular meaning.  Each state has the entitlement to interpret it as it wishes in terms of how it understands rights' holders under Article 2.  That is just about okay from a political-pragmatic point of view.  When one then throws in a consensus doctrine, which is the idea that when a number of states move in a particular direction, the court follows them once they have reached a certain critical mass, then human rights have been moved into the area of majoritarian head-counting.  That is the way the court operates.  It has not done so yet in the context of abortion but there are apprehensions and concerns that it might do so in the medium future.  If a human right depends on whether 30 or 40 countries have adopted a particular strategy, I think the committee will agree it is a form of positivist law.  We have moved well away from the value that there is respect attributable to a human being by virtue of their very humanity.<\/p><p> The European Court of Human Rights is a political animal.  It operates in a political context and will behave in a manner which it sees as politically pragmatically appropriate.  In the medium term, that presents challenges to Ireland.  What the committee and Ireland should not do is simply roll over and wait for the consensus doctrine to apply in Europe or simply say we will go along with the \"Right to choose\" philosophy of the individual members of so many of the monitoring committees.  If Ireland believes the unborn child is worthy of protection, it should absolutely assert that right.  When we do get a referendum, as we most likely will next year, that will be the issue.  It will be whether we recognise that unborn children are entitled to respect for their dignity and worth or not.  It is a stark issue.<\/p><p> Having promised to finish, I will now finish and say I think it was clear from the discussion that lasted two hours with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission that it is a stark choice.  Those so called half-way house grounds are not in practice or intended to be limiting grounds; rather they are grounds that open the door to wide-ranging access to abortion.  They are intended by those who propose them to be so.  That is not in any sense to make a bad faith accusation - they are actually intended to be wide-ranging grounds.  The choice is a stark one however it is described in language.  It is a choice on one side between protection of unborn children based on their equality, equal respect for their mother, the right to life of the mother and absolute assurance in those circumstances that the mother's life is not imperilled in any way and, on the other side, wide-ranging abortion.  I do not believe there is a half-way house in practice, if we stay real.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Professor William Binchy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Binchy and Ms Zampas for their presentations.

When Ireland ratifies treaties, for example the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, the Human Rights Committee monitors Ireland's adherence to the treaty.  That is the committee that issued the decision in the Whelan and Mellet cases.  Article 2 of the ICCPR clearly states that the State will fulfil its obligations under the provisions of the treaty to all persons within its territory without discrimination.  One of the treaty's provisions actually creates the human rights body that monitors State compliance.  When Ireland ratified that, it ratified itself to come before a committee that has an interpretive mandate.  By way of example, on its own the right to privacy means nothing - it is just a phrase.  There must be interpretive bodies to define what it means.  Ireland has ratified the treaty which creates this interpretive body and also the optional protocol which Ms Mellet and Ms Whelan used when they filed cases against Ireland.  Ireland agreed to provide that individuals within its territory can file individual complaints against Ireland.  If Ireland were to ignore that, it would ignore the essence of ratification of the optional protocol to begin with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Christina Zampas"},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I will move on to Deputy Clare Daly, who has ten minutes in total.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#T00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank both contributors.

They are negotiated politically in New York or in Europe as the case may be, or in whatever region we are talking about, and they have this conscious diplomatic, ambiguous language which is used.  It is precisely to allow for ratification by states that have had wide-ranging abortion going back many years and states that are against legalised abortion and that protect the unborn child.  That is the whole strategy that is used by those who are formulating the treaties.  Believe me, that is absolutely on record.  It is not an opinion but an absolute acknowledged fact by everybody who is involved in the negotiation of treaties.  The Deputy can read it and see it for herself.  When it comes to the area of abortion, there is high alert in the discussions and tiptoeing.  Those who are formulating these treaties want them to be implemented.  If they were to have what might be regarded as a pro-life treaty, they would have relatively few ratifiers in the present international climate.  The Deputy is absolutely correct to say that in the international climate, particularly in certain quarters, there is wide-ranging support for legalised abortion.  That is obvious.  We would not dispute that.<\/p> <p>  I think the Deputy said I mis-described the Citizens' Assembly recommendations.  I actually said there were recommendations based on disability.

We can exchange quotes later on.  I notice that none of his contribution was referenced but we can deal with that now.  We are trying to develop guidance for changing our legislation.  I would like to ask a question of Ms Zampas.  International human rights law is evolving all the time.  Our challenge here is to change our law to be in compliance with that.  Ms Zampas spent a lot of time dealing with the difficulties of bringing about a restrictive regime or a reasons-based regime.  Will she expand on that?  Would introducing legislation which permitted abortion in cases of, for example, rape, fatal foetal abnormality or serious risk to health satisfy our obligations under international human rights law?  Under international human rights law, when is it permissible to delay or withhold a pregnant woman's access to health-preserving medical care in order to preserve the life of the foetus?  Is it more acceptable if the risk to her health is less severe?  How are those issues dealt with?  Ms Zampas has had experience in El Salvador.  She may like to look at the area of when it is permissible under international human rights law to detain a pregnant person in a hospital or psychiatric facility in order to prolong her pregnancy.<\/p> <p>  It may also be important to touch on the point which Ms Zampas made in her submission, which was that placing women at the centre does not mean that states should ignore foetal interests.  That is a very important point.  Will Ms Zampas elaborate on it?  How could a state like Ireland protect both women and foetuses in the context of abortion law?  What is the best way of doing that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#U01800","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I will begin with the Deputy's first question on grounds-based regimes and how they function.  The only one of the 47 member states of the Council of Europe that has a minimum grounds-based regime which international human rights law speaks to is Poland.  Ireland has the second most restrictive law in Europe.  Malta has a total ban, Ireland has a life exception and Poland has these four grounds.  As was referenced earlier by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, there have been three cases before the European Court of Human Rights in respect of Poland's abortion law.  Those cases did not seek an expansion of the grounds but challenged the fact that these two women and one girl, in separate cases, did not get access to lawful abortion services in Poland.<\/p> <p>  One case concerned a woman's health, one was a case concerning rape and the other case was a foetal impairment case.  These are essentially the grounds in Poland.  In each of those cases, women were not allowed to access abortion and in each of those cases the women who experienced those violations were vulnerable women.  One woman had a disability, another was a child, and another was on a low income.  These are the people who restrictive laws impact.  In each of these three cases, the court found violations of the European Convention on Human Rights in Poland's failure to actually implement its law.  The court said that a right cannot be theoretical or illusory.  It must be real and practical and the state must implement practical measures so that women can access lawful services.  It found that, in these cases, it did not.  In two of the cases, the court also found a violation of the prohibition on inhuman and degrading treatment in not allowing the women access to lawful abortion.  <\/p> <p>  It is very difficult to regulate a grounds-based abortion regime, first of all because there are usually exceptions in the criminal code.  There is criminal liability, which creates a chilling factor.  It is also very difficult for the Legislature to define a health risk specifically.  Human rights bodies have not done that, and neither has the European Court of Human Rights.  These bodies tend not to go into a medical analysis of whether or not there is a health risk.  They just do not like to do that because most of them are lawyers and not doctors or health care providers.  <\/p> <p>  New Zealand also has a minimum grounds-based approach and human rights bodies have heavily criticised New Zealand for its multiple provider authorisation.  New Zealand has something like the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 in that the approval of multiple doctors is required.  It is far less restrictive than Ireland but there is still a requirement for numerous doctors to approve.  It really impacts rural areas where doctors are just not available to give approval.  The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW, has called it a convoluted law which strips away women's autonomy and does not really grant them the right to abortion in the cases provided for in New Zealand's law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#U01900","nonspeaker":"Ms Christina Zampas"},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Would it be fair to say that reasons-based legislation is increasingly out of kilter with international best practice from the point of view of complicating access?

He clarified the position but the use of that word is particularly inflammatory.  He used the words \"enthusiastic for legalised abortion\".  Again, I have an issue with that.  I do not believe a woman is ever enthusiastic about having a termination.  He is quite dismissive of the right to choose and I take issue with that.

What does the witness see as an unborn child having an inherent right to life?  Which one should be protected?  He replied to Deputy O&rsquo;Connell that he does not believe the right to travel should be taken out.  He is saying some people should be able to travel.  In reality it is quite an elitist view of an inherent right to life.  Is it only those in minority groups?  What unborn children actually have that right if it will not be protected at all costs?  This inherent right to life makes the whole argument incoherent.<\/p><p> The presentation started with a list of premises and a conclusion.  As a philosophy graduate of logic, premise No. 1 fell down when it said that foetal life and human life have an equal right to life.  Everything else fell from thereafter for me.<\/p><p> I agree with the presentation on disability down to the last sentence.  While I agree with the first part, what about the right to life of people, the child or young girl with a disability who needs to access abortion but cannot travel in some situations due to a disability?  When one talks about the rights of someone with a disability, one is not talking about foetal life and a possible disability they will have, one is talking about a person in the world.  Will Ms Zampas elaborate on that in a human rights context?  If the unborn child has a significant foetal abnormality that is not likely to result in death before or shortly after birth, how can the State's duty to combat discrimination against disabled people be balanced against its duty to ensure women have access to abortion?  Are they comparable in the sense that when we talk about discrimination against disabled people, we are in fact not talking about foetal life?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#W04200","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Human rights bodies, as I said in my presentation, have recommended that countries ensure access to abortion in cases of severe or fatal foetal impairment.  They go back and forth and are not always consistent.  Looking back at the recommendations over time, they have always been severe.  Lately, they use the term &ldquo;fatal&rdquo; and sometimes they use &ldquo;severe or fatal&rdquo;.  It is hard for a legislator or a committee member to decide for a woman how it will impact them.  These are very difficult decisions.  These are always wanted pregnancies.  They get the determination very late and it is a difficult decision to make.  Women make those decisions, oftentimes with a heavy heart.  We have to keep that real and see that those are not easy decisions for women to make.  They are very individual decisions.<\/p> <p>  The treaty bodies have never said the foetal impairment grounds should be eliminated in a law.  The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recently issued a general comment on women and girls with disabilities.  It recommended states should ensure access to sexual and reproductive health services, the same as any other women, taking into consideration their disability and their needs.  It never addressed the issue of abortion on the grounds of foetal impairment.  That says a lot in its first general recommendation on women with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  The best way to address the problem of discrimination against persons with disabilities is to address the underlying discrimination.  Why is this happening?  Society needs to take steps to make the individual's life, but also the family life of the parents, easy.  There should be benefits, social and educational supports.  It is about time Ireland ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities because it would really help setting its policies straight on helping persons with disabilities.  That is the best way to address this.  Restricting abortion on impairment grounds is not going to limit access to abortion.  Some countries do not have explicit foetal impairment exceptions, but they read health exceptions very broadly to include any sort of health issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Christina Zampas"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>What Ms Zampas said is important because it does provide corroborative evidence of what I said to the committee generally about the enthusiasm of the members of monitoring bodies for a particular value system.

I apologise to Ms Zampas regarding the misunderstanding and I thank her for coming.  I have listened and read carefully what she has said.  In all her work as an international human rights lawyer has she ever raised concerns about barbaric practices, like the treatment of babies born alive after botched abortions and left to die alone without receiving any medical attention or loving care as they breathe their last breaths?  It is a harrowing image I present, but, sadly, it is a real one.  Is Ms Zampas aware &ndash; she probably is &ndash; that England and Canada are two countries where such abuses routinely arise and have been well documented?  Has Ms Zampas ever taken a stand against such horrific abuses?  Is it the singular goal of Ms Zampas in this area to push for wider access to abortion?  I am deeply concerned at the complete absence of reference to infants born alive after abortions.  What exactly are the views of the guests on that?

Is this not a question of the pregnant individual's autonomy rather than the country's autonomy?<\/p><p>Does Professor Binchy accept that if the aim of Ireland's abortion ban was to save so-called unborn lives, it is not doing a very good job?  Given that ten women a day are leaving the country and at least three others are having abortions in their own bedrooms in this country, the ban is certainly not working.<\/p><p>I have a third question for Professor Binchy.  Does he favour forced pregnancy?  Does he favour forcing a pregnant woman who does not want to be pregnant to continue with that pregnancy?  He said earlier that he does not favour injunctions to prevent women from travelling.  It seems to me that he did at one point, when he served as legal adviser to the pro-life amendment campaign, but he just will not get away with it now.  He has said he wants the sources of all claims that are made.  During a lecture Professor Binchy gave in the Coombe in 1980, he said:<\/p><blockquote>If we are to allow sympathy for the woman to stop us from regarding abortion as criminal... why should that sympathy simply stop at our shorelines?  ...A strong argument can be made that our law should give such effect as it can to the principle that unborn life is entitled to be protected.<\/blockquote> <p>He accepted that this would cause a lot of criticism, but he felt there was a strong argument to be made for it.  He seems to have changed his mind since then.  Is that fair enough?<\/p><p>My fourth question relates to a claim Professor Binchy has made about the Citizens' Assembly's proposal that abortion should be available up to birth.  He has suggested that this would lead to abortion with little or no restrictions in place.  Has he not been scaremongering like this for a long time?  He made similar comments in 1992 in response to the ruling in the X case.  He claimed in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>of 6 March 1992 that the ruling had &quot;introduced an abortion regime of wide-ranging dimensions, beyond any effective control or practical limitation&quot;.  He went on to say that as a result of the Supreme Court judgment, &quot;those who authorise and carry out abortions in Ireland [will be placed] beyond the reach of criminal law&quot;.  Nothing could be further from the truth in relation to the X case.  We have seen how it is practically impossible for a woman to access an abortion by claiming she is suicidal.<\/p><p>In 1992, around the time of the X case, Professor Binchy was asked whether he thinks suicidal women should be allowed to have abortions.<\/p><p>He was asked if a woman went on to commit suicide after being refused an abortion, what would he say?  He said that it would be very regrettable.  He also said that there should not be any legal sanctions attaching to travel abroad, which was a change from his previous position.  <br\/><br\/>Professor Binchy is asking politicians to listen to him but did they not listen to him in 1983 and is that not why we are here today?  He says he favours the equal right to life of the unborn child and the woman, which is practically impossible to adjudicate over in any case.  Was it not his original proposal in the pro-life amendment campaign, PLAC, that: &quot;The State recognises the absolute right to life of every unborn child from conception, and accordingly guarantees to respect and protect such a law.&quot;  I believe that is stated on page 63 of <i>Marital, Privacy and Family Law, Studies<\/i>, but I can check that.  Is Professor Binchy not in favour of a lot more than he has said here today?<br\/><br\/>Ms Christina Zampas said that if restrictions are put in place on abortion law, it effectively means that people's human rights cannot be guaranteed.  The witnesses in the previous session said something similar.  Would Ms Zampas be concerned that politicians outside this committee are saying that the type of proposals from the Citizens' Assembly would not be passed by the people and, therefore, they are talking about quite restrictive legislation?  Would that not lead to a continuation of Ireland contravening best practice in human rights laws?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#Z03200","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":327,"content":"<p>There is a limited time for the witnesses to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017100400002#AA00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I will respond briefly.

Most of the 40 member states of the Council of Europe that allow abortion on request range from having a period of 12 to 18 weeks on request.  They allow from ten to a maximum of 18 weeks on request and afterwards they allow for abortion on other minimum grounds.

The notion of it being false advertising was dismissed.  I understand it is also the case that an actuarial study in Ireland estimated conservatively that a similar figure of lives, 100,000, had been saved on the assumption that had there not been the eight amendment legislation would have followed at some stage, gradually, to legalise abortion on increasingly wide grounds.

In other words, they see only one life worthy of being accorded respect for human dignity and human rights whereas Professor Binchy and those of his ilk on the human rights scene have always seen two people.

No human rights body has ever criticised a liberal abortion law or asked a country to restrict its abortion-on-request law.  That is clear.  It is not of late that human rights bodies have not interpreted the right to life to apply to prenatal life; this position goes back to the development of the human rights treaties to begin with, just like with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, CRC.  In every case, including the CRC, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there were attempts to include in the text a right to life from conception or later foetal rights and they were rejected by the states that were in committee and adopted the treaty.

That is how the Committee on the Rights of the Child and many other human rights bodies have addressed the interests of prenatal life, not by calling for bans on abortion or protection of the unborn because we know that such measures do not reduce the number of abortions but only increase illegal abortions and force women to travel.  The WHO is very clear that criminalisation of abortion does not lead to a decrease in the number of abortions.

I am chairman of European Movement Ireland.  It was founded in 1954 and is Ireland&rsquo;s longest established not-for-profit membership organisation dedicated solely to European issues.<\/p> <p>  I will start by congratulating the joint committee for engaging with this important and timely future of Europe debate.  The input of national politicians and institutions on European issues is a crucial bridge between citizens and the EU.  Through being an engaged member state, willing to hold sessions such as this in our national Parliament, Ireland can amplify and attach greater significance to our voice in the EU.  Reasoned and robust debate on how we, as Irish and EU citizens, would want a reforming EU to look is important.  This helps us to formulate our views and thoughts on these multifaceted issues, thereby progressing the European-wide debate in the process.<\/p> <p>  As an organisation, European Movement Ireland is increasingly concerned about the need for greater debate on this topic in Ireland.  Given that Ireland will be the remaining member state most adversely affected by the UK decision to leave the EU, the Irish focus has understandably been on Brexit.  However, we must remember that the focus in many of the other EU member states is more on the future of Europe process.  Indeed, only last week we saw an example of this in President Macron&rsquo;s widely covered speech.  We must ensure that we do not let Brexit completely define our vision on the future of Europe.  Let us have those conversations as to how the EU will develop.  For example, where do we stand on potential pan-European voting lists in the upcoming 2019 European Parliament elections?  How do we feel about more European integration in the area of security and defence?  How do we see the future functioning of the eurozone?<\/p> <p>  These are wide-ranging and critical questions.  It is crucial that we in Ireland interrogate our views on these issues and more.  They directly affect all of us and if we want to have a say on their development, we must first of all be clear on our position.  Ireland&rsquo;s future remains steadfastly in the EU, but there is a responsibility on all of us to ensure that we do not miss the opportunity to engage in this ongoing, live debate and how we in Ireland wish to influence it.  European Movement Ireland commissioned Red C to conduct a national Irish EU sentiment survey in May, around Europe Day, aimed at tracking and measuring Ireland's relationship with Europe.  This year, it found that 88% of those polled think Ireland should remain in the EU, and these numbers are highest in the younger generations - 90% of young people feel Ireland&rsquo;s future continues to remain in the EU.  On the question of whether Ireland should also leave the EU, given the UK has voted to leave, it is notable that only 16% of Irish people agreed with this statement.  Back in 2013, in the first of these polls, that figure stood at 29%.  Interestingly, when asked whether \"Ireland should be part of increased security and defence co-operation\", 57% of those polled agreed that it should be.<\/p><p>These figures illustrate that there is no real public appetite for Ireland to leave the EU.  Therefore, rather than focusing on a binary question of Ireland's EU membership, it would better serve our national interests to actively feed into and shape the European Union of which we will be remaining a part.  Time is of the essence and we need not to shy away from this debate. <\/p><p> While it is necessary and important to critique and evaluate our EU relationship, to put it quite bluntly, EU membership is not the political behemoth that it is in the UK.  As we know, it is the fundamental issues which the future of Europe process is currently raising that requires more informed debate and frank discussion.  In the context of the importance of this debate, I will now pass over to Ms Noelle O'Connell, who will speak about those issues<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Pratt","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507122000,"counter":419,"content":"<p>A Chathaoirligh agus a bhaill coiste, ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il libh as an gcuireadh labhairt libh inniu ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo ar thodcha&iacute; na hEorpa- &aacute;bhar f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach d&uacute;inn in &Eacute;irinn sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann.

We are very grateful to the Chairman and the distinguished members of the committee for the invitation to input into this important and timely future of Europe debate.  I will now go through the five scenarios presented in the European Commission's White Paper on the future of Europe and throw out some topics for discussion.<br\/><br\/>As members know, on 1 March 2017, the European Commission presented a White Paper to open up debate on the future of the European Union.  It initiated this process against the backdrop of increasing challenges from the rise of populism, globalisation, new technologies and security concerns, as well as Brexit.  The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, presented his vision for the future of Europe in his state of the Union address last month, in which he outlined three values that he believes should anchor the EU.  Those values are that Europe is a Union of freedom and equality, underpinned by the strength of EU law.  He referred to this as his &quot;sixth scenario&quot; for his vision for the future of Europe. <br\/><br\/>In terms of the next stages in the process, conclusions on the future of Europe will be drawn at the European Council summit in December 2017 and a course of action will be presented prior to the upcoming European Parliament elections in 2019.  The first thing to say about the five scenarios is that they are not mutually exclusive.  There is overlap between the options and the White Paper was intended to drive the debate rather than confine it.  Having said that, let us consider the scenarios in the order they are listed in the paper.  The first is entitled &quot;Carrying On&quot;.<b><\/b>Under this scenario, the EU 27 would continue to focus on implementing policies and reform agenda by collectively settling on long-term priorities.  There may be positives in maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>, given that EU membership has served us incredibly well.  Indeed, 87% of people polled in our Red C survey this year thought that taking everything into consideration, Ireland has on balance, benefitted from being a member of the EU.  However, it also risks ignoring the underlying problems Brexit and the refugee crisis, for example, have brought into sharper light.  The problem of the disconnect that exists between citizens and the EU decision-making bodies and processes was clearly underlined by the Brexit vote.  How much these issues could be addressed if the carrying on option was pursued is questionable. <br\/><br\/>In the second scenario, entitled &quot;Nothing but the Single Market&quot;, the EU 27 would be re-centred on the Single Market and move away from co-operation on policy in areas such as migration, security and defence.  It would, in effect, be a return to the days of the European Economic Community, EEC, whereby attention is focused on the functioning and operating of the internal market with foreign policy becoming increasingly bilateral in nature.  We must question whether a return to such a purely economic relationship with our European neighbours and partners would be in our best interests, particularly given that Ireland has recently become a net contributor to the EU budget.  After all, it is far more than just economic attractiveness which Ireland gains from membership of the European Union.  As the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Helen McEntee, recently said, the EU is much bigger than the sum of its parts and membership is not a zero-sum game.  EU membership elevates Ireland's political clout on the world stage.  Membership allows small states to amplify their interests in Europe and onto the international playing field.  Many of the challenges we face in the twenty first century are global in nature and do not respect borders.  As an outward looking nation, we are best served to meet these challenges through continued co-operation, engagement and influencing solutions as part of a reforming EU. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Under the third scenario, entitled &quot;Those Who Want More Do More&quot;, the EU 27 would allow coalitions of the willing to act together in specific policy areas.  Member states have the continuous option of joining those coalitions.  This scenario is often termed &quot;multi-speed Europe&quot; and, in many respects, it is a scenario that is already occurring.  For example, 19 of the current 28 member states have adopted the euro as their common currency with economic policy integration.  Most EU member states are in the Schengen area, allowing citizens to cross borders without being subjected to immigration controls; however, some including us, are not.  In practice, if not officially, a multi-speed Europe is already a reality.  Following the European Commission&rsquo;s publication of the White Paper, EU leaders committed in the Rome declaration in March 2017 to acting together &quot;at different paces and intensity where necessary, while moving in the same direction, as we have done in the past, in line with the Treaties and keeping the door open to those who want to join later&quot;.  This implies that a multi-speed Europe may well continue to be a reality.  In Ireland we need to think about how to ensure that we are not left behind.  We also need to think about diversifying and intensifying our existing alliances across Europe, both politically, on a policy-by-policy basis and economically in terms of our trading relationships, especially in the context of our nearest neighbour&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.  In the area of the digital Single Market, for example, we could look to intensify our co-operation with the &quot;Digital 9&quot; group of member states, which includes the Baltic states.  Estonia&rsquo;s current Presidency of the Council of the EU has shown the potential of co-operation in the area of data hubs, for example. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Under the fourth scenario, &quot;Doing Less More Efficiently&quot;, the EU 27 would decide to focus their limited attention and resources on a reduced number of areas, choosing new priorities to allow the Union to act more quickly and decisively in these areas.  Again, like scenario three, in some respects this already operates in practice.  The current European Commission has sought to be big on the big issues and small on the small ones.  Under the Juncker Commission, the number of new initiatives being put forward each year has been reduced from more than 100 to less than 25 and those initiatives are grouped around ten key political priorities. <br\/><br\/>In the fifth scenario, entitled &quot;Doing Much More Together&quot;, the EU 27 would decide to pool more of their power and resources and centralise their decision making.  This would involve closer co-operation in areas such as defence and security, economic and monetary union as well as foreign policy, such as a unified migration policy.  It is by far the most ambitious scenario outlined in the White Paper and offers solutions to some of the structural problems the Union currently faces.  However, it may also be regarded by some as going too far.  It is vital that, as a nation, we consider and put forward arguments as to how much we want Europe to do, what we are comfortable with and what we are not.  We have a limited window of opportunity to input into this critically important and moving process.  First conclusions will be drawn at the European Council summit in December, so it is vitally important that we grasp this opportunity to have our say.  President Juncker has emphasised the need for the EU to &ldquo;catch the wind in our sails&rdquo; and we, as a nation, cannot afford to miss the boat on this debate. <br\/><br\/>EM Ireland welcomes the ongoing work and commitment by the Government to furthering and facilitating this vital debate.  We look forward to playing our part and engaging with both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney and the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507122000,"counter":420,"content":"<p>It has become somewhat of a truism to say the EU needs to be reformed.  Most politicians, commentators, officials and citizens agree on this and arguably Brexit has created a renewed sense of urgency to the process.<\/p><p>The next phase is agreeing in which direction to reform the EU.  Inputting into the White Paper process on the Future of Europe is a crucial step towards this.  Let us remember, as I said earlier, that Ireland&rsquo;s future remains firmly in the Union, so when talking about the future of Europe, we&rsquo;re also talking about Ireland&rsquo;s future in Europe.  It is vital, therefore, that we input into the future of Europe process fully to make sure that our voice is heard and that we have our say.<\/p><p> This fits into a wider point, on which I will conclude.  It is imperative that we do not just frame the case for Ireland&rsquo;s continued EU membership solely around a Brexit discourse.  We must also make the positive case for Ireland's EU membership, what we gain from being a part of the EU, what the EU gains, in turn, from our membership, and what we want to gain in the future.  The future of Europe process provides the ideal platform through which to engage with citizens and policy makers in order to do this.

It is timely that there is a discussion on the future of Europe, although that discussion has been ongoing since the foundation of Europe.  There has always been a debate at the heart of the European project as to what it is we are trying to create.  There has always been a conflict between those who want to use the three phrases - \"ever closer Union\", \"deeper integration\" and a more federal Europe - and those who want a less federal Europe and a more democratic and social Europe.  I fall on the side of wanting a more democrat and social Europe and I am concerned about moves to create a more federal Europe.  We cannot divorce Brexit or even the rise of parties on the far right from reform of the Union because we have to acknowledge that while we have enjoyed huge benefits from the European project, there are also huge challenges and citizens look at Europe sometimes and do not see what Mr. Pratt and Ms O'Connell see.  They look at the reaction to the economic crisis in Europe, what happened in Ireland and in Greece and what has happened in Catalonia in recent times and ask, \"Is this the type of Europe I want to live in?\".<\/p> <p>  Ireland should be at the heart of Europe and our place is in Europe.  I would like the entire island of Ireland to remain in the Union.  That a different issue and it will be worked out though negotiation.  Do the witnesses agree with the viewpoint that there is a need for more democratic Europe as a starting point?  Do they also agree there is a need for a more social Europe?  The central argument for many is that the economic orthodoxy, neoliberalism, that has underpinned the Union has created the circumstances for Brexit and the rise of the far right and we have to rise to that challenge by making sure the Union works for citizens.  Do we need more democracy or more federalism?  That is one of the key questions that has to be answered.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Pratt referred to deeper integration on security and defence.  I have concerns in this regard.  I support Ireland's neutrality and I would be concerned if we had to spend more on security and defence at a time we have many pressing problems domestically.  I am concerned about the democracy element of this in the context of decisions being made to which Ireland is potentially not a party.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Pratt omitted the issue of consolidated taxation.  Every party is having a critical engagement with the EU because there are more concerns as get closer to the \"ever closer Union\" with talk about more scrutiny of budgets and finance Ministers, and consolidated taxes.  People are beginning to say this may be a step too far.  Is that a concern for the EMI?  What is the organisation's views on security and defence?  I would like to hear its view because Mr. Pratt posed a question to us in this regard.  What is the EMI's view on consolidated taxation?<\/p> <p>  People who have concerns about Europe are not on the fringe or on the margins of society.  Even those who believe in being part of the Union, like me, believe it needs to be reformed and that there are difficulties.  Sometimes the argument can be condensed down to concerns among fringe elements, politically or otherwise, but that is not the case.  Many organisations at the centre of politics are asking questions and they want to be part of a debate and part of the solution.   I thank the witnesses for their contributions and I look forward to the responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#C00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Pratt and Ms O'Connell.  I attend EMI meetings whenever I can.  I thank them for the work they do in providing information to Oireachtas Members and the public regarding activities and developments in the EU generally.  The EMI's publication, Just the Facts, is useful for parliamentarians.  It is an excellent two-page sheet which condenses all the issues of the day.<\/p> <p>  We are very much in the process of having the debate on the future of Europe in Ireland.  The President of the European Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, recently made a state of the Union address and the President of the French Republic, Mr. Emmanuel Macron, made a speech last week.  There was a great deal of food for thought in the president's speech, some of which was good but some of which we would have concerns about.  One of the positive proposals he mentioned was halving the size of the Commission, which would be popular but, as Deputy Cullinane said, Ireland will be concerned about the corporate tax harmonisation proposals, deeper integration as regards defence and so on.  At one of end of spectrum, people think that the EU is a partnership of member states while, at the other, people think there is a federal super state.  As politicians, we have to find out where the public is at.  I urge a note of caution in that regard in respect of treaty change, deeper integration, and heading towards a federal super state.  The Irish people will not go there and, therefore, we need to establish where we are at.  Any treaty change arising out of this process will have to be clearly thought out, clearly desirable and clearly put before the people in a referendum.  We have to be at centre of, and have an input, into the debate.  The Franco-German alliance has been re-established and all of us are looking on as both countries put forward proposals.  We want to be part of the debate, which is under way.  I note the urgency the EMI has injected into this, which we will take on board.  Has the EMI a view on the five options, for example?  Has it canvassed its own members on that?  Where are they at in this regard?  EMI members are committed Europeans and perhaps they favour more integration.  Will Mr. Pratt clarify where the organisation as a whole stands in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#C00400","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  I echo the comments of the Chairman regarding Deputy Crowe, a constituency colleague of mine whom I have known for many years.  His depth of knowledge and contribution to the committee was valued.<\/p> <p>  There is a good line in the EMI's presentation about there being five options, which are not mutually exclusive.<\/p><p>At the heart of it we see the real contradiction in respect of how to tackle further development in Europe.  My own view is that federalism has, ironically, probably increased democracy because federal countries view themselves as incredibly democratic.  Yet I would have a huge problem with the notion of a federal European state.  I am pro-European.  I have supported the EU in every referendum we have had.  I believe in greater and deeper integration but, to echo Deputy Haughey's comments,  I certainly do not believe that the Irish people or the European people buy into the notion of a super-federal Europe.  The founders of the European Economic Community, the EEC, did not believe in that.  <\/p><p> A key argument is coming up for us.  Unfortunately, this is where Europe will really feel the loss of Britain.  On many issues Britain and Ireland combined together to provide a particular viewpoint on the dynamic of Europe and the development of its policies.  There is therefore a worry that the loss of a country of that size might allow a Franco-German alliance or co-ordination of policy to dominate.  The biggest risk to deeper European integration is the feeling among the remaining states that their voices are not as important.  I always find it really, deeply disappointing.  I know there is sometimes a tendency for the media to report things in a certain way rather than how they are in actuality.  A statement by the French President or German Chancellor can be covered as if it was European policy.  It is not.  It is a statement by one leader of one country within the EU which has as much validity as the viewpoint which any other leader brings to the table.  That has to be fought and looked at.  <\/p><p> I disagree with some populist viewpoints, for example I disagree with Deputy Haughey on the proposal to cut the Commission.  I have major objections to such an action.  The Commission is at the heart of driving much of the reality of European progress.  A reduction of the size of the Commission would affect the marginalised smaller countries and their ability to contribute to the Commission.  We had this discussion before.  They tried it the last time around as well, for want of a better description.  I know commissioners swear an oath to Europe and that there is no room for national interest, but we could end up in a situation where Ireland could be without a representative at Commission level for ten years.  I would not like to see that.  Those are the type of things against which we need to guard as we progress towards greater integration between the member states.  If decisions are made to structure a future Europe in that way it will eventually result in more countries wishing to leave.  I would be very interested to hear where the witnesses' views on this issue tie into mine.  Some European leaders are in danger of running away and building an edifice to themselves, before realising that an awful lot of people do not want to be involved in that particular version of Europe.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#C00500","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.  To come in on the back of the comments which have already been made I, like others, would like to know what the witnesses see as the major challenges in dealing with Europe's problems and the negativity surrounding it.  In the recent Brexit vote we saw opportunism, selective negativity and campaigning being used to achieve an outcome.  Some of the leaders involved at the time are no longer around to follow through on the commitments and promises which were given should people in the UK vote to leave the EU.  That was being selective.  What are the witnesses' opinions on the best way to approach the likes of that into the future, so that other countries do not take the same actions?  What is the best way to ensure breakaway groups do not promote the same type of campaign, which could lead to further splits within the EU?  I know that the EU itself has mechanisms for dealing with that.  It is taking a hard line with the UK at the moment.  That might not result in the desired outcome, but it will not stop other countries or splinter groups advocating to leave the EU in the interim.<\/p> <p>  When one goes out to rural Ireland, it is felt that there is a major disconnect between the EU and the ordinary people of Ireland who are operating and working daily.  While the people of rural Ireland acknowledge all the excellent benefits which have come from Europe - and I am pro-Europe myself - they feel that some of the legislation and regulations which have come in have made it difficult for different areas to operate, as they are introduced on an umbrella basis and one does not fit all.  Sometimes such a vacuum can create an energy to oppose the EU or the establishment.  Do the witnesses see any way to reconnect if such a disconnect is there?  It is felt on the ground.  Whether it is real and whether it is isolated cases or a general feeling, it is felt.

I will pick up on a couple of points.  Deputy Cullinane made many salient and valid points.  I fully agree with him.  There has always been a debate at the heart of the European project.  There has always been robust challenges between those who desire an ever-closer union and those who do not.  We absolutely concur that we must work to ensure a European Union which works for all citizens.  As an organisation, we see our role and our mission as developing the connection between Ireland and Europe and ensuring that we in Ireland have our say on what type of Europe we want.  We also try to explain, communicate and act as a conduit in Ireland for the European side of things.  We would certainly never claim that the EU is perfect.  It is not a panacea for all ills.  It absolutely is not.  Has it been in Ireland's interest to be a member however?  We are unequivocally of the view that it has been and that it will continue to be, provided that we have our say and make sure to influence and shape the ongoing debate which the Deputy outlined.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the issue of social Europe, we absolutely agree.  It is important that Europe continues to work to promote and strengthen the connection between citizens and the institutions.  The Deputy touched upon some of the challenges which the EU faces.  In many cases it can seem to be a matter of them versus us, but it is not.  We are all citizens and there is an onus and a responsibility on all of us to have our say and to try to influence and improve the EU.  <\/p> <p>  On neutrality and defence, the question which we asked in the Red C poll, and which Mr. Pratt outlined, was an interesting one.  In 2015 the president of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, mooted the possibility of an EU army.  We asked about that in the Red C poll, to genuinely see what Irish people thought about the idea.  While we must respect that polls and barometers are only a snapshot of viewpoints at a particular point in time, 66% of Irish people polled in 2015 did not favour Ireland being part of an EU army as proposed by Mr. Juncker at the time.  Interestingly, the poll we commissioned this year, which we referenced in our address, was taken to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the Brexit vote, around Europe week.  We wanted to see where Irish people's views on the issue were.  It was interesting that 57% of Irish people favoured closer defence and security co-operation.  We fully agree-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":431,"content":"<p>They are two different questions.

We just wanted to take snapshots of the current, timely debates.<\/p><p>There are differences in and a variety of views, which are perhaps evolving.<\/p><p> To go back to what Mr. Pratt and I have tried to bring across in our presentation to the committee today, this is part of a wider discussion.  We should not be afraid to have the debate on that point.  We certainly believe the EU can continue to be reformed and made more efficient.  We certainly welcome that ongoing debate as part of the solutions.  <\/p><p> I thank Deputy Haughey for his kind words about Just the Facts.  We are delighted.  We take great pride in trying to demystify and de-jargon the EU.  This can be a bit of a challenge at times so we are very grateful for the Deputy's kind words.  He actually posed an interesting question.  There is a spectrum of views among our organisation's members.  I believe the chairman, Mr. Pratt, would agree with me.  We are a very broad church.  Some of our members would absolutely favour more federalist, closer integration, whereas others would not.  The common theme that brings together all our members is that we do believe Ireland's are best served by remaining a part of a reforming European Union and that we have a responsibility, role and opportunity to influence the shape of that.  Time is of the essence.  <\/p><p> With regard to the five options, and to follow on from Deputy Brophy's question on whether we have a particular view, we do not regard the options as mutually exclusive.  This is part of an ongoing debate, dialogue and process.  As the debate evolves, it will feed into this future of Europe process.  The Chairman is to be commended on having the initiative to have this debate.  We are determined to have an input into the process and support the important work of the committee in whatever way we can. <\/p><p> I thank Deputy Brophy very much for his contribution.  He made a really interesting point on the pronouncements and the various EU leaders.  Sometimes we in Ireland can lose sight of the fact that we have a voice at the table.  The Taoiseach has a voice in the same way as the French President, Mr. Macron.  It is important that we become quite vocal in this regard and not shy away from the challenges, and also the opportunities that will arise as we seek to air our view and ensure it is heard.  <\/p><p> When I conclude, I shall pass over to the chairman, Mr. Pratt.  I thank Deputy O'Rourke for his comments.  I come from a rural background, as he might have picked up from the accent.  I am obviously well aware of the challenges that rural areas face.  I would argue also the far better position that rural Irish communities are in thanks to our membership of the EU and the support it continues to give.  Let us not lose sight of the principle of subsidiarity, which presents an important opportunity for national parliaments in influencing the decision-making process.<\/p><p> With regard to the disconnect and the threats associated with the communications on the Brexit referendum, I would be more than happy to come back for a five-hour session and do a workshop on it, with the permission of the Chairman.  It is a matter on which European Movement Ireland has very strong views.  Last year's Brexit referendum is a matter on which we worked very actively.  As part of ensuring that people's voices were heard, we ran, with great support from Members of the Oireachtas, the PhoneAFriend voter-registration campaign.  It is really important that people have their say.  It is something we will continue to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Connell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#E00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507122000,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I shall respond to some of the questions the Deputies have raised.  They were very interesting and constitute a very important part of the debate, which is great.  In terms of the scenarios that have been aired, my view is that we will probably end up with a hybrid of all five, or maybe a hybrid of four.  I am not being specific about which ones they might be.  The crucial point to me is that we get the debate going and that people look into the depths of those scenarios and test them out.  Crucially, the citizens must be brought along in the debate.<\/p> <p>  It is absolutely the case that the European Union needs reform.  As somebody who has been very involved all his life in consumerism, I have long held the view that if people live in a bubble and do not understand what is going on in the daily lives of people, there is a disconnect.  The longer one lives in that bubble, the greater the disconnect.  For me, the really crucial piece is how Europe explains to its citizens its relevance to their daily lives.  There are great examples that rarely come up in the popular debate about Europe.  Commentary is mostly about red tape, the Union being too big or too structured.  There is less talk about the benefits of travel and the opportunity concerning the freedom of the skies.  What about roaming and water directives?  There are many things that Europe has done very positively but classically the debate is frequently on the negative and not on the positive.  A balanced debate is important.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane asked about the consolidated tax base.  From an Irish point of view, it is really crucial that we retain control of decisions around tax.  We all know how open our economy is and of the threats posed to it by Brexit.  I personally regard that as a red-line issue for the future of Ireland, its citizens and job opportunities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Pratt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507122000,"counter":436,"content":"<p>We would really welcome that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507122000,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Very much so.  That is part of what we do as an organisation.  For us it is about how we communicate to the average citizen in Ireland about what Europe is doing so he or she will understand how important it is to have a view and to be able to express it.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Brophy's comments and the size of the Commission and so on, every organisation has to live in an iterative world.  Nothing is perfect, things move on and we live with change.  It is really important that the Commission examine its structure and size and find a mechanism whereby it becomes more fit for purpose for citizens.  It is a great challenge to relate a massive budget to the daily lives of citizens.  After all, we are part of a community of 500 million citizens.  That is how we should think about it.<\/p> <p>  On the very valid questions as to what would happen to the Irish voice in Europe if the structure were slimmed down and whether we would have commissionerships and so forth, possibly the only positive thing I could say about Brexit, or the threat of it, because it has not happened yet, is that I feel it has made Ireland more aware of the importance of getting closer to like-minded member states.  That will be of significant benefit to us in the future.  Had the Brexit issue not arisen, that might not have happened.  That is really important.<\/p> <p>  I have always been impressed when visiting Brussels by the degree to which the Irish nation has integrated itself into European Union activities.  In many respects, it has punched above its weight in its ability to influence.  I hope we do not lose that capacity.  With the prospect of Britain leaving - I say \"the prospect\" because it has not happened yet - I share the concerns based on the view that Britain has been a really important partner for us in many of the debates.  If I examine the long-term prospect of a European Union without Britain, or any other major nation state, I note that large countries have such a scale that they will recover in time.  It is much more difficult for small member states to do that because they simply do not have the economic heft of larger states.<\/p><p>Broadly, those are our views.<\/p><p> In conclusion, the European Union has major challenges but we have a major challenge in Ireland to raise this debate beyond the issue of Brexit.  Clearly, all of the Deputies are in favour, from what they have said about us continuing to be a member of the European Union because they have seen its positives.  We have got to get that positive message out there.  That is difficult to do in a digital world where it is hard to get somebody to pay attention for 60 seconds when one is dealing with complicated stuff, which is why, frankly, our campaign Just the Facts has been of great benefit.  The campaign draws people's attention to what we believe are really important communicative issues and we will continue do so.  It is a challenge.  Our role in Europe in positing the importance and the benefit of being a member of Europe has never been more important for us to continue to press forward, as an organisation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Pratt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Pratt.

I thank both witnesses for their responses and I agree with almost everything they said.<\/p> <p>  Earlier the word \"Eurosceptic\" was raised and I appreciate the context in which it was raised.  It was also mentioned earlier that the debate often comes down to a \"them and us\" type of debate and that feeds into the notion of labelling people as Eurosceptics and putting them all into one box.  I know many people who are Eurosceptic but do not want Ireland to leave the European Union.  Sometimes it cuts both ways.  People who are more enthusiastic about Europe also have to recognise that simply because people have a difficulty with elements of Europe does not make them anti-European or anti-Europe.  In fact, sometimes it is quite the reverse because they are genuinely interested in wanting to build a different type of Europe.  We have to allow that type of discourse and understand it.  <\/p> <p>  I also agree that we should not allow ourselves in Ireland to be defined by Brexit in terms of how we see the European Union.  Something has happened with Brexit that is relevant to this debate on the future of Europe and it is as follows.  We have to listen to people and engage with them.  One of the issues that was at the heart of the Brexit debate, if we want to be honest, was immigration.  People had a fear of immigration.  I come from a political viewpoint where I see immigration as positive.  I believe in multiculturalism and I believe immigration enriches society.  When people express their concerns to me about immigration I listen and engage but, unfortunately, sometimes we do not, we shout them down, label them as racists and lose the argument.  The same applies to Europe.  The way to talk about the future of Europe is not to immediately see somebody who has a different viewpoint on Europe as Eurosceptic or as somebody who wants Ireland to leave the European Union.  That is the type of environment we need to create.<\/p> <p>  Earlier I made the point that my party would have been seen as more critical than others of the European Union.  However, all parties are now more critical particularly when one considers such issues as consolidated taxation and so on, mainly because it impacts more now on issues that affect them, maybe less than when it was social issues.  Now the issues are more economic so people are more alert to them.  That is fine but they are still engaging critically with Europe and that is healthy.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#F00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#F00400","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>If we do not see it as healthy then we have problems.

When I was out of the room I followed the debate with interest.<\/p> <p>  I have one suggestion on which I would love to hear the thoughts of the delegation.  There is a danger in considering Junker's five scenarios as our frame because we would lose focus on what actually needs to happen in Europe.  Much of his focus and the focus of his scenarios is about the speed of Europe, is it going to be multi-speed, etc. and it is not about the direction of Europe.  There are options that are not about simply carrying on or where we pool the new or centralise decision-making further, they are about doing things somewhat differently from how we do them at the moment.  We must ensure that Ireland takes very seriously the role it has to play in every arena we have at the moment, for example, the European Council and the Council of Ministers.  Ireland should not simply attend and see what is on the agenda.  We should debate what Ireland brings to the agenda of the Council of Ministers and demanding to be on the council.  In terms of the European Commission, to what extent are we waiting for edicts to be produced?  Are we pressing the European Commission?  A very important point is coming up now whereby the European Commission will need to seek a new trade negotiation mandate for phase 2 of Brexit.  Are we going to have public discussion on what should go into that trade negotiating mandate or will we wait until after the fact and then complain that we do not like the mandate?  There are key spaces that need to be activated now.  The \"for or against\" Europe discussion has an inherent danger because it is not that at all; it is about Europe.  <\/p> <p>  I have a serious concern about a key role on which I would love to hear the comments of the delegation.  I refer to the narrative on defence and the suggestion, for example, that to be with Europe one must be uniformly onboard with the idea of what Macron has now proposed in terms of defence.  Ireland has a key history in peacebuilding.  It is an asset to Europe to have a country that has international credibility in peacebuilding.  I ask the delegation to comment on why Europe needs to widen its skills, especially in terms of the securitisation agenda, and start delivering in areas such as peacebuilding and diplomacy, which are almost at the origin of the European project.  Have peacebuilding and diplomacy fallen by the wayside?  As we have seen in Catalonia and elsewhere, Europe seems to have washed its hands of those jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#F00600","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":444,"content":"<p>Earlier I made my point about the European Commission quite clumsily.

Sometimes we forget that we are a part of Europe and we have a role to play, as outlined by Senator Higgins.  Therefore, we must ensure that we continue to have our say.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane mentioned immigration, migration and listening to people.  I could not agree with him more.  The tone of the rhetoric, how divisive and how challenging everything was during the Brexit referendum was something that we did not welcome.  While respecting that it was a decision for the UK electorate, we were unequivocal in our view that Brexit would not be in anyone's interest.  <\/p> <p>  On the migration issue, we would like it to gain more prominence.  More than 700,000 Irish people live in Britain and 5 million British people can claim at least one Irish born grandparent.  Again, it is something to bear in mind.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane also mentioned Eurosceptics.  I believe it is important to be constantly critiquing, interrogating and questioning our relationship with Europe.  It is also only right that political parties do so, and is to be welcomed.  From a European Movement Ireland perspective, the ongoing future of Europe debate should be fully inclusive and, as Mr. Pratt said, we must make sure that the voices of citizens are involved.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Haughey raised some interesting and important points in terms of the opportunities for a more effective functioning of various EU institutions.

Sometimes we lose sight of the fact that we have a voice at more than one table.  For instance, the European Parliament will also have to have a say on the deal.  Therefore, it behoves all of us to make sure the Irish point of view is communicated robustly in each of the institutions and at all levels.

I do not suggest for one moment that my organisation has all of the answers, but it is very important, now that our nearest neighbour has voted to leave the European Union, that we examine and understand why it has done so and ensure such an outcome will not be repeated elsewhere.  <\/p> <p>  The ICMSA is a pro-European Union organisation.  Since Ireland joined the EEC, with the United Kingdom and Demark, in 1973, there have been many benefits from membership.  There have also been some negative effects, but as an organisation, we set out to maximise in a pragmatic fashion the benefits for our members who happen to be citizens of the European Union, while minimising the negatives.  This meeting presents a valuable opportunity to discuss matters with people who get to make decisions on a day to day basis, unlike the public which only gets an opportunity to decide every five years or so.<\/p><p>We very much welcome the White Paper on the Future of Europe and the opportunity it gives us to have an open and honest discussion and reflect on where we are at this point.  However, the White Paper does not refer to agriculture or rural development in any specific way.  It refers to trade, trade deals, taxation, defence.  That is disappointing because, from the perspective of the ICMSA, agriculture and rural development are the most important points.<br\/><br\/>The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, has some inconsistencies and the messaging around it is not as clear as we would like.  One example of these inconsistencies is the fact that we must do more with less.  The EU wants the family farm structure to provide food for the citizens of Europe and I am of the view that this resonates with every single person on the Continent.  Everybody has to eat and although many do not understand food, they can identify with its importance.  However, politicians do not put food-related issues front and centre.  It is integral to all our lives.  That is why I feel there are inconsistencies.  Ask any European consumer how they want their food produced, and they will reply that food produced on family farms in Europe is the ideal, but there is talk of EU cuts to the budget.  We feel that is an inconsistency and there is a requirement to have an adequate budget to achieve what the EU sets out to achieve in terms of maintaining its model of agriculture.  The opening round offer on the table for a Mercosur deal is that 70,000 tonnes of beef from the Mercosur countries will be allowed into the EU market tariff free.  We are very much opposed to that deal because we feel it down plays standards and sustainability.  Sustainability is defined in terms of the economic, social and environmental pillars.  If we do not get all three pillars of the sustainability model correct, then imbalances will cause it to fall.  That needs to be addressed when we are discussing the future of Europe.<br\/><br\/>We believe there is unfair implementation of the habitats directive and the birds directives and the ability to generate an income from farming in these areas is compromised because of the derogations and the regulations and the fact that land is effectively sterilised.  This will end up with land abandonment.  There must be more discussion in greater depth on this.<br\/><br\/>In global terms, urbanisation is increasing by 1% per annum.  What can the European Union do to implement pragmatic policies that will help maintain, support and sustain viability in rural areas, not only in Ireland but in all member states?  I have the luxury of sitting on the board of the European Milk Board and other bodies and I get the opportunity to speak to European counterparts from all member states.  I am aware, therefore, the urbanisation process is reflected all across the member states of the EU and there is a lack of viable alternatives in the context of retaining populations in regional and rural centres.<br\/><br\/>There is a need to get matters right when it comes to regulation for farmers and small businesses.  Increasingly, multinationals have an unfair advantage over small traders and businesses because the same regulation is being applied to both.  This makes matters impractical for those small traders and businesses.<br\/><br\/>We need to improve how we communicate the values of EU membership.  If the European Union is to remain strong, we need to be able to explain to our children the values it espouses.  We need to engender more pride in how we communicate and describe what it means to be a member of the European Union.  First, one wants to be a proud European citizen, then a proud Irishman or Irishwoman and it filters down to being a proud parish man or parish woman.  We need to get the balance right.  What has happened in Ireland which has distorted the message regarding the importance of the Union, is that we - and I include politicians here - blame the EU when things go wrong.  When things go right, however, Ireland takes the credit.  Ultimately, Joe and Josephine Public have the vote.  We saw what happened in the UK.  We, as Europeans, cannot be complacent or believe that this voting pattern will not be replicated.  I know the threat of contagion has waned a little but we need to be able to explain and justify policies.  Let me provide an example.  If one asked any person in Dublin who is not a direct primary producer or farmer &quot;What is the CAP and what does it do?&quot;, they would say that it is a subsidy for farmers.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The CAP has been in existence since the Treaty of Rome to provide sustainable, affordable and safe food for the citizens of the Continent.  It is as much a consumer subsidy as it is a farmer subsidy, yet people are afraid to say that and CAP is never explained clearly.  That creates division and derision among our population.  We need to be upfront, honest and able to deal with explaining the reasons for the CAP.<br\/><br\/>Our task was to examine the five different scenarios proposed in the White Paper.  We would favour scenario 1, the <i>status quo, <\/i>with some tweaks from scenario 4 as being ideal.  This would make matters more efficient.  Scenario 2, which is just to focus on the market, will never work.  We are utterly opposed to scenario 3, a two-speed Europe.  I think that would ultimately lead to the collapse of the Union.  I think scenario 5, giving more power to the centre of Europe, would not work for small member states, and Ireland would be very vulnerable.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman and members for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Comer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Comer and Mr. Enright for being here.

My name is James Healy.  I am national president of Macra na Feirme.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Denis Duggan, chief executive, and Mr. Derrie Dillon, agriculture and rural affairs manager.<\/p> <p>  Macra na Feirme is a voluntary organisation for young people between the ages of 17 and 35.  The organisation consists of a nationwide network of clubs, with six key areas of activity: agriculture; sports; travel; public speaking; community involvement; and performing arts.  The vision of Macra na Feirme for rural Ireland is to have rural and agricultural communities that are active and vibrant socially, economically and culturally, in which young people, including young farmers, play an active and recognised role and that are attractive and nurturing places in which to live and work.  By means of our work and our commitment to Europe, through our participation in Rural Youth Europe and European Council of Young Farmers, CEJA, we advocate a similar vision for rural Europe. <\/p> <p>  As the EU marks 60 years since the signing of the Treaty of Rome, we welcome the opportunity that exists to input the views of citizens on the Union's White Paper on the Future of Europe.  One of the key questions relates to how we can support and engage with the next generation of Europeans.  These Europeans are the most skilled, educated and mobile generation ever.  How can Europe achieve the vision of vibrant rural communities akin to that which Macra na Feirme has set out for rural areas here?  How can Europe address the new challenges it faces while retaining its founding principles and core values?  How can Europe communicate and engage with and address the needs of young EU citizens who are the future of the Union and who will ultimately shape it into the future?<\/p> <p>  Macra na Feirme has always been a strong advocate of the values of the European project.<\/p><p>Prior to Ireland joining the European Union, the European Commissioner for Agriculture, Dr. Sicco Mansholt, addressed a Macra na Feirme national conference in 1970 in Tralee on his infamous Mansholt plan.  Macra na Feirme held a series of information meetings and seminars and lobbied for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in the 1972 European Economic Community referendum.  The commitment of Macra na Feirme to Europe then and now has never been in doubt.  Fast-forwarding to 2017, the ten policy areas under the Jean-Claude Juncker agenda for jobs, growth, fairness and democratic change are boosting jobs, growth and investment, the digital Single Market, a resilient energy Union, a fairer internal market, fairer economic and monetary union, balanced free trade agreements with the US, justice and fundamental rights, migration policy, and being a stronger global actor and a Union of democratic change.  These are important policy areas that will shape the future of Europe and impact on future generations.<br\/><br\/>I will address the future of agriculture and the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  A worrying concern is there is no reference to the Common Agricultural Policy in the Future of Europe document.  In all of the five scenarios put forward, there is no impact assessment of the outcomes on the Common Agricultural Policy, which accounts for close to 40% of the EU budget.  The CAP has been in place since 1962 and benefits not just farmers, but the European population as a whole.  Outside the agricultural community, the benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy are often overlooked, as well as its importance to rural communities.  A case in point is the absence of a reference in the Future of Europe White Paper.  The CAP has an economic multiplier effect of five to one and the public good and social benefit to rural Ireland and Europe are immeasurable.<br\/><br\/>At present, 55.7% of European farm owners are aged 55 or over and therefore &quot;approaching or beyond the regular pension age&quot;, with a mere 6% of farm owners under the age of 35.  That is from EUROSTAT 2016.  Young farmers and generation renewal within agriculture are essential for ensuring the long-term competitiveness and sustainability of European agriculture.  With this said, it is crucial the next CAP addresses the current age demographic within European agriculture and implements measures to lower it.  Young farmers are the lifeblood and future of rural communities, providing direct and indirect employment, raw materials for exports and further processing environmental and countryside management.  The future of agriculture and rural areas relies on young farmers, and it is imperative the necessary resources and supports are made available to allow the development of their farm businesses to fulfil this expectation.<br\/><br\/>Another point on the Common Agricultural Policy is the budget for the next CAP programme.  The budget of the EU and the proportion the CAP receives from the budget is a very topical matter.  Ongoing global events and challenges, such as the migrant crisis, terrorism and climate change, cannot put pressure on the CAP budget.  Increasing the Common Agricultural Policy budget will deliver and contribute to the EU Commission&rsquo;s jobs and economic growth agenda.  The Common Agricultural Policy 2020 must include measures to protect Irish farmers from the fallout of Brexit.  The CAP budget cannot be sacrificed to meet the very real and present dangers associated with terrorism or migration.  National parliaments and governments must find new money to contribute to tackling new European problems.<br\/><br\/>Europe has been poor at communicating what is great about the EU.  Engagement and active participation of young people in EU issues and developing their interest and understanding of what the EU can achieve is critical to the future of Europe.  Supporting and recognising the value of young people's organisations as vehicles for training and development of informal life skills is critical to unlocking active engagement.  Youth organisations facilitate structured dialogue with young people to feed into decision-making processes.  They also contribute to the personal, political, social and economic development of young people.  The significant importance of EU-funded programmes such as Erasmus+ to support youth organisations delivering intercultural development of young people highlights what is great about EU activities and engagement.<br\/><br\/>As outlined, it is important that young people engage and shape the debate on the future of Europe.  Macra na Feirme engages in European policy development through active participation in the Council of European Young Farmers and Rural Youth Europe.  Young farmers and rural youths meet with European counterparts and understand each others' perspectives in achieving a European multifunctional agriculture, which is underpinned by the Common Agriculture Policy.  There are differences in farming practices across Europe, but young farmers from all member states work together for the betterment of European agriculture in the spirit of being European.  A good example of this is in the current Common Agriculture Policy.  Macra na Feirme developed a policy proposal for a young farmer support and with the help of our European colleges, this became the European young farmers policy and subsequently formed part of the Common Agricultural Policy.<br\/><br\/>Access to a quality, sustainable job market is a key deliverable of the EU.  Up to one in five young people is out of work in the EU, and this is a major economic and social cost.  Fostering and supporting entrepreneurship among young people and progressing the Youth Guarantee scheme must be a key priority for the EU.  Young people need to have confidence in their future.  In the words of former Vice President of the World Bank, Ismail Serageldin:<\/p><blockquote>Unemployed youth, with no prospect of being integrated into a better future is a prescription for disaster.  If young people do not have a stake in the existing social order and political order, if they do not feel there is a way for them, why should they sacrifice today for a better tomorrow?  Why should they have an interest in protecting the stability and social safety of that system? <\/blockquote><p>With all the challenges posed in Europe by terrorism, migration, radicalism, and so forth, the former World Bank Vice President has offered some possible insight to part of the problem.<br\/><br\/>Travel broadens the mind and encouraging young people to explore the EU and learn from different cultural experience helps delivers on the objective of lifelong learning.  Erasmus+ and the European Solidarity Corps programmes support the mobility of young people for working abroad, studying or volunteering.  According to the European Youth Forum, the youth sector represents only 10% of the Erasmus+ budget but mobilises more than 25% of all programme participants, and it is not able to respond to the increasing demands of young people across Europe.  We caution against the populist rhetoric on integration and its constant association with the negative.  Ease of travel in every way, from cost, visa and passport control, deregulation, and so forth has been one of the great success stories of the European project.<br\/><br\/>The European Fund for Strategic Investment helps drive investment.  Ireland is ranked 17 for utilising this instrument.  Finance is the engine for growth and developing financial instruments and tackling the investment gap for small and medium enterprises, SMEs, in Europe will help develop rural areas.  Improving access such as roads, ports and interconnections; funding and guarantees for SMEs, including the agri sector; and capital investment by universities are all stimuli that will help EU citizens reach their potential.<br\/><br\/>On the matter of trade deals, the mothers, fathers, aunts and uncles of our members are outside protesting today with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, over beef access into the EU under Mercosur.  Macra na Feirme supports them in their efforts to highlight the absolutely detrimental impact this would have on Irish and European beef farming.  Negotiating a trade deal with South American countries that has such a potential negative impact on our largest indigenous industry is grossly irresponsible, especially when the impacts of Brexit are still unknown.  We recognise the importance of EU trade deals to prosper but not at the cost of sacrificing agriculture.  Macra na Feirme calls for a full impact assessment on all trade deals, current and prospective, and this must be undertaken before any deal is agreed on Mercosur.  We need balanced trade deals that benefit European and Irish farmers, and trade deals that recognise the threats and impacts of Brexit.  Entering into a Mercosur with such a large quantity of the EU beef market available to countries that do not meet equivalent European standards is reckless.<br\/><br\/>At a committee in May, Macra na Feirme outlined six solutions for Brexit, including maintaining the strongest possible trading relationships with the UK post-Brexit; securing as favourable UK market access as possible and sufficient resources to identify new markets for Irish agri-business products; an all-island approach to animal health and environment; access to the European Globalisation Fund for upskilling; increasing spaces in Irish third level institutes to compensate for expected increase in places due to reduction in access to UK universities; and maintaining the CAP budget at European level.  We note the RTE news story this morning citing an EU Commission memo that suggests an all-island solution for customs.  We cautiously welcome what would appear as the emergence of some practical solutions for dealing with the significant impacts of Brexit.<\/p><p> The White Paper on the future of the European Union outlines five scenarios, but it does not draw conclusions as to the Commission's preferred scenario.  In his state of the European Union address in September Jean-Claude Juncker presented a sixth scenario based on the principles of freedom, equality and the rule of law.  His vision for the European Union to be more united in the areas of banking, the eurozone and the Schengen agreement included all member states.  Of concern is the rhetoric he used.  We do not want a federal Europe.  We do not want a European Union that is focused solely on expansion and integration.  As Europeans, we need to develop an emotional connection to the European Union which must encourage this connection between it and citizens.  People in the European Union need to feel European for that connection to work.  It will ultimately lead to greater awareness of what the European Union is doing to benefit citizens.<\/p><p> Looking at the five scenarios posed in President Juncker's vision document, we ask which is closest to achieving all of the above.  It is perhaps a combination of scenarios Nos. 1 and 5.  A two-speed European Union is not a solution for the future, while the Single Market approach will not address collective challenges such as security, defence, terrorism, migration or climate change.  Therefore, the scenarios entitled, \"Carrying On\" and \"Doing Much More Together\", appear to be closest to achieving a positive future for Europeans in line with the four founding freedoms enshrined in the Treaty of Rome.  To borrow a phrase from the European Commissioner Phil Hogan, the future of the European Union should be an evolution of ideas and policies, not a policy revolution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Healy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#K00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Mr. Healy had me until the last quote.  I welcome both groups and the opportunity to discuss the future of the European Union.  There will be an overlap with the questions put to the previous group as it is on the same topic.  We discussed the same issues with the group which attended earlier.<\/p> <p>  It appears that there is consensus among the farming groups, which I welcome, that they would not favour a more federal Europe.  That is something I support.  Do they also agree that there is a need for more democracy in the European Union and that it needs to be a more social Europe which delivers more for citizens?  Both groups mentioned Brexit as well as other issues which have given rise to concerns about the European Union.  I want Ireland to remain within the Union and be at the heart of it, but it must be a European Union of which people want to be part and one which they see delivering for them.  When we talk about reform, notwithstanding the big principles and the five questions posed as to what we want, are democracy and having a more social Europe in accordance with the delegates' values?  That is the bigger vision of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  My second question is related to the CAP.  Agriculture and the European Union have gone hand in hand in Ireland.  The CAP is very important to the farming groups in terms of their relationship with the European Union and obviously agriculture is very important to Ireland.  In the south east from where I come agriculture and the agribusiness sector are hugely important.  Both groups stated funding levels under the CAP had been cut.  Are they simply calling for the budget to be increased or are they calling for reform of the CAP?  Depending on the farming organisation to which I talk, some focus more on simply increasing the budget, but others will state the CAP needs to be reformed because it is unfair and benefits a certain category of farmers over others.  Is there a view among the delegates' organisations that the CAP needs to be reformed or is it simply the case that they want the budget to be increased?  I acknowledge that they can only speak for their own groups, but it is a genuine question because the committee needs to understand the position.  I have to be able to understand it because that will frame how I respond.<\/p> <p>  Regional development was mentioned.  That issue cannot be divorced from the national planning framework, on the one hand, or from what is happening in the European Union, on the other.  What are the views of the delegates on the national planning framework?  Have their organisations made submissions on it?  It is accepted by almost every organisations that there is a severe lack of capital investment in the State because of the inflexibility of the fiscal rules and how they are applied.  IBEC, trade unions and others have been very vocal on the need to reform the fiscal rules to allow for greater investment in capital infrastructure which is one of the big asks in rural Ireland.  Do the delegates' organisations have a view on the matter?  It is obviously going to be part of reforming the European Union.  Are the rules too rigid?  Are they one-size-fits-all?  Do they work, or do they need to be reformed?  Have the organisations given the matter any thought?<\/p> <p>  As a party which represents people across the island, Sinn F&eacute;in is very concerned about the North of Ireland leaving the European Union on foot of Brexit.  Having one part of the island in the European Union and one part outside is not good.  Notwithstanding any positivity in the language from Britain or the European Union, we are still concerned about what the end product will be.  What are the views of the delegates' respective organisations?  Different sectors will be affected differently by Brexit.  I can only set out my experience in the south east where I have met many agrifood business organisations which are affected by currency fluctuations most especially.  They see Brexit as a real threat.  Is the Government doing enough and are we doing enough politically, as it is not just about the Government, and as a country to protect different sectors against Brexit?  What more could be done to protect the farming sector from all of the threats coming from Brexit?  Are the farming and agrifood sectors challenged to a greater extent by it?  What about the geographical considerations?  For example, the south east is facing a big challenge.  If the delegates' agree, what solutions should be put in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#K00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations in which a number of really interesting points were raised.  Luckily, Deputy David Cullinane picked up on some of them.  There are one or two areas in which we could probably have a disagreement, but this is not the place in which to do so.  I may have had different views from those of the delegates on the habitats and birds directives which have a role to play in the national pollination plan and the quality and sustainability of our agricultural products, albeit there may be flaws in their implementation.  However, our focus here is on the bigger picture and the European Union.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the key points made about rural development.  It is not an accident that the issue of rural development has fallen off the agenda.  It maps very closely the changes made since 2008 and the focus on national fiscal targets as the top-line main message in terms of the European Union's engagement, semester products and regional development targets having falling by the wayside.  The message on balanced regional development is crucial not only economically but also socially in terms of cohesion and co-operation.  We are seeing across Europe that where there is a failure to deliver balanced regional development, it has very severe consequences for the European project.  I would really like to hear the delegates' thoughts not just about the economic but also the social importance of reframing regional development in the European Union.  What are the delegates' thoughts about the way in which high level fiscal targets alone may be failing to capture the issue?<\/p> <p>  The fiscal rules and the national planning framework have been covered.  Macra na Feirme highlighted eloquently young farmers being the lifeblood of rural communities.  Sometimes, the charts we see from the Commission suggest employment moves around.  While there may be the same number of jobs, transplanting people out of their communities is different.  There is a different question about the quality of employment created through schemes such as the European Youth Guarantee.  I worked with a group in Wexford.  There was an urban pilot European Youth Guarantee scheme.  I wonder if the delegates' would support the Wexford group in what it was pushing for, a rural pilot European Youth Guarantee scheme to address specific issues in delivering for young people in rural areas.  There is a different set of challenges and obstacles to creating employment in that context.  I would love to hear the delegates' thoughts on the matter.<\/p> <p>  A key area on which I want to focus is trade.  I commend both groups but the ICMSA, in particular, for diving into the detail of the trade agreements the European Union is negotiating.<\/p><p>We can often be pushed into simplistic narratives such as that we are either for or against trade or Europe.  That does not really work.  We can be very much for Europe and for trade, but want a better kind of European trade deal within that.  I welcome the call from Macra na Feirme for full impact assessment of all the trade deals.  I echo the concern about the danger of the suggestion from Europe under scenario 4, the fast-tracking of trade deals.<\/p><p> Mercosur has been talked about in detail.  There are very specific concerns there.  I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts about Mercosur, CETA, which I have worked on, and what they think the European Commission should be learning from the flaws in the previous model of trade deal.  We are about to give the European Commission a new negotiating mandate for phase 2 of Brexit.  Should it be taking the next trade negotiating mandate off the same peg as CETA and TTIP?  Should we be excluding investor courts, given that they are being challenged in the European Court of Justice at present?  How can we ensure that environmental, equality and employment regulations are really strongly enforced within the next trade negotiating mandate?  We know that a race to the bottom is one which no-one wins.  A race to the bottom in a trading agreement with the UK will devastate Ireland and farming.  I would love to hear the witnesses' thoughts in detail on what the lesson should be from the public opposition to previous trade deals.  Do they think we should delay ratification of CETA until we have a European Court of Justice ruling?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#K00400","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507122000,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I will make a few comments on the easier questions and then bring in our general secretary, Mr. John Enright, to go into the trickier ones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Comer"},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":465,"content":"<p>The witnesses will have no problems - they are veterans at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#L00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507122000,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I do understand the questions about the democratic process in Europe.  It is fundamental that democracy is upheld and that Europe be a paragon of democracy.  I believe it is as close as we can get to it.  There can be tweaks in it but, fundamentally, I believe Europe to be democratic.<\/p> <p>  On the social issues, there is need for a balance.  Speaking as an individual and on behalf of my organisation, I think either more federalism or more centralised governance would be a retrograde step, particularly for the feeling of some sort of benefits from the Union for sure.  There is a symbiotic relationship between the 27 member states that are going to remain, yet each must have a national identity as well.  Getting that balance right is central to the future of Europe.  If we go too far in one way or the other, there will be member states that will not be happy and there will be objections, rumblings and protests.<\/p> <p>  There were specific questions on the CAP from Deputy Cullinane.  I think it is excellent value for money.  When it is explained to people, they also understand the value.  It is only 1% of the GDP of Europe, which returns in spades to the taxpayer.  Let us be upfront and honest here.  I never hear people saying this is taxpayers' money and we need to justify it.  It is never a conversation down at citizen level, yet that is where it needs to be.  Even farm organisations and individuals are afraid to say so.  We need to justify it and say that taxpayers are getting a return on their investment.<\/p> <p>  I wholeheartedly believe that a well-funded CAP will serve the citizens of our continent very well, although that certainly needs to be communicated better.  What I feel has crept into the mood music of the Commission and the Parliament over the last three to four years, and has become more pronounced in the last two, is the sense that they want it both ways.  They want to have all the benefits, including the regulation, traceability, animal welfare, environmental aspects.  Those benefits are all very noble but they come at a cost.  What I am putting on the Official Report today is that we cannot have it both ways.  The primary producers will not be able to be economically sustainable if they have all the regulation without the financial supports.  If the supports do not come from the European Union, the consumer will have to pay a lot more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Comer"},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I am afraid Mr. Comer may have misunderstood my point about CAP, as the question I asked was not answered and his response may have misrepresented what I said.

I am not against that but am asking if the witnesses also looking for CAP to be reformed.  That was my question to both organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#L00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507122000,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I was going through the questions in chronological order as I have them written down and I get a bit passionate about that issue.  Elements of CAP certainly need to be reformed.  It needs to be targeted where we get best value.  The external convergence piece is taking place.  Internal convergence is another matter.  We sit in the middle so it is not as important for us.  We certainly feel that there are elements that can be reformed.  I have no problem getting into a full debate on what type of reform we would like to see, if the Deputy wishes.   We have a full list of what we would like to see prioritised.  It would take some time to exhaust it.  In general, reform is always good, even if one does not reform that much but just has a look to see if the scheme is ticking the boxes and doing what it says on the tin.<\/p> <p>  The problems caused by Brexit are huge.  We have members whose cows will potentially be grazing in the EU in the morning and in a third country in the evening.  From memory, 26% of Northern Irish milk is processed in the Republic.  That is 9% of the total volume of the milk we process here.  It is a wholly integrated processing and production infrastructure and there will be pronounced negative effects unless we get the deal right.  We are certainly open to the paper that was released this morning in terms of having an all-island situation.  We would like to see that fleshed out a bit to see how workable it is.<\/p> <p>  Everybody knows the details of the 60% of the cheddar and 52% for beef and so on and so forth.  We would like to see a trade deal concluded.  First, we have to have a transitional arrangement to get to a free trade agreement, FTA, providing for zero tariffs.

Our position is that the other member states will have to increase their contributions to keep us standing still.  As Mr. Comer said, there are certain elements of the current policy that we believe need to be reformed, particularly in the area of income volatility.  It is a huge issue for farmers which needs to be reformed.  On rural and regional development and the national planning framework, we believe there has to be a counterbalance to Dublin.<\/p><p>This country is getting very skewed to one side and capital investment in rural areas and outside Dublin is essential in the future to address those issues.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked what can be done on Brexit.  We believe there must be measures in the budget next week relating to Brexit.  Brexit is effectively 18 months away.  Our sector, in particular, is very exposed.  Over the next 12 months the sterling exchange rate will go up and down and create challenges for all agricultural sectors, but what scenario will be in place post-Brexit?  We believe next week's budget must include measures on Brexit.  Waiting until budget 2018 will be too late.  There must be something in that regard next week.<\/p><p> Our president mentioned the Border issue.  There are 32,000 milk lorry journeys across the Border annually.  How will that continue in the case of a hard or soft border?  Issues such as that will have to be addressed.<\/p><p> To respond to Senator Higgins, we understand the need for the habitats and birds directive.  The question we are posing on that relates to the policy inconsistencies in Europe.  Europe wants to have a directive but our question is whether farmers have been treated fairly in all cases.  We believe they have not.  There are major gaps and major genuine frustrations for farmers.  Ultimately, we believe it will lead to land abandonment unless the issues are addressed.<\/p><p> With regard to Mercusor, the key issue is that we continually hear people talking about standards and saying they will respect food safety and environmental standards.  They also talk about equivalence.  History has shown us that it does not happen.  We see what has happened with Brazil this year.  There might be a certain level of equivalence on food safety, but there is absolutely none on environmental or employment issues.  That is our experience and I believe we will be found to be correct in the future unless those issues are addressed.  That is the farmers' main objection.  As a European farmer I must meet a huge amount of regulations on food safety, environment and traceability, yet at the same time I am expected to compete with farmers who have no such standards.  It is just not possible.  That is the major objection farmers have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Enright","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507122000,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I will try to address as many questions as possible.  Deputy Cullinane referred to more democracy in Europe and a more social Europe.  From our point of view, we consider Europe fairly democratic.  However, we envisage some reform of the European Parliament, with perhaps more powers for it and the parliamentarians to make for a more efficient decision making process.  We also believe that having two parliaments, one in Brussels and one in Strasbourg, cannot help the efficiency of a European decision making body.<br\/><br\/>With regard to reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, as Mr. John Comer said European member states are currently spending 1% of GDP to the EU budget and, as we said in our opening statement, we would seek to have that input increased, particularly with the UK pulling out and leaving a gap in the budget.  The amount that is suggested is an increase to perhaps 1.1% of GDP.  We would support that, particularly in view of the new European problems that are arising.  On the question of reform of the CAP, we were the first European farming organisation to have a policy document before the Commission, which was early this year.  It was a roadmap for generational renewal and it ties together the rural development side with the agriculture side.  We view young people as key to the future of both farming and rural development.  Rural communities cannot survive without farmers to keep them alive.  As has been said, many of the manufacturing and service jobs in this country are moving further east and drawing more young people out of our rural communities.  Unless there is investment in those communities we will not be able to keep young people in them.  However, to justify that investment there must be farmers in the community who are providing employment.  A recent Teagasc report stated that we will need 6,000 young people for the dairy industry alone in the next couple of years.  There are some employment opportunities there, but investment must be made in those rural areas to allow people to stay there.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the environment, the Senator referred to the pollination plan.  We made a submission to that and we were glad to see the report that emerged.  However, we believe that element of the Common Agricultural Policy could be reformed as well.  There should be practical, targeted and measurable schemes whereby farmers should be compensated to the value of the public good they are providing.  The schemes in place at present are not the best vehicle for achieving the type of results that are required.  When we speak to young farmers they tell us they believe they are environmentalists.  They are guardians of the countryside, they want to take ownership of the problems and issues and to lead the drive towards improvement on them.<br\/><br\/>As regards regional development and the national planning framework, we made a submission earlier this year to the Ireland 2040 plan.  A draft of the plan only emerged in September and with the National Ploughing Championships and everything else we have not had a chance to go through it.  We will make further comment when we have had that chance.  However, we attended a rural development plan monitoring committee meeting recently.  Indecon produced a report, an <i>ex ante<\/i>assessment of financial market failures, which showed that there was a capital expenditure gap of &euro;105 million last year and that if Ireland is to continue towards its Food Wise 2025 targets that would stretch to up to &euro;350 million.  Financial measures must be introduced to allow young farmers to make the investments that must be made both to expand their business and do so in an environmentally sustainable way.<br\/><br\/>On Brexit, various sectors in different areas of the country are experiencing different levels of impact.  The currency fluctuation is clearly having a huge impact.  Whether it is the mushroom sector or any other sector, people are struggling massively even though Brexit has not happened yet.  We appeared before the Seanad committee on Brexit earlier this year and put forward our six solutions.  We believe it is vital that the investment is made now to protect people because volatility will be a huge factor.  It is part of our budget submission that the income volatility must be addressed, not only at European level but also at national level.  Europe cannot fix everything for us.  Investment opportunities, be it more access to low-cost loans or similar financial instruments, would be a positive way of sheltering not just young farmers but all small and medium sized employers.  They are equally open to that type of impact.<br\/><br\/>I have probably jumped around in answering some of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1507122000,"counter":472,"content":"<p>There was a question on trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017100400002#M00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507122000,"counter":473,"content":"<p>From time to time manufacturing and services jobs appear to be put to the fore and prioritised over agriculture.

People were disappointed that they could not be here.<\/p><p> We very seldom have people from the agriculture sector at this committee.  I appreciate the fact that the witnesses are here today because it is important to hear what they have to say.  It is my opinion that small family farms are in great danger.  The farming organisations and local and national politicians working together have an important job to do to ensure that in five, ten, 20 or 30 years' time small farmers will be able to exist.  We are all practical and sensible and know that they will not be full-time farmers.  We would dearly like it if they could be, if they wanted to be but unfortunately it will be a part-time occupation as it is already.  People are managing and we want to see the family farm intact and something of worth to be passed on to the next generation.  I have come across families who are making the decision about the next generation.  Whereas in the past Johnny or Mary would have the hand up hoping it would come to them, now, and it is an awful thing to say, those young people look on being given a farm as a drawback.  That is very serious.  I want to ensure that will not be the case in the years ahead and that people will be proud and glad and very happy to continue working the land, even on a part-time basis.<\/p><p> The figures in the agricultural colleges are back up.  It is like a yo-yo.  They were going up and down but they are steady enough at the moment.  I have regular contact with them and know what is going on there.  The people who are doing the green certificate, whether online or full-time in the college are getting on well and know the importance of it.  I compliment the people running those programmes because they give our young people a good sound ordinary grounding and they enjoy it.<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses for their work.  There is now a Macra club in Killarney which was never there before.  It is nice to see it in an urban area.  I was delighted to be present at the launch because I know the parents of the people involved.  It is great to see them enjoying a new Macra club.  I was a member of Macra in my earlier days.  We used to enjoy the outings, there was great camaraderie.  I would like to see organisations like that being there forever so that our young lads and the next generation will have the fundamental values we all have. <\/p><p> My views on environmental issues are well-known.  I am not going to get into arguments about them.  To put in the politest possible way, common sense has to prevail when it comes to environmental issues.  The best custodian of the land ever is the person who owns it.  That person will never want to do anything to their farm that would downgrade or damage it in any shape or fashion.  They will only want to pass it on in better shape, with whatever resources they have.<\/p><p> All the witnesses who spoke were sound in their views and spoke from the heart.  I appreciate that.

However, there is now greater public awareness about the existence of abuse of older persons and people with disabilities within society.  Indeed there is now a strong expectation on legislators, policymakers and service providers to take adequate measures to combat abuse.  The impact of well-publicised reports and regulatory inspection findings into failings to protect the welfare and safety of service users in recent years has led to significant changes in policy and practice as well as models of service provision within the health and social services sector to address this most significant issue.<\/p><p> For the HSE's part, an elder abuse policy and social work led support service has been in place since 2007.  Following consultation in recognition of the need to widen and improve this policy, the HSE on establishing the social care division in mid-2013, launched its policy, Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse: National Policy and Procedures, in December 2014.  The policy declares that all service providers to disabled and older persons must have a publicly declared no-tolerance approach to any form of abuse.  All service provision must promote a culture which supports this ethos.<\/p><p> Since the launch of the HSE's safeguarding policy, a number of supporting structures have also been put in place, including the establishment of the National Safeguarding Office, which provides leadership, oversight and co-ordination for all aspects of the policy and practice in safeguarding vulnerable adults.  In implementing the policy, the HSE has set up nine safeguarding and protection teams, one in each community health organisation, CHO, to co-ordinate consistent responses to concerns of abuse and neglect.  These teams are managed and led by principal social workers and staffed by social work team leaders and professionally qualified social workers.  They provide oversight and support to all service providers, including those funded by the HSE.  Each CHO has also established a safeguarding and protection committee, chaired by the heads of social care, which supports the development of a culture that promotes the welfare of vulnerable adults and provides support and advice to the safeguarding teams and senior management.  In 2016 alone, almost 8,000 notifications of safeguarding concerns were submitted to the safeguarding teams.<\/p><p> The HSE has invested in additional staffing and support resources to strengthen the capacity base of these teams for oversight and management of safeguarding concerns.  Over the past three years approximately &euro;2.3 million has been invested in the recruitment of an additional 34 social worker positions and ten administrative support workers into the safeguarding and protection teams.  Almost 60 staff members are involved in the safeguarding teams throughout the country.  However, the implementation of the policy also saw the appointment of more than 900 designated officers in service settings relating to disability and older persons, who in their own right as senior managers are the key people to receive concerns or referrals of abuse, carry out preliminary screenings and develop safeguarding plans where appropriate.  The nine safeguarding teams support the designated officers in their day-to-day work to ensure a consistent approach to the implementation of the policy across these settings.<\/p><p> A strategic training programme continues to be rolled out and the HSE has achieved a critical mass of more than 30,000 staff in the HSE and funded agencies who have been trained to date.  The HSE's implementation plan for the adult safeguarding policy is part of a wider programme of reform and quality improvement measures across the social care sector.  Significant change management programmes are being implemented in areas such as decongregation within residential care and new directions for day service users which have clear implications for advancing the safeguarding agenda.  These developments have been clearly underpinned by person-centred principles and a clear message of no tolerance of abuse.<\/p><p> At national level, the HSE established the national safeguarding committee, which is a multi-agency and intersectoral body.  This committee, which works collaboratively with a wide range of stakeholders, recognises that safeguarding vulnerable adults from abuse is a matter that cannot be addressed by any one agency working in isolation and cannot be solely seen as a health or social services responsibility.  Representatives from the national safeguarding committee are also present today to address this committee which is most welcome.<\/p><p> As envisaged at its commencement, the HSE is undertaking a review of the safeguarding policy.  This review has already highlighted many improvements since the introduction of the safeguarding policy, especially in areas such as awareness training, improved systems for recognising and reporting abuse, and challenging inappropriate attitudes and behaviours.  The review has also highlighted areas that need improvement and areas of practice that need strengthening.  While the improvements I have outlined will continue, there remains a significant underlying challenge for the HSE and other bodies in responding effectively to safeguarding issues due to the gap in legislation.  There is a clear deficiency in the lack of a legislative framework for assessment, planning and co-ordination in responding to safeguarding concerns and managing interventions.<\/p><p> The HSE cannot undertake and co-ordinate adult safeguarding and protection in isolation.  In this regard, the HSE recognises that the current safeguarding policy has clear constraints in its capacity and scope.  The policy is limited as it is a health service led policy, and while co-ordination has been improved with the establishment of the interagency national safeguarding committee and through the development of interagency protocols, legislation is needed on an interagency and societal level to effect the necessary changes.  An important task for the drafting of any such legislation will be to develop a clear and easy to understand definition of who needs protection across all services and whether the vulnerable person concept should be replaced by a definition of an adult at risk.<\/p><p> Any such legislation providing powers of intervention in the lives of vulnerable adults should give due regard to the person's capacity to keep themselves safe and to the appropriate application of consent.  The framing of the legislation needs to be careful to balance human rights principles in areas such as autonomy with the need for protective measures.  Any law should be proportionate in its application and scope and needs to include essential safeguards on a person's right to express his or her will and preference on how he or she lives his or her life.  A key consideration for future legislation will be the appropriate obligation on relevant organisations to report suspected abuse or harm to the appropriate authority.  International research has indicated differing impact and outcomes with regard to permissive or mandatory reporting.  Further analysis and research will be needed to consider the appropriate legal framework for such requirements.<\/p><p> International research and evidence has consistently highlighted the importance of a process and structure for mandated interagency collaboration and co-ordination on adult safeguarding.  This will be of particular benefit with regard to information sharing for assessment and protection planning which will need to be incorporated into future legislation.  This is of particular relevance for all services involved with adult protection but especially core State authorities such as the health services and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it should also strengthen arrangements with Tusla regarding children progressing from State care into adult services and where vulnerability exists.  This mandated interagency collaboration should also include the requirement to put safeguarding committees on a legislative framework to mandate co-ordination and collaboration among services with key safeguarding roles as well as ensuring appropriate reviews are undertaken following critical incidents.  Legislation in this area will also need to strengthen vulnerable adults' right of access to independent advocacy which is most relevant when they are subject to a safeguarding report or assessment.<\/p><p> As a health service provider and commissioner of services we recognise that there is still a long journey of improvement and reform to travel and we acknowledge our shared responsibility to advance the safeguarding agenda.  While much progress on adult safeguarding in the State has been made over recent years, we clearly need a statutory framework for adult safeguarding to address the issues and deficits I have highlighted.<\/p><p> This concludes my opening statement and, together with my colleagues, we will endeavour to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":484,"content":"<p>On behalf of the national safeguarding committee, I thank members for the opportunity to address the committee this morning on the important topic of adult safeguarding legislation.<\/p> <p>  The national safeguarding committee, which was established in December 2015, is a multi-agency forum aimed at promoting awareness of abuse, harm and exploitation of adults who may be vulnerable.  The committee brings together key players in public services, legal and financial services, the health and social care professions, regulatory authorities, and NGOs representing older people, people with disabilities and carers.<\/p> <p>  Regarding adult abuse, the list of potential abusers is wide.  Abuse may be perpetrated by a person known to the victim and may also be perpetrated by those who have no previous connection to the victim and may also be perpetrated by the State.<\/p> <p>  A recent RED C poll conducted for the national safeguarding committee highlighted that half of all Irish adults say they have experienced the abuse of vulnerable adults either through being abused themselves or seeing somebody close to them abused.  Two in five people think vulnerable adults are badly treated and one in three believes vulnerable adult abuse to be widespread.  The research findings indicate a very worrying prevalence of vulnerable adult abuse, uncertainty over what constitutes psychological and financial abuse, and a lack of knowledge of what to do when one becomes aware of the abuse of vulnerable adults.<\/p> <p>  While abuse of older people forms only one category of individuals at risk of harm, the National Centre for the Protection of older People at UCD has carried out a number of studies examining the nature and extent of older persons' abuse in Ireland.<\/p><p>Based on international prevalence of abuse figures at 5% and<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">taking the current figure of more than 637,000 people over the age of 65 suggests that 32,000 people over the age of 65 years have experienced mistreatment in the previous 12 months.  The report by the national centre also showed that financial abuse was the most common type of abuse reported in terms of older persons.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> As Mr. Healy noted, almost 7,900 safeguarding concerns were reported to the HSE's safeguarding and protection teams in 2016 with a high level of concerns coming from the disability sector.  It is clear from other research that this is likely to be the tip of the iceberg as many safeguarding incidents go unreported.  It is also clear from the Red C poll that there is a lack of clarity regarding the point of contact for reporting.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> As has been seen a number of times recently, once a person who may be in a very vulnerable situation reaches the age of 18 years, there no clear obligation on the State, State agencies or organisations to prevent harm and protect such adults who may be vulnerable.  Article 16.1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities commits to the following:<\/font><\/p><blockquote><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social, educational and other measures to protect persons with disabilities, both within and outside the home, from all forms of exploitation, violence and abuse.<\/font><\/blockquote><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Ireland, on ratifying the convention, will be required to fulfil this requirement.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> The prevalence of adult abuse and exploitation highlights the urgent requirement for adult safeguarding to be placed on a statutory footing in Ireland.  The HSE&rsquo;s vulnerable persons at risk of abuse policy is limited in its scope and has no statutory force to ensure the safety and rights of vulnerable persons.  <\/font>The aim of adult safeguarding legislation should be to legislate for State agencies to take responsibility to prevent harm and protect from abuse adults who may be vulnerable.  Such legislation should clearly set out the State's responsibilities for the prevention of harm and protection from abuse.  Primary responsibility for such legislation would lie with the Department of Health due to the need to focus on the role of statutory health and social services.  In recognising that safeguarding is everybody's responsibility, the legislation should be developed on a cross-governmental, inter-agency and societal basis.<br\/><br\/>The legislation should recognise that people who may be vulnerable frequently come into contact with State and other services and agencies.  Specific responsibilities within the legislation would fall under the supervision of the Departments of Justice and Equality and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The latter Department, recognising its responsibility, recently established a working group on agent arrangements and the protection of vulnerable adults to examine and make recommendations on the adequacy of current procedures and processes, within the Department, with a particular emphasis on financial abuse.  In addition, in recognition of civil society's responsibilities and recognising that the largest prevalence of abuse is in the community, elements of the legislation should outline what safeguarding arrangements and responsibilities fall to the voluntary, community, independent, financial and faith-based organisations, as well as on individual families.<br\/><br\/>The legislation should be developed in line with the rights provided under the Constitution, the UN convention, and the European <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Convention on <\/font>Human Rights.  Adult safeguarding legislation should promote zero tolerance for adult abuse across Irish society and beyond.  There are currently huge gaps in our approach to adult safeguarding.  Adult safeguarding legislation must be constructed in a way that respects individual rights with an emphasis on prevention, as well as protection.  Such legislation could place a general statutory duty of care to promote an individual's well-being and to protect him or her from abuse and neglect.  There must be a statutory requirement to identify need, risk, the route to services to meet those needs, the mechanism for intervening and the mechanism for review and not simply to wait until an urgent safeguarding issue arises.  The legislation should also provide that vulnerable adults have access to independent advocacy.<br\/><br\/>The legislation should ensure enhanced awareness of adult harm and abuse and the responsibility on people and society to report suspected cases of abuse to the relevant authorities.  Article 16.5 of the UN convention requires that effective legislation and policies are put in place &quot;to ensure that instances of exploitation, violence and abuse are identified, investigated and, where appropriate, prosecuted&quot;.  Many public and private service providers within the community are well placed to identify early indications that an adult may be at risk, for example, in his or her interactions with banks, legal and property services.  Providers of services who are in a position of trust, in particular general practitioners and providers of primary care services, will have access to information on adults that may suggest they are at risk of harm. <br\/><br\/>Service providers should be aware of the signs of harm to adults within their respective sectors.  They should have a legal duty to ensure organisational procedures are in place to guide staff when concerns are identified.  All those working to provide services in the community generally should also have a legal responsibility to refer concerns to social care services and to co-operate and share information, where necessary, with any adult safeguarding investigations.  Indeed, a positive statutory obligation for the sharing of information on an inter-sectoral and inter-agency basis should be part of adult safeguarding legislation.<br\/><br\/>Recognising that there is a duty on service providers to ensure organisational procedures are in place, Article 16.3 of the UN convention provides that facilities and programmes should be &quot;effectively monitored by independent authorities.&quot;  The continuum of adult safeguarding outlines the wide range of organisations involved in people's lives, from small community activity groups through to larger organisations and statutory services.  All organisations should be required in law to ensure that any service they deliver is underpinned by the principles of respect and treating each person with dignity.  This is the first and crucial step to ensuring that services are of high quality and that the focus is on the individual receiving the service. <br\/><br\/>Increasing levels of care and support needs and risk among vulnerable people in our society are likely to lead to greater demands for service provision.  This in turn requires a heightened awareness of the risk of harm when providing such services and more robust measures to prevent such harm.  Time is not on our side and we need to act urgently to introduce adult safeguarding legislation.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for inviting me here this morning.  I have provided a brief overview of why adult safeguarding legislation is needed.  My colleague and I are happy to answer any questions that may arise.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Rickard-Clarke for her presentation and call on Mr. Mervyn Taylor, Sage, to make an opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#E00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":487,"content":"<p>In 2016, the then Oireachtas Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, which was chaired by the then-Deputy, Senator Jerry Buttimer, produced a report on the role of advocacy in health and social care services in Ireland.  This was the first time that an Oireachtas committee had ever directly engaged with the issue of advocacy.  The report indicated that advocates can play an important role in helping to support and empower vulnerable people who use our health and social services.  It also referred to the need for co-ordination.<br\/><br\/>The right to have one's voice heard and participate in the making of decisions that affects oneself is a fundamental principle in a democratic society.  It is the simple principle of &quot;Nothing about you - without you&quot;.  In circumstances where people may be vulnerable, or have to depend on others, there is a need to ensure that their rights, freedoms and dignity are promoted and protected.  Through support and advocacy the will and preference of a person can be heard and acted on independently of family, service provider or systems interests.<br\/><br\/>The concept of advocacy as a formal practice is relatively new, although advocacy has always happened in many forms.  During the 20th century out of a diverse range of movements concerned with human rights, workers' rights, women's rights, welfare rights, racial equality, health, disability and the environment, there has emerged concepts, practices and services that can be broadly described as advocacy.  Advocacy may be instructed or non-instructed.  Non-instructed advocacy is where an advocate acts independently of the individual, in some cases through necessity, as the individual may lack the capacity to advocate for himself or herself.<br\/><br\/>With regard to instructed advocacy, it is worth noting that the idea that one adult person can give authority to another adult person to act on his or her behalf as an advocate is still deeply challenging to some people in Irish society, not least in the health, social care and legal professions.  Sage has developed quality standards for its work.  In the introduction to those standards Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, until recently a member of the Supreme Court, stated the following:<\/p><blockquote>Too often we see the issues facing older people as related solely to health and social care.  In doing so we can sometimes forget the fundamental importance of values, standards and the law in determining the well-being of citizens.<\/blockquote> <p>There are some significant challenges to the development of independent advocacy services.<\/p><p>At the core of these challenges is the absence of a legal framework for independent advocacy.  For example, it is clear that, despite the references in the HIQA quality standards for nursing homes regarding access to independent advocates, the experience of Sage is that some nursing homes continue to display a total disregard for the right of their residents to see an advocate of their choice.  We are currently preparing a submission to the Ombudsman in respect of this issue.<\/p><p> There is a clear need for the State to respond directly to the advocacy needs of citizens, rather than simply delegating responsibility to NGOs.  Legislative recognition of an independent body, such as a national council for support and advocacy is necessary in order to address the issues of coherency, transparency and equal distribution of resources that can arise when funding is provided to voluntary advocacy groups without reference to any development framework.<\/p><p> Sage argues not just for multidisciplinary approaches among professionals but also for multi-perspective approaches whereby the voices of vulnerable people are entitled to be heard and their will and preference respected when health and social care professionals and others gather to review and plan in respect of an individual.  <\/p><p> The lack of inter-agency collaboration can sometimes lead to potentially serious situations being addressed in differing ways by various players each with a different remit and with differing perspectives, approaches, pieces of information and knowledge of the extent of each others' involvement.  If a HSE safeguarding team, a HIQA inspector, a Garda detective and Sage all have engagement with a particular place of concern and all are acting independently then, in the absence of some framework of collaboration, there is the potential to fail vulnerable people.<\/p><p> The mission of Sage is &ldquo;to promote and protect the rights, freedom and dignity of vulnerable adults and older people through the development of support and advocacy services to address individual and systemic issues&rdquo;.  As a consequence of this mission, Sage has a strong safeguarding dimension to its work and it has been engaged in approximately 200 cases to date in which there is a safeguarding element.  There is a clear interplay between independent advocacy and safeguarding and for this reason we make several recommendations.  The first recommendation is the immediate extension of the powers of HSE safeguarding protection teams in order that they can operate to the fullest degree possible within private care settings.  The second is the recognition of the role and practice of independent advocacy.  The third is the recognition of the right of vulnerable or potentially vulnerable adults to access and be represented by an independent advocate in all care settings, including domestic homes, as well as of the necessity for their voice to be heard in multidisciplinary and inter-sectoral working arrangements that relate to them.  The fourth is the inclusion of advocacy services in any mandatory system of inter-agency collaboration, review and planning.  The fifth is the establishment of a national council for support and advocacy to co-ordinate and strengthen the systems and practices of all providers of support and advocacy services to vulnerable persons and ensure equity in resource provision.  The sixth recommendation is the development of a national safeguarding service independent of all other service providers and statutory agencies, the provision of resources to it to the level required to meet minimum nationally applicable standards and to undertake historic investigations of alleged abuse.  The seventh is the enactment of safeguarding adults legislation, which would address all of the above issues.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it and my colleague, Ms Eileen O&rsquo;Callaghan, the designated officer for safeguarding in Sage, and I will endeavour to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mervyn Taylor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Taylor.

I will ask questions in the order the witnesses spoke and will begin with Mr. Healy.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Healy's statement referred to 60 persons employed.  Are they employed on a full-time basis and is this their whole job?  If not, can Mr. Healy express it in terms of a whole-time equivalent, WTE?  It strikes me that it is very good news if this is their whole job but if it is not, I would be interested in knowing the extent to which they concentrate on that area, especially in light of the figures before us which indicate that there are potentially 32,000 older persons experiencing some form of mistreatment.  Staffing levels might seem adequate but when one stacks it up against that large number, one would wonder.    Sage recommends that the HSE teams would operate to the fullest extent possible within the private home care sector, which indicates that it is not operating to the fullest extent possible now.  Does Mr. Healy have a view on why this is the case and should the HSE teams operate to the fullest extent possible?  Would this require additional staffing?  Are there barriers to that work being carried out?<\/p> <p>  Ms Rickard-Clarke stated there is a breakdown of the abuse and mistreatment which takes place in the home versus that occurring in residential care settings.  Can she indicate if there is a difference in the severity between the home care and the residential care settings?  Can she elaborate on this?  <\/p> <p>  The Sage submission referred to a total disregard for the right of residents to have advocates.  That worries me, as someone who was an advocate in my previous life.  When a person is vulnerable in that way, his or her need for an advocate and to have someone in his or her corner becomes very acute.  Can the witnesses advise us on what line or direction could be taken to improve that level of advocacy and empowerment for older persons?  Is it something that would come from giving HIQA more powers in the area, possibly in regulation?  Having read the submissions and heard them this morning, I wonder if there is something I have missed in terms of how we could improve that because I found that figure on the extent to which the right to have an advocate had been completely disregarded to be shocking.  <\/p> <p>  My question for Sage might be a little cheeky but does it feel the private nursing home sector will welcome with open arms the beefed-up role of the protection teams within their sectors?  Is it an area where Sage anticipates resistance?  If so, do the witnesses have any views in how this might be overcome.  One could make a big political speech about how Government is not investing in the public service, but more and more people find themselves in the private home care sector.  Since it is becoming more of a reality for people, it becomes even more important that we have an understanding of the views within that sector.  I appreciate there are no representatives of that sector present but will Sage give its view? <\/p> <p>  My final question is a general one for all the witnesses.  According to newspaper reports, there will be mandatory reporting of child abuse, which is to be welcomed.  Would there be any benefit if this was extended to the area of elder abuse and the abuse of vulnerable persons?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#F00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming before us and giving a very enlightened appraisal of the situation.<\/p> <p>  Two things occurred to me.  One was the scale of notifications, which Mr. Healy referred to in his opening statement.  In 2016, 8,000 notifications of safeguarding concerns were submitted to the safeguarding teams.  To what extent were they investigated adequately and satisfactorily?  Was action was taken as a result in every situation?<\/p><p>Is the HSE satisfied that adequate provision can be made to detect abuses on time  without necessarily waiting to be told or waiting to receive a report from some quarter?  Of the 8,000 notifications of safeguarding concern, I am sure there were other cases that were not notified and need to be detected.  To what extent can unannounced inspections be carried out?  Are unannounced inspections conducted in all institutions, be it for children, vulnerable adults or others?  To what extent is the HSE aware that abuse can be generated by colleagues in the institutions, fellow patients, by staff and by outsiders?  Is the HSE representative satisfied that sufficient provisions to identify all such abuses is in place?  In particular, we get reports from institutions dealing with older people of cases of bullying but which is abuse; it is mental and sometimes physical abuse from colleagues in the system.  It is one of the things that happen.  <\/p><p> In respect to Mr. Taylor's submission, has thought been given to the appointment of advocacy officers in the institutions, similar to the officers dealing with requests under freedom of information?  Why not have an officer in each institution who has statutory responsibility to ensure that such issues are reported instantly?  In other words, a member of the staff would be ear-wigging - for want of a better description - and identifying situations where there might be potential for abuse or cause for concern.<\/p><p> Ms Rickard-Clarke referred to the need for legislation on adult safeguarding.  How far can we go in providing the legislation without creating the nanny state and a situation that becomes so administratively involved at every possible level that the system becomes unworkable and does not work at all?  Could an individual officer from the staff of all institutions, nursing homes and so on, be given responsibility to identify the potential for abuse, possible abuse, financial abuse and mistreatment of older people?  I know the financial institutions have responsibilities but to what extent do they observe their responsibilities?  Can we be absolutely certain that they are rigorous in the application of the rules, in so far as the rights of the individual customer, who holds the bank account is concerned?  Do they rigorously pursue that to ensure their customer is not the victim of abuse?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#F00400","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Murphy O'Mahony.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#G00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for giving up their time to be present.

As the 60 staff are full-time whole-time equivalents, they are full-time permanent staff.  One of the important parts of what we were trying to do was to get a dedicated team.  We have built on the elder abuse teams and now we have these.  In 2016, there were about 8,000 notifications of safeguarding concern, which is approximately 300 cases for each team and somewhat more than six cases a week.  Clearly, when one looks at the totality, there are large numbers.  We are progressively developing the service but as one would go on, one would want to expand the teams as one continues to develop.<\/p> <p>  The position is that all people at risk of abuse, be it older people or others are covered by the current policy.  The issue that is specific to private nursing homes is that there is a constraint on our entitlement to access nursing homes.  We neither have a right to access the nursing home in this regard nor we do not have a right of access to records.  It is important to state, however, that the majority of private nursing homes have worked very positively with us.  In many cases, the safeguarding policy has been adopted by private nursing homes as the policy they operate.  That is very positive.  The fact that the policy is regulated by HIQA is important because HIQA is inspecting independently and is the regulator that carries out the type of unannounced inspections to which Deputy Durkan referred.  There also is access to the Ombudsman for complaints.<\/p> <p>  Legislation is important to underpin this whole area because there are constraints on what the HSE can and cannot do.

A number of designated officers carry out screenings and the Health Service Executive has an oversight of the adequacy of that screening in respect of any concern that has been raised.  The other element is that direct reports come in to us from the community, from family members, from older people themselves or persons with a disability.  They are the community-based referrals.<\/p><p>My colleague mentioned that of the 8,000 referrals last year, 3,000 were community-based referrals with the remainder from residential and service settings.  <\/p><p> The safeguarding teams have responsibility for the community or direct referrals, to carry out a direct screening and to consider if there should be a protection plan and if there are reasonable grounds for concern.  The social work teams follow good practice by considering what is in the report, the detail of it, the view of the person him or herself and any other information that needs to be gathered.  There is a supervision system via their team leaders and there is overall management by the professional social workers.  <\/p><p> There is a need to consider greater resourcing as the service develops.  In the last year alone we saw a 60% increase in direct community-based referrals from January through to December.  We believe that might be linked to greater awareness and the training programme we have been running.  The service is able to respond.  We do need to look critically into the future.  Legislation and the widening of the scope and operational remit of safeguarding will give more responsibility to those social work teams.  We must be very mindful of matching the resource.  We also need to be mindful of where the resource is placed.  Other people have mentioned the need for prevention and raising awareness.  It is not just responding to abuse or concerns of abuse but also making sure that structures are in place, that our staff are trained in order that early intervention is possible and that systems are in place to catch these before problems develop.  <\/p><p> Our teams are busy in terms of the number of reports.  They apply their good social work practice.  We expect reports to increase and we have seen an increasing number of reports already.  The teams became operational in 2015.  An elder abuse service has been in place since 2007, which was well established and has been incorporated into our safeguarding teams who now have overall responsibility for both disability and older persons.  We foresee a greater demand and a greater need going into the future and that would be reflective of any expansion of the scope of the policy and any legislative impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Hanly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":501,"content":"<p>Of the 8,000 reported, were they speedily investigated and comprehensively reported upon afterwards to the satisfaction of those who made the report in the first instance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#H00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":502,"content":"<p>The safeguarding of vulnerable persons policy has in-built timeframes, which mandate how quickly a preliminary screening is submitted to the HSE.

Where there have been difficulties with our time responses, we have put in place performance indicators.  Professional staff apply judgement with regard to prioritisation, urgency and high-risk cases.  More serious cases are considered more quickly.  Where there is no professional team to assess someone, there may be vulnerable people in the community with limited access to support structures, and they may be prioritised.  There are targets in our report.  The service is meeting those targets for the most part.  There certainly are areas in which we would like to see improvement as well.  The critical point is that we ensure that people at the greatest risk are prioritised for attention.  Timeframes for notification and follow-up were clearly put into the policy.  Once reasonable grounds are established, that is, once the safeguarding team in respect of community-based referrals or the designated officer in respect of the residential service setting has come to a conclusion that there are reasonable grounds - by which we mean the service user or person in the community faces an ongoing risk - there is a clear timeframe to put in place a protection plan.  There is work to do and it has come out in our review that we could strengthen practice and procedure.  We need to look at balancing timeframes with risk assessment.

The 2016 HSE figures are the first time that we have had figures from the disability sector and we do not have comprehensive data.  Generally, the work the National Centre for the Protection of Older People has done over a number of years indicates a very high level of abuse in the home, that is, the family or community setting.  That was for older people.  The emphasis there was on a high level of financial abuse.  Coming back to the legislation, we require legislation for the right to access a home where there is a high or reasonable suspicion of a person being abused, as well as access to information, data, bank accounts and so on.  We have no legislation to deal with that.  There is no right of access for the HSE protection teams to go into nursing homes or a person's home in those situations.<\/p> <p>  In terms of residential care, looking at the HSE figures - again we do not have really comprehensive data - there are instances of a lot of physical abuse where people with intellectual disabilities are living together.  That is a question of putting systems, processes, education and training in place.  <\/p> <p>  The right to have an advocate was mentioned.  I will leave it to Sage to answer this in detail but again, there are very confrontational situations in which families do not like somebody advocating on behalf of the individual.  We absolutely need legislation.   One of the huge issues for older people is the right to decide where they wish to reside.  As deprivation of liberty legislation will be introduced shortly, it is fundamental that we have the right of advocacy.  There should be triggers in certain circumstances where an advocate should be appointed.  <\/p> <p>  HIQA and its powers were mentioned.  Its role is to look at systems, organisations and governance but it has no role with regard to individuals and that is a huge deficit in respect of adult safeguarding.  As for people with disabilities, when they turn 18 there is no screening of their needs.  Someone with intellectual disabilities could live in a situation for many years without an assessment of need.  Their changes between the ages of 20 and 40 may never be screened or reviewed.  There is no obligation on State agencies or authorities to ascertain if they are in vulnerable situations. <\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan spoke about institutions having people in place.  We do not have proper systems in place to prevent all of the abuse that happens.  If we had proper systems in place we would avoid much of that but we do require the legislation.  He also asked about the magnitude of the problem and how far we can go without creating a nanny state.  We have total informality at present.  There are no systems in place either in State organisations or any other organisations.  In other words, what are the standards?  We have no regulation of home care.  That is a huge gap.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that in 2011.  We still do not have it.  We need a legislative framework to deal with many of these issues.  <\/p> <p>  Financial abuse in financial institutions was mentioned.  Again we have had no exchange of information.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is paying out &euro;7.2 billion in State pensions.<\/p><p>If we take a level of expected abuse of even 10%, it is a large amount of money.<\/p><p> A total of 52% of payments are paid into a bank account where somebody may have the pass card, PIN or whatever.  Where money is going into a joint account the banks have no information that the person may lack capacity or cannot operate his or her own bank account.  This is why we are talking about inter-agency information and exchange of information.  Financial institutions are working quite independently of everything else because we do not have legislation to enable them to make inquiries.  How do they raise the red flag or know when the red flag is to be raised?  Something the national safeguarding committee has done is try to bring people around the table, and we are working with financial institutions to try to achieve this, but we need the legislation for it.<\/p><p> I will now deal with Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's question on elderly people being least likely to report abuse.  The national safeguarding committee had a public awareness campaign earlier this year.  We will have another session next week or the week after to try to inform people of what actually is abuse.  One of the issues that came out of the Red C poll is that people do not recognise that pilfering the pension or taking the person's money is actually abuse and theft.  Sitting around the table, it is difficult to get the State organisations to understand that theft is a crime and it should be reported.  We have this informality, and we really need systems in place.<\/p><p> I mentioned the figure paid by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Another &euro;3 billion is paid in occupational pensions from the State with regard to public services.  There are huge gaps in their systems as to how they know where a person is in a vulnerable position or has a lack of capacity.  The question was asked about putting in people so we do not have the abuse.  We have to do a huge amount to put systems and processes in place to prevent it happening in the first place, and not to throw money at inquiries after it happens and the horse has bolted.  We have a huge gap because of very many years of doing nothing with heads in the sand ignoring what we need to face into.  We badly need a legislative framework to look at all of these areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":505,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy O'Reilly's question on the rights of residents to an independent advocate, the Deputy was in an advocacy role as a trade union official but she was not an independent advocate for the individuals who were recipients of the services of her members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mervyn Taylor"},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":506,"content":"<p>That is true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#J00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":507,"content":"<p>There are gradations.  One of the issues, particularly in private nursing homes, is that some of them claim they have their own advocate.  In other words, they tell us we will have a person that they will appoint to represent our interests, and if our interests are against their interests then their interests will win out.  This is a piece of nonsense.  We also have the argument being used that because there is no formal recognition of independent advocacy they do not have to let us across the door.  I am not an lawyer, but my understanding is judges quite regularly in court refer to the fact that people should go to mediation and not be in front of the court.  To the best of my knowledge, mediation is almost there but not yet, but judges have been talking about this for years.<\/p> <p>  The big issue is family pressures, and this can be particularly because families are divided and they do not want another person coming in.  We can understand this to a certain extent, but they are still ignoring the right of the person to his or her own voice.  Sometimes it is because the family is actually actively exploiting that person.  There might have been a daughter or son living in that person's home when that person was shoehorned into the nursing home and in fact that son or daughter is getting a place free of rent that would otherwise be &euro;1,800 month.  That family then puts pressure on the owners of a nursing home, and we know of some situations like this, who then say they will lose income if they annoy this family, so there is a real problem there.  Sometimes it is also just stubbornness, and it will take some time to break this down.  HIQA is starting to ask during its inspections whether there is an independent advocate, whether there is access to one and whether the nursing home can show proof of this.  There are still some people, and I can put it bluntly, whose attitude is they own the building therefore they own the residents.  I am putting it baldly, but this is what it boils down to.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the question on whether private nursing homes welcome us, the fact of the matter is there is another side to this.  A total of 46% of our complex cases last year involved nursing homes, many of which were private nursing homes.  We have a principle that we collaborate first and then we challenge, but many private nursing homes are coming to Sage because they are not getting the supports they need for some of these very challenging situations from their industry organisations.  We are effectively a sounding board for them.  It is a tale of two cities.  There are those who will bar us and there are those who will actively be on the phone to us asking us for God's sake to help in a particular situation, which we do willingly.  I am just saying there are two different types of nursing homes.<\/p> <p>  I must say that although we experienced a few rather frosty handshakes in the early stages of our establishment a few years ago in 2014, our right to be in a HSE facility has never ever been challenged, because an ethos is developing and a network of understanding is developing in the public sector.  It is different in the private sector.  Many of the providers are quite isolated and they are not part of any grouping, or where they are part of a grouping the corporate policy is to be suspicious of us and not to let us in.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Durkan's question on advocacy officers in each institution, I do not think it relates to my previous answer as we cannot have an institution providing its own advocacy officer.  We can have an advocacy person who champions and pushes the idea, and in each of these facilities there is a designated person, and, if I may, I will ask my colleague Ms O'Callaghan to briefly speak about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mervyn Taylor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":508,"content":"<p>The huge issue with the policy at present is that it applies to HSE and HSE-funded services so private nursing homes are left out of it, as is the community.  HSE and HSE-funded services have a designated officer who is usually trained, and Mr. Healy mentioned the 30,000 who have been trained.  They are trained to recognise abuse, notice the signals and refer.  They usually get good support from their local safeguarding team.  However, there are huge inconsistencies throughout the country.  There is no standard operating protocol or procedure that is consistent to the nine CHOs.  In north Dublin we might get a very good response but we may not get the same response in Cork or Kerry.  A vulnerable person does not know what response he or she will get.<\/p> <p>  In private nursing homes, as mentioned by Mr. Healy and Mr. Taylor, there is some really good engagement.  Some private nursing homes really want support.  However, when they pick up the phone to their local safeguarding team that team is not obliged to support them because they are private nursing homes.  Again, this discrepancy falls on who picks up the phone and the response is dependent on this.  Our major concern is what is happening in the community.  There are no designated officers in the community.. It often falls to the public health nurse or the primary care social worker to respond, and they are often left to case manage.  What happens is someone the community with his or her own job is left to actively assess the situation, see what is going on and provide support.  This falls back to the lack of any standard operating procedure and that the resources are not sufficient.  We have been consistently told by safeguarders on the ground they are not sufficiently resourced to respond.  In the HSE and HSE-funded services there are designated officers who will respond accordingly, but what is happening in the areas where we are not involved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen O'Callaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I will bring in some other members and I ask the witnesses to bank their answers until they have had a chance to contribute.<\/p><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations and observations.  Regarding some of the surveys, the Red C polls, the statistics that are coming out and the HIQA 2016 submission to the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare, the Abuse and Neglect of Older People in Ireland: Report on the National Study of Elder Abuse and Neglect report from 2010 estimated that 10,000 older people are mistreated or neglected every year with 6,000 cases of financial abuse.  Dr. Amanda Phelan from UCD estimated that 32,000 older people were abused in the past 12 months.  There are large disparities but certainly large numbers of people regardless of which figure one takes into account.  At the same time, the HSE reported that 8,000 cases of alleged adult abuse were reported to it last year.  The main types of abuse experienced were physical, psychological and financial abuse and neglect.  In the context of the 8,000 cases that were reported to the HSE, without any change in the law, physical abuse is a criminal offence, as is psychological abuse.  Financial abuse is also a criminal offence if it can proved that money was taken illegally.  Of all those cases, how often would the HSE interact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of investigations from a criminal point of view?  Is there a reluctance to refer these cases or does a filtering system exist?  Who analyses whether or not they should be referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is the body charged with protecting individuals' integrity?<\/p><p> The HSE is the body that is primarily responsible in the context of the provision of service as well.  Can a conflict sometimes arise regarding providing and funding a service and at the same time, investigating potential failings in that service?  An example is where the HSE may be funding a home care package and there is no oversight regarding how the person receiving the home care package is actually treated.  We must taken into account what happened in the \"Grace\" case and the case of &Aacute;ras Attracta.  &Aacute;ras Attracta was facility run by the HSE where neglect and abuse took place.  Is there a conflict at times because the HSE is funding an entity and might have to hold the entity to account effectively if it highlights issues of abuse or neglect?  <\/p><p> What are the witnesses' observations regarding the broader issue of the Adult Safeguarding Bill 2017 published by Senator Kelleher, which has cross-party support?  Could they make some general observations on it?  When we talk about safeguarding vulnerable people, there is a move to decongregate and provide more care in the home care or community setting.  If we were unable to ensure that there was no abuse or neglect in a congregrated setting, how capable are we of making sure there is no abuse or neglect when an awful lot more people will be dispersed throughout the community?  From what I can gather from parliamentary questions put down by Deputies over the years, there has not been a huge investment in the area of oversight and investigation because of a lack of legislation and resources or even a lack of will at times.  <\/p><p> The Law Reform Commission recommended oversight of home care and the home care setting.  I suppose that refers to home help, home care packages and, I assume, carers.  It is clearly a failing of the Legislature that it has not legislated for that issue.  This committee should take on board that indication from the Law Reform Commission that there is a deficiency in that area, along with Senator Kelleher's Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#J00600","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":511,"content":"<p>There are lots of Kellehers here today.

I commend Mr. Healy on his leadership in developing the adult safeguarding policy in the wake of &Aacute;ras Attracta.  It was hard to take any positives from that but the work that was initiated by Mr. Healy in establishing the National Safeguarding Committee in December 2015, on which I served, and the adult safeguarding teams in the nine community healthcare organisations was positive.  In his submission, he was clear that we need adult safeguarding legislation and he was also clear about the constraints in the current capacity and scope of the HSE policy.  I think this was referred to by other speakers.  Mr. Healy mentioned specific points regarding the adult safeguarding legislation.  He will be glad that they are contained in the Bill referred to by Deputy Kelleher around legislative gaps.  Assessment, planning and co-ordination can be found on page 9; definition and preference for the adult at risk concept rather than the vulnerable adult can be found on pages one and six; the balance between human rights principles and autonomy, which is a tricky one because we want to protect people but people also have a right to control what interventions and supports they get, is on page ten; inter-agency collaboration is on page nine; and the independent advocacy right is on page ten.  Going back to where we are at present, we have an estimate of about 32,000 cases of abuse, which is a huge figure, and with no scope around them.  A total of 8,000 cases were reported but this was probably significantly under-reported.  Could the HSE spell out what its adult safeguarding teams, welcome as they are, cannot do at the moment because of the lack of a legislative base?  We had information about powers of entry and financial abuse.  Deputy Kelleher also said that there would be far more people living in the community so that is all the more reason why we have adult safeguarding provisions.  Can the witnesses spell out what powers adult safeguarding teams do not have?  I would also like to hear about the multiple roles the HSE carries, if there are conflicts of interest and if the HSE can be truly independent?  I would like to hear from the HSE in respect of that question but also Ms Rickard-Clarke and Mr. Taylor.<\/p> <p>  I have some questions for Ms Rickard-Clarke, who I thank for her powerful leadership of the National Safeguarding Committee.  Could she comment on how the Adult Safeguarding Bill, as drafted, measures up and what she would add to it?  How should this committee advise the Minister in respect of progressing the adult safeguarding legislation that is currently on the Seanad Order Paper?  <\/p> <p>  My final question is addressed to Sage.  The Bill, as drafted, includes access to an independent advocate so that takes up many of the points the witnesses from Sage made about the importance of enshrining that right in legislation.  Could the witnesses from Sage comment on the Bill, as drafted?  What would they recommend to the Minister in light of the magnitude of the issue we need to address - 32,000 cases, 8,000 of which reported to the HSE?  What should this committee say to the Minister about the urgency to develop the legal framework for adult safeguarding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#K00400","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions and for the work they are doing.

When it came before the Seanad, unfortunately the Department advised it wanted a further 12 months before it would go forward with the regulation of home care providers.  It is an important issue because anyone can set up a home care providing company without restriction.  There is a voluntary code but there is no regulation.  It is something we need to progress.  Perhaps we could put that Bill on our agenda and give it some consideration here as a way of pressing the Department to progress that legislation.<\/p> <p>  I will touch on a number of issues that I will come at as a practising solicitor rather than a public representative.  On the one hand I think there is a need for regulation but on the other hand I think sometimes there has been misinterpretation of regulation.  Recently I went to lodge &euro;25,000 into the credit union account of an elderly person who was in a nursing home.  The cheque was swiftly sent back to me saying the person must come in person to lodge the money into her account.  That is an example on an over-emphasis on regulation.  There was a clear explanation given for where the money came from.  It was from the estate of a brother who had died.  The money laundering legislation was cited as the reason why the money has to be lodged in person by the account holder.  Over-interpretation of regulation can sometimes be a disadvantage.  <\/p> <p>  I come across the biggest problems with people who are on their own and are borderline in terms of whether someone should be appointed to manage their affairs; they need further assistance but there is a certain amount of independence.  I have a case at the moment of an elderly gentleman living on his own whose medical card has lapsed.  On Monday morning I had a Bill from the pharmacy for over &euro;800 and we cannot get access to his bank account to answer all the questions for the medical card application.  We have the community guard and nurse working on it but there is no one in charge.  It is a very grey area.  There is a concern about over-interference and it is one of the problems we have.  One issue arises when I have to enact enduring powers of attorney.  In some cases, we are lucky that we already had those powers signed but in cases where we do not have them signed, the issue seems to drag on when trying to manage the person's affairs and trying to make decisions.  We have not done enough work in trying to encourage people to sign powers of attorney while they are fully competent, for example when they are admitted to a nursing home.  Another example is when people just come out of hospital and, while their health may have stabilised, they need to start long-term planning.  There is a reluctance to such planning so we need to provide more education in that area.  It is one of the situations where there are difficulties acting in a legal capacity.  We find resistance from some institutions when we are trying to help.  Barriers are put in our way when we are trying to give assistance when it is really necessary.  It is something we need to look at.  I am particularly talking about enduring powers of attorney so that at least there is someone clearly identified as being in charge.  They also, in taking on that role, have responsibilities and are fully accountable.  We need to do a lot more in that area.<\/p> <p>  When abuse arises, it can be hidden in many ways.  I might recognise it from reading all the signs that are presented to me in a legal capacity but to try to pinpoint it to get movement to protect the person is quite difficult.  It is something we need to highlight a lot more.  We also need to highlight how people can protect themselves at a far earlier stage rather than waiting for the day they can no longer make a decision.  It is one of the problems I am finding in a legal capacity.  There also needs to be far more co-operation between the agencies and the community guard, community nurse, the HSE services and all the other State agencies so that when something arises such as the situation I am talking about someone is put in charge to co-ordinate all that.  It is one of the problems we are not addressing at the moment.  I thank the witnesses for the work they are doing and for the progress that has been made over the past number of years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#L00300","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I will be brief because I have tabled a Commencement matter in the Seanad.

From my own experience as a GP, I think there is a widespread practice of what we call granny dumping in the medical profession.  I welcome the idea of an independent advocate.  From my clinical practice, I feel that banks and nursing homes do not really care so long as they are getting money in or unless there is a legal requirement, as Senator Burke said, such as a power of attorney or if a patient has dementia and is made a ward of court.

Learning from all of the previous issues that have arisen, I have a number of points to make.  Regulation is an essential part of it.  On the residential side we have independent regulation by HIQA, which we do not have yet in community services and home care.  We are supporters of that and Mr. Fitzgerald will talk about it in more detail and some of the other aspects that have been raised by members.  Regulation will be an important part of it.  On the specific issue of our independence and the learning around that, we have established a national panel for people with disability similar to the child care panel.  It has been formally established and a chairman has been appointed to it.  The panel is still being put together.

In our opening statement we were trying to set out our issues.  The simplest way of dealing with the constraints would be to highlight section 3 of the Child Care Act 1991 which gives Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, the authority to do all that it does for children.  There is no such legislation for adults.  The Oireachtas has not bestowed that responsibility on any organisation.  The only authority that has the power to investigate abuse is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  No entity in the State has the authority to remove vulnerable people.  In individual cases there is potential in the area of inherent jurisdiction to go to the High Court.  There is the use of the wards of court provisions and so on.  The legislation is required.  As the national director of social care, my priority is that the national policy, which is good and can be developed, needs a legislative basis.

That will come to a conclusion this week.  It had to be extended because of the level of input from the community and voluntary groups, etc.  From our perspective, home care has grown as a resource and in terms of its importance in maintaining older people and people with disabilities in their own homes.  Those of us in the HSE have been calling for such regulation or licensing of providers to a standard or level and we hope the committee might move that legislation forward.  We have done some internal work to strengthen our organisation and have good oversight of the home care services.  We have put audit teams in place in the nine community health organisations, CHOs, this year. They are working with the service providers, and taking the temperature and receiving comments from the recipients on their experience of the service.  This is important because home care is a high risk area and there will be challenges in regulating that.  It will be important that those who provide it will be able to display that they have oversight and good systems in place to ensure that any risks with regard to abuse of vulnerable people will be picked up by the service.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge what Senator Colm Burke said, that there is work to be done in a range of services because people who are getting older should put their affairs in place at an early stage.  They should do it when they are healthy, have capacity, are clear about what they want to do, and understand the importance of that when they do need services, such as applying for the nursing homes support scheme and all that comes with it.  Doing all that in the cold light of day when one is well and able, for want of a better phrase, is very important.  I echo his comments on that area.  Too often we find ourselves in a morass with people's circumstances, and people are not sure or not clear.  Families are often not sure what their parents' requirements are or there is divisiveness.  It would be important that, given our ageing population, older people are educated on their rights and entitlements to enable them make good decisions when they are able to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":526,"content":"<p>First, I will deal with Senator Kelleher's questions.  The figures can be confusing.  We do not have comprehensive data but the 10,000 refers to the research that the National Centre for the Protection of Older People did in 2010.  It did not cover people who lacked capacity.  The high risk areas are the people over the age of 90 who lack decision-making capacity.  It did not include people in residential services.  The cohort was quite confined.  The 32,000 is a general extrapolation based on international figures and our own figures.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about the interaction between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others.  The offences that the Senator identified, particularly theft and fraud, operate significantly in respect of vulnerable people.  The vulnerable person is left to report it.  Someone asked about emotional or psychological abuse, the vulnerable person may be under huge pressure not to report.  My view is that if it is a crime the Garda should intervene, and another State authority to ensure support for the person.  That can be done by anonymous reporting but we do not have any system in place for that even where it is clear that a crime or offence has been committed.  We do not recognise that there is a large cohort of vulnerable people in our society who need protection.  <\/p> <p>  The UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities considers the question of people being able to exercise those rights.  It also provides that we need safeguarding protection for people in vulnerable situations.  We have a huge gap.<\/p> <p>  In response to the question of the HSE being the body responsible for the provision of the service and the funding and the investigation, while I hear what Mr. Healy says about audit teams and external panels, that is in the CHO, it is not general around the country or in non-governmental organisations, NGOs.  That is only starting.  There are very good organisations such as Sage which have that internally but there is a need for external oversight.  That has to be the independent national safeguarding authority as provided for in the Bill.  That is extremely important.<\/p> <p>  That leads to the question of mandatory reporting or not.  If there is an external authority and proper systems in place such that people know how to escalate internally and there are external panels they do not need to escalate everything.  However, they need a robust authority with right of access and investigation when it is needed, meanwhile the systems are working to prevent abuse.  We have nothing in our systems to prevent abuse, no overarching standards or guidance.  The HSE have some but, for example, banks do not even know that things are going on.  I mentioned shared services, they do not know or understand.<\/p><p>We have not addressed the fact that we have an ageing population who may be in be in very vulnerable situations.  This beings us back to Senator Burke's point.  Our systems are honed in on money laundering but are not facilitating people.  We do not have systems to accommodate people in certain circumstances.  We need to be very aware that people may need to be safeguarded against abuse.  Our mentality and thinking has not got to grips with that issue.<\/p><p> Deputy Kelleher asked whether the Bill hits a lot of the points we are making.  I would say we need an independent authority with a right of access and all the rest.  I also welcome the section of the Bill providing for an internally mandated person.  The Bill attempts to define what we are talking about, which is something that is really needed.  I agree that we are talking about a person at risk, but how should that be defined?  As Senator Kelleher has said, such questions need to be put to the Minister.  We need a framework that will enable systems and processes of prevention to be put in place so that we are not arriving at critical situations.<\/p><p> Before I ask Ms Lennon to talk about decongregated settings, I will deal with some of Senator Burke's questions.  Mr. Fitzgerald has mentioned the whole area of home care provision.  The Law Reform Commission recommended the regulation of home care services, which is extremely important.  A disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill has been introduced to deal with the issue of access.  It will provide for the right of a person to decide to get care at home.  If we have that, we need to have robust home care regulation.  I refer not only to service providers, but also to what happens in the home.  My own experience has been that Government Departments shy away from the home and do not want to go there.  If one is aware that a vulnerable person is being abused, one must have a mechanism to deal with that.  I would come back again to the systems we have in place to prevent abuse in the first place.<\/p><p> I would like to speak about the issue of having enduring powers of attorney.  In 2009, the Council of Europe recommended that State parties were to ensure that older people had advanced health care directives and enduring powers of attorney in place.  We have no national campaign, even though that has been demanded for a number of years.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 will deal with many of the points that are being made about having a decision-making assistant or a co-decision maker in circumstances in which someone still has capacity but needs a lot of assistance.  As members will be aware, the 2015 Act has not yet been fully commenced.  It has been in the process of commencement for a long time.  We badly need it.  Some of our bad practices, particularly in dealing with people whose decision-making capacity is in question, can be dealt with fully under that legislation, which recognises their rights.  I am aware that the director of the decision support service started in that position this week.  I hope that as a result, the commencement of that legislation will now start to be accelerated.<\/p><p> Wardship is a denial of human rights.  It is 1871 legislation.  We have not yet realised that in reality.  The sooner we get the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, the better.  I emphasise strongly that we need to commence section 3, which relates to the assessment of capacity, and section 8, which sets out the guiding principles, immediately.  They could start tomorrow.  They are already part of the common law.  They are already part of the HSE consent policy.  They are already part of the Medical Council guidelines.  I do not understand why we do not start those two sections immediately because it would enable people to start planning and would assist the whole issue of prevention.<\/p><p> I would like to come back to the barriers.  Advocates cannot get in.  We go for total informality in our system.  We do not realise we need to face up to the fact that we are dealing with people who are growing older and becoming frail and vulnerable.  Some of them have huge capacity, but they are sometimes ignored.  Those who cannot physically go into the bank to do what they have to do need assistance that is provided in a correct and appropriate manner.  I emphasise that much of the abuse that happens is possible because we do not have a system to recognise the vulnerability of such people.  There needs to be far more co-operation between all organisations.  I ask Ms Lennon to address the question of decongregation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":528,"content":"<p>We were asked how we can be sure during the process of decongregation that the community will be better.  The short answer is that we cannot be sure.  I suppose it is a bigger issue than decongregation.  It is actually a question of deinstitutionalisation.  Decongregation involves between 2,500 and 2,700 people.  Deinstitutionalisation is a bigger issue.  It depends on what we understand to be an \"institution\".  The definition of an \"institution\" that is used by the committee on the UN conventions includes many other places where people with disabilities can live, including community group homes.  It may also include people's private residences.  We are talking about between 2,000 and 3,000 people moving to the community.  A significant number of people with disabilities live with their ageing parents, who are receiving support but might not be known to us and are certainly not being considered in terms of service provision.<\/p> <p>  I represent Inclusion Ireland on the national safeguarding committee.  We represent people with intellectual disabilities.  We view institutions of all kinds as abuses in themselves.  They are certainly fertile ground for abuse to take place in.  We face significant challenges as we consider how we can get the community right.  I suggest we should perceive those challenges as opportunities.  We have many tools at our disposal.  Interagency working has been mentioned all day.  A significant number of laws and policies which are partially commenced or not commenced at all would make community living a significantly more abuse-free environment for people.<\/p> <p>  The deprivation of liberty safeguards are a significant piece of work for the Department and the committee to do.  The decision support service has a huge role to play.  Clearly, the provision of independent advocacy is a significant area that has been teased out.  Another important structural change that needs to be brought in involves drawing up personal budgets for people with disabilities and putting in place personal assistance to help people to live in their own homes.<\/p> <p>  I would like to offer a couple of observations on the Bill itself.  It is really welcome.  It is being introduced in response to a number of things that have happened, such as the &Aacute;ras Attracta and Grace cases.  The focus on prevention is really important.  If we recognise that vulnerability is constructed, and that we are all responsible for constructing it, we need to do more than react when abuse takes place.  We need to put in place the structural changes that are needed to prevent abuse from occurring in the first place.<\/p> <p>  I think the committee should consider the idea of being able to take care of oneself, which has not really come up in this debate to date.  It is a part of the legislation.  We need to reflect on issues of self-neglect or a lack of self-care and the boundaries around that.  If we are taking a neutral or non-status approach to defining who this legislation applies to - such an approach is to be commended - we need to be careful that we do not become subjective in terms of what constitutes self-neglect and self-care.  An important conversation needs to take place in this context.  The boundaries of that conversation will need to be managed carefully.<\/p> <p>  Those of us who work in the area of disability have seen that independence is critical.  It can be difficult for children with disabilities to receive services within the likes of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  They often have to return to the HSE for investigation or management.  For that reason, the independence of the national adult safeguarding agency that is being mooted in this legislation is critical.  Training is also important, as is an awareness of the multitude of people we could be talking about here, including people with disabilities, older people, people with acquired brain injuries and people with mental illnesses.  A significant number of people will not sit comfortably within the groups I have identified.  Resources and training will be needed.  The independence of the agency will be absolutely critical.<\/p> <p>  I would like to suggest some recommendations that this committee can make.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has a personal advocacy service at its disposal, but the statutory powers that go with it need to be commenced.<\/p><p>In the interim, an important move would be if that part of the Citizens Information Act 2007 were commenced.  While it agrees with the likes of an agency as proposed by Mr. Mervyn Taylor, Inclusion Ireland also proposes an advocacy agency which would have oversight of all of the statutory and voluntary advocacy services.<\/p><p> The other critical part of this legislation is the idea of the will and preference of the person.  Earlier we spoke about children's first legislation.  It is a different concept when we talk about adults.  Whatever we put in place in terms of investigations, mandatory reporting and advocacy, it is critical that people with disabilities and others who are being represented are not subject to any investigations or anything that takes place around safeguarding but that they are actually active participants and their will and preference are recognised.  The best way to do that is through independent representative advocacy.  That message has been heard loud and clear today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Lennon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":530,"content":"<p>Deputy Billy Kelleher raised the issue of congregated care.  In the south east, where much public attention has been paid to some particularly awful cases, 70% of those with a disability live in the community.  For some people, a person in a family with a disability is a source of income.  The solution to this is not about having more safeguarding teams.  This is why we have a national safeguarding committee, as well as the involvement of the Department of Employment and Social Protection and HIQA.  It is through the interaction of the various agencies who can check who is actually benefitting from the moneys.  Is it really for the benefit of the person?  We must not see this as just the responsibility of any one agency.  Although there is a clear lead agency with the HSE, other agencies are involved.  Huge amounts of State money go out through the Department of Employment and Social Protection which is a key part of the picture.  Following the money is often, as in crime, a useful way of tackling the issue of abuse.<\/p> <p>  We thank Senator Colette Kelleher for her welcome work on the Adult Safeguarding Bill 2017.  Our view is that any safeguarding service should be independent of service providers.  For example, the same chief operating officer of the HSE who does not answer three letters could be the same person who is responsible for setting up safeguarding teams and various committees in those areas.  We see the need for an independent service.  People need to understand that the future lies in having a dedicated independent safeguarding service.<\/p> <p>  The recognition of the independent advocate in the Bill is welcome.  There is a debate about whether the old Citizens Information Bill is the relevant one because some have criticisms of the way people were mandated to provide advocates.  There are issues to be teased out there.  The first point is that there should be recognition of the role of independent advocacy.  I also think of the emerging decision support service which will have implications for the emergence of advocacy.  We need to develop among the general public a better understanding of what constitutes abuse. We need to talk about a threshold for engagement of safeguarding services.  There is a role in all of this for the public.<\/p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke referred to enduring power of attorney, EPA, and the general idea of planning ahead.  Earlier this year, we wrote to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, Deputy Madigan, suggesting certain incentives to develop EPAs, advance health care directives, etc.  We would like very much if the committee would bring that message to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  We have not had engagement with it so far but we know some people are interested in this whole idea of how we can develop a series of incentives.  People need to be incentivised.  There is a significant cost to the health and social care system generally, as well as to the public purse, arising from the fact that one has divided families, not always large, fighting over people who have a lack of or are losing capacity.  An incredible amount of time is spent by us, as well as doctors, social workers, nurses, health care attendants, and indeed in some cases, security, in dealing with these cases.  This is an incredible cost to the State.  We have got to find a basic system to incentivise people to actually take responsibility and literally think ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017100400002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mervyn Taylor"},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":531,"content":"<p>Which Department should be responsible for this complex legislation?

It has a wide representation of high levels from those organisations such as chief executive officers.  It is important to have people around the table who can make decisions and commit.  It will need a core number of staff but will also need to be able to commission work because one does not know from day to day what expertise one needs.  It should also have powers of investigation like the decision support service.<\/p> <p>  The cost to the State would actually decrease substantially.  Taking Mr. Taylor's point, we are wasting and using money inappropriately because we are going around in circles and not actually dealing with the problem.  We have no systems in place or no processes in place to deal with it.<\/p><p>Therefore, I would say that it would actually decrease the cost to the State if we had a proper system.<\/p><p> On having mandatory or voluntary reporting, that needs huge concentration in terms of what is appropriate.  Looking at other jurisdictions, mandatory reporting does not work.  My view is to have good prevention and a system internally in organisations such as that being put in place by the HSE and external panels to deal with a lot of complaints.  At the moment, we do not really distinguish between a low level complaint and a really serious safeguarding issue but we need to dissect those.  Where there are serious issues, it would then be over to the independent authority to take action and investigate.  Our systems, NGOs, banks and financial institutions are all institutions today.<\/p><p> On the public awareness in families, a huge cultural shift has to take place in terms of understanding the appropriate behaviour to a family member and acknowledging that the vulnerable family member or a person who lacks capacity is an individual person with his or her own rights.  We have not reached that point yet because our legislation has not demanded it of us.  This is why I emphasise that the Assisted Decision-making capacity Act is so important.  It is based on the right of the individual.  We should not look at their disability, age or whatever but look at them as an individual person with rights and we should enable them to exercise their rights.  That is hugely important.  On whether it would dramatically increase the number of complaints, I would say \"yes and no\".  Perhaps it would initially, but if we put a robust prevention and proper system in place, we would get the benefit of it.<\/p><p> Those are my views, off the top of my head.

I am director general of Engineers Ireland.  I thank the committee for the invitation to give evidence before the it this afternoon.  I would like to introduce my colleague, Cormac Bradley, a fellow of Engineers Ireland, who is joining me in representing our institution at the meeting this morning.<\/p> <p>  Engineers Ireland is one of the oldest and largest representative bodies on the island of Ireland, that is, North and South.  We have 23,000 engineering members. This membership incorporates all disciplines of engineering in Ireland across industry in consulting and contracting organisations, the public service, semi-State organisations and academic institutions.<\/p><p>Engineers Ireland awards the professional title \"chartered engineer\", which is the gold standard for engineers working in Ireland.  This professional badge of excellence, awarded following a rigorous assessment, is recognised internationally and in Irish law.  Under the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, BCAR, for example, only chartered engineers may act as design certifiers and assigned certifiers to a building project. <\/p><p> Engineers Ireland welcomes the general scheme of the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill 2017.  During the BCAR consultation process, the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, proposed a voluntary register that all the stakeholders welcomed and it was the collective ambition of all the stakeholders that the register would become statutory even though we knew this would require Government support. <\/p><p> We therefore believe that establishing the Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI, as a mandatory statutory register of builders, contractors and specialist subcontractors is an important step in improving building control and consumer protection and the ultimate step in the previously declared ambition of the BCAR consultation process.  We believe this Bill will help to promote a greater commitment to compliance with the building regulations, thereby promoting greater safety and quality for consumers and the wider public. <\/p><p> The Bill provides for independent and cost-effective oversight.  For example, two industry nominees to the admissions and registration board may be &ldquo;registered construction professionals&rdquo; which include chartered engineers registered with Engineers Ireland.  Two such registered construction professionals, not being members of the board, shall also be nominated to the appeals committee.  It is important for the transparency of the statutory register that the other building sector institutions are afforded the opportunity to nominate individuals to both the admissions and registration board and appeals committee. <\/p><p> It is our view that the obligation to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the board of CIRI, the ability to comply with the multiple requirements of section 5(4) strengthens the credibility of the register and acts as an appropriate deterrent to those who may try to operate outside this regulatory vehicle.  A transparent and rigorous system of qualification to undertake building works should enhance competition for projects in the sector and will go a long way to ensure that only bona fide builders operate in what is bound to become, for the immediate future, a highly focused sector as we attempt to redress our housing shortage in particular. <\/p><p> We are not of the view that the proposed register is either discriminatory or exclusive and that it affords all those who wish to operate in the building sector an equal opportunity to be selected for specific works in accordance with declared expertise and a successful track record of project completions.  Accordingly, we welcome this proposed Bill for the benefits it can bring to the sector as a whole in improving the build quality of projects and the opportunity it affords building owners to engage with builders who are prepared to subscribe to the regimen of membership of the register.  We look forward to ongoing engagement with the Government to ensure regulation keeps pace with industry and delivers optimum outcomes for consumers and the wider public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Spillane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507105800,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Spillane for her presentation and call on Ms Kathryn Meghen to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#C00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507105800,"counter":557,"content":"<p>My name is Kathryn Meghen and I am chief executive officer, CEO, of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI.  I thank the committee for its invitation to come before it, and wish to introduce Ms Carole Pollard, who is president of the institute.  The RIAI, which was founded in 1839 and now has 3,380 members, is the support and registration body for architects in Ireland and is the membership body for architectural technologists.  The RIAI works to ensure the safety of the public through the efficient and effective administration of the register of architects and the maintenance of standards within architectural education.  We welcome the publication of the CIRI Bill 2017 and believe the register of contractors in Ireland is an important step in strengthening consumer protection and achieving higher standards in construction.  We believe the proposed Bill as structured can deliver a robust and transparent system.  The requirements for the independence of the admissions and registration board, as well as for those on the register to have appropriate training and experience and that they participate in continuing professional development, are all to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  The RIAI recommends two additions to the proposed Bill and a small number of operational changes.  The additions we ask the committee to consider would enhance consumer protection and specifically provide appropriate redress for consumers if things go wrong.  The issue of most concern to the public is the quality and safety of their homes; it is imperative that homes are built to the highest standard and that they are safe, durable and enjoyable places to live.  While delivering high standards in construction is vital, the committee will be aware the registration system is designed to ensure that those using a specific title are competent to do so.  If a person, or a company in the case of the CIRI Bill, does not meet the standards of knowledge, skill or competence, a fitness to practice complaint can be made against them.  The purpose of fitness to practice is to sanction or remove from the register those who are found to have breached the registration requirements or have been found guilty of poor professional performance to prevent them from continuing in the profession or trade for the future protection of the public.  However, this procedure does not provide financial redress for the consumer who may have been affected by the contractor's poor performance.  The RIAI suggests that this deficiency can be addressed by amending the Bill in two areas, namely, in respect of professional indemnity insurance and latent defects insurance.  <\/p> <p>  Professional indemnity insurance provides clients with protection if, following an error or admission in professional advice or service, they suffer a financial loss.  For instance, where a contractor needs to adjust the design provided to fit the actual work, they create a contingent exposure and should carry insurance to protect the end user.  As a rule, contractors do not carry professional indemnity.  The RIAI believes all parties in the building process should be responsible, liable and insured for their own work.  Architects are required under the RIAI code of conduct to carry an appropriate level of professional indemnity insurance and the RIAI recommends that contractors are similarly required.  We believe this could be accommodated in section 7 of the code of conduct in the proposed legislation.<\/p> <p>  The RIAI's second recommendation is for mandatory latent defects insurance, LDI.  Notwithstanding the existing registration and regulatory systems in place, the complexity of building means things can still go wrong.  In order to further protect clients and homeowners, the RIAI recommends that LDI becomes a mandatory requirement for all new build residential requirements.  LDI is taken out in respect of specific new build premises or building works to provide cover in the event of an inherent defect in the design, workmanship or materials becoming apparent after practical completion.  Latent defects insurance cover is generally provided for between ten and 12 years after a building is signed practically complete.  It provides a quick remedy for the consumer in the event of a defect arising.  LDI is common in many developed countries and mandatory in some, such as France.  LDI provides the quickest and most cost-effective remedy for home and building owners should a problem arise and we believe it is in the interest of the consumer that it is legislated for.  <\/p> <p>  There are also a number of specific operational suggestions that we believe would lead to more expedient decision making under the new Act.  The first relates to sections 4 and 24 of the admissions and registration board.  The CIRI Bill provides an admissions and registration board consisting of a chairperson and ten ordinary members, five industry nominees and five ministerial nominees.  The board must sit with the majority of ministerial nominees and has a quorum of six.  The chairperson does not appear to be included in the majority, as this person is a ministerial appointee and not a nominee.  We suggest that the quorum provided in section 24 be reduced or that the number of ministerial nominees in section 4 be increased.  Similarly, under section 12, the appeals committee, where there is a chairperson and four ordinary members, of whom two are industry nominees and two are ministerial nominees, the committee must sit with a majority of ministerial nominees, with a quorum of three.  In this case, we suggest an increase in the number of ministerial nominees. <\/p> <p>  The RIAI supports the need for standards in consumer protection in all areas of the construction sector.  The introduction of CIRI is an important step in continuing to improve the standards of the built environment and one which the RIAI supports.  We believe that our recommendations as outlined will further strengthen the consumer protection intentions of the Bill and ask that the committee consider their inclusion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathryn Meghen"},{"type":"speech","time":1507105800,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Meghen.

I am a chartered building surveyor and chairperson of the professional group on building surveying in the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI.  I am also the managing director of a private building consultancy practice that offers building surveying and design and project management services.  I am joined by Mr. Alan Isdell, a chartered building surveyor, and past chair of the SCSI building surveying professional group.  He is also a director of OLM Consultancy services.  Mr. Isdell was involved in the stakeholders group in the development and implementation of the building control amendment regulations and has spoken on the subject in a number of forums.<\/p> <p>  The SCSI has been and continues to be very active in the publication of authoritative data for policy makers and Government officials.<\/p><p>For example, given the current housing and homelessness crises, the SCSI has published numerous reports on the property market and construction costs for housing in order that this issue can be measured and addressed in a targeted and systematic way.  The society is also finalising its 2017 apartment delivery cost report, following on from its 2016 real cost of new house delivery report.  The SCSI continues to raise awareness of building defect concerns in our built environment, particularly those within our multi-unit developments, as outlined in our recent submission to the Department and presented to this committee earlier this year.<\/p><p> During that committee meeting, we provided our views on the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, BCAR, which we affirmed is a substantial improvement on the previous self-compliance regime.  The SCSI believes greater consumer protection can be best achieved through ongoing review and improvement of the current regulations, such as improvements in the provision of latent defects insurance measures in residential developments.  The certification process under BCAR is making significant grounds and with greater support of industry standards, further gains can be made.  Accordingly, we welcome an increase in construction industry standards and we fully support the introduction of the Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI, on a mandatory basis for all those working in the construction sector impacted by the building regulations.<\/p><p> With the advancements made in building materials and new building products, we feel that industry practices and installation training were and still are, slow to keep pace with the new ways of installing innovative products and materials.  This can be assisted by mandatory training and continuing professional development across the industry.<\/p><p> The purpose of CIRI is to provide a transparent regulatory environment to improve quality in our building stock and to ensure high-quality construction practices and products for the future in the public interest.  The construction industry has suffered reputational damage prior to the introduction of BCAR.  CIRI aims to address this by raising standards and practices to ensure we avoid mistakes of the past.  Commitment to mandatory registration demonstrates a desire to stamp out non-compliant construction activities while exposing and eliminating non-competent builders from the industry.<\/p><p> As an industry, the construction industry must meet the demands of more rigorous building regulations, more complex and competitive procurement processes, the use of innovative and diverse technologies in design and construction processes, as well as increasingly demanding building contracts.  Regular education, training and upskilling for all those in the construction sector are vital to ensure high standards are applied and maintained.  This is particularly important in high-risk areas such as fire safety.  With new products and building methods coming on stream annually, our current workforce must upskill regularly to maintain skills appropriate to new product installation requirements.  We welcome the requirement for CIRI registrants to plan, record and verify the continuing professional development, CPD, activities of its personnel, with the principal focus on management and supervisory staff whose input is essential to achieving legislative and regulatory compliance.  We believe that through CIRI, other policy directions can be supported such as professional indemnity insurance.<\/p><p> The establishment of a mandatory register should be regarded as a positive step forward in the Irish construction industry.  It has been regarded as an integral component of encouraging public confidence in the construction industry and protecting consumers.  A consumer who engages a builder from the register should have the assurance that the latter possesses a minimum level of commitment to best practice, competency and qualifications.<\/p><p> The SCSI wish to take this opportunity to reiterate our support and overriding requirements that it provides a fit-for-purpose process by providing flexible access to competent entities without sacrificing standards in the interest of consumer protection.  From a consumer protection point of view, with the improvements made with the introduction of BCAR and the proposed implementation of CIRI, the SCSI is concerned that the level of latent defects insurance currently available falls short of what is required.  While there have been improvements in recently introduced products, we believe this area requires significant improvement.<\/p><p> As the registration body for building surveyors and quantity surveyors under the Building Control Act, the SCSI would welcome the introduction of the CIRI scheme to ensure a competent workforce throughout the construction process, which will benefit the other professions involved and consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Baldwin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507105800,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I welcome all three delegations to the committee on this important topic, especially as we embark again on an ambitious building programme.  I support CIRI because it is a registration process designed to promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance.  That, in combination with BCAR, can certainly enhance consumer protection with regards to the construction industry.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, it is important to learn from the mistakes from the past in terms of standards in building and compliance.  There have been well-publicised failures in the construction industry, such as Priory Hall and the Dublin docklands apartments, as well as pyrite and now the mica issues in counties Donegal and Mayo.  During the last big freeze, it was discovered utilities were buried at insufficient depths in the ground causing freezing pipes and so forth which caused significant problems for consumers.  With no disrespect to the organisations before the committee, professional engineers, architects and quantity surveyors signed off on these developments.  It came as a severe disappointment, as policy makers, to see how consumers were abandoned at that time and are still abandoned when it comes to mica and pyrite issues.  That is why I welcome CIRI.<\/p> <p>  There are builders at fault where substandard work has been done.  I argue, however, that professionals who signed off on such substandard work are also rogue and need to be taken to task as well.  How will CIRI impact on dealing with rogue builders and professionals who sign off on substandard work?  How do the individual organisations propose to ensure they retain standards of professional competency in their organisations?  Sanctions were mentioned in one of the presentations where a person found to be incompetent is removed from the relevant professional register.  Is that enough?  Should there be financial sanctions or penalties and fines imposed?<\/p> <p>  It was also mentioned that there is no financial redress for consumers under the legislation as currently drafted, and providing additional insurance cover for substandard work may need to be revisited.  Will the delegations expand on those points?  Many consumers to date have been left in the lurch by inadequate insurance or by professionals or builders not held to account.  How will CIRI change that?  It is important to have a register of competent builders and professionals.  However, it is not good enough that the sanction is that one is removed from a register, yet the consumer is left in the lurch again.  What other sanctions will work to enhance standards and competency?<\/p> <p>  What is the impact of cost?  We often hear the costs of new build houses or apartments are a barrier to development happening.  What will be the cost impact of this new regulation?  I hope it will not be another barrier and will fit seamlessly into current costs.<\/p> <p>  My final question pertains to inspections.  We heard recently from the Department of Education and Skills about problems with relatively new school builds.  It is now proposed to have a clerk of works on all new school builds.  What are the delegation's views on bringing back independent clerks of works on all substantial building projects over a certain size to monitor and ensure adherence to standards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#D00200","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507105800,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I will respond to the code of conduct issue and my colleague, Mr. Cormac Bradley, will respond with regard to the inspection piece.

We have an ethics and disciplinary board to which any member of the public can make a complaint for free.  We hold oral hearings in certain circumstances and a chartered engineer can be removed from the register.  If they are removed from the register, they cannot practise and will not be able to undertake activities under the building control regulations as specified.<\/p><p>Codes of conduct operated by professional bodies are to ensure that the standards of the profession are upheld.

Section 7 provides for the Minister to prepare a code of conduct and a number of subsections relate to professionalism, competence, professional development, records and data and other matters.

An inspection is a frequent visit to a site as works are in progress while supervision implies a full-time on-site presence.  In many ways, the proposal that the Department of Education and Skills would now put a clerk of works on sites of new school projects harks back to a previous era where a building project, or civil engineering project for that matter, would have had full-time on-site supervision.  A return to a clerk of works environment for the Department's projects is a positive move.  However, in the context of the CIRI Bill, the builder is not responsible for inspection; the builder is responsible for full-time supervision.  If one looks at the BCAR documentation and the certificate of compliance and completion that the builder is obliged to sign in his or her individual capacity, it makes specific reference to the requirement to provide on-site supervision.  It provides for specific undertakings and a commitment and declaration that the works have been carried out in accordance with drawings, specifications, performance parameters and everything else.<\/p> <p>  Inspections do not impact on CIRI in terms of membership of the CIRI board, because the builders who will be expecting to get onto that register are providing supervision and do not provide inspections.  However, the professionals attached to a project - the engineers, architects and building surveyors - work to an inspection regime.  I imagine that we would collectively welcome the fact that a clerk of works for a Department of Education and Skills project would be placed on site.  We need to be very careful, however.  If there is a party on site who is answerable to the client body while others who are answerable to the client body are there in an inspection capacity, there will have to be very clearly defined areas of responsibility and lines of communication to ensure there is no duplicity or double work.  While this is welcome, it is not a panacea to solve the problems of the sector and the mistakes of the past.

The title \"architect\" has been registered since 2009.  Some of the issues and difficulties referred to are legacy issues with origins prior to 2009.  I am not saying we have had a clean slate since 2009, as we have not, but we have come a long way in the standards expected of an architect.  The requirement to register as an architect is a stringent one given compliance and the requirement to undertake 40 hours of CPD per annum.  An architect must also comply with the code of conduct.  We have been actively involved in the training relating to BCAR.  We have seen significant improvements and the feedback from members has been very positive.<\/p> <p>  Ms Meghen mentioned insurance as a method of redress.  As a practicing architect for 30 years, I consider professional indemnity, PI, insurance to be an incredibly powerful tool for ensuring standards.  One pays for one's PI insurance and if there is a very severe claim against one, one often cannot get PI insurance again.  That is a financial burden on the professional practitioner.  It acts both to provide redress for the consumer and to keep a check on professionals.  PI insurance must be part of the CIRI Bill.  Everybody involved in a construction project must have a similar level of insurance cover.<\/p> <p>  The mica and pyrite issues are incredibly serious and have huge implications for people living in affected homes.  The mica investigation in counties Mayo and Donegal is ongoing.  I understand that an incredible 10% of the population of Donegal, and more than that on the Inishowen Peninsula, has been affected by mica.  To the best of my knowledge, the blocks which contain mica have CE markings.  If a product has a CE marking, the contractor and the professionals on the job have to take that at face value.  As such, latent defects insurance is the solution for mica and pyrite.  Latent defects insurance provides for defects in materials.  That is a really strong argument for the inclusion of that form of insurance in the CIRI legislation.  Ultimately, it is the best recourse for consumers affected by building defects.  It is a much faster solution.  While there are concerns about the cost of these new regulations and of paying for latent defects insurance, the benefit for the consumer is enormous in the long run.  It shortens the time to get redress and reduces the legal bills attached to it.  In the larger scheme of things, it is far more cost effective than the current system.<\/p> <p>  As to the use of clerks of works, I concur completely with Mr. Cormac Bradley on the difference between supervision and inspection.  Every layer we have is good.  If there is a clerk of works, it needs to be clear who is employing that clerk and to whom he or she answers.  Certainly, the architectural profession welcomes every layer of oversight and being part of a larger grouping protecting the consumer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Carole Pollard"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507105800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>We echo the views of the RIAI and Engineers Ireland on admissions procedures and the codes of conduct that apply to our society.

I am hopeful that the legislation will create a new level of professionalism and new standards in the construction industry.<\/p> <p>  We were asked about financial redress to protect consumers and my views are like those of my colleagues here.

There is also a technical assessment board for where issues of a technical nature need assessment.  We have had some, whereby people working in the industry for quite a number of years maybe do not have the professional qualification but are trying to come through on a technical route.

I draw the Senator's attention to the definition of \"competence\" in the proposed Bill, and I have an issue with it.  Section 7 of the Bill speaks about competence being relevant work undertaken or relevant education qualifications or a combination of both.  Looking at this definition, one could say somebody who has educational qualifications could get onto the register.  To me this does not sit with the definitions we have had traditionally in the industry.  The definition under health and safety legislation, for example, comprises three things, namely, relevant knowledge, training and experience.  The definition under the code of practice for inspecting buildings and certifying buildings is relevant knowledge, training and experience.  This definition should probably follow through to make sure members who are CIRI registered have the appropriate competence.  This is to try to address the issue of competence on the building side of the equation.

All of the committee members want to see a mandatory register.  The issue is whether the legislation provides the most robust system we can get.  Much of this has to do with the quality of the enforcement element of it.  I have a couple of questions for all of the witnesses.  We have had the voluntary register since 2014.  What has been the witnesses' experience of this?  Have they noticed the voluntary register making any change or impact?  Have they noticed, or are they aware of, any enforcement actions taken for non-compliance or poor standards against contractors on this voluntary register since it was established?<\/p> <p>  In terms of the effectiveness of the enforcement, somebody on the panel mentioned that the complexity of building, particularly new building technologies, creates a series of challenges, but there is also the size of the sector.  The size of this register will be substantially bigger than any of the registers the witnesses' organisations operate.  Do these two factors, the complexity of what is done and the size of the sector create additional challenges which need to be considered?  For example, if I discover there is no fire stopping in the home I bought some years ago, against whom do I make a complaint?  Is it the untrained subcontractor who installed the fire stopping, the foreman of the building site, the builder, the developer or somebody else?  How will the register work in this sense?  If I employ an architect, it is pretty straightforward as I make a complaint about the work or otherwise of that individual.  How do the witnesses see this register working in this particular way?<\/p> <p>  There is also an issue about independence and we have two options in terms of the legislation.  One is to follow self-regulation, which is the model that works in the witnesses' own sectors, and arguably works very well.  The other, of course, is an independent model, whether we look at the Environmental Protection Agency or the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Given the size of the sector, the complexity of what is done and the damage reputation that sector has because of the activities of a small but significant number of rogue contractors, is there an argument to say that public confidence would be better served by having a fully independent register and enforcement activity rather than locating it, for example, within the Construction Industry Federation?  I am interested to hear the views of the witnesses on this.<\/p> <p>  In terms of board membership, do witnesses think the legislation is strong enough to ensure not only industry representation but also that consumers and consumer protection have a voice?  Obviously there are ministerial appointees.  There is clearly a need, given the level of defect discovery in developments, for some type of consumer voice because this is the bit that is missing in much of the public debate and legislation, as the witnesses have outlined.<\/p> <p>  I would like the views of the witnesses on sanctions.  While I absolutely agree with the principle that if somebody does something wrong and is sanctioned, there should be a remedy for them to get back into the system, at what point does the level of negligence or non-compliance become so egregious that not only is somebody taken off the register but he or she is barred from engaging in the profession at all?  We see this with taxi drivers and other industries.  Do the witnesses' organisations have a sense in which there should be a scale of sanctions and what kinds of sanctions should be applied, given the impact that non-compliance in the sector has, not just on people's quality of life but on their family homes, family futures and their financial well-being?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#F00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507105800,"counter":572,"content":"<p>The first issue the Deputy raised is where a person goes when an issue occurs.

To deal with redress and remedies, all of the bodies here have mentioned latent defects insurance, and without wanting to bore people, this is the absolute bottom line.  Average home buyers should not have to decide whether to take a case against the builder, the material supplier, the contractor, the architect or the engineer.  They should have an insurance product that enables them to get their house or home fixed in order that they can continue to live in it or move back into it quickly and then, if needs be, the insurance company can decide to take court cases against all the various participants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathryn Meghen"},{"type":"speech","time":1507105800,"counter":573,"content":"<p>My question is more related to the operation of the register rather than legal remedies.

From a voluntary registration point of view, on a personal level I have not experienced any changes or impact from the voluntary register system to date.<\/p><p>I accept the point about the complexity of construction techniques and how the register would work in practice.  We referred in our opening statement to the complexities and to how the construction industry is changing annually.  It is very important that everyone involved in the construction sector maintains continuing professional development.  There has to be training in place.<\/p><p> There is a difficulty with the register at the moment.  To take the example outlined, if there is an issue with a house or an apartment, to whom does one take the matter?  The Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill provides that one would take one's complaint to CIRI and register it.  I stand to be corrected but my aspiration is that there will, under the CIRI system, be a series of subcategories that will be determined by the Minister, in consultation with whoever is on the board, and for each of those there would be specific elements within a building structure.  There is the possibility that could become terribly complex because one could have 50 to 60 subcontractors on a very large complex build so there is the potential for that to become a bit of mess in terms of how we get to the right person.  In reality, what we are expecting is that a main building contractor will register under the scheme and he will be ultimately responsible for the build.  If it is the case that some of that responsibility is assigned to another registered contractor who is an expert in firestopping or fire-sealing, then it would seem to me that the second contractor is the person who the claim would be made against.  That would be my expectation.  That is really important because if all we do is create a register for the main building contractors, it will serve no purpose.  The problems most consumers have encountered in the past probably stem from things they cannot see and that in many instances have been carried out by unskilled personnel simply because there is not an expectation or requirement that they need any training.  They simply fit the product; they do not know whether they are fitting it correctly.  That is a really important point.<\/p><p> I hope the register will provide for a very simple system in terms of recognising the various parties involved in the construction.  Ultimately, it will be down to the appeals committee to decide the outcome and it may refer the matter back to the party that made the complaint for the issue to go to mediation or arbitration.  That is something we could talk about as a panel and whether that is the appropriate course of action.  If one has bought something, the suggestion is that one takes one problem back to the person with whom one has the problem in order to enter into mediation.  However, that might not provide one with the necessary redress one was hoping for.  While mediation is very beneficial, it can also be very time-consuming and expensive, so we have to look at all of those things.<\/p><p> The possibility of a public register was mentioned.  I do not have any particularly strong views for or against it.  The current register is working fine, it just needs to be put on a mandatory footing and quickly.  It was mentioned that there is no voice on the board advocating for the consumer.  The Minister makes the appointments so one would hope something could change to recognise that.<\/p><p> The question about sanctions is interesting in terms of how we deal with serious breaches of building regulations.  The intention is simply to remove somebody from the register and, in doing so, prevent them from being able to undertake the work they rely on from a livelihood perspective.  I think it is recognised that, from the perspective of the proposed Bill, there is no redress so one is still left with a problem even though someone has been removed from the register.  Perhaps Mr. Isdell has something to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Baldwin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507105800,"counter":577,"content":"<p>The only comment I would make on a macro level is that when we all sat around in 2012 or so to look at the standards in building and introduced the BCAR regime, the principle the institutes here, the CIF, the Department and various stakeholders worked on was the inter-reliance of all in the building process to achieve compliant buildings.  That inter-reliance bit is based not only on inspections by professionals but the work carried out by the contractors.  It comes back to CIRI being a key bit in the jigsaw because we have gone through the BCAR regime and while some people may criticise it, it is working.  It may need to be adjusted in the future.

When the Bill becomes law and the register is in operation the issue will be how robust the processes will be and it will be very important for there to be accountability and transparency in respect of the systems and processes that are put in place and then the decisions that are made if a complaint is made against a registered member.<\/p> <p>  In the context of sanctions, I think there is redress to the courts in cases where the registered member wants to appeal against the sanction.  Ultimately, the sanction of being eliminated from a register impacts upon one's livelihood and I imagine that there would be provision for an appeal to the High Court in such circumstances.  That is a very serious matter.  From the point of view of the operation of the CIRI register, it would be important that there would be sufficient reserve funds for the registration body to be able to defend decisions that are made if an appeal is taken to the High Court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Spillane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507105800,"counter":579,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin talked about the potential complexity of the register.

We have 23,000 members, of which 7,000 are chartered engineers.  Not all 7,000 would be eligible, for example, to fulfil the role of an assigned certifier or design certifier because the chartered engineer designation applies across a number of disciplines but let us say, conservatively, that half of them would be eligible to be assigned certifiers or design certifiers.  To my right there are 3,000 individuals, there are 3,500 in our organisation and building surveyors might have a smaller contingent.  Colloquially, I have seen two statistics for the number of companies on the current voluntary register of builders and there are between 600 and 800.  I suggest that it is probably closer to the lesser figure of 600.

The register is currently available to small and medium-sized subcontractor specialists in a voluntary capacity.<\/p> <p>  As to whether the voluntary register has had an impact, I would say there is an awareness rather than an influence.  I am about to embark on a project in the pharmaceutical sector.  I had a meeting with the client a number of weeks ago and he said to me at a very early stage of our engagement &ndash; basically 15 minutes into my first face-to-face conversation with him &ndash; that he was considering three contractors and he asked me which one I would use.<\/p><p>I said I could not answer that question.  He said he did not care whether I thought I could answer the question and that he wanted an answer, so there is an awareness of this.  I was able to say that one of the defining measures he might consider is whether any of the three contractors he was considering was on the CIRI register.  He asked about the significance of that.  I said the significance of it is that if they are on the register, they are making a public declaration of their capabilities so, effectively, if they default regarding the work they are doing, the public declaration catches them out.<\/p><p> How much more effective will a mandatory register be, with the ultimate sanction that if one is proven to be incompetent on the basis of track record, one will lose one's livelihood, there is no recourse and one is gone?  One of the problems we in the construction sector have is that we are collectively tarnished by what happened in the past.  There are many people out there trying to do the right thing and many people governed by a code of ethics but, regrettably, we have been tarnished by the actions of a small percentage of the sector and, increasingly, developers who are looking at a commercial return, not necessarily at building standards.<\/p><p> We must also realise that the CIRI register is not the panacea to resolve all the difficulties in the sector.  The CIRI register is part - a very substantial part, admittedly - of a suite of tools to which the building sector is voluntarily committing itself by virtue of the initiative put in place by the former Minister, Mr. Hogan, whereby we look at additional certification and we have an assigned certifier and a design certifier.  Ten years ago, those positions did not exist.  We have ancillary certification.  That did not exist either.  On a certificate of compliance and completion, a builder is expected to declare that he or she has constructed the works in accordance with the drawings, specifications and performance parameters he or she was given.  If someone claims to have firestopped a building and it is proved afterwards that he or she did not do so appropriately, he or she has sullied - not just sullied, but reneged on - the declaration he or she made in that certification.<\/p><p> With respect to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question as to where individuals should go if they come across something that is wrong with a house, for example, the reality is that they now have an assigned certifier who is a named individual, a design certifier who is a named individual and a building owner, who in this case may be a developer and who is a named individual.  Suddenly there are three named individuals whereas, previously, as the Deputy correctly said, the finger was pointed at the subcontractor, who said it was not his or her fault but someone else's because that someone else told the subcontractor what he or she was doing was right.  What BCAR has endeavoured to do is eliminate the ring-around because if we say we want an ancillary certificate for the fire design of a building, we can trace that fire certificate from a corporate, although not an individual, point of view.  If, for example, one is of the view that the fire measures in one's house are not adequate, one can seek out, presumably via a freedom of information request, information as to who signed the certificate that says the fire measures were appropriately installed and one now has a name.  One can say, \"Hold on.  You have made a declaration to the effect that the fire measures are appropriate.  They are clearly not.  What happened?\"  We must not look to the CIRI register as a panacea to resolve all the problems.  CIRI must operate in tandem with BCAR and the ancillary certification.<\/p><p> Reference to LDI and to professional indemnity insurance, PII, is conspicuously absent from our written statement.  Mr. Baldwin is one of the few people who have been involved in this process from the word \"go\" in the dark days of 2012.  LDI was always on the agenda.  My colleagues to my right were the proponents of LDI, but at the time it was considered that it required ministerial intervention to get it off the ground.  That has not happened for understandable reasons.  PII likewise.  It is almost inconceivable that contractors who are responsible for the biggest element of a project can get away without having PII.  However, PII, LDI, CIRI and BCAR are not stand-alones; they all integrate and overlap.  If we walk away from this Bill saying that we have done our business and that CIRI solves all the problems, we will be neglecting our duties.  The former Minister, Mr. Hogan, and his officials at the time said BCAR would be subject to milestone reviews.  Deputy Alan Kelly initiated the first one; there will be others in future.  Likewise with this Bill.  We can say we will get it in place and make the register mandatory but we must ensure we do not say that is it, it is on the shelf and it is mandatory.

I sat on the technical assessment board, which is one of the statutory boards administering the register of architects, for three years as an architect and an RIAI nominee.  We have recommended, as Ms Kathryn Meghen said, that the balance on the boards for the CIRI Bill be amended because there should be more ministerial nominees than professional nominees.  Definitely, in my experience, on the technical assessment board - obviously, I cannot speak for all the boards - there was a very strong consumer voice, and the chair, who was a barrister, was a very strong advocate for the consumer in all the decisions made by the board.  Furthermore, the quorum is always primarily made up of the ministerial nominees on the board and, in that way, I do feel there is an independence to the board that might not be automatically seen when one considers that CIRI is administered by the Construction Industry Federation.  Those boards do have an autonomy and an independence because of their make-up and chairs and they function very well.  Like everything, we can have all the rules we want, but it is only when they are applied properly that a system functions.

Ms Spillane mentioned independence in her opening statement and has referred to it again.  My colleague, Deputy Catherine Martin of the Green Party, proposed earlier this year the establishment of a national regulator that would be independent and not under the remit of the CIF.  I want to tease that out a little with the witnesses.  Ms Pollard referred to the board and the independence of its make-up.

That is a question about the independence of the board.<\/p> <p>  I really welcome the witnesses' comments on LDI and PII and the indemnities because they have really helped us in this process to add much more value to the proposed legislation.

When it comes to self-builders, I want to reaffirm the Society of Chartered Surveyors' position that there should be no opt-out position.  Whoever is in the building game is in the building game, so the standards that apply to build someone's home should also apply to building a large commercial complex project - the same people; the same standards.

On the flip side, however, we have to look at the cost-benefit analysis.  We are looking at a construction industry with a lot of members.  Considering the volume of building we are now facing, we are probably talking about 80,000 people coming into the construction sector in the next four years, maybe more.  We have to ramp up our housing significantly so we are talking about a lot of people. The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, framework that is in place already has many of those people in its system.  It makes sense from a cost-benefit point of view to use those systems.  It is legitimate, however, to ask whether that is independent enough.  We have spoken about the board members here, and the witnesses from the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, have made some good comments on this matter.  It is very important that the board be independent and able to make decisions outside of the influence of the CIF.   There are, I think, only three CIF members on the board under the Bill as it currently stands.  More ministerial nominees might possibly be appropriate.  This is the key, however.  It is a case of looking at how much this is going to cost because that cost will eventually pass down to the consumer.  Any decision to put in place an independent regulator would have to be justified in terms of cost.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Baldwin just mentioned the legislation on self-builders brought in by the previous Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly. Like many commentators at the time, the Society of Chartered Surveyors in Ireland, SCSI, was not in favour of it.  If I were a person building a house down the country, however, and if I were looking at what my responsibilities were under legislation and signing a declaration saying that I would build my house in accordance with the building regulations, I think that I would step back from it.  There are also significant responsibilities under health and safety legislation in terms of health and safety on sites and project supervisor construction stage, PSCS.  Could a lay person put themselves in that role?  I would have to step back from it.  People have to make their own decisions, but there are a lot of responsibilities placed on them there.  If I was giving advice to someone I would tell them to be very careful because they would be opening themselves up to a lot of responsibility and possible subsequent liability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Isdell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507105800,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I agree with what the witnesses from the SCSI have said, namely, that the independence of the system would be down to the quality and number of ministerial nominees on the board.  The CIRI system will come under a lot of public scrutiny.  If, within two or three years, it is not standing up to provide robust redress for the consumer, it will have to brought into question.  However, the costs of a fully independent or State-sponsored system could be quite considerable.  The system has to be set up to be robust and there has to be a majority of ministerial or consumer nominees on the boards.<\/p> <p>  I also concur with what the SCSI has said with regard to self-builders.  There are extreme liabilities on the self-builder.  There is also the matter of long-term interest, however.  If a house built by a self-builder is subsequently sold, the assurances to the next purchaser are not as considered as they would be if it had been carried out independently.  The RIAI provides supports for members working with people engaged in the SI 365 system, but we are very concerned about a two-tier system for construction.  There is also the issue of the disclaimer.  We are all, unfortunately, instructed by our legal advisers to have disclaimers on our websites.  I have not reviewed the CIRI disclaimer but it sounds stronger than might need to be and is probably not in the public interest.  We will certainly review it but I have not read it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathryn Meghen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507105800,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I agree with the points made about the drawbacks.  The concept was that of an Irish building authority and there are obviously examples of that in the accountancy field, where something similar was established.  There is probably a trend towards consolidation in regulation rather then dispersal.  There are issues with resourcing and time span, however.  Going back to some of the points we already raised, the Minister has an opportunity here to specify who should be on both the overarching board and the sub-boards and to ensure that there is independence there.  Colleagues have already mentioned this.  There is also an opportunity to introduce accountability here through auditing by the Comptroller and Auditor General, as well as accountability to the Oireachtas and to committees such as this one.  Accountability to the courts is also embedded in the draft Bill.  Those three facets, together with public scrutiny, should give a high degree of public assurance around the independence of the register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Spillane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507105800,"counter":590,"content":"<p>An interesting statistic came up yesterday when I was giving a presentation on building control (amendment) regulations, BCAR.  Up to this point in 2017, approximately 6,000 commencing notices have been logged onto the building control management system, BCMS.  That number is made up of 6,000 building projects of varying sizes.  It could be a ten-storey office block or a 41 sq. m extension to an existing residential dwelling.  Of those 6,000 or so commencing notices, however, 4,700 came with an opt-out provision.  That means 4,700 projects where the building owner said that he or she did not need to comply with statutory compliance.  The facility to opt out came about as part of a review that none of us supported.  We have to be very careful about saying we want to police the professionals to the benefit of the layperson when, under the current system, the layperson is actually endeavouring to run away from it as quickly as he or she can.  We have to be cognisant of that.<\/p> <p>  If someone were to ring Ms Spillane and say he or she wanted to initiate a building project and needed a chartered engineer to take on the role of assigned certifier, Ms Spillane would point them to our register of 7,000 people.  First, it is impractical to ask which one of those 7,000 would she recommend.  Second, even if she did have the temerity to recommend one individual in particular, the other 6,999 would then question her relationship with the person she had just recommended.  We need to be careful of seeing a register as a panacea.  One of the commonest expressions we use in the professional classes is \"due diligence\".  We are expected to conduct our own research.  Sometimes we get paid for it, because it is the preamble to an appointment, and sometimes we simply want to find something out.  We can carry this research out colloquially, for example, by asking a person who hired her whether the house built by Ms Spillane was any good and whether she could be relied upon.  We again need to be careful here.<\/p><p> A self-builder is, by definition, only interested in one person, numero uno.  As soon as the builder becomes involved in a second project, he or she is no longer necessarily a self-builder.  The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, has pointed out, very fairly, that a mainstream contractor is expected to be on the Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI, and commit to insurance, latent defects insurance and continuing professional development etc., but the self-builder does not necessarily commit to those.  I have the same example.  I am trying to do assigned certifier work where I am, to a certain extent, limited by the fee my company wants to recover for me doing that.  The individual operating as an assigned certifier in the front room of his home does not have my corporate overheads.  We need to be careful we are not generating a race to the bottom, and this is a mechanism that will stop a race to the bottom by introducing a mandatory element.  One of the mandatory elements of this proposal is that the expertise of individuals and corporate entities trying to get on the register must stand up to scrutiny.  If a contractor states he or she can build a six-storey building but has never done it, there would be a default.  The Bill proposes a sanctioning mechanism in this regard.  I will go back to what I have said.  CIRI is not a panacea for everything and it must be operated in conjunction with the building control (amendment) regulations and appropriate due diligence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Bradley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507105800,"counter":592,"content":"<p>We are in a housing crisis and by all accounts this legislation will be quite robust and positive in terms of standards and consumer protection.

It is very positive today.  It is great to see there are 23,000 engineers because in recent years we all saw the effects of recession.  My own son has a qualification and he had to emigrate.  He is a civil engineer in Calgary in Canada.  Is there an issue in this regard?  We can speak about apprentices.  We are in a housing crisis and there is to be a change.  We had a building crisis but now we are trying to promote apprenticeships because apprentices will be needed.  Will this be crucial in future?<\/p> <p>  There is the idea that regular education, training and upskilling for all those in the construction sector is vital to ensure high standards are applied and maintained.  That is crucial.  Most local authorities contract their work.  If a company has tax clearance, it would qualify as a contractor for local authorities.  That is fine and the companies do good work as local authorities send out engineers to check it.  Who will enforce the stipulation for regular education and training upskilling?  Is it part of the remit of the bodies before us to say that a person has a certain number of courses to do in a year, two years or three years?  What will happen in this regard?  It is important.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned older buildings.  I know a case where a young family bought an older house and paid a top price for it.  It started to subside and although they had insurance, nobody would cover it.  In the end I got it sorted but it took months.  There was no accountability.  When the couple bought the house, they were the second or third buyer.  They had a mortgage and the bank would have required an engineer's inspection.  Everybody passed it.  When the house subsided, we could not get any accountability.  It was devastating for the family.  The witness spoke about indemnity and I am all for that.  The smaller print with insurance must be watched.  Insurance is crucial.  I had a case where the people had insurance and two engineers had given reports.  These are ordinary workers with a mortgage.  They are not engineers but got professionals to do their job.  They passed the building.<\/p> <p>  What is the bigger picture for this?  It is great to see there will be so many initiatives.  I have spoken to people recently who are building houses and it is great to see this important energy rating.  There is quite a high standard now with these energy ratings.  I do not know if that process works with the Department so will the witnesses explain it?  It is important that all houses built have an energy rating.<\/p> <p>  It is great to see the provisions for fire regulations as we are aware of what has happened over the years.  I want to be positive but enforcement is always the biggest issue.  When we make regulations and rules, we must ask if money is there for enforcement, who will do it and who will be accountable.  It is great to see that CIRI will tackle many of these issues.  Health and safety are so important.  We have all seen different issues with buildings over the years.  I was a councillor for 18 years and I would have seen problems that I can now say will be addressed.  I was going to ask about the hubs as well.  Will the witnesses speak about education and apprenticeships, as I have concerns about them?  It is great to see the 23,000 figure for engineers.  I know many have emigrated but I hope they will come back to Ireland.  It is important to get back on track with engineers and apprentices.

Engineers, architects, doctors, accountants - almost every professional class I am aware of - has a form of CPD.  The elephant in the room is that builders in general are not as committed to CPD as they were in times past.  Engineers Ireland recently initiated a process in-house where every time I go to a CPD event, I can log it on a website facility within Engineers Ireland.  I am obliged to generate 35 hours per year of CPD time.  That is new learning and I can claim this morning's proceedings as CPD as I am learning the procedures of this committee and imparting knowledge, I hope, as part of the process.<br\/><br\/>The idea that CPD is now an applicable education regime to builders is a major step forward.  I advise those who are outside the sector but very interested in it that the idea of embracing CPD was a voluntary gesture by the CIF when it was put in place.  It did not look to put in place an old boys' club exclusive to its own members that it could administer.  Currently, membership of CIF does not equate to membership of the CIRI board and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  One cannot get into one as a consequence being in the other.  They are two entities.  Currently there is much emphasis on the independence of CIRI.  It is independent of the CIF and all the federation does is provide the resources to administer the facility.  We do not have somebody like Mr. Hubert Fitzpatrick saying we can let one person in but not another.  It has nothing to do with it.  It is simply a convenient house for CIRI.  If we are successful in persuading the committee of our conviction, CIRI will become mandatory and we may have to address the circumstances where CIRI is currently housed.  It must be resourced one way or another.<\/p><p>As other speakers have said, it would be more appropriate and effective to have CIRI administered by people who know what it is all about.  For example, Sky television, when broadcasting football matches, now puts a referee in the studio on a Sunday or Monday night to assess the performance of other referees.  One would not bring in the club owner or the centre forward to assess the performance of the referees.  The referee assesses the performance of other referees, admittedly with the benefit of slow motion.  The idea that CIRI will be an old boys' club and that we let in whoever we want because it suits us is contrary to the sentiments, not just of the CIF but also of the other stakeholders.<\/p><p> The Senator is correct that we do have a resource problem.  It is not specific to the professionals on this side of the table.  The CIF will tell the committee it is short of critical trades, carpenters, guys to do form work and electrical work.  The challenge is that we have a shrinking resource pool and we are trying to do more faster and with more regulation.  The significance is that the stakeholders on this side of the table are committed to the challenge.  They all understand the need for transparency and acknowledge the need for interaction between the professions and the builders.  We are not running away from the table, so to speak.  The Chairman has not dragged us in here kicking and screaming.  We want to see this.  In reality, and it is nothing to do with any of the people in the room, we have been wanting it since 2012-13.  We have a challenge.<\/p><p> With respect to the difficulties with the insurance industry, it is very difficult on a case-by-case basis to ask why these people were not sorted out immediately.  Our understanding is that latent defects insurance, LDI, will provide the funds by which the matter can be addressed while the investigation into who is responsible goes on.  The difference is that people are not waiting for the investigation to close out to allocate money to the cause.  LDI would make sure that money would be available to address the remedial works while the investigation was continuing.  With respect to who is responsible for the substandard works, I would go back to the suite of ancillary certification and certification generally, the whole point of which is to provide traceability, answerability and responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Bradley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507105800,"counter":597,"content":"<p>The RIAI has had continuing professional development, CPD, for architects for the past ten, 15 or 20 years.  Last year, we brought in a new information technology, IT, system where people log it and approximately 80% of people now use that online system.  The rest bring in boxes.  The advantage of CPD is that the end users have a guarantee that the architects they work with are up to date.  Building is extremely complex.  Architects are always carrying professional indemnity, PI, insurance as are all the other professionals.  The insurance market considers a profession in its entirety when deciding on a premium.  If all the architects, engineers and, one hopes, contractors are up to date with all the legislation and technology they are working under, their insurance premiums will be kept down.  CPD is vitally important for the end user.  All the professional bodies, to my knowledge, ask their members to demonstrate that they are complying.  The same is true of CPD.<\/p> <p>  In respect of apprentices, one of the problems for architects and architectural technicians is that architecture has not been the most sustainable of careers over the past 15 or 20 years.  Very few parents would have been encouraging their children to go into the trades because people within the trades have been competing with people who have no qualifications.

When we consider all the investment required for infrastructure in the near future, we can see that we will reach a critical point where we will not have the skills available.  Engineers Ireland has a region in Australia and New Zealand, members all over the world and a jobs desk.

They have to be recognised as an important component.  They have to sit alongside other professions.  The way the Apprenticeship Council works is very positive.  There are several engineering related apprenticeships coming on stream which we have supported.  It is important for professional bodies, such as Engineers Ireland, to be there for people who go through the apprenticeship route between levels 6 and 9, very highly qualified individuals, to continue their professional development and contribute to the industry.

I will stand corrected if my numbers are wrong but under the current CIRI system, senior management and supervisors are required to undertake 40 hours of CPD annually.  Going down through levels of management it goes from 40 hours per annum to 20 hours per annum.  There is an expectation that general operatives would undertake ten hours of CPD annually.  It is fundamental.<\/p> <p>  In respect of fire safety, it is important that the committee recognises that historically much fire stopping would have been undertaken by unskilled labour.  That is a high-risk area.  It is unskilled, uneducated and unregistered.  CIRI will move to regulate that and ensure that the people who undertake that work in future do so correctly and that they are provided with opportunities for CPD.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned someone with a subsidence issue.  In our statement we reaffirm the view that the current latent defects insurance model in the market has improved but I suspect in the instance the Senator gives that, going back some years, there were so many exclusions, the LDI was not worth the paper it was written on.  We want to see greater change.  I would encourage the committee to bring the key stakeholders in the insurance industry back and ask how their products have changed and what exclusions now exist.  They have taken big steps to try to capture many of the workmanship issues that arise in every job.  There will always be workmanship issues in every job that will give rise to claims being made against an insurance company providing LDI.  That is accepted.

I welcome the professionalism and the presentation that I have heard here today.  I wish to stress that my following comments do not relate to anyone present.<\/p><p>My first question is a generic one that has already been asked.  I refer to who is and who is not a builder.  In other words, who registers?  I have talked to a few people who are involved in the Dublin chapter of the Institute of Clerks of Works.  I sought their views on some of the issues mentioned in the legislation, and specifically, section 5(4) that states: &quot;Entry on the register shall be open to Builders.&quot;  Who is a builder?  Individual builders must register.  As already mentioned, what about individuals who work for a building contractor?  These are persons who are primarily responsible for the building works and usually operate in isolation from the person named in the registration.  The principals of large contractors rarely visit sites and if they do it is in the capacity of supervising the carrying out of any works.  Let us say site staff have executive powers.  In terms of how the works are carried out, to whatever standard but not required, will this give large builders a loophole that those with executive powers can then avoid?  I am talking about foremen, site agents, managers, contract managers and health and safety specialists.  Is there an issue around this matter?  I refer to requiring the registration of people who are not builders, and I do not know how a builder is defined, but I mean people who carry out acts.<\/p><p>An interesting comment was made earlier.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned that if something is wrong in a house if it was not caused by Johnny then it must have been done by Peter, but the arbitrator will say one must go after Peter and not Johnny.  Would it helpful to define the level of work that a person carries out on a building site?  Should we identify him or her as a builder for the purposes of the Act?<\/p><p>I welcome the continual professional development that is clearly taking place.  I shall outline a related matter that has been brought to my attention.  Let us say I have been disqualified for whatever reason but readmitted to the register.  What requirements are on me, let us say for the previous two years, to show that I have a specific additional amount of continual professional development done in that period?  The CPD may even relate to the reason I was disqualified in the first place.  Should we insert an extra requirement to cover such instances?<\/p><p>The code of conduct does not mention ethics.  I do not think that ethics were mentioned in the Bill.  Can the delegations answer my query?  It would be good if ethics were mentioned.<\/p><p>My next query is about the requirement for the board to publish investigations and decisions.  I suggest that the information is published quarterly thus ensuring there are regular updates.<\/p><p>I wish to make two more points, one of which has already been discussed.  I refer to instances where an individual is not a builder.  Section 3(2) states:<\/p><blockquote>This Act shall not apply to: (a) building works carried out solely and exclusively by an owner or an occupier involving the construction of a new single dwelling on a single unit development or the extension.<\/blockquote> <p>My point is that such people are exempt but a contractor is not.  Should we restrict the exemption so that it does not apply to a person who wants to build a dwelling?  Can the witnesses qualify the exemption?  Would it make sense to restrict the exemption?  A person might be able to build an extension or a bathroom but he or she might not have the capacity or knowledge to build an actual dwelling.  A person who is not competent enough to build a dwelling can carry on because he or she is not deemed to be a builder for the purposes of the Act.<\/p><p>My last point is the most important to me.  Notwithstanding all us great and good people sitting here with our wisdom, knowledge and professionalism, I can bring everyone to a house in Drogheda, County Louth, that was completed for a local authority in the past couple of years.  The tenant of this house complained to me about a problem.  Then we discovered that there is rising damp not through the walls but in some of the internal walls.  A member of the family has a disability.  We discovered there was no damp-proof course when we got the local authority, after some months, to excavate around the outside of the five-bedroom house.  Without doubt, the lack of a damp-proof course provides there are still cowboy builders.  What can the tenant do?  Notwithstanding all of the issues that have changed, houses are still being built without a proper damp-proof course and it has taken six months for the tenant to be offered alternative accommodation.  We lodged a freedom of information application with the local authority.  The reply did not show any report whatsoever in relation to the missing damp-proof course.  What do the witnesses think of the matter?  I know it has nothing to do with them.  I want to know what the hell is going on because I am concerned about the matter. <\/p><p>My next query is more for politicians than the professionals present.  Let us say a council tenant finds himself in that situation.  Due to the fact that he is a tenant, did not buy the house, and does not have specific knowledge or access to information, how does he vindicate his rights?  In the context of the lady and her family that I mentioned, she approached me because I am a Deputy, then I contacted the council and she eventually got an offer of alternative accommodation this week.  How can such people vindicate their rights?  Can the lady I mentioned, or somebody on her behalf, complain to professional bodies?  The problem with the house happened under the council's watch.  This is what is going to happen in the new phase of all of these thousands of houses that are coming.  How do we police the matter?  I have written dozens of letters and held loads of meetings about the matter.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#M00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1507105800,"counter":604,"content":"<p>That is what this is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#M00400","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1507105800,"counter":605,"content":"<p>That is what I have said.

We are always going to get poor workmanship but it is about how to minimise poor workmanship and then provide consumer protection so that if people are affected by poor workmanship, they have recourse to remedies.  Inspections and supervision are very much part of that.  In respect of defining the roles, I know BCAR has very closely defined the role of the engineer, architect and the surveyor in terms of assigned certifier and design certifier.  Going back to the Deputy's very good question about what defines a builder, we need to have very strict definitions of what a builder does and what the builder's role is under BCAR.  I would imagine that because a local authority tenant does not own the house, it may not have latent defects insurance, LDI, or access to a product like LDI.  Then the local authority should have that in place.  The length of term within which that a local authority or any landlord must act to identify and resolve problems is probably a bit beyond the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill 2017.

I am also aware of the mica situation in the Donegal-Mayo area and the difficulties experienced by people in that regard.  The Deputy's question about who is and is not a builder is a very good one.  It is an area where we need a very careful definition.  As the Deputy said, there is a difference between main contractors and sub-contractors.  As an architect, my employees come under my professional indemnity insurance that I hold for the practice.  If one of my employees is signing off on the work, they must be a registered architect and comply with all the CPD requirements of that in terms of their experience, skills and knowledge and keep up to date.  While a building contracting company may be a registered building company, there must be some way of identifying the persons within that company who hold the responsibility for signing off at the various stages.<\/p> <p>  Senator Murnane O'Connor asked how CPD is enforced.  CPD is enforced by the registration body.  If registered members are not complying with CPD, they come before the professional conduct committee, which can impose sanctions.  In very severe scenarios, individuals could be struck off.  CPD comes under the code of conduct.  In our organisation, ethics come under the code of conduct and that is how they are dealt with.  Everybody must follow the code of conduct.  I agree that a publication of decisions needs to be done in a timely manner and be fully open and transparent.  <\/p> <p>  I know the question about self-building was answered earlier so I do not want to rehash it too much.  We need very strict restrictions around self-building which, again, are in the interests of the consumer.  From what I have heard, people who engage a local person to build an extension or dwelling for them have run into incredible difficulties because in many of those instances, people are building those houses and extensions out of cash flow - cash or income coming in - and they get to the stage where they need to borrow money to complete the work.  An area with which I am familiar where there are many unfinished dwellings results from the fact that people have gone to a lending institution to borrow money to complete a dwelling only to find that the lending institution will not lend them the money because they do not have appropriate professionals looking after their build.  Those people have got themselves into a very difficult situation where they have expended a huge amount of money to get so far and cannot go any further.  This is not necessarily because of anything bad; it results from a genuine belief that they were doing the right thing so there needs to be a very strong public information campaign by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to explain to the consumer in very clear and simple terms why BCAR is there and why these regulations are there.  They are there to protect them.  They are not there to cost money or be more onerous.  They are there in the long run to make sure that people have houses that are worth the amount they spent on them and that they can sell on because everybody will need to sell their house at some stage.  Not everybody passes down a house through a family forever.  It is not down to lending institutions or a firm of solicitors to have control over halting a build because of lack of understanding of BCAR and its intention.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017100400002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Carole Pollard"},{"type":"speech","time":1507105800,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I appreciate it is not Ms Pollard's area but who vindicates the rights of a tenant in such a house, regardless of whether or not they are a local authority tenant?

From a layman's perspective, there is a perception that a main building contractor is like a general building contractor whereas my opinion is that the very large main building contractors we see around the city are, in essence, providing management contracting services and have staff who complement that expertise, whether they are engineers, project managers or site managers.  In essence, they are not really designed to undertake construction work.  They are not like a general building contractor.  Someone could not hand them a hammer and ask them to do some work.  I am sure they would make an attempt at it but really they are there because of their expertise in terms of management or their background, whether it is engineering or whatever it might be.  It is stated in the Bill under section 5 that the Minister may prescribe regulations to divide the register in such different divisions of categories of registered members and class of work as may determined necessary and appropriate from time to time.  All of us around this table recognise that there are lots of people involved in the construction of projects.  As I said earlier, my hope is that when CIRI comes in, those subdivisions recognise all of the necessary elements to bring a building together and that we do not just allow a situation to arise where one building contractor is given the title &quot;building contractor&quot; and we are back to square one.  We must recognise that in essence, its job is management contracting.  It is there to provide a service and has any number of subcontractors that support it in its endeavours in terms of doing the work.<br\/><br\/>In respect of fire safety, it is really important that in those subcategories, there is a division for fire sealing and fire stopping.  The situation regarding the house mentioned by Deputy O'Dowd is very regrettable.  I know for a fact that if it was being built under BCAR, there would have been checks and measures in place whereby an engineer and architect would have come to inspect that element of the work at a specific stage.

The body may say that if one has been excluded from the register or if there is an issue in the past, then there is an additional requirement on him or her regarding continuing professional development.

I am accompanied by my officials, Mr. Brendan Eiffe and Ms Anne O&rsquo;Farrell.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of the motions is to seek Oireachtas approval for Ireland to opt into an EU regulation amending Regulation (EU) 2016\/794, generally referred to as the Europol regulation, for the purposes of establishing a European travel information and authorisation system, ETIAS, for the Schengen area.  The regulation provides for the allocation of new functions to Europol in connection with ETIAS.  The legal basis of the measure is Article 88(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which empowers the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, by means of regulations to determine Europol&rsquo;s structure, operation, field of action and tasks.<\/p> <p>  It is useful to be absolutely clear that the regulation in question is binding on all participating EU member states with the exception of Ireland and the UK.  In the case of Ireland and the UK, the regulation falls under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  The amending regulation, therefore, requires the approval of the Oireachtas under Article 29.4.7&deg; of the Constitution to opt into the measure.  The committee may wish to note that Ireland previously opted into the Europol regulation this new regulation amends.  The Europol regulation came into effect on 1 May 2017.  Had Ireland not opted into that regulation, it would have been required to leave the Europol system.<\/p> <p>  The Europol regulation defines Europol&rsquo;s role, enhances the supply of information by member states to it, reinforces the data protection regime applicable to Europol and improves its governance structures.  Before going into some detail about ETIAS, I want to emphasise that the system has no implications for Ireland.  Irish citizens will not be required to use it.  It will not affect Irish citizens travelling to the Schengen area or other EU citizens coming to Ireland.  ETIAS only impinges on this State because Ireland opted into the substantive Europol regulation and is a member of that organisation.  Accordingly, Ireland must be consulted on any changes which may occur from time to time to that regulation.<\/p> <p>  Following recent terrorist attacks and the migration crisis which has impacted on many regions of the world, including our own, strengthening the EU&rsquo;s external borders has been one of the measures targeted to ensure internal security and to preserve freedom of movement in the Schengen area.  Currently, nationals of around 60 countries worldwide do not need a visa to enter the EU.  However, there is currently a lack of information related to such third-country nationals arriving at Schengen external borders.  Numerous states in the Schengen area have witnessed significant movements of people arising from the migration crisis.  At the same time, there have been horrific terrorist atrocities in several major European cities.<\/p> <p>  I am by no means conflating these two issues.  It is notable that those responsible for terrorist attacks generally do not come from third countries.  However, I am drawing attention to the two issues to highlight the public safety concerns among citizens in the countries of mainland Europe whose borders are open.  They want to feel better protected by their governments and by the EU.  This regulation is part of a response to this.  Unlike the advance transfer of detailed information required for the visa application procedure of visa-obliged travellers, no such advance information is required about visa-exempt nationals arriving at Schengen external borders.  This means that border guards need to make a decision on allowing or refusing access to the Schengen area without prior knowledge of any security, migration or public health risks associated with persons not requiring a visa.  When the ETIAS commences, this category of traveller will have to apply for travel authorisation through the system prior to undertaking their journey.<\/p> <p>  All information gathered by the system will be done in full respect of fundamental rights and under data protection legislation.  The proposal follows similar models already existing in Canada, Australia and the USA, among others.  As the EU&rsquo;s law enforcement agency, Europol&rsquo;s mission is to support the member states in preventing and combatting all forms of serious international crime and terrorism.  Its role is to help achieve a safer Europe for the benefit of all EU citizens by supporting law enforcement authorities through the exchange and analysis of criminal intelligence.<\/p> <p>  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are seconded to Europol and are represented on its management board.  Europol also assists An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in operational matters when required.  Europol plays a key part in Europe&rsquo;s response to the current terrorism threat and has been central to several counter-terrorism initiatives in recent times.  Alongside the threat of terrorism, which can often have a transnational dimension, members will be fully aware that those who engage in serious and organised crime in this jurisdiction frequently operate on an international basis.  Our engagement in Europol is, therefore, of immense value in keeping our people safe and tackling serious crime.<\/p> <p>  While this particular regulation refers to the Schengen zone only, the reason it has come before the Houses is because of our engagement in Europol.  This regulation amends Articles 4 and 21 of the Europol regulation.  Article 4, which sets out the functions of Europol, is now amended to provide that Europol will be charged with the development and hosting of an ETIAS watch list, the provision of information related to terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences to this watch list, and the provision of opinions following consultation requests by the ETIAS national units.<\/p><p>Article 21 of the Europol regulation, which currently allows limited access by Eurojust and the European Anti- Fraud Office to Europol data on a \"hit, no hit\" basis, is amended to further permit access by the European Border and Coastguard Agency on the same basis.  The agency will only be permitted access to Europol data that is relevant to its mandate.  In addition, access will be restricted to seeking information relating to persons who are suspected of having committed, taken part in or been convicted of criminal offences for which Europol has competence or persons regarding whom there are factual indications or reasonable grounds to believe that they will commit criminal offences.  Any subsequent sharing of substantive information must be done in accordance with the Europol regulation and any conditions set by the provider of the information.  <\/p><p> The aim of ETIAS is to enhance security in the Schengen region with a view to ensuring the safety of individuals travelling through the area, many of whom are citizens of this State.  I think the members of the committee will agree that any enhancement of security in the Schengen area is likely to have a positive impact on the security of the EU generally.  <\/p><p> A decision by Ireland to opt into the measure would be seen as a demonstration of Ireland's continued commitment to the effective functioning of Europol and the wider security of the EU.  The regulation was drafted specifically to facilitate the opting in of Ireland and the UK . A decision not to opt in will not prevent the expansion of Europol's role where ETIAS is concerned but may result in a diminished role for Ireland within the Europol system.  This would not be desirable and indeed could be harmful to our capacities to keep our people safe and continue our role in combating organised crime.  <\/p><p> I believe it is essential that Ireland contributes to Europe's fight against organised crime and terrorism.  Playing a full and active part in Europol is a key part of this process.  Our participation in Europol is vital to our national interest and we look forward to continuing to playing an active role with the agency.  I hope, therefore, that the committee will support the motion to exercise Ireland's opt-in to this proposal having regard to the points I have raised or submitted here this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#A00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":660,"content":"<p>If members would like to like to make comment or ask any questions, it is open to them to do so.

There has been no full comprehensive impact assessment of ETIAS and this is just another rush job.  There are potential implications regarding the right to privacy and the right to data protection.  Organisations like the European Agency for Fundamental Rights have huge concerns about this and that the materials will be used for racial profiling.  This seems to be what it is being set up for - let us be clear about it - and saying \"ah sure look, no Irish people are going to be affected by that\" is not a good enough reason for us to join up.  There are many dangers in terms of data protection against a backdrop of more global incidences of hacking.  At best, it is a massive waste of money and, at worst, it is an exercise in further surveillance and racial profiling and I do not think there is any benefit for us in joining.

The concern that has most exercised members of the committee appears to be the implications or otherwise of the withdrawal of our nearest neighbour, the UK, from the EU.  It has always been the case that Ireland and the UK co-operate closely on immigration matters, particularly those relating to our common travel area.  This arrangement is unique in the EU and it is fair and reasonable to suggest that this will continue.  Indeed we will continue to strengthen our co-operation, notwithstanding the imminent withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  Hopefully, our common travel arrangements will be fully protected.  The indications from the negotiations to date are to that effect.  Both the Irish and UK Governments are on record as saying that our commitment to ensuring that there is no return to what has been called hard borders on the island on the Ireland continues.<\/p><p>There are excellent relations, which will continue at political and official level on enhancing the operation of the common travel area.  We are committed to this continuing.  The amended regulation will take effect from 2020.  At that stage we will have a clearer picture on the matter of the withdrawal of the UK from the Union.<\/p><p> In respect of the concerns of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on the matter of data, as this particular amendment has no implication for Ireland, our data protection or data retention regime will not change.  There is the European data protection supervisor, that being the competent authority, with which we have already agreed to engage in the matter of our engagement with Europol, and this will not change.  I will be happy to keep the committee further advised in the event of there being any issues of concern as raised by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  The European travel information and authorisation system applies to non-visa required third-party states.

We fully recognise that we need to change.  We need to change our culture.  We need to provide our people with better training, resources and systems.  We need to provide a better police service to the public.  We have commenced a major programme of reforms to deliver those changes and they are currently being accelerated.  In making those necessary changes, it is also vital that we continue to protect and support communities, and while we appreciate the scale of the problems we face, improvements have been made and we still enjoy the trust of the vast majority of the people. <\/p> <p>  Our public attitude survey shows that the number of victims of crime has fallen in the past year, victim satisfaction has improved, fear of crime is down, and satisfaction with the service we provide is up.  In addition, recent activity against organised crime has resulted in many lives being saved, major arrests being made, and large quantities of drugs and firearms taken off our streets.  These results are a tribute to the great work done by our people, Garda members, civilians and reserves, throughout the country every day.  <\/p> <p>  I will now address the reports by Assistant Garda Commissioner Michael O&rsquo;Sullivan into issues surrounding the fixed charge processing system, FCPS, and mandatory alcohol and intoxicant testing, MAT-MIT, checkpoints.  These reports found major failings in how we handled both issues over a significant period.  When the former Garda Commissioner was here with the committee in March, she apologised for those failures and I reiterate that apology.  The reports identified unacceptable failures in our systems, processes, internal oversight, supervision, and management.  As Assistant Garda Commissioner O&rsquo;Sullivan wrote, this reflects poorly on the professionalism of the organisation. <\/p> <p>  We fully acknowledge the damage this has done to public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  All of us in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must now take responsibility to change our systems, practices, behaviours and culture so these issues cannot happen again and confidence is rebuilt.  It is a collective issue and can only be fixed from the top down and the bottom up. <\/p> <p>  In relation to the FCPS and people being incorrectly penalised, we are examining all fixed charge penalty notices issued since 2006.  We have completed 99% of that work.  We have written to 11,924 persons who we identified as people whose cases must be appealed.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is working with the Courts Service to ensure all wrongful convictions are appealed.<\/p> <p>  In July 2017, we brought 67 test appeal cases before the Dublin Circuit Court to be heard by the President of the Circuit Court.  All of the cases were successfully appealed and the Court Service is in the process of updating the records of those concerned and returning fines paid.  A further 3,800 are scheduled to be heard in Circuit Courts in December 2017.  All the recommendations in Assistant Garda Commissioner O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s report in relation to the FCPS are being implemented either internally or through an existing interdepartmental working group. <\/p> <p>  On the issue of MAT-MIT checkpoints, a number of measures have been taken to address the deficiencies highlighted.  A change to PULSE in August 2017 means that only essential data is now collected.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety has commenced a tender process for new Dr&auml;ger devices which will improve recording and new and improved training methods are being developed.  We have also adopted a new approach to roads policing, including the introduction of a roads policing bureau, which will assist in this area by strengthening governance. <\/p> <p>  In addition, checkpoint incidents identified in Assistant Garda Commissioner O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s report that were associated with implausible breath test data have been referred to each of the regional assistant commissioners for further examination.  This process is being overseen by the assistant commissioner in charge of roads policing.  We are also awaiting the report by Crowe Horwath for the Policing Authority and should it identify any additional issues, they will be addressed. <\/p> <p>  The decision to remove a child from their parents or guardians under section 12 of the Child Care Act is never taken lightly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Following recommendations contained in the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report into the two incidents of the removal of Roma children from their families by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, known as the Logan report, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engaged the services of Professor Geoffrey Shannon to conduct an independent audit of the exercise by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991.  Professor Shannon&rsquo;s comprehensive and detailed report was published on 29 May 2017.  All the findings were accepted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  While Professor Shannon&rsquo;s report highlights important issues in relation to training, PULSE data and inter-agency working that need to be addressed, most critically it did not find any abuse of section 12 by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, nor did it find any evidence of racial profiling.  As Professor Shannon wrote, &ldquo;the overwhelming finding in this audit is that Garda members commit great efforts to treating children sensitively and compassionately when a child has been removed under Section 12&rdquo;.    <\/p> <p>  Since the report&rsquo;s launch on 29 May 2017, we have begun to adopt the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  An implementation plan has been developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that all the recommendations are progressed.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to work closely with Professor Shannon to ensure implementation of his recommendations and we have already liaised with him on several occasions on this issue.  The newly established national child protection unit at the Garda national protective services bureau is leading out on progressing the recommendations.  Professor Shannon has also accepted our invitation to assist and participate in future child protection training for Garda members.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in co-operation with Tusla, is in the process of developing a model of inter-agency working which will meet the standards expressed in the report. <\/p> <p>  I want to give the committee my commitment as acting Garda Commissioner to ensuring the protection and support of communities while introducing the necessary changes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I and my management team look forward to engaging with the committee in a constructive and positive manner on these and other issues with the joint focus of improving the service An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides every day that protects and supports communities throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I thank the acting Garda Commissioner.

I want to echo what Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in said in his opening remarks that it is important always to realise and remember that the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are out every day, often putting themselves at risk, to enforce the law, and keep us safe as a community and society.  In looking at what are major failings, and this committee will do so with the acting Garda Commissioner and his management team in some detail, it is important to keep in mind that it is the same garda&iacute; who have failed us who are putting their lives at risk and have reversed the situation in some of the main areas of crime, particularly in tackling the gangland scourge of recent years.<\/p> <p>  The heart of why the acting Garda Commissioner is before the committee, and why his predecessor was here, is that what happened is totally unacceptable.  The falsification of data by any organisation is wrong; the falsification of data by the State's custodians of law and order is therefore doubly wrong.  I appreciate the work done by the assistant Garda Commissioner in the investigation of this and some of the practices it has demonstrated, but I will focus on one particular aspect of this although not in a \"gotcha\" sense.  I recognise the comments by the chairperson of the Policing Authority.<\/p> <p>  The Garda report and the acting Garda Commissioner's comments referred to the falsification of data being so obvious that there will be further investigation into the actions conducted at a divisional level, but this poses a direct problem.  The members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through their representatives, the Garda Representative Association, GRA, are effectively accusing the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of having been responsible for causing this.  Ironically, because they did not state this at the beginning, they are saying that much of this increased falsification came about because of a culture or pressure to raise the figures.  How does Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in propose to deal with a situation whereby management is trying to investigate the matter and then engage in disciplinary measures arising from that, where those who maybe disciplined believe that the ones disciplining them are the ones responsible?<\/p><p>What actions does Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in propose to take if it does transpire to be the case - I want to be careful in how I phrase this - that, in the words of the Policing Authority's chairperson, there is an indication that, although it might not have been a direct instruction, there was an implied culture that this needed to be falsified by substantially more senior people with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na than the front-line garda&iacute; taking out the tests?<\/p><p> I cannot see how this process of investigating and drilling down the line will work.  I accept that rank and file garda&iacute; participated in this.  They had to, given that it happened across the country.  However, I am sorry to say that the real failure was a management one, and not just of an individual manager in an area.  It was a complete cultural and management failure to deliver a proper system.  That is what needs to be changed.  That is what Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, his team and the ongoing review of the Garda need to do.  If the GRA's accusation is correct, how does Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in propose to deal with the issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#D00400","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I will start with the Deputy's last comment.  We have already taken action in respect of the GRA's comments.  We have asked Assistant Garda Commissioner O'Sullivan to seek any evidence, including names of people, so that we can establish an evidence trail, go to those people and get their versions of what is being put out there, that being, management was in some way putting pressure on front-line members.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's opening comments were right - it is unacceptable.  However, a distinction is to be drawn with the MAT checkpoints, which are in statute with the purpose of giving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the means to play its part in reducing road deaths.  I would be surprised if any manager in charge of a district or division did not ask and direct everyone under his or her control to engage fully with that process in terms of the enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts.  That is the manager's duty.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the taking of breath samples where the falsification may have occurred, however, there is no evidence to suggest that anyone at management level asked people to falsify records.  Of course managers would have put pressure on their people to ensure that they maintained acceptable levels of enforcement across our lifesaver offences, which include drunk driving.<\/p> <p>  Assistant Garda Commissioner O'Sullivan has gone back out and addressed the issue raised by the GRA.  If the committee wishes, he can speak in more detail about his findings in that regard and whether there was pressure from management to falsify records, which is a different contention from the one that managers were just doing their duty and ensuring that the laws of the land were being enforced by the people who had been given the job to do so.<\/p> <p>  We play a significant part in the enforcement aspect of the three Es, which include enforcement and education.  We play a significant part in the education process as well.  The final E is engineering, in which we also have a part, in that we meet local authorities on a regular basis to ensure that, where we see blackspots emerging, we can let them know about the number of accidents happening there.  With all of that combined, there was a consistent reduction in the number of road deaths during the period covered by the report, that being, from 2006 onwards.  Assistant Garda Commissioner Finn can give the committee the relevant details.  It shows that all of the components together were having the right impact, namely, reducing the number of fatalities on our roads.  As a backdrop to that, however, and where there is supporting evidence of wrongdoing by any member at any rank, I fully accept that people have to be held accountable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":688,"content":"<p>I will follow up on Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in's answer.  There is a problem with it.  He stated that management in the Garda, particularly at divisional level, was applying pressure to ensure that enforcement took place in the form of conducting the tests to deal with the scourge of drink driving.  One of two problems stems from that.  Either management accepted reports from subordinates that were blatantly false and had such a poor management structure in place that it could not pick up on just how false those reports were, or it turned a blind eye to how false they were or everyone was in agreement.  I acknowledge Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in's point that the figures were decreasing, but it is not credible that a senior management that knew what it was doing within a proper management structure - I keep referring to it as \"management\" rather than \"Garda officers\" or whatever - could believe that this level of activity was taking place when there could not have been enough hours in the day, cars on the road at certain places or drivers to stop.<\/p> <p>  It took months for this situation to come out, and then the Garda investigated and reverted to us.  Members of the Oireachtas and members of the public are being asked to believe one of two things.  Either management was so inept that it could not work within its own structures to figure out what was happening or garda&iacute; actively colluded together to do it.  Either scenario is an awful outcome.  It is difficult to believe that rank and file garda&iacute; continued doing this for so long and it was not picked up on without there being some type of a nod-and-a-wink culture or one that turned a blind eye.

I agree that there was a poor management structure.  There is no doubt that it played a critical part.  I will focus on management structures for a moment.  There were divisions that did not have chief superintendents during the period due to the cutbacks.  There were divisions that did not have divisional traffic inspectors.  There were regions that did not have regional traffic superintendents.  The traffic bureau had no dedicated assistant commissioner from 2008 to 2017.  It had seven chief superintendents who stepped in and out alongside their various other functions.  There was no superintendent in charge of operations at the Garda national traffic bureau, GNTB, from 2008 to 2017.  Many of the issues in question were highlighted in previous reports by the inspectorate, including in 2008, but those reports were not implemented because of the period of austerity.<\/p> <p>  Management was one factor in this situation.  Education was another.  There was no training or continuing professional development, CPD, from 2008 onwards in the areas covered by these two reports.<\/p> <p>  As to the suggestion that there was no education or awareness, there was an awareness that MAT checkpoints were a critical point of the lifesaver strategy.<\/p><p>There was no awareness that the recording of breath tests was a measurable outcome.  We found that, across the ranks and associations and all the way up to the top, there was no awareness of the breath test tab on PULSE incidents, where breath tests were recorded.  Consequently, there was no supervision of the data, no measurement and no attention paid to them across the divisions.  It was not any part of any performance management, promotion or career advancement process.  It simply sat there until the issue arose.  I agree that this was poor management but that is the situation in which the organisation found itself at that particular time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":692,"content":"<p>I was fairly happy with the comments until this point but I have a real problem now.

I am sorry but the assistant commissioner's answer is unacceptable.  He started by saying that there was a cutback here and a cutback there and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not have this.  He said garda&iacute; were not really aware of the number of breath tests being carried out or that they were part of something which they monitored.  If nobody was aware of any of that, it is very funny that, instead of not recording it or recording little or no information, everybody decided - very conveniently - to record massive increases in the numbers, which suited themselves and a narrative that flattered the activity level of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was a very self-serving mistake, regardless of who was in place or the lack of management.  Mr. O'Sullivan said he was not aware that it was quantifiable but people did not simply record a zero entry while telling their boss they had been out doing the tests for an hour; they made up an enlarged figure that made everybody look good.  It only takes one or two managers in any place to have some integrity and, when they see something careering off the rails, to call a halt.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is subjected to a lot of criticism but that was not the case in Dr. Shannon's report and when the force does things well it deserves to be commended on it.  One of the most extraordinary powers this State has is the ability to take a child away from its parents and Dr. Shannon says that garda&iacute; performed that role admirably and with sensitivity.<\/p> <p>  Am I correct that the assistant commissioner's report cannot definitively conclude what the reason was for 1.4 million breath tests that were on the PULSE system but did not happen?

I also acknowledge the work of Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan in what was a comprehensive report.  As Deputy Brophy has said, it is important that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality recognises and acknowledges the great work done across all levels of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Reference was made to the public attitudes survey and it is mainly positive.  It is important that this is mentioned because it is difficult in a process of change when one has issues such as this to deal with.  I reiterate and echo the comments made by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon about the sensitive and compassionate use of section 12.  While changes can be made, one of my concerns when this committee engaged with Dr. Shannon was that sometimes, when there is an excessive analysis of this, there could be a reluctance to use section 12.  It is important that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to have confidence in using section 12.  It has been found that garda&iacute; have been using it appropriately.  Tusla also needs to address some of its issues in respect of not following through and giving feedback to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when they are dealing with particular matters.<\/p> <p>  I shall now turn to the breath test issue.  In his report, Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan referred to the over-ambitious scheduling of mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, checkpoints with local management as a factor in some Garda members inflating breath test figures.  Mr. O'Sullivan's report states, \"This examination has found that by failing to review the capacity to carry out the number of ... checkpoints which were being set down for front line members, management were intentionally or inadvertently applying pressure and that this was a contributory cause which lead to the discrepancy between the PULSE and Dr&auml;ger breath test figures.\"  Does this give some weight to the Garda Representative Association, GRA, line that there was some element of pressure?  Why does Mr. O'Sullivan feel that management made over-ambitious scheduling of checkpoints?  Will Mr. O'Sullivan tell the committee what was the reason or rationale behind that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#G00900","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":717,"content":"<p>The rationale is included in the executive summary; while the outcome was undesirable the focus of management appears to have been the persistent detection of intoxicated drivers and the saving of lives.  There is no doubt in my mind that this was the focus of all the Garda divisions.  The focus was on the enforcement of drink-driving legislation and saving lives.  We know that this was achieved in many divisions across the country at the time.<\/p> <p>  I will wait for the Policing Authority independent report to come out, but there was a sense that if ten checkpoints were scheduled, five might be done.   If 20 were scheduled then there was a good chance that ten might be done.  I do not agree with this.  I believe we would have been far better off organising two checkpoints to be done and ensuring that the two were done.  It was a perception, certainly from the Garda members to whom I spoke and the GRA representatives, that they felt by having so many checkpoints scheduled, garda&iacute; felt under pressure to achieve the checkpoints and ensure they were done.  At this point I have no evidence of it but in some instances it may have resulted in numbers being entered on PULSE for breath tests that were not completed.  At all times, in everything I found, the genuine aim was to ensure that MAT checkpoints, which are legislated for, were scheduled - as the acting Garda Commissioner has said - to detect drink-driving and save lives on the roads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":718,"content":"<p>In his overview, Mr. O'Sullivan said how under section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, MAT checkpoints were introduced and how during the period pre-2009 most MAT checkpoints were not electronically recorded and that some local managers developed a practice of recording these under the generic category, which I believe we addressed these before, of \"Attention and Complaints\".  This outlines that there was no process of data collection or recording.  How did the Road Safety Authority, RSA, then publish figures for breath-tested MATs for 2007 and 2008?  The RSA said there was 489,029 tests in 2007 and 563,115 tests in 2008.

Back then we did not have the IT systems to support it and it was based on the reports we got in from the divisions around the country.

The superintendent had to make out the schedule in advance.  If he or she said there would be just two for the night and the first was not completed for operational reasons, there would be other checkpoints to give the garda&iacute; some options.  Perhaps it was an over-ambitious scheduling, but those checkpoints had to be scheduled and authorised legally before they could be conducted.

As I said, 3,800 have indicated that they wish us to pursue it.  There are many people we have not managed to contact.  We initially wrote to them by registered post.  The letters have now been sent to local Garda stations for efforts to be made to contact them.  We have tracked down almost 1,500 people by chasing up the letters and going door to door to ask whether people have moved house and, if so, ascertain a subsequent address for them.

She would not be surprised if civil actions were to ensue in several cases.  However, she also stated she was not aware of a process having been begun by the Garda to deal with the matter.

We learn more as we move on and as the environment changes we may have to re-prioritise.  That is part and parcel of every major programme of reform.  We have to ensure that the critical enablers that will allow us deliver on the overall programme are put in place as soon as possible and that includes the civilianisation, the skilled resources coming into the organisation to allow Garda members work on the front line and to take on additional jobs to get us through this phase and to get our own people, who would be employees of this organisation to a level of skill such that they can, once our reforms have been delivered, deliver the ordinary continuing change scheme in a professional and efficient manner.

Last week at Committee of Public Accounts, I said that the programme for Government contained a commitment on the reopening of six Garda stations on a pilot basis.  That came to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was then a matter for us, based on our knowledge and professional opinion, to decide where these things might happen, based on the high level criteria that came with the correspondence from the Department.  Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll did that work and he can explain in detail how he approached coming to a conclusion on where those six stations might be.  That is a matter for me as acting Commissioner to recommend.  It is a matter for the Commissioner of the day to decide where those stations are and to recommend them to Government.  Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll can give more detail on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":766,"content":"<p>This process commenced with a letter from the then Minister for Justice and Equality to the Commissioner asking the Commissioner to identify six stations for reopening.  It set down particular criteria: a rural and urban inclusion and premises that remain in State ownership.  The first task was to identify which stations remain in State ownership and that involved interaction with the Office of Public Works, OPW.  A significant number of stations had been sold and those remaining I examined in detail.  In the Dublin Metropolitan Region, DMR, there were only four available to consider.  That made the task in Dublin easier than elsewhere in the country.  The acting Commissioner, when he appeared before Committee of Public Accounts, stressed the importance of local involvement in this decision making and I engaged with the assistant commissioners in the regions seeking their input and asking them to engage with relevant stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  There is a situation in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na such that of the commissioners who were serving on the day I was promoted in May of last year only one remains.  All the others have been appointed since that date.  I engaged with particular assistant commissioners at an early stage but there was a change in management and in Cork every chief superintendent had changed.  I went back and sought an input from the new management team in the southern region and as recently as 19 September I received a response from that region which differs from responses I received earlier from a different management team.  The emphasis is on ensuring that there is a local input, that I am not the one who is choosing a station in Donegal or west Cork or wherever.<\/p> <p>  On the basis of the criteria given to us, it was obvious that Stepaside would be number one of the four.  I suggested that if there was to be a second one it would be Rush but there were criteria for circumstances where there would be two stations chosen in Dublin.  The second station cannot be considered as a definite decision until such time as the other stations around the country have been identified.  I expect that I will be able to conclude the work I am doing within the next two weeks.  I can say categorically that no person has come to me asking that a specific station be opened.  I have sight of all the parliamentary questions put by various public representatives about stations to be reopened.  I stated earlier that I believed I would have the report completed on an earlier date.  The then Minister for Justice and Equality in concluding the letter to the Commissioner asked to be kept informed of current developments and she and the current Minister for Justice and Equality have sought that information.<\/p><p>I have advised them that it has taken me longer than expected; that I have sought additional information from the various regions and all of that will be given in detail in the final report.<\/p><p> In the interim report I have stated that I believe caution should be exercised in terms of the use of crime statistics as a significant indicator of where a Garda station would be built or opened, because on that basis alone, one would open a station on one day and close it a month later and open up a different station in the following week.  There has been a greater emphasis on population.  I have also emphasised that there is a need to consider that in certain locations in this country at any particular time there is a temporary population, which far exceeds the population of an area, whether that be at Dublin Airport, which has 30 million people passing through it, or Dublin Port, or a college environment.  I have suggested other criteria that perhaps should be taken into consideration when reaching a conclusion.  In any event I will submit a final report to the acting Commissioner in the next two weeks, in which there will be recommendations in respect of six stations.  It will be a matter for the acting Commissioner to decide which stations will be opened and to inform the Minister of that decision and the timeline involved.  That will be determined following additional consultation with the OPW on the expense and level of work required in advance to bring a station into operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":768,"content":"<p>I thank Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll.

As that is not the case, I have opted not to ask the questions in other areas.  Be that as it may, the information we received and the engagement has been extremely useful.  I have always contended that we should consider mobile Garda stations in areas such as seaside resorts.  For example some 1.5 million people visit the Cliffs of Moher every year and the Garda station in Lahinch was closed.

In 2014, at the height of the scandals into fixed charge notices when the public eye was focused on the issue, the Garda Inspectorate issued a report, yet the Garda is only now looking at it three years later.  Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan states in his report that, in his view, one of the reasons for the problems was the lack of senior staff at the Garda National Traffic Bureau during the period in question.  The GNTB did not have a designated assistant commissioner in this period during which seven different chief superintendents were assigned to it.  This returns us to the issue of responsibility.  Who is responsible for the turnover of management in this area and the failure to fulfil roles.  I ask the assistant commissioner to address the point that an assistant commissioner for organisational development and strategic planning was in place during that timeframe.  Assistant Commissioner Jack Nolan performed this role between 2012 and 2015.

When I pointed out that there was an assistant commissioner in place who had this specific brief in his portfolio, the assistant Commissioner stated the situation was a little disjointed.  This links to the other point in his report that the PULSE bulletins issued to ordinary garda&iacute; contained extensive and confusing information.

That is the question to which we keep returning.<\/p> <p>  I will now address mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, because I am conscious of time.<\/p><p>The first point in that regard is that there appears to be a writing out of the involvement of the Medical Bureau for Road Safety in this from the narrative.  While it is true that there was correspondence from the RSA in 2014 relating to the breath test issue, it took over a year for the Garda to begin an investigation into the matters.  Throughout that time the Garda was involved with the medical bureau, which is responsible for this equipment.  The bureau is not mentioned in the narrative or the report at all, yet the acting Garda Commissioner tells us today, as if it is a great step forward, that one of the solutions is that the medical bureau has commenced a tender process for the new Drager devices which will improve recording.<\/p><p> Is it not the case that this process started in summer 2015 and, following detailed consultation between the medical bureau and the Garda, the Garda requested some information that it now does not want in that process?  Even though the medical bureau was ready to go with new equipment over a year ago the Garda changed the specification, which will cost considerable amounts of money.  As Professor Denis Cusack said in information we got under freedom of information, it will put back the entire process of procurement, approval, testing and ultimately the supply of the new devices for between 18 and 24 months.  A process that management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was involved in with the medical bureau to get new devices has been kicked to touch.  Despite the acting Garda Commissioner telling the committee in his introduction that a new system is coming forward as if that is great, he forgets that this was in train two years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#N01400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":804,"content":"<p>I will ask the assistant commissioner, Michael Finn, to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":805,"content":"<p>I am familiar with the process with the Medical Bureau for Road Safety.

The report basically states, \"we did the internal investigation, we are not really sure what has gone on here but there is a number of reasons that we think it might be so\".  One of the issues is that there was no awareness of why this information was being recorded.  I agree that this is a credible answer.  However, who designed that system?  In every other checkpoint operated by the Garda ordinary rank and file garda&iacute; are asked to record where an offence occurs.  They do not record the motorists who have motor tax, just the ones who do not.  What genius came up with the idea that the garda&iacute; would record the cars that went through anyway?  I agree with the witness.  Why would a garda have a problem with ringing up the information centre and saying it could have been 30 or 40?  No crime was being carried out so why would the Garda see that as falsified information?  I do not.<\/p> <p>  Is it not the case that the issue here is not breath tests at all, but checkpoints?  Deputy Brophy pointed out earlier that a garda would go out on duty and when he came back he would make up the figure when he rang the information centre, because he did not really know what the information was for.  How does the Garda know that he did go out and come back?  How does the Garda know the checkpoint was conducted?  Is it not the case that senior officers were mandated to put up a checkpoint on PULSE?  It had to be put up on the system.  If that was not carried out afterwards, it was supposed to be invalidated.  Certainly, from our experience of talking to garda&iacute;, that often did not happen.  Management should have known.  It would have known.  If the two of us were on duty in the station that night and we got a section 12 warrant and had to drive off with a child, we could not physically have been on that checkpoint that the superintendent told us to conduct.  We simply did not have the manpower resources.  How do the witnesses know that those checkpoints were cancelled?  Based on the reports, there was a pressure to carry out checkpoints.  Can the witnesses credibly tell us that all the checkpoints that are on the system were invalidated if they were not carried out?  Certainly, from our dialogue with rank and file garda&iacute; that was the unspoken pressure.  Nobody wanted to say that the checkpoints were not being carried out.  Is that not really the issue?

The answer is supervision.  It is glaringly apparent to me and from the report that supervision was absent across all the divisions in respect of MAT\/MIT checkpoints.  How do we know they were done?  We would have to go back to Deputy O'Callaghan's question.  Do we look at 502 checkpoints, go through them and listen to the recordings of the phone calls?  That would take 21 years.  The answer is supervision.  There must be adequate supervision and sergeants available at front-line level in the traffic corps and in districts, stations and divisions to supervise the checkpoints.  That is how it is done in other jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#P00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":816,"content":"<p>It is utterly shocking that to find out the Garda went to Canada and Wales yet nobody said to the superintendents in the stations: \"Listen lads, if there is a return for a checkpoint there, we might want to make sure that they were not actually doing another job at the same time as they are claiming to have done a checkpoint.\"  I am not blaming individual garda&iacute; for this.  The only way it adds up is that there was pressure, once a checkpoint went up on the system, to say that it had been done regardless of whether it had or not.  That is the only thing that makes sense.<\/p> <p>  In that context, the witness has said there was a problem with supervision.  Is it now his contention that senior management have lost all authority among the membership?  It was striking that only seven people answered Mr. O'Sullivan's survey on this issue.  By contrast, Geoffrey Shannon had 100% compliance.  Is Mr. O'Sullivan saying they have lost the trust of the membership?  In the context of his claim that this was a supervision problem, why in God's name would he now target individual garda&iacute; and accuse them of inflating breath tests when he accepts that they did not know what the information was for and had no credible idea that it could be involved in any wrongdoing because they were not reporting any crimes?

I grew up in an area where people respected the Garda, and I believe that over the last number of years the respect has decreased.   My respect for the Garda has not decreased, but from listening to many people in my constituency I believe it has gone down generally.  The damage has been done over the last number of years, and the final straw was when the fixed penalty and breath test scandals came to light.  They were very badly handled, and it is very important that it does not happen again.  We need better policing, we need changes, and we need to get the public trust and respect for the Garda back.<\/p> <p>  Acting Garda Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in stated that it is very important that this new regime starts from the top down and the bottom up.  I agree with that.  Too many people are blaming each other, and this has to stop.  We need a Commissioner who will lead from the front, will have the trust and respect of the public, and do the job.  I am a firm believer in getting it right first time.  In the last number of years we have had two or three Commissioners who did not get it right first time.  It is very important that acting Garda Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in gets the support and the resources that he needs to do his job, and I believe that he should start with a clean slate.  It is fine for him to appear before various Oireachtas committees and different organisations and be constantly battered over what happened in the past.  What happened in the past was wrong, and I know that the acting Commissioner will put a team together to sort out what happened in the past.  It is very important going forward, and to be fair to acting Garda Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in we have to give him a clean slate going forward.<\/p> <p>  It has been stated that crime is down and that drugs have been taken off the streets.  That is a good start.  I come from Dundalk in County Louth.  It has had its problems over the last number of years, and as a public representative I have a very good relationship with Superintendent Gerard Curley, who has done a fantastic job there.  I can only speak from my own experience.  I see many more garda on foot patrol, more checkpoints, and more involvement in the local community.  That means a lot to me.  <\/p> <p>  The reopening of Templemore has been a big plus.  We are getting more professional garda&iacute; on the beat.  There has been a big issue with garda&iacute; retiring, so it is good to balance the books.  We have to do something to increase the number of garda&iacute; in the force.  Too many garda&iacute; are doing clerical work at the moment, sitting behind desks.  We should increase the number of civilians working for the Garda.<\/p> <p>  As a former businessman, I would like to know what acting Garda Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in's plan is going forward.  Is he only filling the role on a temporary basis or does he actually want to be the Garda Commissioner?  Is he here for the next six, 12 or 18 months to fill the position or is he here to do the best job he can and put his name forward as the next Garda Commissioner?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#Q00200","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":834,"content":"<p>The Deputy mentioned the community in his opening remarks.  We have to return to the fact that we serve the community, in whatever capacity we hold in this organisation, whether garda, civilian or reserve.  That is our focus at all times, and that will be my focus.  Any damage to that relationship is a red flag for the organisation.  We have to give it absolute priority, because our success as a police service since the foundation of this State has been built on our relationship with the communities and the fact they have been happy to support us in doing what is an evolving and very complex job.  To the person on the front line, dealing with a local community, the work of a garda may seem very simple.  That is how it should be.  We should be present in the community, be seen, and provide support and visible reassurance to members of the public.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked me what my vision was and where I want it to go.  I want to ensure that for the time that I am leading this organisation that we do not - regardless of what changes might come about - lose that valuable tie that we always had with the community.  That is where our focus will be, through our community policing initiative, and that is a main plank of what we hope to achieve over the coming years.  The name \"community policing\" might indicate that this is some new initiative that has been taken off a shelf or out of a textbook.  It is not.  This is what we always did.  It is our default position.  We may have to vary or modify it depending on where we are, depending on whether it is an urban or rural situation, but we have to maintain our focus in that community way.  My vision for the organisation is to ensure that with all the change that is about to happen, and is in fact already happening, that we do not lose that.  It is the family silver, as it were, and is something that we cannot afford to lose.  We are the envy of many other police services worldwide, which see the manner in which we can go to our communities for that support when we need it.  I have served in every province of this country, in different capacities and different ranks, and the common thread that runs through all our work is that we have that good relationship.<\/p><p>At times it dips, of course.  There is much negativity at the moment because of all the issues that have arisen.  That has to have an impact on public confidence.  I accept that but we depend on the individual garda&iacute; at local level to ensure that local confidence is there.  If we combine all that local confidence together then nationally, the public will have confidence in the police service.  We have much to learn and we have lots to do to bolster that confidence but that is what I am setting out to do at the moment.  I made clear at the outset, on my appointment as acting Garda Commissioner, what my priorities were and they go back to my first point about community.  That is where we are - the delivery of a day-to-day service for the people of this country, supporting them and keeping them safe.  Parallel to that, we are moving on as quickly and efficiently as we can, in the context of all the help we will require, including from this committee, to ensure that we get the delivery of cultural change, investment, increased civilianisation and the return of garda&iacute; to the front line who had to come off it to do critical administrative work.  That work is needed in order to ensure that we are accountable but it does not necessarily require those with Garda powers to carry it out.  We are very ambitious in that context and thank the Government for its commitment to an increase in our civilian capacity which will be doubled over the coming years.  We have a very ambitious programme at the moment which is moving on under our chief administrative officer, who will ensure that we get delivery of those people in the fastest possible manner so that we can release garda&iacute; to the front line.  Getting people in from the college and releasing people from desk duty will increase our visibility on the front line.  A lot is happening.<\/p><p> That is my vision for the organisation while I am in charge over the coming months until such time as a replacement is found.  I have every confidence in the Policing Authority to carry out its functions in that process.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":836,"content":"<p>I believe that Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in will do a good job.

Primarily we do it through the enforcement of the Road Traffic Act.  We also do it through education.  We avail of the opportunity of press releases to inform the public of not only the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but everybody's role to be responsible and that working in partnership we can make the roads a safer place.<\/p> <p>  We have achieved that objective and there has been a considerable improvement in road safety and a considerable reduction in the number of people who have lost their lives.  We need to remember the core and key objective we were trying to achieve.  In the mid-2000s and going back way beyond that, the number of people killed and seriously injured on our roads was much higher than it is at present.  The record of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other agencies working in this area is to be commended in many respects.  From that perspective the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been well done.  As was mentioned earlier by some of the other Deputies, we have had a considerable reduction in the number of people killed on our roads.  As we sit here today, there has been a reduction in 2017 over 2016.  That is a key core objective.<\/p> <p>  We continue to focus on the enforcement of the Road Traffic Act on the key offences to save lives.  That is only part of the role.  The work that has been done has been very good and we will continue to do this.  I accept we have made mistakes along the way and that we will find areas to improve.  We will continue to do that next year, the year after and every other year.  The key objective of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was to reduce the number of road deaths and serious injuries and I think we have achieved that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Twomey"},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":893,"content":"<p>As head of the traffic bureau-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#U00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":894,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to try to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#U00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":895,"content":"<p>As head of the traffic bureau, how many times did Mr. Twomey meet representatives of the Road Safety Authority, RSA?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#U00500","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":896,"content":"<p>I may not have an exact number.

As the witnesses have mentioned, the Government gave them the criteria.  Are they comfortable with the Government dictating criteria about policing issues?  On the independent authorisation as a police force, should it not be for the witnesses to decide what stations they feel are appropriate with their own criteria?  Would Mr. O'Driscoll have been more comfortable, as an assistant commissioner, in dictating the criteria to Government and letting that inform the process of which station should be reopened, rather than garda&iacute; being told what to do?  I gave the primary school example to demonstrate how Garda management has been really framed with this.  I have great pity for members of the force that were before the Committee of Public Accounts last week.

I am not blaming the witnesses and they are obviously in a compromised position because they cannot comment on Government matters.  If this process was commenced again, would the witnesses prefer to have the discretion to set their own criteria?

I am aware of that.  When it comes to a general election, each party will go to the people and say what it would like to do about policing.  We might prefer one proposal over others but it is a matter for the people to vote the Government in.  Where we have an arrangement such as happened as a result of voting and there has to be negotiation between parties, we also realise that there is negotiation about policing issues and it is in that context that we understand that this proposal was agreed.<\/p> <p>  On our independence, there may be an element of frustration that I have not completed my report yet.  I think that is because of the independence that we have shown.  Nobody has put pressure on me.  When I have said that I am not ready yet, it has been accepted.  I have submitted interim reports.  When I decided, though nobody asked me to, that maybe other criteria could be examined, I put them in that report.  I believe it is important to include them.  Another issue I raised in it is the mobility project.  The extra funding given to us by Government for technology is going to go partly towards a mobility project which will allow access on the ground by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to databases such as PULSE without having to be in stations.  I give an example from New Zealand in that report and how that has prevented a necessity for consistent returns to stations.  We hope to go on a pilot in the near future to show just how beneficial this will be in one particular city in Ireland.  That should also be taken on board.  I will leave it to Government to examine other recommendations that I make.  It is important to note that when the six stations are chosen, there is also a programme prepared by our housing section for priority for developments of new stations and renovations of stations.  The decision has yet to be made as to where this will slot into that schedule of requirements.<\/p> <p>  I spent some years working in immigration and was hugely concerned that we did not have a Garda station appropriate to dealing with foreign nationals who, for a number of reasons, might end up in either Garda custody or interacting with us.  I made a firm recommendation related to that and mentioned it in detail in the report.  I understand that the go-ahead is now there to proceed with developing that facility at Dublin Airport which will go a long way and which I sought for many years.  I was very critical about it not existing.  I think that is, in fact, getting significant priority and will perhaps be dealt with ahead of other issues.

I am one of those people who believes it is the role of this committee to quiz, interrogate, investigate and put our views to witnesses and for them to answer our questions.  I record again that I deplore \"gotcha\" tactics in any committee or structure.  Such tactics are designed to ambush people and arrive at pre-determined outcomes.  It is also important to record the fact that the time of senior police officers, the force's top management, is very valuable.  Having to attend multiple committee meetings because they and their members are competing with each other to rehash continuously ground that has already been covered is very regrettable.  It does no service to politics or politicians.<\/p> <p>  Respectfully, I disagree completely with my colleague who questioned Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll on the last point.  All Governments of every hue have the right to express an opinion on policing and to communicate.  The Department of Justice and Equality is involved, with its Minister, in the development of policing policy.  Ultimately, that Minister has accountability.  It would be laughable if the Minister and the Department had no say.  It is farcical that political parties which spend hours talking about which post office should or should not remain open would not wish to have an opinion expressed.  The point is well made that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not to be politicised.  The assessment and view of what should be done and how, coming back from the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is a vital part of that.  However, there is also a role in the overall structure for the view of the Department and of Government.  That said, I thank the witnesses for the manner in which they have worked with us today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#W00800","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1507104000,"counter":928,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Brophy.  There is no response to that.  I have a couple of final points myself.  In his opening address, the acting Commissioner stated:<\/p><blockquote>All of us in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must now take responsibility to change our systems, practices, behaviours and culture so these issues cannot happen again and confidence is rebuilt.  It is a collective issue and can only be fixed from the top down and the bottom up.<\/blockquote> <p>That is very important.  I agree with colleagues that this is not a situation in which any of us wanted to be.  These are issues which have presented themselves, whatever their genesis, particularly the breath-testing debacle.  As someone who respects An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and has an excellent working relationship with the acting Commissioner's colleagues within my constituency and the divisional areas attaching thereto, it is very important to recognise that some of the points made here today will not wash.  They will not run.  I wish no personal disrespect to Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan, but the point he made about estimation rather than inflation is not one anyone on the committee can buy.  I cannot speak for the members but I listened to them all very carefully.  We cannot buy the notion that this was all just about estimation, which is how such incredibly inflated figures arose.  &quot;Falsification&quot; is the word we have used.  I do not think we are going to fulfil the goal of restoring confidence, to which the acting Commissioner, quite rightly, referred in his opening remarks, in any exercise that is intended to or appears to pull the engine of it all out.  I cannot buy estimation in this instance and inflation.  At the end of the day, the public belief is that there was falsification and we need to get to the kernel of that and discover what caused it.<\/p><p>Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan's report is not the final word on this.  The Policing Authority's report is yet to come.  Are there any other exercises in train or working on this?  Are there other internal reports or examinations following on from Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan's report or is it the case that we are just waiting on the report commissioned by the Policing Authority?  It is the universality of this.  If it was specific to a particular division, people might think that it could be explained in some other way.  However, this was universal.  Serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na all over the country did not just wake up and decide to report inaccurate figures on breath tests.  We need to know the facts as that is hugely important to the restoration of public confidence.  That confidence is, in turn, hugely important to the relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the people it is entrusted to serve, namely the Irish people and Irish society generally.  Can the witnesses clarify the position having regard to other reports?<\/p><p>The acting Commissioner referred to 3,800 cases scheduled to be heard in the Circuit Court in 2017.  Assistant Commissioner Finn also made reference to that.  In terms of the practicalities, are they special sittings?  What does that do and how does it impact on the already scheduled series of sittings which normally take place?<\/p><p>I refer also to PULSE and the report of Dr. Geoffrey Shannon on the exercise of functions under section 12 of the Child Care Act.  While he paid tribute to all of those garda&iacute; with whom he had worked and recognised that the highest standards were applied by individual members in the exercise of that power and authority, he was very critical of the systems in operation within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We must look at that.  While we acknowledge the excellent disposition of individual garda&iacute;, there has been a failure to address what is wrong with the system.  The circumstances and whereabouts of 31 recorded children are completely unknown according to the particular focus Dr. Shannon took.<\/p><p>Has any exercise been carried out over the period since Dr. Shannon's report was presented to the Office of the Garda Commissioner?  Has any exercise been undertaken to establish the current whereabouts of those 31 missing children?  Has an updating exercise been undertaken on the PULSE system?  Can the acting Commissioner add any additional information that might give us a sense that the importance of this report is fully appreciated and that the necessary attention is being devoted to implementing, in a speedy manner, the recommendations Dr. Shannon made?  The acting Commissioner might respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017100400002#W00900","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507104000,"counter":930,"content":"<p>Yes, and I will call on my colleagues to focus on specific points the Chairman made.

In all cases examined, the audit found appropriate restrained use of section 12.<\/p> <p>  What happened in regard to those 31 cases, and Dr. Geoffrey Shannon makes reference to the fact that he examined 500,000 PULSE records, when a member has a section 12 incident, they press a button relating to category, which says \"Child Welfare - Tusla Notification\".  They then go on to incident type and choose from a menu including \"Section 12, Child Care Act Invoked\".  In terms of \"Role of Child\", they choose \"Tusla Notification Concerning\".  He got all those records.  A discrepancy was found and 31 were not included there.  That is because, at that point in the process, a number of members picked a multiple case option or whatever.  That was because these incidents related to other incidents so 31 cases had gone into another category.  He had full details of those 31.  He included those in his overall examination and found that those 31 cases were also dealt with properly.

We are working through all the recommendations with him and ensuring that we implement them in a way that is satisfactory to him.  I have all the recommendations here in an implementation plan.  That implementation plan is examined at the overall strategy meeting I engage in with Tusla and we are ensuring that every one of those is being implemented.

As Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the committee in regard to the performance expenditure and targets of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs during the first half of 2017.<\/p><p>As members are aware, responsibility for the regional development and rural affairs functions of my Department transferred to the new Department of Rural and Community Development with effect from 27 July 2017 and my Department was renamed the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht with effect from 1 August 2017.<\/p><p>The report provided by my Department outlines details of performance and expenditure across all programme areas during the first half of 2017.  The 2017 Revised Estimates provides for a gross allocation of more than &euro;368 million for the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2017.<i><\/i>In additional, a further &euro;13.548 million in capital funding was carried over from the 2016 provision.  <\/p><p>Gross total expenditure incurred by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in the period to 30 June 2017 was &euro;143 million - this expenditure represents 39% of the overall 2017 gross allocation.  In addition, the sum of &euro;3.478 million has been expended in this period in respect of the capital carryover provision from 2016.<\/p><p>For my Department, 2017 has been a very significant year.  The heightened sense of identity, pride and goodwill generated by the very successful Ireland 2016 centenary programme has been harnessed and further developed as part of Creative Ireland - a whole-of-Government legacy initiative aligned with Culture 2025 - &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach and framed within the programme for a partnership Government.<\/p><p>The core proposition is that engagement with and participation in arts and culture drives personal and collective creativity with significant implications for individual and societal well-being and achievement.  My colleague, the Government Chief Whip and Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, and I will now speak about the highlights of each programme area during the first half of 2017.  We will commence with the arts, culture and film programme and are happy to expand later on any matter members may wish to raise.<\/p><p>In programme A, more than &euro;158 million is provided in 2017 for arts, culture and film, with a further &euro;11.548 million provided by way of capital carryover.  Total gross expenditure for programme A up to 30 June 2017 was &euro;77.621 million, that is, 49% of the 2017 programme allocation.<\/p><p>Due to the scale and complexity of once-off aspects of both the capital and current programmes, some adjustments have been made to allocations within this programme.  For example, savings have arisen in subhead A7, cultural infrastructure and development, due to a combination of outside factors, as well as in subhead A16, Cork event centre, which has not progressed as promptly as anticipated.  Sanction has been received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to use these savings to address emerging pressures in other programme areas.<\/p><p> I have already made reference to the Creative Ireland programme but I would now like to address this initiative in a little more detail.  As I have already mentioned, it is a whole-of-Government initiative, led by my Department, which places creativity at the centre of public policy.  It aims to bring an enhanced level of co-ordination, focus and leadership to existing policies and initiatives across national and local government, State agencies, the arts and culture sector, Gaeltacht and Irish language organisations.<\/p><p> Under the initiative, culture teams have been established in each local authority to promote culture and creativity and 31 local culture and creativity plans for 2018 were published in May 2017.  The inaugural Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca, a day of cultural events and programmes, was celebrated across the country on Easter Monday 2017.  A social welfare pilot programme for writers and artists was launched in June to make it easier for such individuals to access social welfare supports.<\/p><p> A number of launches are scheduled under the Creative Ireland programme for later this year, including a capital investment programme for the culture and heritage sector and a creative children programme to enable every child in Ireland to access tuition in music, drama, art and coding - this is a joint initiative with the Departments of Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p><p> The National Gallery of Ireland re-opened its doors to the public in June 2017 on completion of a &euro;30 million investment project to provide much-needed environmental upgrades and new exhibition spaces.  The public response to the new and improved spaces has been overwhelming positive, with the gallery reporting an 89% increase in visitor numbers over the period June to August 2017 compared with 2016.  The new cultural and heritage centre at the Bank of Ireland, College Green is progressing well, with a building hand over anticipated by the end of this year.  An exhibition on Seamus Heaney by the National Library of Ireland will open in the centre in 2018.  The design phase of the phased capital investment plan for the Kildare Street premises of the library is under way in partnership with the Office of Public Works, OPW.<\/p><p> I was very pleased to announce more than &euro;10 million in funding under the arts and culture capital scheme in 2017.  A total of 62 arts and culture centres across the country benefitted from funding under strands 1 and 2 of the scheme, which I announced in February, while a further 60 local arts organisations benefitted under strand 3 of the scheme, which I announced in August 2017.<\/p><p> The national cultural institutions continued to attract a large number of visitors through their doors to sample the many and varied treasures on display &mdash; total visitors in the first half of 2017 were just under 1.7 million.<\/p><p> I am happy to expand on any issues members would like to raise in respect of this programme area before proceeding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017100400002#A00500","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":949,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire.

In the end of the day the programmes of the Department have been discussed here recently as part of the Estimates process.  I am concerned that we are into the last quarter of the year and looking at what the Department did for the first seven, eight or nine months.  There is a very serious underspend in the Department, even against its profiles which themselves are skewed towards everything happening in the last three months.  Why everything happens in the last three months I will never fully comprehend.<\/p> <p>  The Minister might explain.  My understanding is that we are in a kind of no man's land as to who is whom.  When I looked for the Minister's expenditure report for September, because they have not issues the Revised Estimates volume, it encompasses both the rural and regional affairs and her own Department.  I have the Exchequer returns here.  That is because, for whatever strange reason, even though the Department of Rural and Community Development was set up on 27 July, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has not seen fit to issue Revised Estimates to go with it.  I am told the total amount of capital for the year that the Minister had was &euro;119 million starting.  The Minister profiled that &euro;62 million of that would be spent by the end of September but, in reality, only &euro;38 million of that capital was spent, which is an underspend of &euro;25 million.  Most of this relates to regional and rural affairs.  I have been saying from the beginning of the year that the Department, when it was under Deputy Humphreys' control, would underspend its budget on the capital side and there were great howls of denial about that.  As the year goes on, it gets worse and worse.  For example, &euro;12 million is provided in the Estimate for town and village renewal.  Not one project has yet been sanctioned.  The Minister cannot account for what happened after the end of July but she can account for what happened up to July.  I have it all in parliamentary questions.  There is &euro;40 million for the Leader programme.  I welcome that the Minister, Deputy Ring, has moved &euro;5 million out of it into the local improvement scheme, LIS.  I had been badgering on the record here about that for a long time.  Some &euro;11 million was spent on the administration which, for some unexplained reason, is a capital expense and &euro;6 million on projects.  Even if all of those projects were brought to fruition by the end of the year - which is very unlikely - the Minister still has a huge hole of approximately &euro;20 million.  What I am saying is that in the months we are now looking at, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, was in control of the expenditure here.  How did it arise that such a monumental underspend has occurred?<\/p> <p>  Two further developments occurred.  Some &euro;80 million was brought forward and paid to local authorities in December 2016 for work not done.  On 21 September, I got a reply to a parliamentary question stating that only 55% of that money had been spent.  I received a reply from the Minister stating that of the &euro;13 million carried forward from last year into this year, only &euro;3 million had been spent, that is, &euro;10 million had not been spent.<\/p> <p>  I will add it up for the Minister.  Of the original allocation on the capital side, irrespective of the Department it is in, and I do not care what Department because it should be on the ground, there is &euro;81 million to be spent between the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the rural side of the new Department; there is approximately &euro;10 million of the carry-forward that has not been spent and there is &euro;8 million of the funding that was given to local authorities last year but has not been spent on the ground, which adds up to &euro;99 million to be spent in three months.  All the Minister spent in nine months is &euro;38 million.  Can the Minister explain to the committee how the Department, for the second year in a row, is failing to spend its money?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017100400002#B00500","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":953,"content":"<p>First, in regard to the spend at the latter half of the year, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will be aware, a lot of work goes on during the year on projects and the bills come in during the latter half of the year.<\/p><p>That is why I do not anticipate any significant underspend in my Department in 2017.

In fairness to the people who led that project, it was in the interests of the arts in Galway.  There is no doubt that it was a well intentioned project.  I am sure that members know of some of the prominent figures who were involved in it at the time.  An application came in during 2007 and my Department committed to providing funding of &euro;2 million to the project promoter who was then Galway Picture Palace Ltd., known as Solas, towards the construction of an art house cinema on a city centre site.  The site was to be provided by Galway city council.  The original total project cost was &euro;6.1 million and construction commenced in August 2009.  The project was fraught with difficulties.  They started the project right bang in the middle of economic crash.<\/p> <p>  When I came in to the Department in 2014 I was left with a situation where a premises in the heart of Galway was unfinished.  It was a site with a huge amount of anti-social behaviour.  I visited the site and it was a shell of a building.  The decision I had to make at that stage was whether to allow this whole project to collapse or to do something about it.  I decided that it was in the best interests of everybody, including the people of Galway city, that the project should be finished and opened as a cinema, as planned.  At that stage I committed the further funding.  The project already had &euro;2 million, and that was gone.  In 2015 and 2016 I committed the &euro;990,000, almost &euro;1 million.  We worked closely with Galway City Council and the project promoters from Element Pictures who are experts at running this type of project - they also run the Light House Cinema in Smithfield, Dublin.  My Department has been working with Galway City Council to progress the project.  It is well on its way and we hope that it should be finished by January next year.  This is the plan.  There are, however, still a few issues.  The closure of the building site over a prolonged period, from 2009 until the work re-started, presented difficulties in rectifying certain design deficiencies and this may give rise to some additional costs.  The costs are being very closely monitored and will be considered by all funding partners as the project completes.  The Department has not lost any public money on the project.  There is no money lost to pursue.  There is a lean on the building to protect the taxpayers' investment.  The plan is to open it by early January.  It will be a wonderful addition to Galway, which has won the bid for European Capital of Culture 2020.  One of the issues the city needed to address was the lack of arts space.  This project will be a great addition.  It was a legacy project that I had to deal with.  I felt that it was in the best interests of everybody to proceed and to work with the different stakeholders to bring it to fruition<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017100400002#D00100","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":981,"content":"<p>The Minister said there was no State money lost but &euro;250,000 was spent knocking down a building that was built, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General's recent report with \"poor ground conditions, design inadequacies and delays due to suspension of works while the builder was on site.\"   In other words, people went ahead under a departmental partnership and built a building that was on poor grounds and with poor design.  As a result the building had to be knocked down.  There was also an overrun of funds.  The Minister said there was an overrun of some &euro;900,000.  This means that the project's own estimate of costs was not enough to cover it.  To say that there was no loss of Government funds does not square with those two pieces of information.

There is no doubt that the project was fraught with difficulties, on the site and when they did some damage to an adjoining building.  It was one thing after another.  It cost more than had originally been anticipated but I still believe that, at the end of the day, it was better to work closely with the city council to ensure the necessary checks and balances were in place.

There was also a strategic investment partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland for our national monuments and capital funding is now going into much-needed improvements in visitor facilities and interpretation at key sites.  Work on the natural environment also continues and I look forward to publishing the national biodiversity action plan tomorrow at the Botanic Gardens.  Any members of the committee who are available are welcome to attend.  <\/p> <p>  Work has been done on international compliance particularly in respect of the special areas of conservation, SACs.  It was my privilege in recent weeks to launch the living bog project in Clara Bog, which will oversee the rehabilitation of significant tranches of raised bog in the midland region.  This will be a historic year for investment by the Department in built heritage.  Over &euro;4 million, leveraging a further &euro;3 million, will be invested by the end of the year in important heritage buildings and structures.  The Department has also progressed work on a national heritage plan and I look forward to reporting to the committee on that matter in due course. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017100400002#G00500","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":1030,"content":"<p>The Moore Street campaign looms large in Dublin city.

The River Boyne, which flows from Kildare to Drogheda, is littered with internationally recognised heritage sites, including Newgrange, Slane, Tara, the Battle of the Boyne site, Monasterboice and hundreds of abbeys, raths, wells and old bridges.  It is a very well served area and one of the top ten F&aacute;ilte Ireland tours.  The area is known as the heritage capital of Ireland.  It would be useful to develop the idea of a heritage park and link the many heritage sites stretching from the source of the River Boyne to its estuary by means of a greenway.  The route would take in three counties and could become one of the great walks of Europe, with visitors spending eight or nine days traversing it and spending time in bed and breakfast accommodation, restaurants and water adventure facilities.  I ask the Minister to consider that idea.<\/p> <p>  In Canada, there is a strong focus on river parks.  This involves sterilising rivers as cities develop.  For example, as the city of Toronto has developed, the river has been left in its natural state, with parkland stretching approximately 200 m either side.  This linear park in a densely populated city is good for the natural function of the river and its heritage value.  It is also good that citizens have a green belt with a river in the middle of their city.  If there is to be significant building works here in the next three to ten years, it would be useful to consider this idea. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017100400002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":1055,"content":"<p>I agree with the Chairman on the idea of having a large heritage park with links to various sites.

When we get into the nitty-gritty, we see that no money was actually set aside for the delivery of Creative Ireland in terms of programming.  What is the Minister hoping to do in terms of setting aside actual funding for the delivery of Creative Ireland?  How much does she intend to apportion to each of the pillars, of which there are five.<\/p> <p>  The Arts in Education Charter contains lots of proposals, ambitions and actions.  What funding does the Minister intend to set aside to deliver the charter?  The local arts in education partnership is the model that is recommended in the charter.  That will involve a conversation.  I compliment the Minister on engaging with the Department of Education and Skills.  Perhaps, more importantly, the Department of Education and Skills is engaging with the Minister.  This relationship must be cemented.  If we are serious about arts in education, it is the only way it can done otherwise services will be duplicated.  What are the Minister's plans for local arts in education partnerships?  Will money be set aside for that scheme which is clearly set out in the Arts in Education Charter?<\/p> <p>  Will the Government recommit to investing in local authorities over the coming years and will it ensure that the arts budget is ring fenced as non-discretionary funds.  As the Minister and I know from being members of local authorities, they are discretionary funds and there is always a battle over how much is put into the local arts office.  It is really important that the funding is ring-fenced as non-discretionary funding.  Is the Government committed to doing that?<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to the cultural organisations and creative industries across the country that are doing so much.  In many cases, these are not being supported by the LEOs because those offices cannot provide support.   Does the Minister have plans to give them that opportunity and to see to it that the LEOs can support these organisations and industries, which create many types of employment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017100400002#K01100","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>I will first address the arts in education.  I increased resources for the Arts Council by 8%, to &euro;65 million, in 2017.  The Arts Council has, in turn, increased its funding for the children-related initiatives from &euro;3.1 million to &euro;3.7 million.  I thank Deputy Niamh Smyth for her comments.  We are working very closely with the Departments of Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs.  The teacher training scheme has been extended to provide training for the largest number of teachers this year and it has gone from six centres in 2013 to all 21 education and training centres being involved now.  That is progress.  Teachers are being trained in terms of the arts offering.  I visited Scoil &Eacute;anna in Ballybay two weeks ago and spoke to two teachers who had undergone the training and who were very happy with the training they received.  Now, however, it is about delivering for children on the ground.  This year, I have also been involved with the national arts in education day.  I met art teachers from across the country and listened to their views on pillar 1 of Creative Ireland, which is about enabling the creative potential of every child.  The feedback from them was positive.<\/p> <p>  Every local authority has been given &euro;65,000 for its Creative Ireland programme this year.  This has supported a wide variety of events, including Creative Ireland events at local level.  Many of these were targeted at children and young people.  Events such as Culture Night and Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca are also family-orientated and designed to get young people involved.  Many things are happening in that space - with the different agencies across interdepartmental lines involved - in terms of getting the right environment so that young people can access, participate in and enjoy the arts.  The next step is the Creative Children plan, which will be launched later this year.  It is the first time the three Departments have come together.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned ring-fencing arts funding within local authorities.  I accept what she is saying.  Sometimes if there is a cut in funding, the first place that gets cut is the arts budget.  I can only encourage local authorities, which, in fairness, have done a huge amount in setting up their culture teams.  The process is director-led within local authorities.  Again, it is about encouraging them to see that engagement in the arts is good for people and society.  These culture teams are set up.  By continuing to elevate the importance of the arts across the country in every local authority area, it instills in them the need to maintain those budgets but the Deputy knows that I cannot tell them to ring-fence their budgets.  That is something I cannot do.<\/p><p>Local authorities are independent in what they do.<\/p><p> On the creative industries and the local enterprise offices, LEOs, as the Deputy will know that these offices are part of local authorities.  It is for them to decide how to allocate their budgets.  While I would like to see them invest more in the creative industries, I cannot tell them what to do.  We can only encourage them and keep pointing out the benefits of investment in the arts and in the creative industries.<\/p><p> To answer the Deputy's question on the budget for Creative Ireland, I will break it down for her.  The budget was kept under review.  Some &euro;5 million was allocated for the Creative Ireland programme.  It is important to say that Creative Ireland is not involved solely with my Department, it is across all of Government.

T&aacute; an B&eacute;arla l&aacute;idir sna me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta fosta, ach sna ceantair Ghaeltachta agus lasmuigh d&oacute;ibh t&aacute; daoine ag &uacute;s&aacute;id na teanga i dt&eacute;acsanna agus ar Twitter agus Facebook, agus is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil s&eacute; n&iacute;os feice&aacute;la&iacute;.<\/p> <p>  Maidir leis na comharchumainn, cinnte go bhfuil taca&iacute;ocht de dh&iacute;th.

Sin an f&aacute;th gur thosaigh Dinny McGinley leis an phr&oacute;iseas f&aacute; dtaobh den phlean&aacute;il teanga in 2012.  Bh&iacute; mise i nGaoth Dobhair agus d'fh&oacute;gair agus lainse&aacute;il m&eacute; na ch&eacute;ad tr&iacute; phlean teanga a chl&uacute;da&iacute;onn &aacute;iteanna ar n&oacute;s Cois Fharraige, Gaoth D&oacute;bhair, an F&aacute;l Carrach, Machaire Rabhartaigh, Rann an Feirste, Loch an I&uacute;ir agus Anagaire.  Cinnte t&aacute; difear ann maidir leis na hiarratais a chur siad isteach.  Chomh maith leis sin, &aacute;fach, tr&iacute; bhliain &oacute; shin n&iacute; raibh airgead ar bith ar f&aacute;il, ach d'fh&oacute;gair m&eacute; &euro;300,000 i nGaoth Dobhair f&aacute; choinne na tr&iacute; dreamanna.  Chuala m&eacute;, cloisim agus c&iacute;m na deacrachta&iacute; f&aacute; dtaobh de sin.  An rud is m&oacute; a bh&iacute; mise ag r&aacute; ag an am n&aacute; go bhfuil bealach f&eacute;ar&aacute;ilte de dh&iacute;th fosta.  N&iacute; mhaith liom go mbeadh n&iacute;os m&oacute; airgid i gceantair amh&aacute;in n&aacute; mar at&aacute; i gceantair eile.  Sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil, ag t&uacute;s an phr&oacute;isis, suas le &euro;100,000 ann do gach plean teanga.  Amach anseo, b'fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh beala&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la ann agus go mbeidh taca&iacute;ocht &oacute; dhreamanna eile n&oacute; &oacute; ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; eile.  Amach anseo, b'fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh comhairle ann &oacute;n gcomhairle contae n&oacute; ruda&iacute; mar sin.  T&aacute; mise s&aacute;sta leis an t&uacute;s.

T&aacute; an &eacute;ileamh ag dul suas, &aacute;fach.  T&aacute; bunscoileanna agus me&aacute;nscoileanna eile ag iarraidh n&iacute;os m&oacute; airgid agus taca&iacute;ochta.  T&aacute; s&aacute;robair d&eacute;anta ag an dh&aacute; dream sa Mhumhain, agus Muintearas fosta, agus b'fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh seans eile ann amach anseo.

I am assistant director of flight operations in the IAA and I have 38 years airline experience.  My colleague, Mr. James Courtney, is manager of airline standards and he has 34 years experience in the airline business.  Together, we have over 70 years experience collectively.<\/p><p> I will outline the framework for aviation regulatory oversight in Ireland and the responsibilities of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA.  The IAA is responsible for the safety regulation of the air operations of civilian aircraft in Ireland.  We issue the air operator certificate, AOC, and the approvals to allow an airline to use its aircraft for commercial air transport.  Our agency is completely separate from the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, and it is important that the committee understands that.  However, we interface with the CAR on certain issues before we issue approvals or licensing to establish that it has completed what it must do before an AOC is issued.<\/p><p> The IAA is a semi-State agency and our primary function is to regulate civil aviation in Ireland.  We also provide the air traffic control services in Irish airspace.  We have just under 700 highly qualified staff, such as pilots, aeronautical engineers, air traffic controllers and radio officers.  We receive no funding for the primary functions we perform.  Our role in safety oversight is to oversee aircraft, aviation personnel, airports and airspace.  We also comply fully with the international and European standards set for aviation.  We are ranked one of the best in the world by outside agencies in the safety oversight of civil aviation.  I have included the International Civil Aviation Organization's chart, which shows the position the IAA has established.  This position has been established by outside agencies; it is not our own assessment.<\/p><p> With regard to the role of the safety regulator in member states, the IAA's remit is to ensure that airlines comply with EU regulations.  The airlines achieve this by implementing their policies and procedures contained in a suite of operations manuals.  These manuals must be acceptable to us.  Parts of them are approved and parts of them are just accepted.  However, it is the operating procedure of an airline that we oversee.  Each airline is entirely responsible for managing its operations through this process, which is continually updated to meet changes in the European regulations.  These happen quite frequently.  Also, the IAA, as the Irish designated safety regulator, must agree that we deem them acceptable.<\/p><p> I will outline our approach to oversight.  The IAA has a 24-month oversight audit programme in place for all its Irish airlines.  The programme combines both planned and unplanned inspections over the entire airline operator's network.  Furthermore, the IAA has daily exchanges and dialogue with the airline, monthly flight operations meetings to agree changes to its operating procedures to ensure they are compliant and annual reviews with the airline's senior management to confirm oversight and compliance.  The IAA audits are conducted to ensure regulatory compliance with European and international standards.<\/p><p> I will ask Captain Courtney to outline the flight time limitations part of our presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017100400002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":1250,"content":"<p>I will explain the flight time limitations and their history.  Flight time limitations have been in place across Europe for many years.  Historically, each member state had different flight time regulations in place so Europe tried to standardise flight time limitations across the states.  There were always differences between each member state.  For example, one of them that has come up for discussion is that Ireland had a calendar year which ran from April to March for some of our airlines while other airlines used January to December.  A number of other differences appeared in regulations so Europe wished to standardise them across the Continent.  In 2014, after many years of negotiations with many interested parties, the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, finally came up with a set of flight time regulations, known as Commission Regulation No. 83\/2014.  All countries and airlines in the member states were required to be compliant with these regulations by 18 February 2016.  All Irish airlines implemented these requirements in full and met the target date of 18 February 2016.<\/p> <p>  Obviously the flight time regulations are very detailed.  However, I will outline some of the specific requirements relating to the flight times and duty periods.  The duty period is the time a crew member is available to do a duty for the airline operator.  The regulation provides that the total duty periods to which a crew member may be assigned shall not exceed 60 hours in any seven consecutive days, 110 hours in any 14 consecutive days and 190 hours in any 28 consecutive days, spread as evenly as practicable throughout that period.  The flight time is effectively the time one is flying an aircraft, to put it broadly.  The restrictions there are that the total flight time of the sectors on which an individual crew member is assigned as an operating crew member shall not exceed 100 hours of flight time in any 28 consecutive days and, importantly, 900 hours of flight time in any calendar year.  In our case, the calendar year was April to March and in others it was January to December.  There is also an additional restriction of 1,000 hours of flight time in any 12 consecutive calendar months.  Members will see that there are many restrictions with respect to duty times and flight times.<\/p> <p>  Most other EU member states traditionally used the January to December calendar year.  We entered into discussions with EASA and the EU Commission on this subject and it came across to us that the Europeans wanted to harmonise the regulations across Europe as far as possible.  We agreed with them in 2015 and 2016 that we would get all our airlines to comply with the January to December calendar year.  We advised all our airlines that had an April to March calendar year that they would have to be compliant with the January to December calendar year, as agreed with the European Commission.<\/p> <p>  It has been suggested that an April to March calendar year gives the airline a commercial advantage.  That is absolutely not true.  The reason is that there are so many restrictions relating to the hours a pilot can operate per day, per week and per month.  There is no advantage, commercially or otherwise, to which calendar year the airline used.  The reason the EU wanted this harmonised across Europe was the free movement of pilots and cabin crew across different airlines if they wished to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017100400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Courtney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":1251,"content":"<p>I will discuss Ryanair, as ours is the agency tasked with its oversight.

The Commission for Aviation Regulation was established in 2001 under the Aviation Regulation Act 2001.  It is an independent public body under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and has a staff of 18.  With me is Mr. David Hodnett, deputy commissioner.  He is also the in-house legal expert and responsible for the licensing of ground handlers and airlines, as well as looking after customer rights.  Also present is Ms Patricia Barton who is the manager in that area.  She has many years of experience of dealing with flight cancellations in terms of what should be done, as well as the treatment of the regulation about we have been talking - Regulation (EC) 261 of 2004.  In the 13 years the regulation has been in place the commission has dealt with some significant events for passengers, including the volcanic ash crisis and the disruption caused for passengers by the 2008 radar failure at Dublin Airport.  We are, therefore, accustomed to responding to big events.  This event is significant for passengers, but it is on a lesser scale than those two events.  Assisting passengers to depart from Irish airports is our only responsibility.  Assisting Irish passengers at other airports in other member states to return to Ireland does not fall within our remit.  Such persons have to go to the enforcement body in the country concerned.  To assist departing passengers the commission has comprehensive information on rights which is available on its organisation website <i>www.aviationreg.ie<\/i>and its dedicated passenger rights website <i>www.flightrights.ie<\/i>.  Passengers can fill in complaint forms on both websites.<br\/><br\/>The European regulation establishes rights for passengers affected by flight cancellations, delays or instances of denied boarding.  The commission is the enforcement body for flights scheduled to depart from Ireland.  In the context of flight cancellations, passengers are entitled to choose between re-routing and refunding and may also be entitled to compensation and care and assistance such as the provision of meals and overnight hotel accommodation.  That is the nub of what has been happening for the last two weeks.  When Ryanair started to cancel flights, the sole focus of the commission, in line with our strategic plan, was the passenger.  There are two aspects to the air carrier obligations.  The airline must inform passengers of their rights to allow them to make an informed decision about what they want to do.  It must also practically implement and apply the regulation in favour of passengers.  I will concentrate on providing information for passengers because that is what is key.  I wanted to ensure passengers knew their rights and that the rules set out in the regulation in relation to cancellations would be applied.<br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">On<\/font><b><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> <\/font><\/b><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Friday, 15 September, Ryanair announced that it was cancelling 40 to 50 flights daily for the following six weeks, to the end of October.  The commission became aware of the cancellations through observing social media and media reports but found no clear statement on passengers&rsquo; rights to rerouting, refunding, care and assistance or compensation.  There was some reference to them, but it was not in our view substantial or prominent enough for customers to know what their rights were.Ryanair's press statements of 15 September made limited reference to passenger rights.  On that evening and over the course of that weekend my senior managers and I monitored the position continuously.  On the Saturday morning, because of our concern, we issued a public statement which was also available on our website clearly setting out the passengers' rights.  For the rest of the weekend we addressed various media queries.  <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  On the Saturday Ryanair admitted that it had &ldquo;messed up&quot;.  By the Sunday evening the commission in its actions had made it publicly clear that compensation would apply.  This was given a high profile in the media, which is what we had wanted to happened because we wanted to get access to the passengers in Ireland who did not know what to do.  In my view, it would have been difficult for passengers to be fully informed of their entitlements based on the information they had available at the time.  They needed the following questions to be answered as a matter of urgency: which flights are cancelled?  Am I affected?  What should I do next?  Should I seek a refund or a re-route without incurring significant cost which might not be recoverable from Ryanair?  What if I incur additional costs waiting for my re-routed flight?  Who will pay for the hotel bill if I am stuck?<\/font><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Do I have any right to compensation?  One of the key points we got across that weekend was that customers had the right to compensation.  Ryanair stated it had messed up.  Ours is the only organisation that told passengers that they had rights.  We are glad that we did it and it was clear to everybody what his or her entitlements were.  <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  On the same evening I considered what would be the best course of action to take to provide as much information as possible for affected passengers as soon as was possible.  My focus was not on going after Ryanair.  That was for another day.  The focus was on getting the information on rights to passengers in order that they could make a decision.  <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Every member state has its own sanctions and enforcement regime which is predicated on that country&rsquo;s legal framework.  Our powers of enforcement <\/font>are set out in section 45A of the Aviation Regulation Act 2001.  The process can take some time and that was my concern.  Given the very real and immediate needs of affected passengers, <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I considered this to be the incorrect approach to take at the time. <\/font>The power to direct an airline to take certain action is available to the commission, as it is to most regulators, but it does not need to be used if the airline instead agrees to act in that manner without the need for a direction.  That stands to reason.  Issuing a direction before giving an airline a chance to respond is premature.  Once a direction issues in these matters in Ireland, it becomes a separate legal process which may lead to litigation which in itself is not a problem.  Timing is the issue.  It may needlessly change the situation from one of collaboration to deliver a particular practical outcome in ease of the passenger which is quicker to one of conflict which is slower.  <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I felt and still feel our priority had to be assisting passengers in airports at home or abroad who were desperately seeking a solution and concluded that the best course of action was to engage with Ryanair directly for it to provide the necessary information for all passengers affected.  If it proved to be unco-operative, legal powers of enforcement were and still remain available to me. <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  On Monday, 18 September, three days after the initial publication, the senior management team met and we agreed on our next steps.  Ryanair had to immediately publish a list of all affected flights for the six week period, but it also had to specify which passengers would or would not be entitled to compensation.  We wanted clarity on that issue.<\/font><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Ryanair had to immediately contact all passengers affected and set out their rights.  Passengers should not have to worry unduly if they were not on the cancelled flights.  The commission had to further publicise the rights of passengers.  In particular, we wanted to communicate that passengers should keep all receipts because when one is claiming from Ryanair it is always best to have a receipt, as it is in the case of any other airline.  Passengers should be made aware of the claims process.<\/font><\/p><p>They should first contact Ryanair and if they did not get satisfaction, they should contact the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  The third step, which is important, was to emphasise the importance of allowing Ryanair to re-route flights rather than opting for a refund and booking with another airline.  While I do not propose to speak in detail about Regulation (EC) 261\/2004, if passengers book themselves on other flights, for example, on the following day, they may not be able to recover the cost of the flight or accommodation.  We are bound by the regulation and our only function is to apply it.  What I wanted to do was minimise the risk to passengers that they would incur additional costs.<br\/><br\/>On the same morning the commission engaged with Ryanair and emphasised the importance of getting this information out immediately.  By the close of business on the Monday, we had taken part in a number of media events to highlight the rights of passenger and Ryanair had published a list of affected flights and emailed affected passengers of their rights.  We then updated our website to provide this information for passengers. <br\/><br\/>I now turn to the text of the first wave email.  We reviewed the email Ryanair had sent to passengers, noting that the company had not sent it to the commission in advance.  It would have been our preference to have received it in advance as we could then have agreed with Ryanair appropriate wording to provide clarity for customers.  We acknowledged that Ryanair had provided information on certain aspects of the regulation, except on re-routing, which presented a problem.  In its email Ryanair stated:<\/p><blockquote>You can transfer online (free of charge) to the next alternative Ryanair flight to the same destination airport (subject to seat availability).  If you require other rerouting options to\/from different departure or destination airports or via another airport served by Ryanair... <\/blockquote><p>Ryanair was, therefore, stating passengers had Ryanair options in all circumstances.  The company seemed to be suggesting the only re-routing options were with Ryanair, which is not our understanding of the application of Regulation (EC) 261\/2004.  There has to be some leeway in that regard. <br\/><br\/>We can return to this issue when members are asking questions.  Separately, however, because we always review how airlines operate, we knew that Ryanair had a scheme in place with partnership airlines which it used to re-route passengers.  Ms Barton can discuss it in greater detail.  For the life of me, I could not understand why Ryanair would issue an email stating passengers could only use Ryanair flights when we knew that, in the background, the company was more flexible than this. <br\/><br\/>We spent most of the week in question progressing these issues.  On 21 September Ryanair provided the commission with clarification on who would be entitled to compensation.  This was very important clarification which we published on our website.  We asked Ryanair for a list of flights from Ireland for which passengers were entitled to compensation.  This was done to provide further clarification.  At first, Ryanair stated passengers would receive compensation for flights between certain dates.  However, we wanted a list of specific flights in order that we could provide clarity for passengers on the flights for which they would receive compensation.  During that week the commission internally reviewed Ryanair's re-routing policy as it was not clear at what point it would book a passenger on another airline.  With regard to &quot;re-routing under comparable transport conditions&quot;, the European Commission has indicated that the phrase &quot;comparable transport conditions&quot;  includes the possibility of re-routing with other air carriers.  The provision does not require an air carrier to provide multiple choices in the re-routing options offered.  While the airline has some room to manoeuvre in what it can do, it must include the option of using another airline. <br\/><br\/>That brings us to the second week.  On Monday, 25 September, Ryanair provided the commission with more detail on its partnership arrangement.  As I stated, we knew two years beforehand what the company was trialling and what it intended to do.  However, I wanted it to spell out what it was doing in this scenario because I could use this information once I had it in writing.  Ryanair informed the commission of its arrangement for using other airlines to re-route passengers.  It involves seven partners, namely, Aer Lingus, Vueling, CityJet, Eurowings, Jet 2, Easyjet and Norwegian.  I do not know why the company did not provide this information for passengers the previous week, but it did not do so.<br\/><br\/>Ryanair explained that if a passenger was unable to re-book online on its website, he or she could contact it and the company would check if a flight was available either with Ryanair or one of its seven partner airlines.  The company examines these issues on a case by case basis as circumstances may be different.  This approach is much more in line with the requirements of Regulation (EC) 261\/2004 than the text of the first email provided by the company.  At that point, the commission considered that Ryanair's proposal was in line with the regulation.  We then considered how best to get this information to passengers because it should not be forgotten that at that point a high percentage of passengers had already been re-routed or refunded and we did not want to add to the confusion.  I tried to work out a way of focusing the information on those intending passengers who were still making choices.  <br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, on Wednesday, 27 September, Ryanair sent another email announcing another wave of flight cancellations and a first email to the passengers affected.  The commission was not given a copy of this email in advance.  As soon as we became aware of this development, we asked for a copy of the email which was provided on the same day.  We also immediately requested from Ryanair a list of Irish flights affected because my concern is what is happening in Ireland rather than in the rest of Europe.  The company provided us with this list.  The problem with the email to passengers was that it was not accurate.  I noted that it made no reference to the recovery of incurred care and assistance costs.  I decided that all outstanding concerns had to be resolved to our full satisfaction not later than at a meeting with Ryanair on the morning of Friday, 29 September.  I know that this date has come up in correspondence from the Civil Aviation Authority, but that is a coincidence.  A meeting had been scheduled some time earlier, with different items on the agenda, but I decided to use the opportunity to clear out these items and have a meeting on one item only, namely, a resolution of this issue to our full satisfaction; otherwise we would take further action.  <br\/><br\/>On the day before the meeting the commission spent considerable time to and fro with Ryanair on the wording of the email and the text of the information provided for passengers on the Ryanair website.  We met representatives of Ryanair at the pre-arranged meeting on Friday, 29 September.  At the conclusion of the meeting Ryanair&rsquo;s final re-routing proposal and the information to be provided for passengers met the requirements of Regulation (EC) 261\/2004.  I reiterate, however, that, for the most part, this information was available, but for whatever reason it was not presented in a sufficiently clear manner to passengers before that date.<br\/><br\/>At our meeting on the morning of Friday, 29 September, Ryanair dealt with our concerns about the level of information passengers required to make an informed decision.  However, it is clear that not all passengers affected had the appropriate level of information when making decisions on what they would do when their flights were cancelled.  We had the first wave of passengers who had already made decisions followed by a further email sent to a second wave of passengers.  I strongly advise these passengers to submit their receipts as part of their claim to Ryanair because there is a good argument that if they were unaware of the options open to them and followed an option which they would not otherwise have taken, their case is worth considering.  I, therefore, ask these passengers to gather their receipts and submit them to Ryanair.<br\/><br\/>Ryanair has indicated that it will deal with claims within 28 business days and that those who want to cancel tickets will receive refunds within seven days.  If a passenger is dissatisfied with the outcome or does not receive a response within the 28-day period, he or she can make a submission, at no personal expense, to the Commission for Aviation Regulation on <i>flightrights.ie<\/i>.  Again, this only applies in the case of flights out of Ireland.  The commission is working with Ryanair on the provision of statistics to allow us to monitor the claims process.  <br\/><br\/>I reiterate that the focus of the Commission for Aviation Regulation is on protecting the passenger.  We will continue to ensure passengers are provided with correct information on their rights by engaging with Ryanair and using our website, helpline and media engagements.  We have taken out newspaper advertisements informing passengers of their rights and, depending on whether the level of claims rises or reduces, we may do this again in the coming weeks.  Where a passenger is not satisfied with Ryanair's response to a claim, the commission will investigate and, if necessary, issue directions to ensure full compliance with Regulation (EC) 261\/2004.  We will ensure our office is sufficiently resourced should we receive an increased volume of referrals.  In that regard, we are in the process of hiring additional resources.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of not commencing enforcement action, the approach I took was a matter of judgment.  I remain of the view that the best course of action over the two weeks in question was to engage directly with Ryanair with an open door.  The company needed help and every time we asked it to provide information, it gave it to us.  If its handling of this matter in terms of the claims process is not deemed to be satisfactory in the coming weeks and months, enforcement action will be taken.<br\/><br\/>I will make one further point because I have thought about it a great deal in the past two weeks.  If I had a choice, I would do exactly the same thing again.  Based on our previous experience of Ryanair, we knew what the company should have been able to do.  We had had a meeting with the company on disaster recovery and what it had told customers in the previous year.  All of this was in place.  We knew the rough bones of its re-routing options and that it had the information to inform passengers.  In short, the information was available and it is possible that Ryanair was too focused on solving its internal problem and looking inwards as opposed to looking outwards and at what it should have been telling passengers, regulators and other stakeholders.  <br\/><br\/>I thank the joint committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017100400002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Mannion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":1255,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mannion and the Irish Aviation Authority.

The key lesson is that if an airline knows an event is going to happen, the ideal thing would be for its regulatory person to tell us what is going to happen.  We would not say anything publically about it because that is a commercial decision for the airline but we would tell it what passengers need to be told and how they should be told.  It could use whatever language it wanted to do so.

Although I do not accept it, I can understand how it happened, because Ryanair was concentrating on solving the problem and took its eye off the ball when it came to passengers' rights.  A similar situation will probably not happen with any other airline operating out of Dublin.  However, we need to engage with them and put in place a structure whereby, if an airline knows something is going to happen, there are designated steps to be taken, working together with the commission.  We do not need a legislative basis for that because it is to the advantage of airlines.  If I were Ryanair, I would not want to have gone through the past two weeks in terms of giving and not giving information or giving wrong information.

On a practical level, we are happy with the resources it has put into this for now.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Ryanair's application of the regulation generally, there are multiple layers to that question.  Looking at it holistically, given the number of flights Ryanair operates and the number of passengers it carries, it actually yields a very small number of complaints under Regulation (EC) 261\/2004.  There is an inference there that, by and large, it is vindicating passenger rights under this regulation.  However, as Ms Mannion mentioned, it does come back to language.  Its language is different.  As a regulator, we take the approach that once the message conveyed and rights established by the regulation are respected in whatever Ryanair says, we are not so bothered about the tone as such.  Nonetheless, it is causing an element of confusion with the public.  The language can seem a little more terse than it actually is.  Ryanair is very much open to engagement with us on that.

This is principally directed towards Ryanair and how it announced the situation.  It acknowledged that it did not announce it in the best way.

The flights were chosen and known in advance.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the scale of the first wave, from 20 September to the end of October, 118 of those flights were to depart from Dublin.  That is the focus of the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  That list could simply have been published, which would have greatly assisted passengers in Ireland as they could have just gone down through the list.  In fact, that is what Ryanair did in respect of the second wave.  The scale of the second wave was 231 flights out of thousands.  This is about managing people's distress, really, more than anything else, to make sure that people can simply check a list and see they are not affected.  Ryanair can learn from this.  It speaks to the scale of it in Ireland, 118 flights in the first wave and 231 in the second.<\/p> <p>  There was a question as to how this is having an impact on passengers contacting the commission, which is the enforcement body.  Directly related to this in the last two weeks we have had 504 queries from the public, of which 170 were resolved over the phone, and which have now translated into just over 30 actual complaints.  That gives an idea of the scale.

I thank those who did come for making their presentations in a concise and clear manner.  This helps us in advance of our deliberations.<\/p> <p>  The IAA says it complies with international European standards and that it is the fourth in the world ranking in terms of safety standards.  How often is that reviewed and checked?  When has the league table most recently been adjudicated upon?  Its role in this matter, as I understand it, is only from a safety perspective.  Can it confirm that there was no breach of any safety regulations, be they Irish, European or worldwide regulations?<\/p> <p>  It is the IAA's role to inspect compliance with the flight time limitations.  When did Europe move to align flight time limitations?  Previously, each country had its own calendar year and then there was a move by Europe to impose an aligned calendar year across the Union.  When did that happen?  Was it only Ryanair that was operating a different calendar year in terms of April to March or were other Irish airlines operating a different calendar year prior to this EU directive?  Are all airlines now meeting that requirement and did they meet it within the timeframe stipulated by the EU?  It has been said that airlines operating on the April to March calendar are at a commercial advantage.  I think the IAA has answered that already.<\/p> <p>  It is also said that there is nearly a question mark over the safety standards of low-fare airlines.  Can the IAA, which enjoys long-standing international recognition of its competence in what it does, confirm there is no compromising of any safety standards by any of the airlines operating here?  The IAA carries out planned and unplanned inspections.  Perhaps the witnesses can tell me what kind of inspections they carry out to make sure they are happy that each airline is complying with the standards.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to the Commission for Aviation Regulation, it would appear that its counterparts in the UK have a lot more teeth and a lot more power in terms of how it has dealt with Ryanair.<\/p><p>It would appear that Ryanair went to the CAR's UK counterpart to give it information rather than face the consequences, but that does not appear to have happened in Ireland.  From the timeframe outlined by Ms Mannion, it seems that the CAR had to go looking for Ryanair's co-operation at every step along the way.  Has Ryanair a good track record of co-operating with the CAR?<\/p><p> Ms Mannion stated that this was not about going after Ryanair, but about ensuring that customers' rights were made known so that they were aware of where they could go to acquire the necessary information.  It is funny.  I was contacted a number of times - I will not say a large number of times - on the first weekend subsequent to a Facebook post that I published outlining where customers who had been affected could go to get the relevant information.  Those people would not have known where to go had I not made that post.  That is not right or fair.  Neither is it right nor fair that the CAR should be following and observing social media sites and media reports to find out what is happening.  Does Ms Mannion believe it is satisfactory that she must surf through social media to find out what is happening?<\/p><p> Surely to God there is a requirement for an airline to advise the CAR in advance.  As Ms Mannion stated, this was not some unplanned cessation of flights.  This was planned.  Does the CAR know how long in advance of the flights being suspended Ryanair knew about it?  Does Ms Mannion believe that there should be consequences for Ryanair for not pre-warning the CAR that this was about to happen?  She mentioned that Ryanair had sent an email and that she was disappointed that it had not referred the matter to the CAR first, but surely there should be a requirement on Ryanair to refer something to the CAR first, especially where there is a risk that the email will contain misinformation.  What are the consequences for an airline that issues an email that contains misinformation or, at best, does not contain all of the information that is required to help stranded passengers?  This is about ensuring that the customer's rights are not exploited and are honoured.<\/p><p> Ms Mannion also mentioned that it was not until Monday, 25 September that Ryanair made the CAR aware that it had agreed a partnership arrangement with seven airlines.  She stated that the CAR did not know why Ryanair could not have made that information available prior to that time, but it should know.  In the CAR's discussions with Ryanair, it should ask why Ryanair did not make it aware.  Are there consequences for not making the CAR aware?<\/p><p> Ms Mannion stated that it was only at the end of September, specifically 29 September, following a meeting with Ryanair that \"Ryanair's final re-routing proposal and the information to be provided to passengers met the requirements of Regulation (EC) 261\/2004\".  That was two full weeks after this situation started.  Does Ms Mannion view that as satisfactory and are there consequences for this process taking too long?<\/p><p> Perhaps Ms Mannion will correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the CAR's counterpart in the UK seems to have stronger powers in this regard.  Is my assessment right?  If so, are there additional powers or legislative amendments that we can introduce that would help the CAR to ensure that an airline is afraid or, at a minimum, respectful of the commission's position and makes it aware of all information in advance in order that the airline's customers are informed at an early stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017100400002#J00700","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":1275,"content":"<p>I welcome the contributors.

I might group a few of them together because they seem to cover the same points.  A number related to the concern that we did not find out until after the event and asked whether there was anything that we could have done about that, whether there were consequences for Ryanair for not telling us in advance and whether there should be a legal obligation on it to tell us in advance.  As far as I am aware, and correct me if I am wrong, but there is no legal obligation on Ryanair to tell us in advance of what it will do.  However, it would definitely have been to Ryanair's advantage to have let us know in advance because it would have stopped the confusion and given passengers the correct message.<\/p> <p>  This brings me to the second part of our role, namely, enforcement.  The first part is to get the information out and the second is to ensure airlines apply the rules.  If a passenger takes a claim to Ryanair and is dissatisfied with the response, the matter comes to us where flights out of Ireland are concerned.  I will carefully examine the level of information that was provided to the customer at the time he or she made a decision.  Absent information, a person is not sure what the right thing to do is, so he or she might end up doing the wrong thing.  This is part of the reason for us saying on our website that we examine situations on a case-by-case basis in that we must consider the full circumstances of each complaint that we receive.<\/p> <p>  Regarding a sanction, this could cost Ryanair additional funds because it did not provide the full information to the passenger.  Separately and at the end of the process, we will examine how well Ryanair did overall in terms of providing information and dealing with the claims made to it.  That is the next stage down.  For the past couple of weeks, our focus has been on getting information out as quickly as possible.  I am disappointed that it took until Friday, 29 September to get information out, but we did get it out.  Ideally, it should have been available on day 1, but it was not.  We did what we could.<\/p> <p>  I will address another point before I move on to the question on the Civil Aviation Authority, CAA.  While we were working under the Regulation (EC) 261\/2004 requirements, it is important to note that there were other pieces of information that we required Ryanair to give to passengers that had nothing to do with Regulation (EC) 261\/2004.<\/p><p>The first one was that on the Monday we asked it for a list of all affected flights and also for it to contact all affected passengers.  It did this.  Then on the same week, on 21 September, we asked it for information on who was covered by compensation.  It gave that to us on 21 September.  Subsequently we asked for a list of affected flights out of Ireland.  It gave that to us as well.  At the same time as trying to sort out all the information requirements for Regulation (EC) No. 261\/2004, we were also trying to get extra information for passengers.  In a sense, Ryanair was working with us on that.  It does not condone the situation it got itself into, but from me looking in, it was trying to do what it could to resolve that situation.  It might not have been as fast as we all wanted, but that is my perception.<\/p><p> I was expecting questions on the CAA because that got considerable press coverage, particularly in the second week.  On the Wednesday and Thursday, it issued its enforcement notice.  There were two letters as part of that.  A lot of space in the press was taken up with which regulatory authority was stronger and which was weaker.  I did not engage in that at all because I just wanted to get the information out to passengers.  For the first week we appeared a few times in the media.  That was just about people's rights and what they should do.  I did not want to get involved in a debate about which regulatory authority is strong and which is weak.  As to the legal aspects of it, we are strong in a regulatory sense, but there are different ways of doing things.<\/p><p> As I said at the start of the presentation, I decided not to issue a direction because there was concern that a Ryanair withdrawal to assess the direction before coming back to us would give it two weeks.  I could not take that risk because I wanted to work with it.  I was not expecting Ryanair not to work with us because I knew the information was there.  It was a case of getting it out.  It was a matter of judgment and that was the judgment I made.  The CAA made a different judgment.  Its emphasis or focus might have been slightly different from ours.<\/p><p> I wish to make a technical but important point.  Following a change in the past couple of years, responsibility in the UK for handling complaints under Regulation (EC) No. 261\/2004 is now largely a matter for independent alternative dispute resolution bodies.  They actually deal with complaints from the passengers.  For the past year or so, Ryanair has been assigned to that.  The CAA deals with the enforcement part of the regulation but does not deal with the complaints themselves.  On the other hand CAR is a one-stop shop.  We deal with the complaints and we also deal with the enforcement.  Therefore our focus was different.  I was so wired into getting information out to the passengers that I did not want to take the risk of going down the legal route.  As members will know, once we get into the legal arena, it can go either way.  While they may work with us, there is also the risk that they do not.  I could not take that risk.  In the UK, the CAA's focus was slightly different and was slightly more on enforcement.<\/p><p> In addition, without getting too technical, the circumstances were different.  Dublin has just one airport, Dublin Airport.  Therefore we do not have many concerns about transfers from this airport to another airport.  It is all Dublin Airport.  Part of the concern the CAA might have had regarding the information Ryanair was or was not providing to passengers was not a direct concern for us because we only look after passengers out of Ireland.  The characteristics of the market in the UK are different from those here.  That might have been an added complexity which might have suggested it move in one direction rather than another.<\/p><p> The last question was on whether we have sufficient powers.  I will hand over to Mr. Hodnett who will give some background on legal powers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017100400002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Mannion","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":1279,"content":"<p>Deputy Troy asked some direct questions and I would like to answer those.  Are there any consequences for Ryanair for not notifying us of the cancellation?  The answer is \"No.\"  There is no legal obligation on Ryanair to notify us that it is going to cancel flights.  The regulation was originally introduced to cover cancellations that happen at much shorter notice and would not be planned in the same way as Ryanair has announced.  It is straightforward.  There are no consequences.<\/p> <p>  On the use of legal powers, the regulator in the UK was marching under some provisions relating to the Enterprise Act 2002, a separate legal basis from what we use here.  It reached a similar direction to ours.  Potentially we could have reached exactly the same point on the same day using direction under section 45 of the Aviation Regulation Act 2001.  There is no lack of legal power there.  As the commissioner has just outlined, she decided to take a different approach and get the airline to agree with this.  There is no point in using a direction if an airline has already done what we have asked of it.  That was the position taken regarding the information.  Ryanair was giving people information at certain times regarding refunds, rerouting and so forth.  That was on its website.  Ms Mannion has explained all the steps she took to ensure that important information was put out there.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Keeffe asked about notification.  This relates to the IAA point on pilots.

If wrong information was given at any time and a customer makes a decision based on the information available to them at the time and it transpires that they made a decision that has cost them more money in the long run, the only consequence is that it will cost Ryanair more to reimburse them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017100400002#L00300","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507120200,"counter":1281,"content":"<p>A direction from the commission to an air carrier in these situations, to take the Deputy's example, would be that the carrier give the customer the correct information on his or her flight and if he or she is due moneys for reimbursement or compensation and that has not been forthcoming, to do that within a 14-day period.  That is the direction that the commission would give the airline.  If the airline thereafter fails to comply with that direction, it is possible to commence proceedings in the courts in Ireland with a view to having a fine imposed on it for breaching the regulation.<\/p> <p>  In the shorter term, if a customer believes he or she is out of pocket because he or she has not had his or her rights vindicated by the airline and he or she complains to the commission, the direction for that customer to the airline is to pay out what the customer believes to be due.  If the airline does that as a result of the direction, no further action occurs.<\/p> <p>  Separately one could take a view on the entirety of the approach, as the commissioner mentioned earlier.  The commission could take a view as to whether there was an infringement generally regarding information being given to passengers.  If the airline complies with any direction that is given by the commission, there is no further legal action because that is the legal process set out in section 45 of the Aviation Regulation Act 2001.  The process set out is the commission, if it gives a direction to the airline, is restricted to giving the airline a direction to do a particular thing, and if that is done, there is no further action.  It is only if it is not done that it becomes a court case where a fine may arise.

I believe it all kicked off on 15 September with the first announcement of the cancellation of 40 to 50 flights per day until the end of October.  Like most people, I had numerous concerns and several questions about the matter, but having listened to the responses today, I find that I have now even more questions.  I think it is fair to say, as most people believe, that if it had not been for the Civil Aviation Authority, CAA, in the United Kingdom outlining the details day by day and contacting Ryanair, Ryanair would not have come forward with the information.  The CAA took it to task, threatened it with legal action, served it with an enforcement notice and gave it a deadline by which it had to furnish passengers with information to which they had an automatic right.  If it had not been for this action by the CAA, however, Ryanair could still be playing games.  <\/p> <p>  I do not want the commissioner to take this personally, but I do not think Ryanair showed her office much respect.  I do not think it took the Commission for Aviation Regulation seriously throughout this process.  It all started on 15 September and on 18 September the regulator had to make contact with the airline.  Ryanair did not inform it about the initial cancellations.  We are not talking about two or three but about a massive number of cancellations, not all of which were flights from Dublin.  Ryanair did not extend to the Commission for Aviation Regulation the courtesy of informing it, as the regulator, of wide scale cancellations.  It prolonged the delay in giving passengers the information to which they were entitled, despite having been requested by the regulator to do so.  It also sent emails that were incorrect and it was not until the third email was sent that the regulator received the information.  We can see there, therefore, that there is a pattern of Ryanair not responding to the regulator.  If it had not been for the no-nonsense approach taken by the CAA, I believe passengers might still be in distress and operating under duress.<\/p> <p>  I found it very disappointing that the Commission for Aviation Regulation was not being forthright with the airline and was almost on the back foot from 15 September until 29 September when the CAA finally called out the airline out and Ryanair gave the information.  There was a full fortnight of to-ing and fro-ing with the regulator, with the information being drip fed.  One thing is for sure - Ryanair was certainly not taking the Commission for Aviation Regulation as seriously as it took the Civil Aviation Authority.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to no advance notice being given of flight cancellations.  The commissioner's colleague has outlined the fact that obviously the airline knew about the cancellations because they had been planned and the number of cancellations had all been worked out.  It knew which flights were due to be cancelled.  The commissioner has said there was no legal obligation on Ryanair to inform her office of the cancellations, but perhaps this is something at which we as a committee could look.  I do not believe any passenger or customer of any company ever deserves to be treated in that manner.  If the legislation needs to be looked at to give the regulator some teeth, perhaps there is some good that might come out of this fiasco.<\/p><p>Someone asked earlier if the Commissioner for Aviation Regulation did not have the same options.  The same EU regulations applied here so the same options would have been open.  I know Ms Mannion said she would have preferred to engage with Ryanair but everyone knows that Ryanair is not a company known for its consultation or continual updating with passenger information.  It deals with workers, unions and so on.  I do not know what gave Ms Mannion the impression that it was not something as serious as this and as widescale as this that did not need a firmer hand to be taken.  That was the situation that arose and dragged on for over a fortnight.  Ms Mannion said that if it was to happen again, she would do the same thing.  Passengers do not need to hear that from a regulator's office.  The commissioner needs to be more forceful, given Ryanair's history.  We saw who got results first.  Everybody is of the opinion that Ryanair did not take the commissioner seriously and had no respect for Ms Mannion's office.  The events that unfolded over the fortnight proved that.<\/p><p> The Irish Aviation Authority indicated that it was not notified of the cancellations.  There is no legal obligation on Ryanair to inform it of widespread cancellations since it is a commercial outfit.  Does that not raise questions about a company that did not feel that it was a matter of courtesy, at least, to inform the Irish Aviation Authority?  The Irish Aviation Authority has a commercial relationship with airports and airlines but it is also tasked with being a regulator and safety inspectorate, so it has a dual mandate, as far as I have read.  Is there a potential for conflict?  Is the IAA confident that all operators practise the \"Just Culture\" as defined in EU regulation, including Ryanair?  I read some notes that the committee was sent about it and the IAA alluded earlier in the meeting to individual operators managing safety concerns internally.  Are the witnesses confident in that system and, given that there may be a particular company that might discourage reporting of internal safety complaints, are they confident that those reports should be carried out internally and the IAA as an overseer should not have sight of and respond to all safety reports?  The correspondence mentions that when reports on safety issues or other matters were sent to the IAA, people got the standard response that their correspondence had been received and then received no follow-up.  What is the procedure relating to that?<\/p><p> We will have pilots in shortly.

The legal framework could be different in different countries but, speaking as a non-lawyer, regulators - at least those of us in the UK - have similar powers in issuing directions.  It comes down to a matter of judgment.  My focus was on getting information to passengers.  I did not want to take the risk that Ryanair would not engage and would sit back and reflect upon that direction.  We got certain additional information from it in that period.  We knew about the partnership agreement that was part of the rerouting policy which was in the final email that went to Ryanair's passengers on Friday morning on 25 September.  In fact, we knew about that in 2016.  The threat of legal action by the Civil Aviation Authority, CAA, did not result in this arrangement being created overnight.  That is impossible.  The arrangement was there.  It was just a case of getting Ryanair to put it down on paper.  I do not accept that because somebody waves an enforcement letter and takes a more open approach, that person is stronger.  It is a matter of judgment, I made that call and it worked.<\/p> <p>  On Ryanair not consulting, it has a track record and if one goes back, Ryanair and the Commissioner for Aviation Regulation have a long history and not a consultative one, I imagine.  In this case, I know that as soon as we started to speak to Ryanair, it knew that it had a problem.  I could see it was focused on trying to get flights sorted.  However, every time we spoke to it to try to get information, it came back to me as quickly as it could, so I do not accept that it was just fobbing us off or playing a game with us.  We worked with it, and that Friday morning was in our diary from two or three weeks previously.  The date that we and the CAA had was a coincidence.<\/p> <p>  I know I had the same legal powers as the CAA.  My first concern is not whether I am perceived as stronger or weaker because I have not publicly issued a letter or got involved in a public exchange of letters because, to me, that is not always the best way to do things.  We got the outcome we wanted.  Everyone takes their own view as to which the better approach was but that is the approach I took.  When I said I would take that approach again, I would in the same circumstances but I do not want this to happen again in future.

We find ourselves in situations where we are looking at complaints that the regulation at its inception did not necessarily envisage - exactly like this mass disruption and mass cancellation.  What would generally happen when something is an entirely new occurrence is that the enforcement bodies will have a dialogue among themselves and perhaps with the European Commission and will get their views so that we have a co-ordinated approach.

I will park the point there.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the regulators that we have before the committee this afternoon, I have listened carefully to the points that have been raised by Ms Mannion.  She puts forward argumentation to the effect that it is a question of pragmatism and not an issue of whether to take a hard line or a soft line.  The question is whether one gets results.  In fact, she has outlined her case very well.  However, I was concerned, as I always would be when I hear such a phrase from a regulator, when she said that Ryanair had taken its eye off the ball and implied that this was the root of the problem.  I put it to Ms Mannion that Ryanair did not so much take its eye off the ball as engage in a calculated and deliberate policy to maximise profits for its corporation.  I believe that it knew that it would gain financially if it did not properly advertise alternative flights and entitlements that people may have to claim compensation for hotels, meals, etc.  It seems to me that the CAA in the UK is operating on the understanding and premise that this was a calculated and deliberate policy by Ryanair and I suspect that is the basis on which it is taking a more hard-hitting approach.<\/p><p>We can take a hard line or a soft line but if our starting point is that a company has taken its eye off the ball as opposed to making a hard-headed commercial decision, then it raises a question for me about the approach being adopted by the regulator.<\/p><p> The main questions I want to ask are for the IAA and, in particular, for Mr. O'Connor.  In his previous contribution, Mr. O'Connor said he has no ambition to micromanage Ryanair or any other company.  That is a little bit of a red herring because I do not think anyone here or any other sensible person would expect him to micromanage the affairs of Ryanair.  They would expect him to have some kind of idea about what is really going on behind the scenes.  This is a real crisis and inconvenience for huge numbers of ordinary people which the IAA is there to protect.  Does the IAA have any obligation to be aware that proper crewing arrangements have been put in place?  Did it have no idea beforehand that this crisis was going to blow up?  If not, why not?  One does not have to be a micromanager to see a crisis of this scale coming.  It seems to me it has taken the IAA completely by surprise which indicates to me that we have soft touch regulation here all over again.  I put that to Mr. O'Connor for comment.<\/p><p> It has been said that the April to March holiday year, as opposed to the January to December holiday year, did not confer commercial advantage on companies that availed of it, and that included Ryanair.  There are a lot of people who work in the airline industry day to day who dispute that.  The Irish Airline Pilots' Association disputes it and I will let its representatives outline the reasons when they come to the microphone later on.  It was introduced in 2008, so why will Ryanair begin on 1 January 2018?  Why did it take ten years to bring Ryanair and others operating in Ireland into line with this?  It seems extraordinarily slow in comparison with other European countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017100400002#P02700","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":1355,"content":"<p>Would Deputy Smith like to ask any questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017100400002#Q00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":1356,"content":"<p>Yes.  As somebody who is not a member of this committee, I appreciate the opportunity to put these questions.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  My first question is for the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  Ms Mannion has been employed there since 2012.  Is she aware that in 2012, Michael O'Leary attacked the regulator for being overstaffed and overpaid and claimed that Ryanair was a victim of the agency?  If she is aware of it, what is her comment on it?  Five years ago, Mr. O'Leary saw the regulating agency as a problem, but nowadays it does not appear to be a problem for him.  The witnesses have talked about a partnership and harmonious relationship, the attempt to work with Ryanair and the attempt to solve the problem, yet there is no indication of the attempt, which is one of the commissioner's briefs, to implement and apply regulation.  There is no indication in the commissioner's tone that it is what the Commission for Aviation Regulation tries to do with Ryanair.  This is why everybody is making the comparison between it and the CAA in Britain.  The head of the CAA, Andrew Haines, has made a mark.  He had previously been accused of light touch regulation by pilots' associations and trade unions in Britain but he stands out markedly next to the record of Ms Mannion's agency by insisting that Ryanair complies with regulation and informs passengers they are entitled to be rerouted on other airlines.  Mr. Haines has said that in some discourse with Ryanair, Michael O'Leary said he will not pay for passengers to fly on other airlines and that it is against the law.  It is a regulation that passengers should know they are entitled to be rerouted on other airlines.  Ms Mannion referred to the emails Ryanair sent out and said they had to discuss it, change the language a bit and make the message a bit different.  Did she insist in that email that Ryanair point out to passengers very clearly what the British regulator forced it to point out under threat of enforcement, which is that passengers were entitled to be rerouted on other airlines?  Does she interpret that regulation differently from the CAA?<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Barry.  There has been a shocking level of light touch regulation in this country and with regard to Ryanair.  It is summed up for me by Mr. Haines when he says compliance culture in Ryanair only appears when it is forced into the courts and is otherwise wanting.  I would like Ms Mannion to comment on that.  I am not asking her to tear Mr. Haines apart but I would like her to comment on those very serious allegations by her counterpart in Britain.<\/p> <p>  One of the representatives of the Irish Aviation Authority said the issue of pilots' contracts was nothing to do with it and was for someone else.  It is very much something to do with the IAA because it has to oversee safety regulations for flights, including for the pilots, the airline, the passengers, all of us sitting here and those who may be watching proceedings.  We are very concerned that flights are run safely.  There are a number of issues here to do with the contracts of pilots which the IAA does not seem to think has anything to do with it.  It goes to the heart of the issue why, for ten years after the regulation was introduced in 2008, Ryanair did not apply it and change the annual leave year to run from January to December.  If one speaks to any trade union in the airline industry or any of the pilots associations, they will say the 900 hours that were declared safe to work in a period were being worked by Ryanair pilots between April and March.  They will say that most of those hours were being packed into the summer with hardly any hours given to pilots in the winter.  There is a big concentration of Ryanair flights in the summer period and an awful lot of them do not exist in the winter period, which is the reason for Deputy Barry's comment about the type of contract under which pilots work.  Are the witnesses aware of a London School of Economics study on pilot fatigue carried out on 7,000 pilots across Europe?  It points out that the type of contract under which pilots work, whether precarious or permanent, and how the hours were managed very much impact on the safety of the airline because pilot fatigue is a problem.  If the witnesses from the IAA are not aware of that study, I recommend they make themselves aware of it because it is a very highly recommended and comprehensive study carried out on 7,000 pilots across Europe.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is that in June 2016, Ryanair wrote to its pilots saying it would have to change the leave year around because of the regulation being imposed on it.  It is my understanding from conversations with people in Europe that it was the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, that leaned heavily on the IAA to make sure the regulation was implemented.  I would like the witnesses to comment on that.  They have spoken about discussions with the EASA but I have been told it leans quite heavily on the IAA.<\/p><p>It would seem they may have had to because after ten years, Ryanair and Aer Lingus were the only ones not applying the rule that the operation of the 900 hours had to be within the January to December leave year.  Ryanair told its pilots last June that it would apply this rule yet it went ahead and published its 2017 summer schedule.  Did it not occur to the Irish Aviation Authority at any point that there was a problem in that this airline was coming up against a deadline to apply this regulation and yet it published its 2017 summer and winter schedules and sold many flights?  Did it not wonder what would happen?  That is not micro-management.  Given the serious change the airline had to make in terms of the leave year, the authority should have been alerted automatically that a problem will arise for passengers and in terms of health and safety.  The responsibility for passengers' complaints lies with the body represented by the witnesses sitting beside the witness, but there must have been an indication somewhere along the line that these issues matter.  If they do not, then Michael O'Leary's complaint about being overpaid is fair enough.<\/p><p> I will make one other point on health and safety.  Are the witnesses aware that a secret table detailing Ryanair's tracking of pilots' fuel use was sent to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport some months ago?  Has the Minister discussed that with them?  Are they concerned that pressure might be put on pilots to fly with less fuel than would otherwise be the norm because it is more economical in that less fuel is needed to carry the weight of the fuel?  Are the witnesses aware of any complaints or petitions from pilots in Ryanair that they were concerned about being pressurised to cut down on the amount of fuel they carry?  If they were not aware of it, now that I have made them aware of it, are they concerned about that?  Does that ring alarm bells with them?  Would they be concerned, therefore, that the safety not just of the pilots in terms of the hours I spoke about and the fatigue that kicks in, but also the safety of the pilots and the passengers they carry is being compromised because of these shoddy practices?<\/p><p> I have a final question, and I am sorry for taking being slow but I have many notes with me.  The aviation authority gave Ryanair a deadline until January 2018 to get its act together yet it informed its own pilots last June that they had to do this.  The authority gave Ryanair almost two years because it had those discussions in February of 2016.  It failed to comply in a proper way and then it made a mess of it, according to Ryanair.  Does that not concern the civil aviation authority, in terms of the behaviour of this company, the impact on health and safety and the impact on the nearly 700,000 passengers who have been affected?  If Bus &Eacute;ireann or Dublin Bus unions did that, the sky would fall in, according to wider society.  It would be an awful thing to happen, but this happens because of the behaviour of a company and there is hardly a word of criticism.<\/p><p> The question of light touch regulation, backing off Ryanair and having discourse with it rather than imposing regulation on it is a problem with both authorities and I would like the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017100400002#Q00300","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":1358,"content":"<p>Before those questions are answered I want to make the point, in fairness, that in terms of Deputy Smith's allegation of light touch regulation, the facts are that the witnesses are not required to be informed.

That would have saved me more money because if fewer than 14 days notice is given of a cancellation, the airline is required to pay compensation.  Ryanair estimated the cost of that to be something in the region of &pound;25 million.

That is for somebody else to do.  To move forward on this, pilots are very well trained and responsible people.  As a body, they are highly recognised for their high standards of operation.  Also, it is laid down in the rules that if a pilot is tasked with a duty, it is the pilot's responsibility to ensure he is fully fit to take part in that duty.  That is the responsibility that I have to see, that the pilot is fully responsible.  I have not seen any trend or been notified in any way that pilots are turning up fatigued or in some other state to operate aeroplanes on behalf of any of our air operator certificate, AOC, holder-operators.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the decision, as I said, the Irish Aviation Authority was not informed.  There is no reason for Ryanair to tell us what sort of changes, be they small or large, it is making to its operation.  I know the Deputy has concerns that more than 700,000 people were involved in this.  Of course, everybody has concerns that this number of people were displaced in some form or fashion.  However, our remit is to ensure that the airline is compliant with the regulations.  We have a very robust audit programme in place to ensure that all our AOC holder-operators are fully compliant with the regulations.  The robust audit programme is based on the EU rule 965.  It is an area that is divided into eight categories ranging from the ground to the air, to training, to looking at flight time limitations etc.  I do not know what the Deputy means by \"light touch\".  I have no comment on that.  I can only advise this committee that Ryanair, about which everybody is talking, is fully complaint with all the regulations, both European and international.  I believe that the EASA in its own statement, in its report from our March audit, would go along with that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to pilot numbers, I have given the pilot numbers we have for Ryanair.  It has a standard industry ratio of over 5.2 crews per aeroplane.  That covers the early mornings, the late mornings, the standby function, the sick leave and annual leave.  Its planning of crew numbers is the industry standard.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the question on fuel and if we were aware of the list, I was aware of the list some years ago.

The regulation said that airlines had to comply with 900 hours in any calendar year.  That is how the regulation was written.  We met the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, to discuss that element of the regulation.  In our discussions with EASA and the European Commission, it became clear that they wanted to get to a situation where there was harmonisation across the board.  In the context of the free movement of people between airlines and so forth, it was advantageous that everybody would operate on a January to December calendar year.  We agreed with that.  We came back and instructed the airlines that had the April to March calendar year that they would have to become compliant.  However, having sat down with them, we realised that there was a significant amount of work involved in achieving that, particularly for the larger airlines such as Ryanair.  The airlines had from early 2016 right through to the deadline we agreed with them, namely 1 January 2018, to become compliant.  Aer Lingus became compliant on 1 January 2017.<\/p> <p>  I must make another important point.  Deputy Smith suggested that there is some advantage in having an April to March calendar year in the sense that a company can work people harder during the summer months and so forth but that is absolutely not true.  There is a limitation, which I mentioned earlier, of 100 hours of flight time in any 28 consecutive days.  That is a restriction which is in place to balance out the workload across the year.  An airline cannot suddenly overwork people during the summer period because of that restriction of 100 hours in any 28 consecutive days.  That point must be made very strongly because the argument has been made in various fora that the April to March calendar gives some advantage to airlines.  It does not have a safety implication.  Moving to the January to December calendar levels it all off and creates harmonisation across Europe, allowing pilots to transfer across Europe and so forth.  <\/p> <p>  The new regulations came into force in February 2016.  EASA came over to us with an inspection team, as part of a wide inspection.  It wanted to see how we implemented the flight time regulations that were required to be implemented by February 2016.  In March 2016, the EASA report was published.  It found that one of the main strengths of the authority was its \"well managed transition\" to the new flight and duty times, FTL, requirements.  EASA, having had discussions with us, made that statement.  The agency said that we managed the transition to the new flight and duty time requirements..

Yesterday, there was a plenary session in Strasbourg involving dozens of very irate MEPs from all over Europe.  The whole discussion was about Ryanair and how badly the transition has been managed.  Mr. Courtney might say that is Ryanair's problem but it is the Irish Aviation Authority that oversees this, so that does not add up.  Neither does it add up to say that over 28 days a pilot can only work for 100 hours because there is nothing stopping Ryanair from scheduling its pilots to work 100 hours every month from April to September, the busiest period, so that pilots work the bulk of their 900 hours in that six month period.  They could work 600 hours in that period.  There would then be another six months in which they would have to work the other 300 hours, bringing them to the maximum number of hours in a year.  What Mr. Courtney is saying does not add up in terms of proving that there is not a problem.  I asked Mr. Courtney if he was aware of the London School of Economics study of 7,000 European pilots which specifically looked at pilot fatigue, which should be of concern to him.  Pilot fatigue is certainly a matter of concern to me.  I am going to a climate change conference in Bonn in a few weeks' time and will be panicking about pilot fatigue, having studied all of this stuff.  The Irish Aviation Authority should also be panicking because it is the body overseeing this area.

We got into a debate with the IAA about how it is using its reporting systems.  I would like to read this into the record:<\/p><blockquote>The audit may also miss the fact that pilots may not use reporting system in circumstances where they have lost faith in the confidentiality or impartiality of such systems.  Low use of reporting systems might then be misinterpreted as an absence of issues to be reported, leading to potential suppression of issues of significant concern.<\/blockquote> <p>I also bring the committee's attention to page 26.  This is a letter from the IAA to IALPA in response to our complaints.  This is a phrase that is colloquially known among pilots as the &quot;God clause&quot;.  I want to read it into the record:&quot;We do not report to the individual reporter on the outcome of investigations, but we may interview him or her to obtain further information.&quot;  This is referring to a situation where the IAA believes it has an absolute right, when it receives confidential information or information of a safety nature, not to tell the reporter, the pilot or the engineer who provided the information if it is going to investigate the matter.  Even more damaging from our point of view is that it does not have to tell the individual who reported if there is an outcome to the investigation and whether it has investigated.  There is no feedback and no response.  There is nothing.  Information that is provided to the IAA goes into a black hole from which it never emerges, from our point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017100400002#X01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Evan Cullen"},{"type":"speech","time":1507120200,"counter":1440,"content":"<p>I have a difficulty.
