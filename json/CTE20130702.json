Before we consider my Department, I wish to say a few words on the EU Presidency, the outcome of which is very important to Irish agriculture.  We began the Irish Presidency of the EU in January last with ambitious and challenging objectives, namely, to deliver by the end of our Presidency a political agreement between the three EU institutions on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  I am very pleased that we have achieved both objectives.  The agreement reached last week marks an historic moment in the evolution of CAP.  This is the first occasion on which a major reform of CAP has been secured with the involvement of the European Parliament and the 27 - now 28 - member states.  The agreement was linked to the parallel negotiations taking place on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, for the next EU budget from 2014 to 2020.<\/p><p>  Under the MFF agreement, the expenditure ceiling for heading 2 - CAP - was set at &euro;373 billion.  While this represents a reduction of just over &euro;14 billion in comparison with the Commission's original proposal, heading 2 has been protected to a far greater extent than other headings.  A decision was taken that direct payments will be more equitably distributed between member states.  As a result, all members states whose level of direct payments is currently below 90% of the EU average will see one third of this gap closed by 2020.  The method of calculation used in this exercise, which was initially proposed by Ireland and which uses eligible area as the comparator, has largely protected this country's share of direct payments funding.  I will be returning to discuss the CAP with the committee in a few weeks so I will not spend much time outlining the detail involved.  I have a speaking note in which the main elements of the reform of the CAP are outlined and I can circulate it to members.  This matter is relevant to this year's Estimates, particularly in the context of the budgetary negotiations that have taken place at European level.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with some of the detail relating to the 2013 Estimate for my Department.  This year, the Department's Vote is again being presented on a strategic programme basis consistent with the high level goals set out in its statements of strategy.  We are all very much aware that the general economic situation and the position relating to the public finances require the continuation of tight budgetary discipline.  None the less, with the resources available to me I am determined to build on the progress achieved in recent years in developing the agrifood sector and, in particular, to contributing further to the future growth and prosperity the sector can achieve for Ireland, primarily through the expansion of its revenue base through growth in export earnings.<\/p><p>  The Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department in 2013 is just under &pound;1.242 billion.  This includes a sum of &euro;6 million capital savings carried over from 2012.  While this represents a reduction on the 2012 outturn of &euro;1.318 billion, I have managed to fund new schemes and programmes and secure savings in 2013.  The 2013 budget reflects a significant Exchequer commitment of support for the agrifood sector and is a recognition of the contribution which the sector is making to economic recovery and future growth.  The &euro;1.24 billion expenditure in the Department's Vote comprises some &euro;1.049 billion in current expenditure and &euro;193 million capital expenditure.  The downward budgetary movement of &euro;76 million between the 2012 outturn and 2013 Estimate reflects lower budget requirements for a number of measures, including that which relates to public sector pay.<\/p><p>  Considering the overall limit on resources, I was obliged to make difficult decisions and choices in the context of making prudent provision for essential areas, meeting maturing liabilities for grants approved in previous years and introducing reductions in expenditure in order that we might remain within the expenditure ceiling for the year.  The 2013 budget for the Department is, however, consistent with last year's in terms of priorities.  I refer here to the protection of incomes for family farms, support for small farm holdings in disadvantaged areas, providing support programmes in line with the targets of Food Harvest 2020 - in particular job creation - supporting the future of the sector through new research and development funding and investment in food safety and animal health and welfare controls, and an ongoing programme of reform within the Department aimed at continued improvement in service delivery and reducing costs.  The latter has been a priority.  When the 2013 gross Vote is combined with the &euro;1.285 billion in EU funds which is paid through my Department, the total projected expenditure for the year amounts to more than &euro;2.5 billion in public funds.  In light of the current financial situation, this represents a substantial level of support for and commitment to the agricultural, food and fisheries sectors.<\/p><p>  In addition to direct financial support for the agrifood sector, I have secured agreement for a range of taxation reliefs that would link in with the key measures being pursued under Food Harvest 2020 in respect of the growth and development of the agriculture, food and marine sectors.  The main taxation measures contained in the budget introduced by the Government in December 2012 that will benefit the sector are as follows: the retention of the general 25% rate of stock relief for all farmers and 100% stock relief for young trained farmers; a new farm restructuring initiative to allow consolidation of land parcels, with the aim of improving the overall efficiency of the combined holdings; an expansion of the foreign earnings deduction scheme, which benefits SMEs and which we have extended from the previous year, to apply where an individual spends 60 days per year developing opportunities for Ireland in certain key markets; the extension of the farm partnership scheme to sectors other than milk production partnerships, subject to state aid approval; and relief from excise duty on auto diesel for licensed road hauliers.  The last had an impact on the agriculture side.<\/p><p>  I will summarise briefly the financial allocations for this year on the basis of the four strategic programmes which are set out in the 2013 Revised Estimate.  As stated, the Revised Estimate links the resources required for the programmes with the key outputs to be achieved in 2013 and includes information on the outcomes achieved in 2012.  Programme A deals with agrifood policy, development and trade.  The funding relating to it is focused on establishing the policy framework to develop an internationally competitive, innovative and consumer focused agrifood and fishing sector. This programme involves a total expenditure estimate of &euro;341 million for 2013.<\/p><p>  Programme B deals with food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health.  The aim of this programme is to ensure the maintenance of the highest possible standards of food safety, consumer protection, animal health and welfare and fish and plant health.  This is the bedrock upon which consumer confidence in the agrifood and fisheries sectors, and in particular, our export trade, is built.  Expenditure under this heading in 2013 will amount to &euro;222 million and the targets for the programme are set out in Part III of the published Vote.  Obviously, there has been some additional expenditure in this area as a result of the horsemeat crisis earlier in the year and animal welfare concerns relating to the fodder shortage experienced in late spring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2013070200004#E00200","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372770900,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

On this issue, in terms of administration pay and non-pay, we have been making consistent reductions year after year because we were reducing the number of staff.  Not too long ago there were more than 4,000 people employed in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; it is about 3,300 now.  In terms of some of the consolidation that is taking place, particularly around regional veterinary offices throughout the country, we have gone from just under 60 down to 17.  We are trying to continue to maintain the same service but in a more efficient way.  That has happened in areas such as Clonakilty, Tipperary and now in Kerry, where staff in some cases have been reallocated within the Department but in more cases they have been reallocated to other Departments.  In the case of Tralee, we are proposing that some of the administration staff would move from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine into another Department in Killarney.  That issue has gone to the Labour Relations Commission, and I have been informed that it is finalised.<\/p><p>  In the past 18 months we have reduced staff numbers by another 300.  Obviously, there is a floor below which we cannot fall because if we do services to our clients, namely, farmers, will suffer significantly.  However, if we look at the actual performance in terms of getting payments out on time, last year was the best year ever and this year is better again.  <\/p><p>  In terms of the other support services the Department provides, I keep telling farmers that we want to try to first reduce the expenditure in terms of the cost of running the Department before we cut their schemes.  That is what we are trying to do here.  Essentially, we have knocked another &euro;6 million off the cost of administration and the running of our Department by having fewer staff and by consolidation in terms of our facilities.  The Deputy will probably see that figure reduce again because of pay agreements that are likely to be signed up to this year, which will result in further reductions in terms of the cost of pay.  We do not get any direct credit for that in terms of being able to spend it in other elements of the Department, particularly around pay savings, but in terms of costs to the Exchequer, that is from where the figures primarily come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2013070200005#F01200","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1372770900,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Would the Minister be satisfied that the service provider from the Department is not being adversely affected as a consequence of the reduction in staffing levels?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2013070200005#F01300","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1372770900,"counter":24,"content":"<p>That is a fair question.  I have told farmers that I want to hear about it if they are not getting the same level of service as they had previously.  For example, we have watched closely the moving of some of the administration staff from Clonakilty into Cork city but there is still desk space for farmers to go into Clonakilty to get advice and what they need from the Department.  In truth, I have not had any evidence to suggest there is a reduction in the quality and standard of service.  That is not to say that it is not the case.  I am just saying that the feedback I have got from farmers has not been negative.<\/p><p>  This is all about making savings here to ensure we do not have to make savings elsewhere that will cut farmers' incomes.  Ultimately, that is what we are trying to do.  Since 2008, the cost of running this Department is down by almost &euro;90 million.  That is incredible when one thinks about it, and the standard of service in the Department has probably increased in that time.  <\/p><p>  In terms of the benchmarks one might set around payments, disease control and support for farmers, the evidence I have seen would suggest that the service has improved even though we are providing it with far fewer people.  That involves many sacrifices within the Department, and I would be hugely complimentary of the management in the Department in terms of managing that change but even more complimentary of the people who have been subject to that change having to essentially restructure their lives around a different job, having to be trained to move into other Departments and so on, and all of that has been done without any industrial unrest.  We are trying to address people's concerns where possible but at the same time we have to stick with the agenda of reform so that we can keep making the savings we need to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2013070200005#F01400","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1372770900,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Pringle.

The sooner the money is spent, the better.  It allows us to plan more accurately.  This money rolls over year on year and, from an accounting point of view, is only drawn down when it is spent even though it may have been granted a number of years prior.

I cannot speak for other Departments, but our administration costs represent approximately 6.7% of expenditure in our Department, which I confidently suggest is one of the lowest percentages in the Government.  Most of our expenditure is on schemes and managing direct payments.  The administration cost of running our Department in the past five or six years has decreased by nearly &euro;90 million.  We are performing well in trying to do more with less, which is what every Department and business must do.<\/p><p>  When examining the figures, the one for IT jumped out at me as well.  I asked Mr. Carroll about it.  Last year, our IT section spent less than it would normally spend, leading to an increase this year.  A part of the increase is linked with preparing for the new CAP.  A new system is also required for rolling out the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS.  IT is an important part of our infrastructure.  If we get it wrong, we have a collapse in the system of payments, enforcement, mapping, etc., leading to a fine from the Commission.  We spend a great deal of money on IT in terms of human resources and the systems being built.  Most of our Department's IT is in-house whereas many other countries outsource both it and payment agencies.  It is to our benefit that we have decided not to outsource because, in a crisis situation, we manage IT and the relevant skills.  This work is expensive but, given the &euro;1.6 billion or so in expenditure for which IT is responsible, the figure outlined is a reasonable one.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is right, in that we give Teagasc a great deal of money, approximately &euro;111 million per year, to run an advisory service, an educational service through agricultural colleges and, perhaps most importantly, a research and development programme that needs to make Ireland a world leader in terms of technology and innovation.  Regardless of whether this is done in collaboration with universities or at facilities such as Moorepark, which specialises in dairy, or whether it involves the other beef, grass or management research being conducted, Teagasc is a major player in financing research and development in the food and nutrition sector.  This is how it should be.<\/p><p>  I do not tell Teagasc how to spend money, but it has an obligation to be consistent with Government policy on the food industry and on growth that is consistent with the Food Harvest plan.  I speak with Professor Gerry Boyle regularly to ensure that Teagasc is spending accordingly, which I believe it is.<\/p><p>  The Deputy knows my opinions on the horse and greyhound fund.

Total expenditure this year on the EU Presidency has been about &euro;9 million, half of what it was the last time.  This had consequences, with all informal ministerial meetings, for example, being held in Dublin, whereas normally they would been held all over the country.  The same applies to expenditure on EU Presidency events, which was much more modest this time because we were in a new reality.  Having said that, if one looks at the results of policy-making and decision-making, this has been one of the most successful Irish EU Presidencies ever.  The Taoiseach is outlining these achievements today at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.  I will let others judge, but from our perspective, we set out our targets in January.  We essentially had two priorities and little else - to have the CFP and the CAP finalised.  I am relieved and glad to say that both had a good outcome for Ireland, as well as being completed on time.  However, that has cost us money.  If one looks at the administration figures, one will see a figure of &euro;1.3 million specifically under the heading of EU Presidency.  We have had a team of 12 people in Brussels for the whole six months and, to be honest, we could have done with three times that number.  In Brussels last week we were joking about the Haddington Road agreement and the weekly working hours of civil servants, which are sometimes criticised.  We had the hours worked by the Tuesday.  We have received fantastic value from my Department in the past six months, particularly from the group of people who have been dealing with the Irish EU Presidency and the challenges involved.  I cannot compliment them enough on their performance, as well as on their commitment and motivation levels, which went way beyond what they were contractually required to do.  Nevertheless, we will probably see a slightly higher figure for items such as transport, IT and postal services.  The sum of &euro;1.3 million was specifically earmarked for the EU Presidency.  We will have a higher figure than we otherwise would have for IT because we know that we will have a new CAP which will have an impact in terms of software development and IT generally.  That will not come cheaply because nearly all of the programmers we will need to write the new programmes are on contract and not full-time departmental staff.  Some of them are paid more than I am, but one must pay to have that skills set.  That was a long answer to a short question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2013070200007#H00300","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1372772100,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I compliment the Minister on a job well done, not just on the CAP but also on the CFP.  <\/p><p>  The sugar beet issue is also close to my heart.

It seems unfair that if a country spends too little on holding the EU Presidency, it may not progress.<\/p><p>  Does the Minister intend the new IT programmes to be compatible with those in other Departments?  Should other Departments share some of the cost, especially the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government because there are linkages with inspections?

Many have basic and consolidated payments which I presume will have to become part of one payment.  <\/p><p>  A hobby-horse of mine during the years has been maps.  There have been issues continually about lines on maps, be they the old Ordinance Survey maps or more modern ones.

Members of the committee might remember that last year I got a bit of stick for the delay in making many AEOS payments owing to mapping problems.  Farmers became very irate, but if we had paid out using the wrong maps, we would not have been able to draw down EU funds because that is how the audit system works.

A great deal is happening in both areas.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar and I will be launching a safety initiative for the fishing industry in Union Hall next Monday, which the Deputy and all other Members are welcome to attend if they wish.  It will involve grant aid, an obligation to training, and the establishment of an industry-led group of people who will report to me by the end of the year in terms of making recommendations around safety and careers in fishing, in particular for deckhands.  There are a series of complex issues involved that require to be looked at, with which Deputies Pringle and Ferris will be familiar.  We are responding to the issues raised.  BIM is being given an allocation to support this initiative.  I suspect there will be more to come on the back of the recommendations from the group.  I think Union Hall is the appropriate place to launch this initiative given what happened there last year.<\/p><p>  Following the funerals after the most recent tragedy in Waterford, I spoke to the family.  My heart goes out to them.  It is almost unthinkable that so many people from one family would lose their lives in the same tragedy.  I have also received a fairly detailed description of the likely situation in terms of what happened to them.  They were all wearing life jackets and there was an EPIRB on the boat.  However, for some reason it did not trigger an emergency signal when it should have.  I am told that this happened because the bow of the boat, where the EPIRB was located, did not sink.  EPIRBs need to be submerged in water before they trigger.  We do not know all the facts and should not overly speculate.  Following receipt of a full report from the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, we may learn lessons from that tragedy.  In the meantime, we must do all we can to support the community involved.<\/p><p>  We have learned from other tragedies that if emergency services are quickly alerted to a person being in the water, the chances of the person being saved are dramatically increased.  For this reason, we must ensure that when a fisherman or anyone else falls into the water, an emergency response is triggered immediately.  I hope the equipment we propose to support and grant aid next Monday will address some of those concerns.  A person who falls into the sea, even when wearing a life jacket, can only survive a couple of hours before dying of hypothermia.  It is important the person can remain afloat and that the emergency services reach him or her quickly.  The two pieces of equipment about which we are speaking are linked to saving lives.  I propose, with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, to act on this next Monday in Union Hall.  I thank the Deputy for asking that question.<\/p><p>  On the Deputy's second question on the new Common Fisheries Policy, we should know in the next ten days what Ireland's allocation will be from the EMFF, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.  On the last occasion this was distributed, Ireland did particularly badly in that it received only &euro;72 million, which is approximately 1% of the fund or approximately &euro;10 million per annum.  I am making the strong case to the Commissioner that Ireland should receive a significantly increased allocation this time.  While every country is seeking an increase, Ireland manages a complex mixed fishery and needs resources to do so.  I will make the figures available when I receive them.  While Ireland will receive some money, I am hopeful the amount will be considerable enough to assist fishermen to adapt to the new realities of fishing policy, which is an obligation to land all fish, with some exception, and the gear they require to become more targeted in terms of how they fish, including mesh size, escape hatches, net shape and new storage facilities and so on.  I cannot give a figure in this regard now.  We have factored some of this into the programme.  Members will note that BIM's budget has been increased, as has the budget for Bord Bia.  This is because I see both organisations as strategic in terms of finding new markets and developing new value added products in the food and seafood sectors.  It is also because BIM has to do the work I have just outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2013070200008#J00600","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1372772700,"counter":53,"content":"<p>We will now move on to programme B.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2013070200008#J00700","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1372772700,"counter":54,"content":"<p>On programme A10(vii), legal and miscellaneous, there is a substantial increase of more than &euro;2.1 million for this year.

It is a pilot scheme focused initially on Kenya and Tanzania.  We are trying to persuade Irish companies which would not normally consider investing in Africa because of political uncertainty and the possibility of social unrest to view Africa in a new way.

This year, we are completing a more significant structural review of how we operate our inspections systems in factories.  This year, we have seen a great deal of evidence as to why we cannot compromise the standards in factories.  We must ensure that the jobs that must be done by veterinarians are being done by veterinarians, whether they are in private practice or working in the Department.  We must also consider whether work being done by vets can be done by trained Department staff.  We have made some of that transition already.  Some of the carcass stamping which would have been done by veterinarians previously is now being carried out by factories themselves under supervision.

It was designed and advocated for by Ireland at the start.  We wanted young farmers under the age of 40 years to get a top-up payment on the single farm payment, which we had agreement on last week.  Up until last week it was going to be voluntary in countries but we secured agreement that it would be mandatory.  A young farmer in Ireland will get a 25% top-up on a single farm payment.  We need to decide how that 25% is calculated, whether it is 25% of the average farm payment in Ireland and the same for everyone or whether it is 25% of a young farmer's single farm payment.<\/p> <p>My personal preference would be for it to be 25% of the average payment in the country in order that each young farmer would get the same level of top-up.  Otherwise, the 25% top-up for the person who inherits a very high single farm payment would be much higher than that for a person who inherits a very low single farm payment and I consider this to be unfair.<\/p><p> However, members will have a chance to discuss this when discussing the Common Agricultural Policy.  Essentially, the installation aid thinking now centres on the CAP because I do not have the money to introduce another expensive installation aid scheme.  As to whether a retirement scheme will be introduced to complement an installation aid scheme, my Department must consider whether we can afford to do that in the rural development programme.  In the future, there will be less money available in the rural development programme than is the case at present and consequently, there will be many competing interests for that money.  For the Deputy's information, the Commission undertook some research to assess the best way of effecting generational change in farming and of getting young farmers into agriculture.  The Commission considered the benefits of encouraging early retirement and of encouraging young people coming into farming and found the installation aid type of approach was much more effective than was a retirement scheme type of approach.  This is the reason I have advocated for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2013070200011#M03200","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372775100,"counter":112,"content":"<p>We will have another day on that subject, on which we probably will have a long discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2013070200012#N00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1372775100,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I have one question in respect of the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS.

There have been some exceptions such as the pig loose housing investment programme, for which a lot of money was drawn down.  Similarly, a considerable amount of money was drawn down on the poultry side and some money was drawn down in respect of the dairy efficiency programmes.  However, on other programmes such as, for example, the water harvesting programme, farmers simply did not draw down the money because they were obliged to provide matching funding themselves.

However, tied into that sector are those tillage farms, including my own, which take much of the slurry from these units.  The problems farmers like me face in this regard is that each load is inconsistent and is not homogenous.  Moreover, the slurry arrives at times of the year when its value is not as high because if one spreads it on stubble ground, the nitrogen will evaporate.  There is no use in putting a lot of nitrogen into a winter crop in the back end of the year, whereas one achieves a completely different result if one incorporates it into the soil for spring barley or spring wheat.  I ask the Minister to consider grant-aiding slurry storage facilities for large areas of land in which lots of liquid slurries and the associated nutrients can be imported, agitated and tested.  Consequently, one would be able to ascertain precisely its volume and composition.  This completes the nitrogen cycle and certainly would cut down on the cost of nitrogen, as well as increasing the quantity of organic matter in soils that are being depleted.<\/p><p>  My second point pertains to the issue of early retirement.  In the context of a set number of early retirements per year, would the Minister consider examining what would be the net cost of so doing?  In the early days of the previous pension scheme, in which my parents were involved, participants could keep their old-age pension but in the latter end, their old-age pension was taken from them.  So be it but in my own case and that of others, this is certainly what got us involved in agriculture.  I acknowledge that funds are tight but I ask the Minister to consider what would be the cost.<\/p><p>  I note the Minister has provided for increased expenditure on sea fisheries, which he thought might have been for rigid inflatable boats, RIBs, hardware that was purchased, boats and so on.  Would the Minister consider co-operating with voluntary bodies such as Mallow Search and Rescue, with which I am involved?  These bodies purchase lots of equipment, were involved in the recent rescue mission in west Cork and do a great deal of work nationwide.  However, they pay full VAT and are not tied in.  It appears to me to be double expenditure, in that there is a trained unit but the Department is purchasing on the other side, whereas a collaboration between both might bring better value for everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2013070200012#N01100","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1372775100,"counter":122,"content":"<p>On the last question first, I am familiar with Mallow Search and Rescue, which was very helpful at the time of that tragedy at Union Hall, as have been many other organisations, both on rivers and in respect of sea tragedies and drownings.  However, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, plays a very different role.  It is not primarily responsible for safety, which primarily is the role of the Coast Guard, the RNLI and the Naval Service.  Most of the time, the SFPA's activities centre on enforcement of the rules and of ensuring that trawlers catch the quota they have been allocated.  The authority carries out much testing onshore, when fish are being landed.  It also boards some vessels, both in port and in harbours.  Essentially, the authority is responsible for policing the fishing industry to ensure it is obeying the rules.  While Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, is a development agency, the Coast Guard, the Naval Service and the RNLI combined provide search and rescue services.  It is a fair point in respect of voluntary organisations such as Mallow Search and Rescue, of which there are many throughout the country.  They raise much money and there probably should be more integration with the Coast Guard.  However, I believe it is important to stress the SFPA plays a different role.<\/p><p>  As for the cost of early retirement, I have no doubt but there will be a debate, probably in this committee and certainly in the D&aacute;il Chamber, on the new rural development programme.  It will be necessary to design a rural development programme for Ireland that can keep people farming, be consistent with the Food Harvest 2020 targets and look after those who cannot benefit from that plan.  There will be many competing interests involved, from young farmers to those who wish to retire, as well as environmental schemes, disadvantaged area payments and new challenges such as climate change and the Department will have a lot less money to spend.  While the Department certainly will cost such early retirement measures, it will be in a mix with many other competing interests.<\/p><p>  On TAMS, during the lifetime of the previous Government, one of the most expensive programmes this Department has ever managed was the farm waste management scheme.  Initially, the Department had anticipated it would spend approximately &euro;200 million.  However, it ended up spending &euro;1.2 billion because it was a demand-led scheme and the Department of Finance is still pretty sore about it.  It would be difficult for the Department to get sanction for a new farm waste management slurry storage type scheme unless it was designed to be and kept very tight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2013070200012#N01200","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1372775100,"counter":123,"content":"<p>It would be very tight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2013070200012#N01300","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1372775100,"counter":124,"content":"<p>This is something which it may be necessary to link with dairy expansion.

In respect of what happened last year with the scheme, members will remember we had quite a long debate in this committee about how we would make the savings because I had asked people for their feedback.  We had a closed-door session, which was very useful in terms of getting people's feedback.  I made it clear that we had to make the savings so I wanted people's input as to how we might do that.  We had an Estimate of &euro;190 million to spend on DAS last year.  We ended up spending &euro;206 million.  We were trying to be clever about it and it did not work out so we learned some lessons from that for this year.  We had to bring the figure down.  Initially, we were asked this year to make sure we got it down to &euro;190 million.  I increased that to &euro;195 million.  Even though the Estimate last year was &euro;190 million and is &euro;195 million this year, &euro;206 million was spent last year and &euro;195 million will be spent this year because I am pretty confident we will get our savings this year.<\/p><p>  The Deputy knows how we are getting those savings.  They relate to ensuring people keep animals for a certain number of months per year and that there is a basic stocking rate, which is still low but is slightly higher than it used to be.  Certain animals and conditions were taken out of DAS payments that would not qualify.  Again, this is all about trying to ensure people who are actively farming on hillsides and in disadvantaged areas are prioritised and do not have any reduction.  We have made other savings as well in DAS in terms of the actual area that people can apply for.  That reduction on lowland DAS areas will make savings this year but, again, we have maintained full payments for people who are essentially farming on mountains because they are the most disadvantaged farmers.  I am pretty confident we will get down to our target figure of &euro;195 million this year.<\/p><p>  It is hoped this will mean we will not have to make any more cuts but when I am asked to make another &euro;30 million of savings in the upcoming budget, which I have been asked to do, there are only a few schemes left that are big expenditure schemes.  These are REPS and DAS.  Luckily, REPS is naturally making savings because the number of farmers in REPS is falling all the time.  I do not want to make any solid commitments.  I want to protect farmers in disadvantaged areas as best I can in the upcoming budget, but we must wait and see what the arithmetic says.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2013070200013#O01100","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1372775700,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I have two quick questions on D3(ii), cost of capital for purchasing intervention products.

It looks at all the schemes and the systems in place to control those schemes and then makes an estimate of the money it should not have given or should not give on the basis of a lack of enforcement, mapping problems or farmers over-claiming.  The fact that our disallowance figure will probably be less than &euro;10 million this year out of &euro;1.6 billion is pretty good.  Denmark recently had a disallowance figure of &euro;110 million and the UK recently had a disallowance figure of over &euro;200 million.  When Deputies and farmers ask me whether we can back off on inspections or being so obsessed with getting digitised maps correct with the delays that come from that, the reason I say \"no\" is because we will get audited for everything we do.  All the mistakes we make will cost us money and it will be in the disallowance figure.  At the moment, it is very low but it was much higher than &euro;10 million.

I am co-chairman of Home and Community Care Ireland, HCCI, and joined by my colleague, Mr. Ed Murphy, who is a director.  We are here to outline to the committee not only our organisation and the sector but, more importantly, the forthcoming increased demand for home care and the pressures this will place on the system.  However, there is also the opportunity to create thousands of jobs and enable increased investment in the sector via appropriate regulation and the provision of reform funding.<\/p><p>  Home care is defined as a support provided for persons who require assistance to continue to live independently outside a hospital or residential setting.  This can be over a short-term period to recover from an operation or for an extended period.  The duties associated with this type of care can vary and range from preparing meals to helping clients to wash and dress to providing more intensive palliative care support.<\/p><p>  HCCI is a national organisation which represents 25 private home care providers across the island of Ireland.  Our primary objective is to promote the highest professional standards of care in the home and client choice in a cost-effective manner.  In providing care for 8,500 clients in their own homes throughout Ireland HCCI members play an important role in the development of the home care sector which is an integral part of the Government's stated policy of developing the primary care sector.  We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee, given the serious challenges facing the country such as an ageing population and reduced State investment in health care.  As the Government seeks to implement more cost-effective solutions in the caring sector, increased investment will be required from outside sources, including the private sector, to ensure sustainable levels of investment in technology and people can be maintained.  <\/p><p>  HCCI believes increased transparency and a regulatory system that is reflective of the nature of the sector are essential to attract investors and create more jobs.  There is no formal regulation of the home care sector, something on which HCCI continues to advocate.  There are FETAC training qualifications which are appropriate for home care workers.  All HCCI member company employees are trained to FETAC level 5 qualifications.  There are 40,000 people employed in the home care industry, including by private providers, the HSE and not-for-profit organisations.  We provide care for more than 70,000 people.  HCCI member companies alone employ more than 6,000 of these 40,000 staff in every town, county and rural location.  In many of the members' constituencies we would have at least four or five member organisations working in their local areas.  We contribute more than &euro;36 million to the economy annually.  <\/p><p>  Home care is provided in a number of ways by private providers, not-for-profit organisations, the HSE directly and individuals operating in the black market.  The types of care include directly secured private provision or State-funded home care which falls into two schemes, namely, home help and home care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070200003#D00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bryan Meldrum","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372769400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I got into the sector about eight years ago because my mother needed a particular type of home care when she lived in Wexford but her needs were not satisfied by the prevailing system.  I have worked in the sector eight years and I am passionate about it.  I have taken thousands of people out of hospitals and nursing homes and looked after them for long periods until death.  Our care model is not the old style home help.  We provide a more managed and professional service which deals with the complex needs of older people in their homes.<\/p><p>  We examined the following challenges and opportunities and commissioned an independent report that was published in March 2013.  The report found that more people will need support as the elderly population increases.  Between now and 2021, the number of people over 65 years is set to rise to nearly 800,000, a 40% increase on 2006 levels.  The Central Statistics Office produced a startling statistic that between now and 2026, which is 13 years, the amount of people over the age of 75 will double from 207,000 to 414,000 people.  If we are experiencing problems now then they will double within the next ten to 12 years.  As the population grows older people will require support.  Dependency rates are projected to increase from the current level of 16% to over 24% by 2012.  Therefore, thousands more people will need care. <\/p><p>  The current cost of HSE section 39 funded home care is 30% more expensive than private sector rates.  The report also found that &euro;117 million could be saved each year if all home help and home care package provision was outsourced via tender for an open and honest commissioning of services.  <\/p><p>  An additional saving of &euro;256 million per year could result if 30% of patients with low and medium dependency under the fair deal scheme were provided 21 hours of intensive care at home under an enhances home care package.  In other words, additional savings could be made if the fair deal scheme was opened up instead of ring-fenced.  Many pundits believe that 30% of people in nursing homes would not need to reside there if the relevant care was provided in a home scenario.  Relocating 30% of those residents would achieve great savings.  <\/p><p>  The cumulative savings between now and 2021 should reach &euro;2 billion with a potential of creating 8,600 jobs through reform and growth in the sector.  There is a great opportunity for job creation and savings in the sector.  <\/p><p>  There are four major challenges and opportunities for creating jobs and making savings.  The first challenge and opportunity is regulation and professionalism.  At present the home care sector is unregulated and Government regulation is unlikely to be implemented until 2016.  In the interim my organisation, the HCCI, has dedicated considerable resources to ensure that all of its members undertake best practice recruitment, supervision and training procedures for all employees.  The professionalism of home care is a key HCCI objective to ensure trained and motivated staff are given access to career development.  Increased regulation and professionalism are also important to ensure high standards of care.  It will give medical staff and hospital staff the confidence to discharge people home quicker rather than keep them in hospitals and nursing homes.  This is a genuine and real issue and that is why we are pushing for regulation.  If we have regulation then we will have standards and with standards comes the proper training of care givers.<\/p><p>  With regard to the current home help system, we want to make sure that home help care is not regarded as the lower rung of the ladder and home helps are given a chance to create real careers all over the country.  Regulation will mean training at FETAC level 5 which will give people a career and opportunity.  I have visited many hospitals and talked to many consultants, GPs or whatever.  Their biggest issue with home care is that they view it as being at the bottom rung of the ladder.  They view home care providers as being quite unregulated, not necessarily well trained and incapable of providing professional and holistic care in the home.  Regulation and properly trained care givers will give confidence to doctors, consultants and social workers to discharge people quicker, and more often, to the home rather than to a nursing home or remaining in a hospital.  That is a very important point.<\/p><p>  The HCCI seeks two things from the committee.  First, recognition of the role that regulation and making home care a profession can play in developing the home care sector as a desirable career.  Second, the first national home care tender occurred this time last year but only &euro;50 million was tendered out of the Government's total home care expenditure of &euro;340 million.  Most of the money, as Mr. Meldrum has said, centred on not-for-profit organisations under section 39 funding.  The Government will re-tender again next September and we hope, with some influence and prompting, that more money will be spent on a tender for home care and in a very open, honest and transparent system that will allow for cost savings and development.  We estimate that there will be 30% less in the private care sector which will lead to overall savings of &euro;117 million.  Such savings will give an opportunity for growth and about 500 extra jobs can be created immediately when the new home care tender commences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070200004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372770000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>We wanted to not only outline who we are and what we do, but more importantly, stress to the committee, as Mr. Murphy has done, what this critical sector needs in the form of regulation and what can be achieved, both in the form of job creation and investment.

Their work is important.  A large number with whom I have engaged over the past number of years have found that nursing homes or hospitals are not for them and that they need care at home.  It offers them much dignity and peace of mind.  It is a good environment in general if one is able for it to be cared for at home if it is possible to do so.  The State should be doing its utmost to ensure that, where persons select the option, it provides a service for them at home.  I also believe that many of the workers they employ do sterling work in delivering that home care.<\/p><p>  I will be honest.  From my perspective, I believe in a public rather than a private health service.  I do not believe in a two-tier system whereby those who have the funds can access the service.  I also have a worry that where there is a profit motive in the provision of a health service, it can often, as we have seen in certain cr&egrave;ches and nursing homes, change the nature of delivery of service.<\/p><p>  I am shocked that there is no formal regulation of this sector.

No doubt there should be strong regulation.<\/p><p>  I read some of the documentation that we received  It goes through the normal diary of a person's day and indicates that the client may be resting for a period of time and that the staff member would not be paid for that, perhaps if the client is asleep for the hour.

If there is privatisation, circumstances will change.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n&rsquo;s remarks on elderly people.  I spent 28 years working with the HSE as a community welfare officer.  I was working with elderly people and assessing them for the fair deal and nursing home subvention schemes.  The last thing an elderly person wants is to go to a nursing home.  The elderly really do want to stay at home.<\/p><p>  I do not fully understand some of the remarks of the delegates.

It was stated there could be a saving of &euro;159 million in respect of the fair deal by keeping people out of nursing homes and caring for them in the community.  Have the delegates pencilled in the cost of community care?  Are they suggesting that some part of the fair deal budget should be open to be used for keeping people within the home?  If so, I would agree with that.  If a person can be kept at home for half the cost, it makes sense to consider it.<\/p><p>  My final concern relates to the existing home helps employed by the HSE.  Will they risk losing their jobs if we privatise home help?

With regard to the current HSE home helps, there has been an embargo on recruitment for a few years.  It is important to point out that although we provide home care privately, we are absolutely not opposed to the HSE providing home help as it is doing at present.  However, unless the HSE opens the floodgates and hires all the home helps itself, it will not be able to cope with the significantly increasing demand.  The HSE has been providing home help in recent years and the not-for-profit companies are doing so still.   We started seven or eight years ago and have looked after 7,000 or 8,000 people that the HSE had not the capacity to look after.  We are very much of the opinion that we need both State and private provision.<\/p><p>  I am not quite sure whether my next point is against the thinking and logic of Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  More than 50% of the people we look after approach us privately stating they do not want State provision and that they want to use us because of the services we provide.  I spoke to a lady from the HSE, a home care package co-ordinator, and she said to me that it is great that we are looking after a couple of hundred people in this area and that these people and their families are prepared to pay for the service.  The lady stated this means the HSE does not have to provide services to them.  This is because they want something a little different or more complex, for example.<\/p><p>  If one pays for the care of an incapacitated individual, one can receive tax relief of 41%.  I compliment the Government on this.  The relief subsidises a person who decides to look after his mother, father or family member.  There are people seeking private care and the Government is prepared to give tax relief to people looking for it.  The services for the average person for whom we provide private care are usually paid for by sons and daughters who are pooling together.  I genuinely believe that public and private provision can exist together.<\/p><p>  The concept of the break time is quite confusing.  The HSE is struggling with the Organisation of Working Time Act.  The Act specifies that one must be finished work for 11 hours before one can start again.  With regard to live-in care, most staff finish work at approximately 9 p.m.  Our staff have separate living quarters in the house where they can stay from 9 p.m. and they do not return to work until at least 8 a.m. in the morning.  Therefore, there is a break of 11 hours.  The private sector and HSE are doing this.  It is not just a private sector issue but also a public sector issue.  We give an 11 hour break and tend to give an on-call allowance to the member of staff just in case he or she gets a call during the night to take the individual in care to the toilet, for example.  That is all.  If we had to pay for 24 hour care, including during the 11 hours when the carer is in bed or watching television, it would make live-in care unaffordable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070200006#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr Ed Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372771200,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Mr. Murphy said the employees are given 11 hours off.

There is a disposition in our culture to care.  Mr. Murphy spoke as if he were creating professions.  Perhaps that might not sit easily with some of the work.

They see themselves getting a few bob through the HSE rather than the black market, but they provide the care mainly out of altruistic motives and old fashioned ideas of neighbourliness.

The need starts with how much money we have to afford all the services that an aging population and other support and social care services demand.

In terms of the overall spend within the health care sector, we have decided that there must be other opportunities in respect of spending this money wisely.  With regard to development and meeting the needs of older people - because we are at a crisis point - the question arises as to how one spends one's health care budget when every year it is contracting.  We are all joined at the hip.  It does not matter who provides the service.  The very people who entered health care did so because they really wanted to provide care.  It does not matter whether they work for the HSE, the not-for-profit sector or the private sector.  What linked them and brought them to an induction was the fact that they wanted to make a difference.<\/p><p>  The standards of care we are now delivering are far in excess of what was there when I started in the past five or six years.  We are growing at a phenomenal pace because demands to get people out of hospital and deliver continuing care within the home are rising all the time.

With regard to why older people went into residential homes quicker than anywhere else in Europe, there was no formal assessment process in the early days.  That has now ceased and there is now a formal assessment for anyone who is of the age and meets the entitlement.  The fair deal scheme has been reorganised to ensure that the person who requires a home can get access to it and avail of that service.

The HSE provides 70% of the care and it will cost it hugely to implement any standards or guidelines because it must employ a few extra thousand people to carry out the necessary supervision and training to comply with the standards that might be introduced.  The HSE is by far the largest provider of care in the country.  It may cost the State over &euro;30 per hour at the moment but the HSE is the largest provider and it would cost far more if it had to comply with the standards.  That is my opinion.  Therefore, it would be very expensive to bring that in.  We would love to see it happen because we believe it is absolutely necessary.<\/p><p>  We should always go back to the older person.  Older people want to stay at home.  We want to keep them safe and secure and we want families to be able to obtain care at a rate that is as affordable as possible if they must pay for it.  The largest problem we have at the moment, in addition to the cost of care, is the fact that older people are not given a choice.  If they are provided with care, they are told they must use Mrs. Murphy or Jane O'Neill or whatever.  We would like to see a tender situation, although not necessarily to give it all to the private sector.  I would not want that.  We should have a tender system and a number of options for older people, but we should make sure they are approved from the point of view of quality, policies and procedures.  We can then offer older people and their families a list of those high quality providers and let them choose whom they would like to use their funds for.

Coupled with this, I can also bring to the role my experiences as a past president of IBEC and a member of advisory boards to a number of third level institutions.<\/p><p>  From initial research, I have established that the NSAI has a strong vision, mission and values and a recently approved strategic plan for the years 2013 to 2015.  I take this opportunity to commend the work of the outgoing chairman, Ms Ann Riordan, and the board members on the strength of this plan, which will guide my chairmanship if it is ratified.  The NSAI is a significant contributor to the Action Plan for Jobs programme since it was initiated in 2012.  It is important to note that the NSAI is not a job creation agency but rather a key element in the trade infrastructure that underpins our economic activity.  In this context, NSAI provides Ireland, as a small and open economy, with an infrastructure of products and services to be developed, traded and relied upon nationally and around the world.  This infrastructure also contributes positively to decisions on foreign direct investment, in which organisations rely on a regulatory environment, developing standards and a conformity assessment infrastructure to achieve objectives such as the development of the medical devices sector.<\/p><p>  I will give a personal example from my own area of operations in pharmaceutical activities in Ireland.  The Food and Drugs Administration in the US has not issued a single warning letter to any pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Ireland, which is of strong strategic import in the attraction and retention of foreign direct investment in the pharma-chemical sector.  This competency was developed as a result of the strong emphasis of the Irish Medicines Board on the benefits of focusing on compliance and creating a culture of compliance within the Irish industry.<\/p><p>  The NSAI delivers on the trading infrastructure through the core programmes of metrology, standardisation, legal metrology and conformity assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070200009#K00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Julie O'Neill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372773000,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I apologise that so few members are present.

As Senator Quinn mentioned, yesterday a new regime was introduced under the construction products regulation which has come into effect fully throughout Europe.  It will create many extra requirements for the NSAI to transpose European standards fully as national standards and reference points, and provide certification schemes for Irish companies so they can CE mark their construction products.  This is very new as up to now construction products did not have to be CE marked to be placed on the European market.

As we come through this difficult time we will be a much more knowledge-based economy investing in people and developing products and services.  This requires much more intensive interaction with standardisation.<\/p><p>  This country needs to go from standards takers to standards makers, and this is a role in which the NSAI can support business and we actively promote it.  As a small country Ireland has exactly the same access to the international standardisation committees as the US, Germany and China, which is a huge benefit not only to indigenous Irish companies which are our primary target but it is also of great assistance to the IDA in attracting international investment, because the sites in Ireland which at one point in the distant past were manufacturing only can now play a big role in research and development.  They can also be a conduit to international standardisation through the work of the NSAI.  Over the next five years we would like this to become part and parcel of the package Ireland offers through the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to foreign and domestic businesses.  We are not looking for money or support; we will fight our corner like anybody else, but preaching this message and establishing this culture would be the great hope and objective of the NSAI, and this is where we need the support of the good people in this room.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070200011#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1372773600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact the NSAI is willing to come before the committee on an annual basis and we will take up this offer.

Assuming my submission has been read by all members, I will concentrate on emphasising the urgency of the issues involved and the need for courageous leadership. <\/p><p>  I came to the issue of climate change through a career spent examining issues of social, economic and political development in Ireland, Latin America and globally.  As I have acquainted myself with the growing scientific evidence on climate change, I have become increasingly concerned both at the enormous, indeed momentous, challenges this poses for society and the disconnect between the evidence of science, which is demanding immediate and urgent action, and the meagre and completely inadequate responses by most sectors of society, including our political leaders.  As a professional social scientist, I have not hidden my view that most of what we are teaching in all branches of the social sciences &ndash; political science, which is my area, economics and sociology and development studies being those with which I am most acquainted - misses the fundamental challenges we face.  We are educating a generation that is ill prepared for the serious challenges of social change with which they will have to cope.  It is partly for this reason that I took early retirement last year to devote myself more fully to writing and teaching on the challenges climate change poses for society, including for the ways we teach the social sciences.  I am currently writing a book on this subject.<\/p><p>  In case members may be less than impressed by this subjective response, in other words, my wish to share my personal experience with the joint committee, I will substantiate my position by citing a most authoritative source, namely, the German government&rsquo;s high level Advisory Council on Global Change - WGBU are its initials in German - which reports directly to the Chancellor&rsquo;s office.  In its 2011 report entitled, World in Transition: A Social Contract for Sustainability, the advisory council highlights the \"drastic change in direction [that] must be accomplished before the end of the current decade in order to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to a minimum by 2050\".  This \"great transformation\" as it is described, \"encompasses profound changes to infrastructures, production processes, regulation systems and lifestyles, and extends to a new kind of interaction between politics, society, science and the economy\".  Such a transformation, it continues, is \"unique in history\" and goes \"far beyond technological and technocratic reforms\" involving \"a new global social contract for a low-carbon and sustainable global economic system\". <\/p><p>  Interestingly, the report compares the extent of the transformation, which it states \"can barely be overestimated\", to the Neolithic revolution, namely, the invention and spreading of farming and animal husbandry, and Industrial Revolution.  This comparison emphasises the enormity of the challenge we face, which will require a \"proactive state, a state that actively sets priorities for this transformation, at the same time increasing the number of ways in which its citizens can participate, and offering the economy choices when it comes to acting with sustainability in mind\".  Despite actions being taken on climate change, the expert group states \"there is a very real danger that the dynamics between change and dogged insistence on the established will lead to a lock-in; the transformation into a low-carbon society could also fail.\" <\/p><p>  Each of our societies faces an unprecedented revolution in production, consumption, mobility, energy and construction, all within the most tight of timeframes.  To lead this, a revolution in governance is required with courageous political leadership of a kind we have not seen to date.  It must not be afraid to alert society to the realities that face us and must be decisive in facing down powerful vested interests which seek to minimise these realities.  President Obama showed the way in a ground-breaking speech he made on climate change on 25 June last.  I strongly recommend that members read or view the speech as it is probably the most important speech made by a political leader on the subject.  We need similar leadership from the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013070200005#E00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Peadar Kirby"},{"type":"speech","time":1372777800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Kirby for his presentation and paper.  Ireland's economic crisis occurred because powerful capitalist interests played the music while politicians danced a jig.  Is there a danger that the dominance of these interests in the western media means they are so powerful that they may prevent a real debate on climate change?  Are democratic institutions sufficiently powerful to hold the ring and make a call on climate change that is in the interests of citizens?  That is the overall context.<\/p><p>  Professor Kirby correctly noted that a number of steps must be taken within a short timeframe.  On emissions targets, what is his view on the bottom-up approach under which one asks each sector to produce a plan for carbon reduction?  Is it realistic to have such plans?  The reason I support the introduction of five year targets is that they would match the term of governments.  While I accept that governments do not always last for five years - we had three governments in 18 months at one point - my concern is that longer timeframes could result in us hitting a carbon cliff because a government could decide to kick the can down the road and leave the issue of carbon emissions to its successor.  Such an approach would cause the problem to build up and we would hit a carbon cliff at some point.  What is Professor Kirby's view?  Should emissions targets or carbon budgets be set in five year timeframes?<\/p><p>  Professor Kirby cited a report by an advisory body to the German Government.  There are different views on achieving change.  Some believe one should involve the various stakeholders, while others argue that one should focus on the views of experts.

Should we listen to experts such as independent scientists, sociologists and economists who do not have a vested interest in pushing an agenda on behalf of any particular sector and whose interest lies in protecting the environment and humankind?<\/p><p>  Moves are afoot in the North to introduce climate change legislation.

We held a meeting with some of the Departments to try and explore the sectoral plans in areas such as agriculture, energy and transport.  Following the meeting I was confused as to how these areas dovetail.<\/p><p>  It is critically important that the institutional arrangements we put in place are capable of making something more than a document that acts as guidance.  In this regard I am interested in what Professor Kirby has said regarding institutional arrangements because it is something we can recommend can be inserted in the Bill to change what is included at present.  <\/p><p>  Professor Kirby said a low carbon society needs to be given equal weight with a low carbon economy.  Perhaps he might elaborate on this.  Conflicts arise in this area, even in terms of policy decisions that have been taken.  The train has already left the station in that we will not meet our obligations up to 2020.  This means that targets extending to 2030 or 2050 will be more difficult to achieve.<\/p><p>  Is it possible to disconnect the economy from the targets, given that we probably need a financially more equal society if we are going to deliver on this?  Is it suggested that the needs of the economy be ignored in this?  For example, reference was made to vested interests.  A key area is the national ambition to export agricultural produce, yet this is the area in which we are most challenged.  How can this circle be squared, especially in terms of targets?<\/p><p>  Reference was made to expertise in regard to the universities, social sciences, Government Departments and so on.

It certainly provides food for thought, no pun intended.  Is there a need for balance here in Ireland?  We should take into consideration our size as a nation, our impact globally and our ability to produce food.  We should look at the global situation, particularly countries in south-east Asia and even eastern Europe that are driving clouds of emissions to the skies on a daily basis, and the significant impact that has when compared with what we have to do.  I know we have to play our part, but surely there is a balance so that we do not strangle ourselves with further bureaucratic restrictions and directives on our ability to produce food at a time when half the world is starving.  We have to decide whether food security, food safety and the provision of food is more important than the world we live in.<\/p><p>  I am interested in Professor Kirby's statement that scientific evidence changes on an ongoing basis.  There are scientists who tell us that no matter what we do on climate change, it will have very little effect and that this happens in cycles, be it every hundred years or over centuries.  We can get carried away with this and with people like the professor and the so-called experts to whom he refers.  I would be interested to know his definition of an expert.  We have had experts in the financial sector like Mr. Fingleton or Mr. Dunne in construction.  Are these the sort of people to whom the professor refers when he talks about experts?  The ordinary people are probably the most educated of all, yet there seems to be no room for their thoughts to be taken into consideration.<\/p><p>  I put it to Professor Kirby that the effect we have in Ireland is minuscule, no matter what we do.  We can do ourselves damage ultimately.  Most speakers have spoken about agriculture.  Agriculture is the only industry that has saved this country in times of trouble, because 98% of what we produce in agriculture is exported.  We are the closest to organic production of food in the world, because we produce our food in natural conditions.  Compare that with the factory farming carried on in places like the Netherlands on the seashore, where animals never see daylight.  We have to place more significance on what we have and then look at climate change from a different light.  I am concerned to get this balance right.  I did not hear Professor Kirby speak about balance today.  He is very passionate about what he is proposing.  We can work on that, but we should work on it on the basis that it does us least damage, that we are able to reach our food production targets and that we place more emphasis on the people who are starving in the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013070200008#H00700","speaker":"1087"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372779600,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I find this astonishing.  In his address last Tuesday, President Obama said that 97% of the world's scientists have reached this remarkable consensus on the serious nature of what we are facing and it is due, by and large, to our human activities on the environment.  When I talk about experts, I am talking about hundreds of the world's leading scientists who work on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which will produce its seventh report later this year.  I am not talking about the Michael Fingletons of this world, so let us not minimise the weight of the scientific advice we are getting.  The Deputy noted that I said the scientific advice is changing.  It is changing because the scientists are learning more and more that the very complex activities of the global climate are changing in worse ways than they predicted as recently as 2007.  Things are getting worse at a faster rate than they would have predicted.<\/p><p>  I do not know what \"balance\" means in this planetary emergency, which is what scientists now call it.  The idea that we are small contributors takes away from the fact that we have the seventh largest global footprint of the 200 or so countries that exist in the world.  We are a major contributor.  We are, of course, a small country, so overall we do not contribute an awful lot, but the way in which we produce goods and services and live our lives is at the worst end of what is unsustainable in today's world.  If we talk about balance and about giving our agriculture the chance to continue, then we are basically abdicating responsibility.  Any country in the world can say this.  Every country has its own individual challenges  If the Deputy read the report of the World Bank published last November, entitled Turn Down the Heat,  he would know that it was about the effect on food supply in the world if the sort of development that is happening is allowed to continue.

I read his submission and I wish to tease out one of his recommendations.  It stated that no conditions should be included which appeared to make the achievement or the objectives of the Bill subservient to economic growth and development.  That is a rather radical and explosive statement.  Will Professor Kirby respond on that?  Will he elaborate on his final recommendation?

This is one of the most important subjects we are debating.  We have a major challenge and indeed the world has a major challenge and we recognise that.  Some of the points I was going to raise have been mentioned already, including the limitations to which Deputy Humphreys referred.  We will be grappling with the issue of targets, the footprint, mapping and how we do all of that.<\/p><p>  Our decisions will have to be evidence-based and policy-based.  I wish to draw the topic out a little.  Professor Kirby stated that we need to disconnect the economic section of the Bill.  Agricultural production amounts to 7% of our GDP.  Realistically, we will not get rid of all the cows in Ireland overnight.  As policymakers we are faced with ensuring we have realistic and achievable targets.  We would all love to set idealistic targets but I want to get something else from this.  I recognise Professor Kirby as an expert in the field.  How can we set realistic achievable targets?  I am unsure whether Professor Kirby used the word \"disconnect\" but we need to ensure there is employment in the economic sectors and that we continue to have farmers and so on.  As politicians, we need to consider the seriousness of this and recognise what we need to do, but it must be based on evidence and on what is achievable.  This is where Professor Kirby comes in.  Could he, for example, recommend three things that should be done?  He stated that every year we should set a target.  The transport sector has been weak here in setting and achieving targets.  The heat sector has been very weak as well.  We must ensure we work on that sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013070200009#J00400","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1372780200,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I ask the Senator to conclude because we will be suspending for a vote shortly and I want to allow our witness to respond before then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013070200009#J00500","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1372780200,"counter":290,"content":"<p>Let us get back to the expert.

In a general sense we must answer what Deputy Coonan has said because this is what is on people's minds as a result of all the pressure on them relating to carbon taxes, changing systems and so on.  We need to answer their concerns.  Senator Keane said that the targets must be achievable and must make sense.  They must make sense in a democratic sense as well in that they must be accepted by the people when we try to implement policy.<\/p><p>  The urgency and passion with which Professor Kirby speaks indicates that the issue is urgent, but in terms of the western world and the USA, we are fundamentally consumer-driven societies.  Until we tackle that, the problems will remain.  The consumer sector of our economy is down but we have seen celebrations in the United States because the sector there is up.  Where are the people there getting the raw materials from?  They are getting them from the places, to which Deputy Coonan referred, where they are sending plumes of carbon into the sky.  We buy the stuff.  That is what we want and that is what people demand.  They feel hard done by if they cannot get another new this, that or the other.  I am not trying to denigrate people who are just getting by, but it is hard and it is, as it were, a chip in people now.  If we try to change that, we are fundamentally changing what even developing countries want to work towards.  They want people to be able to shop until they drop.<\/p><p>  The proposals under discussion go beyond setting out that it is raining more here and that we will have difficulty getting food.  It is a major ask in terms of the psyche of people, who are simply living from day to day or a few years ahead, to approach things in the way Professor Kirby has called for.  Professor Kirby cannot dismiss what Deputy Coonan has said on that basis.  This is bigger than agriculture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013070200009#J00700","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372780200,"counter":292,"content":"<p>If I had the answers to any of these problems then I would have won the Nobel Prize.  Deputy Mulherin has stated it exactly.  These are the challenges.  It is fine to discuss realistic and achievable targets.  At the moment our governments are negotiating a successor to the Kyoto Protocol.  Its purpose is to try to take seriously what the scientists are telling us about the targets we must achieve.  Anyone could say these are completely unrealistic or unachievable targets.<\/p><p>  Last Tuesday, President Obama pledged the leadership of the United States to ensure that robust targets would be set.  Then it becomes the challenge for governments to be able to translate these into the changes required.  This is why I said that we need to put an emphasis in the Bill on a low-carbon society, because it is not only the economy that needs to be changed.  If we are to take seriously the German experts who have said that this is akin to a transformation similar to the Industrial Revolution or the Neolithic revolution, we must concentre our minds on the fact that the way we do things now is not the way we will be able to do things in 30 or 40 years time.<\/p><p>  We will have to go through a revolution in the way in which we produce food.  A great deal of emphasis at the meeting has been put on food, and rightly so, but let us we consider the entire structure of Irish agriculture.  When I go to Cloughjordan to buy my fruit and vegetables, most are imported.  Why can we not re-balance our agriculture such that we produce food for local consumption?  The effort to reduce carbon emissions will necessitate far fewer carbon miles in our food and drink production.  In other words, we must source more locally.  This will immediately change the conditions or incentives for the way in which any of our economic sectors operate, including agriculture.  We need to be imaginative, think big and realise that we are truly facing the most swingeing and radical changes.  Only by working together can we begin to explore and find answers to them.  One of the essential answers must come from those in political leadership.  They must not kick the ball down the road.

The first big thing, and I am asking for it here, is that responsibility for climate change be given to the Taoiseach.  That is essential because it signals that this is central to Government policy.  That will have to happen internationally with whatever is the successor treaty to Kyoto.  There would have to be a unit established for poverty proofing or equality proofing policies.  We have to climate change proof policies.  As Deputy Murphy says, there are many contradictions in the incentives that we are setting, and climate change objectives do not seem to be getting the importance they warrant.  Those are two things.  We need much more leadership from public figures, including ourselves as academics.  We need to talk much more about this.  The media has been a great failure in this regard too.  We need leadership at all levels in society to educate our population.  I was shocked that I did not see any mention in the Irish media of President Obama's climate change talk in Georgetown University on Tuesday of last week, despite it being probably the single most important speech by a political leader anywhere in the world on the issue.  It is really is worth watching.  We need to wise up our media and all our sectoral organisations, such as the employers' and farmers' organisations.  They might not like some of this stuff but this is what is coming down the road and the future of our children and our children's children depends on the actions we take now.  It is that serious.  Let us develop a co-operative spirit.  In wartime we have the capacity to develop a co-operative spirit to get through a period where our survival is at stake, and that is akin to what we are facing into.

I am delighted to address the committee.  This is a very important topic and is also very urgent.  I propose to summarise the opening statement that I have provided to the committee. <\/p><p>  The most recent assessment report from the IPCC concludes that warming of the climate system is unequivocal.  That is its analysis as published in 2007.  A more recent report published last month by the International Energy Agency concludes that the world is not on track to meet the target of 2&deg;C agreed as part of the international process on climate change negotiations, the Canc&uacute;n agreements.  According to the scientific analysis, this means we will have more extreme weather events which will become more frequent and intense.  I understand the committee has addressed the impacts of flooding as a separate issue.  According to the International Energy Agency, we are likely to have a temperature increase of between 3.6&deg;C and 5.3&deg;C compared with pre-industrial levels. <\/p><p>  Greenhouse gas emissions are associated with two things: energy on one side and agriculture on the other.  What I call energy includes energy used for transport, energy for heating our homes and businesses, energy for industry, and power generation.  Energy is at the heart of the challenge.  The increase in emissions is largely due to what we have been doing in terms of energy and is also where the solutions lie.  The focus of my research is energy modelling to inform policy decisions.  We have built the only software model in Ireland that allows us to examine different scenarios in the period to 2050.  It is on the basis of that analysis and research that my comments have been generated.<\/p><p>  I would like to raise five key points which will, I hope, inform the deliberations of the committee.  One is that Ireland has distinct challenges in making the transition to a low-carbon economy.  That is not a reason to abnegate our responsibility, but it is a contextual point of which we need to be aware.  Second, policy to date has been effective in isolated areas but has been insufficient.  Third, growth in beef and dairy farming is not aligned with developing a low carbon economy.  Fourth, we should be ambitious and also realistic.  Fifth, we need more evidence-based policy.<\/p><p>  In the context of the first point, Ireland has distinct challenges.  I want to draw the attention of the committee to two of them, which are related to some of the comments made earlier.  Our emissions have grown while EU emissions have declined since 1990.  When we talk about targets relative to 1990 and 2005, we can have a very different perspective from other countries.  Reference was made earlier to the EU low-carbon roadmap, whose target is a 40% reduction in emissions EU-wide by 2030 relative to 1990 levels.  That is equivalent to a 36% reduction relative to 2005 levels for the EU, but if we apply a 40% reduction relative to 1990 levels to Ireland it is equivalent to a 52% reduction relative to 2005 levels.  If we simply apply the EU low-carbon targets for 2030 to Ireland we end up in a very different situation compared to the rest of the EU.<\/p><p>  The second point in regard to our distinct challenges is agriculture, which has been discussed.  Essentially, 30% of our greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, whereas 10% come from agriculture in the EU as a whole.  This does not mean we are bad at reducing emissions from agriculture; rather, it reflects the fact that a significant portion of our agricultural output is exported.  The emissions are calculated based on production rather than consumption.  The fact that cows are belching here means they contribute to our emissions even though the resulting steaks and milk are consumed elsewhere.  About 80% of our beef and dairy sector output is exported.  That raises a key challenge, a point to which I will return.  <\/p><p>  The second key point is that policy to date has been effective in isolated areas but has been insufficient.  I used two examples in my submission.  One is the fact that in 2000 we started to take wind energy deployment seriously and moved from a situation in which wind energy represented 1% of our electricity generation to one in which it represented 16% of the total, in 2011.  That is a very significant achievement and was delivered through policy.  It was largely the work of the renewable energy strategy group in 2000, which effectively transformed wind energy from a peripheral policy issue to one which achieved almost full stakeholder support.  That is not to say that wind energy does not face challenges, but it is a success story.<\/p><p>  The second issue relates to the purchasing of new cars.  We changed our car taxation system in July 2008.  The emissions performance of new cars purchased in Ireland has significantly improved.  In 2008 every kilometre travelled by car resulted in the emission of around 166 g of CO2 per kilometre, but now the weighted average for new cars is 130 g of CO2 per kilometre.<\/p><p>  These successes are in isolated areas.  Problems arise in the energy system as a whole and we have not been successful in dealing with that.  There are areas of the energy system that we have neglected and, as a result, despite these successes, our energy system continues to be dominated by fossil fuels with high import dependency.  We need a plan for the full energy system - that is, energy used for power, electricity and transport, and in buildings.<\/p><p>  The third key point is that growth in beef and dairy farming is not aligned with developing a low-carbon economy.  This presents a huge challenge for us.  As I mentioned, our beef and dairy farming has a low carbon intensity but we export a lot of our output.  Beef and dairy farming make a significant contribution to emissions.  The decision Ireland has to make is whether to stop or continue with beef and dairy farming in the context of moving to a low-carbon economy.  If we stop it, the chances are that beef and dairy products will be produced elsewhere, resulting in greater emissions.  We are working with Teagasc, but based on my analysis, a reasonable target for the agricultural sector would be to have zero growth in emissions from agriculture between 2020 and 2050.  That would allow for growth in agricultural activity, coupled with an improvement in the emissions performance of agriculture.  If we combine that with an 80% reduction in the remaining emissions from the energy system, we end up with a target for 2050 of 50% below 1990 levels.  That does not sound ambitious in the context of goals of 80% to 95%, but they are the figures we need if we want to keep the beef and dairy sector going.<\/p><p>  That ties into my fourth point, namely, that we should be ambitious and yet realistic.  The 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions comprising 0% growth on the agriculture side relative to 2020, protected levels until 2020 and an 80% reduction in energy emissions relative to 1990 levels are ambitious but realistic challenges.<\/p><p>  We explored the idea of going further in the energy system, such as achieving a reduction of up to 95% in emissions by 2050.  We found the marginal abatement costs - that is, the cost to squeeze out the last tonne of carbon dioxide in 2050 - increased fivefold when one moved from a goal of 80% to one of 95%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013070200012#O00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372782300,"counter":309,"content":"<p>New Zealand is a similar country to Ireland.

I study the consequences for the energy system of not being able to achieve targets in agriculture, based on other people's analysis of what is feasible in agriculture.  That touches on the implications of Harvest 2020 in the short term.<\/p><p>  Ireland's short-term target is to achieve a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the non-ETS sectors relative to 2005 levels by 2020.  Our analysis shows that the targets of Harvest 2020 mean that the energy system will have to deliver a reduction of more than 30% in greenhouse gas emissions in the non-ETS sectors.  The non-ETS sectors in energy are the most difficult ones in which to achieve reductions, and these are the ones that have been neglected.  The focus of the energy policy has been on electricity.  Electricity will not help us to meet our non-ETS targets because it is part of the ETS grouping.  Transportation and the heating of buildings, homes, shops and offices are the key areas of the energy portion of non-ETS emissions.  Because Harvest 2020 has been agreed, the consequence is that if the energy system delivers the overall required reductions to achieve the 20% target, the marginal abatement cost is four times higher than it would have been if the targets had been allocated sectorally - that is, if everyone had to give a 20% reduction.<\/p><p>  The Deputy said that the costs were on the low side <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i><b><\/b>GDP.

He referred to a significant conflict which I did not bring up in the context of what we should do about agriculture and its impact on the energy system.  One of our sets of results shows that if we continue as we are with the beef and dairy industry and if we want to meet more stringent targets, then the energy system must do more.  Part of the solution in this regard relates to bioenergy.  Immediately a further conflict arises in respect of agriculture in the context of competition for land use.  This is another issue with which we must grapple and there is no easy answer in respect of it.<\/p><p>  In terms of hydropower, we have actually exploited our best sites.  There are some smaller sites which could be exploited but they would not contribute a significant amount in the context of our overall energy requirements.  When Ardnacrusha was developed, the grid was developed around it.  At that time, effectively 100% of our electricity came from the renewable source of hydropower.  At present, approximately 2% of our electricity comes from it.  Electricity represents less than 20% of our overall energy use, which is a very small proportion.  Our analysis suggests that the biggest opportunity in terms of meeting our emissions reduction target at least cost relates to wind energy and bioenergy.  In the context of bioenergy, the use of biogas has been neglected.  It is possible to anaerobically digest the organic fraction of waste to generate biogas and one can also grow crops to generate it.  One of the best crops, in the context of land use and energy output per hectare, is grass.  Of course we have expertise in this area.  Essentially, we could foresee a situation whereby grass could be used in anaerobic digesters to generate biogas.  The latter could be then fed into the national gas grid and used to meet our heating and transport requirements.  The latter would be done through the adoption of compressed natural gas, CNG, vehicles.  Some activity is happening in this area in Ireland but the pace is very slow.  As with many things in the energy space, a significant boost will be necessary if we are to make the transition we require.<\/p><p>  On producing energy from waste, a number of the larger landfill sites have electricity generation plants.  However, there are others where, as the Deputy stated, the gas is flared off.  My view on the production of energy from waste is that we should seek to generate biogas and feed that into the gas grid by upgrading it to biomethane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013070200014#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir"},{"type":"speech","time":1372782900,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing Dr. &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir's opening statement.

The Senator made a second point about the 50% reduction by 2050 being relative to 1990 levels.  In some of the work we did previously we examined the EU low-carbon roadmap, which indicated that in the EU one can get a 50% reduction in emissions in agriculture.  However, we are not experts in agriculture, so we just applied the roadmap in order to see what the consequences were for the energy system.  We concluded that if one could get a 50% reduction in agriculture and a 95% reduction in the energy system then one could achieve the overall 80% goal.  We have talked to people in Teagasc and other experts in agriculture and realise that achieving a 50% emissions reduction in agriculture in Ireland is not feasible because agriculture in Ireland is very different from agriculture in the rest of the EU.  Ireland's emissions are dominated by activities associated with grazing.  Crops and housed animals give other mitigation options that Ireland does not have.<\/p><p>  Teagasc is working on projections up to 2050 and we are using a zero-percent target as an interim measure.  The target suggests that if we want agricultural activity to grow then it needs to find mitigation to reach a zero sum.  We have made a crude assumption which is not based on evidence from agriculture.  Clearly, if we want the beef and dairy sector to continue then the target would be in that vein.  Obviously, if the country chooses not to continue, then we can apply a different target.  As I said, our focus is more on how an 80% target could be delivered in the energy system.<\/p><p>  The Senator also mentioned the electrification of heat.  Our model generated certain results in the context of the 2020 targets because we must meet an ambitious non-ETS target, and Food Harvest 2020 has other knock-on effects.  As I mentioned, emissions generated in electricity are associated with ETS.  If we use electricity for heat or transport then we will shift them from the non-ETS to the ETS sector, an option that is open to us.  I have two things to say about the electrification of heat.  First, we have about 1.6 million permanently occupied dwellings in Ireland and nearly half of them have oil-fired heating.  The amount of oil we use is unusual when compared with other EU member states, but it is the result of our housing stock being spread out.  I will outline one of the measures we could examine.  We could analyse how many of the 700,000 dwellings with oil-fired hearing are located close to the natural gas grid, and a sensible move in the short term would be to connect them to natural gas.  The initiative would immediately lead to improved efficiency and reduced emissions.  In the long-term, feeding biogas into the gas grid means that housing stock can access renewable gas.  <\/p><p>   We are examining the possibility of attaching an air source heat pump for houses located away from the gas grid.  Therefore, the electricity requirement would be drawn from the ambient air temperature.  That would be a sensible way to electrify heat in the residential stock.  We are carrying out a further analysis with other modelling tools that focus more closely on the power system and on housing and residential energy use to see which houses might be suitable.  One could adopt a strategy of aiming for larger and more inefficient houses, upgrade them to reduce their energy consumption and then electrify their heat use to see what kind of incremental gains could be obtained from energy efficiency and electrification.  That means the electrification of heat plus the gasification of heat, which is often overlooked.  <\/p><p>  Achieving the ambitious target of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050 would require electrification of heat and transport and increasing our electricity usage from 20% to 30%.  It would mean the remaining 70% would not be electricity-based but largely biomass-based.  In some areas, such as aviation, kerosene is still being used.  Electrification is only part of the story but it is an important part.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013070200015#R00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir"},{"type":"speech","time":1372783500,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I have a supplementary question.

I agree with the Senator on the need to keep a long-term perspective but to take actions now in the short term.  We would make a number of specific recommendations in terms of incentivising renewable heat, anaerobic digestion and degeneration of biogas for heat and transport.  In terms of retrofitting of buildings, the point I made earlier about electrifying and gasifying residential homes are all short-term policy measures that can help us in the transition to the long term<\/p><p>  The Senator mentioned the ocean.  She is correct.  We have a significant resource in that regard and our results do harness that, particularly offshore wind energy, but the model adopts a least cost approach.  Essentially, the model will choose the onshore resources first because they are cheaper but it will then look to the offshore wind energy.  The Senator is right that for that to happen, it needs policy support.  Otherwise, it will not happen because it is more expensive.<\/p><p>  In terms of cars, there was some political lobbying at a European level to dilute the improvements in the targets for car performance.  I do not see it as a problem.  In terms of tax revenue, the Senator is right that we generate revenue from tax but if we have appropriate mechanisms in place people will change their purchasing decisions, and we have low tax associated with cars.  The focus in terms of tax should be on the more polluting cars.  The more polluting the car, the higher the tax.  If we transition to a low carbon economy, challenges will arise in certain areas regarding revenue but I would suggest the Government continues to positively differentiate towards low emissions cars.<\/p><p>  I agree with the Senator that more anaerobic digestion needs to be happening.  One of my colleagues in University College Cork, Jerry Murphy, has done a lot of research in this area.

However, it is not the only thing there and there are other options such as, for example, natural gas with carbon capture and storage one could have coal with carbon capture and storage.  As wind energy is variable and has other issues associated with inertia it will need to be supplemented.  Our analysis suggests that were we to go down the route of using such options to complement wind, one option is to use the depleted Kinsale gas fields as a storage location for carbon dioxide and essentially to add carbon capture onto the new gas power plants in the Cork Harbour area.  Storage is another option and certainly is part of the mix.<\/p><p>  Interconnection is another part of the option because we can benefit from it.  The Danes have benefited significantly from this in their development of wind energy.  However, at present our electricity represents less than 20% of our energy use and the focus of discussion in respect of energy policy is dominated too much by electricity.  While it certainly is an important part of the issue, a bigger part pertains to what is to be done with transport and heating, which collectively represent more than 80% of energy use.  I am not quite certain what the Deputy meant by radiant heat and perhaps she might come back on that.<\/p><p>  As for the midlands, I mentioned wind energy as a success story.  Ireland has not had the same experience as the United Kingdom in this regard where they have had difficulties in developing onshore wind energy.  They have had significant campaigns against wind energy and as a result, they have been obliged to move offshore more quickly.  This is partly from where this midlands project stems, in that for the United Kingdom, the option is to build wind capacity offshore or import it directly from onshore wind in Ireland.  I agree with the Deputy that the scale of the developments proposed is something new and it is unclear how this will be received in the heel of the hunt.  Another issue with the midlands wind proposal is that if this wind energy is being used to meet the United Kingdom's targets, at a certain point in the future we will need it to meet our own targets or if we do not, we might end up with more expensive wind energy.  Consequently, in the context of our own needs, I am unsure for how long that contract will be negotiated.  Certainly, in the short term it is envisaged that the amount of wind energy available there will be surplus to what Ireland's system can accommodate but that situation is likely to change over time.<\/p><p>  As for public information, there are a number of areas from which public information should come.  The Deputy mentioned the Government and the universities and in the energy space, there is the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, the energy agency.  Similarly, public information also is provided by EirGrid, the transmission system operator and there is certainly a number of sources from which public information is and should continue to be provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013070200017#T00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir"},{"type":"speech","time":1372784700,"counter":335,"content":"<p>To revert to the question regarding radiant heat, I read about a particular type of heater, called a radiant heater, that is being used in Europe.

While essentially it is a work in progress, we have been considering its use.  Some recent natural gas-fired power stations have been built in the Cork Harbour area, which would have a high efficiency relative to many of the power plants on the system.  The idea would be to take the carbon dioxide from them, capture it and pump it into the Kinsale gas field.  The Kinsale gas field is composed of different parts and we are considering precisely the issue raised by the Deputy, namely, the scale in terms of the number of years for which we could do that.  In addition, we are considering what are the associated engineering challenges as obviously, one would wish to make sure that if it is stored there, it does not seep out and actually is sequestered.  Consequently, it is very much a work in progress but essentially is to try to address this question as to what in the power system, if wind energy is there, will complement it in the future.  Natural gas carbon capture and storage, CCS, is one option.  Biomass of course is another but this brings one back to the land-use question.  Should we use biomass for power generation, for heat or for transport?  How much land should be allocated for biomass and if there is a constraint on land use, what is the most effective way of using that biomass?  We are considering a number of options and in our model at present, we do not have biomass CCS as a technology because coal CCS and natural gas CCS are at much more developed, albeit stalled, stage of development.  However, biomass CCS would give us the prospect of having negative emissions, which would be a very nice scenario towards which to move.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013070200017#T00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir"},{"type":"speech","time":1372784700,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Has Dr. &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir undertaken the modelling that would ascertain what kind of percentage impact it would have on reaching the targets?

It is about getting information to the ordinary members of the public and using national parliaments in that process so what is the witness's view on the more effective use of that strategy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013070200004#C00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372770600,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I would appreciate if the members could remind me if I forget any of their questions.  There was a question on the level of interaction between Members of the European Parliament and Members of national parliaments.  The interaction is very useful and it should take place either in one way or another.  Members of the European Parliament should at least attend sessions in the national parliaments, although the idea that they can sometimes be a Member of a national parliament is controversial.  They should at least attend sessions, given the position of the Parliament in legislative dossiers that are being negotiated at the moment.  The European Parliament may have a different position to that of the European Council, which may be useful and increase political accountability and democratic legitimacy.  Increasing numbers of interparliamentary meetings are taking place either in Brussels when organised by the European Parliament or the rotating Presidency, which Ireland has just left with a successful record.<\/p><p>  There was a question of which initiative, so far, has been effective in improving democratic legitimacy in the European Union.  The subsidiarity checks on the political dialogue with the Commission is one such example, and checking the subsidiarity principle remains on the sidelines.  Sometimes it is a very technical exercise and although national parliaments have already been doing it, the process should be put in the context of political dialogue with the Commission.  This related to the question on the annual work programme.  If we can do this from a very early stage, there can be a capacity of the national parliament not only to scrutinise what is happening in the Council but also what European institutions think about this.  There would also be a capacity to react and influence governments in order to shape a final outcome, which is very important.  It would be a very successful initiative.<\/p><p>  There is still much to consider in how the Commission reacts as it is not just receiving recent opinions on compliance with the principle of subsidiarity; it is also taking comments on the substance of the proposal.  The Commission should increase resources to accommodate all the comments from national parliaments, as sometimes such suggestions can be helpful and useful.  The Commission always sends a letter taking good account of comments received but perhaps it should move to explain whether it takes into account any such comment or suggestion from a national parliament, and in what way that happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013070200004#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sonia Piedrafita"},{"type":"speech","time":1372770600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>On that point, does the witness consider there are enough reasoned opinions coming from national parliaments to assist the depth of scrutiny that surrounds subsidiarity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013070200004#C00500","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372770600,"counter":381,"content":"<p>Many national parliaments, such as the Spanish Parliament, do not send a reasoned opinion unless it is negative.

The total number of occasions on which national parliaments have used the additional power that is available to them under the Lisbon treaty is one, and that related to the Monti proposals that were put forward.  They never even got to the dialogue point with the Commission because the Commission withdrew the proposals when all the parliaments submitted their observations.  I am aware that a critical mass of national parliaments must be reached for the system to be triggered - I believe it is one third - but is that not a very low figure?  Given everything that has happened in the last 18 to 24 months, the system has only been triggered on a single occasion and when it was triggered, it did not even develop because the Commission withdrew its proposals.  In view of the huge amount of activity across the European Union over the last 18 months why do you think national parliaments have only triggered their right to intervene on a single occasion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013070200005#D00400","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372771200,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I will start with the last question.  Perhaps the European Union is not doing that badly regarding the subsidiarity principle.  Perhaps it is complying with its role quite well.  On the occasion you mentioned, the Danish national parliament was very active in convincing, through interparliamentary co-operation, all the national parliaments to cite it and to send a negative reasoned opinion.  That is very difficult to do and it is not likely to happen.  It was an exceptional circumstance.  National parliaments carry out the subsidiarity checks on the proposals on which they want to carry them out so, first, it is difficult to see how they all decide to carry out the checks on the same proposal.  Indeed, the Commission publishes a report explaining which proposals were subject to a subsidiarity check and many of them do not receive a subsidiarity check by more than two or three member states, so that also makes it difficult to happen.  There is a third factor, which is the way national parliaments work.  In many member states they have a majority supporting their governments so it is very unlikely that if a government votes for something in the Council the national parliament will say that it does not comply with the subsidiarity principle, because it is their own party that has the majority in most cases in the national parliament.  That is the third reason it only happened once, but I was even very surprised that it happened once.  It was a sign that it can happen again and it is an alarm bell for the Commission that it can happen, so it must do better.<\/p><p>  Regarding the weight of the big parties among the European Union political parties-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013070200005#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sonia Piedrafita"},{"type":"speech","time":1372771200,"counter":387,"content":"<p>The big countries and the big parties within big countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013070200005#D00600","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372771200,"counter":388,"content":"<p>That is a problem.

Recent national contests are signalling that radical parties with their rather anti-European discourse are winning votes and seats in national elections.  If that happens in the European elections also, with many people unhappy because of the austerity measures, or the bailouts in the rich countries, the electoral systems in member states are rather proportional and therefore it would be very easy for those bodies to get representation in the European Parliament, perhaps easier than in the national elections.  If that happens, that would pose a risk in terms of decision-making in the European Parliament, with high representation from parties that are not that European or pro-integration.  Sometimes they are not that democratic or they do not defend democratic principles.  That is a risk, and I do not believe we are aware of that risk or perhaps we are turning a blind eye to it when it is an issue that should worry us more than it does at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013070200006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sonia Piedrafita"},{"type":"speech","time":1372771800,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Do colleagues have any further questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013070200006#E00400","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1372771800,"counter":393,"content":"<p>One final question-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013070200006#E00500","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1372771800,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I will take members in order.

Dr. Gerard Hogan, an expert witness in the case, stated that at least &ldquo;a tenable argument could be made to the effect that the foetus was not an unborn for the purposes of Article 40.3.30.&rdquo;  He asserted that the argument that the protection afforded to the unborn attached to a viable foetus was a matter which would have received serious consideration by an Irish court.<\/p><p>  I come from the same perspective as Deputy Seamus Healy and many others on this issue in that it ought to be addressed.

It is harrowing to hear the testimony of women and their husbands or partners who speak of bringing their dead babies home in the boot of the car, or waiting for DHL to deliver their babies' ashes.

Some women have to wait for protracted periods of time - up to five or six weeks - while they wait for the inevitable miscarriage of their baby.  Why are we not giving greater certainty to women who find themselves in the awfully traumatic circumstances of losing a baby?  There is no need to prolong something that is sadly going to end.  I do not understand why we are not seeking to clarify that for women.  I have personal experience of this.  One is sent home from hospital with medication, and it does not work.

I have listened carefully to what the Minister and the Minister of State have said.  Neither of them said they believed an amendment in relation to fatal foetal abnormalities would contravene Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution.  The Minister of State, Deputy White, said we cannot take the risk that it might be found to be unconstitutional, but he did not say he thought it would be unconstitutional.  I remind the Minister and the Minister of State that when Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness gave evidence to the Joint Committee on Health and Children on the issue of term limits during the second set of hearings, she made the point that it was open to the Oireachtas to make legislation and allow it to be tested at Supreme Court level.  If that point applies to term limits, surely we could go down the same avenue in this instance.  If that is not the case, perhaps the Minister or the Minister of State might clarify the reasons.  Do they believe it would be unconstitutional to draft an amendment along those lines?  That is not what has come across here   There seems to have been a nuanced change in the Government's position on this aspect of the matter since the initial discussions on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070200006#F00500","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1372786200,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I am not satisfied with the response of either Minister on these amendments.  Many people who have anti-abortion views that differ considerably from my pro-choice position would feel that this aspect of the matter needs to be addressed.  I do not think either Minister is doing that sufficiently.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has described what we are subjecting women to as intolerable cruelty.  The United Nations and other organisations have defined it as being akin to torture.  It is cruel and degrading to force a woman to continue with a pregnancy, being congratulated by people, etc., even though she knows she will have no baby at the end of it.  Such horrendous cruelty is beyond imagination.  Approximately 1,500 individuals and their partners go through this every year.  I do not accept that further delays in dealing with this are needed.  The responses of the Ministers have made me more convinced that we can provide for this from a couple of points of view.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, made the point that the purpose of this Bill is to clarify existing rights, basically as set out in the X case judgment, in legislation.  That is the backdrop to the introduction of this Bill.  Nothing in that statement precludes us from providing for terminations in other areas.  The Government has a choice.  It has chosen not to use this opportunity to include such a provision.  The Minister of State highlighted clearly the argument made by the State in the D case.  It is important to remind the committee that the State referred in that instance to \"the potential\" or scope for \"further development of the law\" and said serious consideration would be given to that possibility.  Basically, the State was saying it is possible to provide for terminations in this scenario within the confines of our existing constitutional arrangement.  I would argue there is always a risk with everything we do constitutionally.  I would prefer to take that risk, to be honest.<\/p><p>  I would not normally trust the Supreme Court, but it came up with the original X case ruling which provided that the risk to a woman's life does not need to be \"immediate\" or \"inevitable\".  I do not think that aspect of the judgment has been fully factored into this Bill.  The court was able to interpret the law in that regard.  I would be quite confident that the court could facilitate a provision such as that we are proposing.  A great deal of legal opinion would agree that it is possible to legislate for this within the confines of the Constitution.  Rather than merely offering sympathy to pregnant women in these circumstances, should we not err on the side of legislating in this manner in deference to them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070200006#F00600","speaker":"1015","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372786800,"counter":495,"content":"<p>We are discussing this because very brave women who faced a horrendous, cruel and unacceptable situation had the courage to come forward and tell of their truly tragic circumstances, when they had wanted pregnancies but received a diagnosis that the foetus they were carrying had a condition that was incompatible with life.  I repeat, incompatible with life.  That is the key phrase which underlines the fact that legislating for terminations in this very particular and tragic situation is not in conflict with the constitutional requirement to uphold the right to life of the unborn because we are talking about a foetus that has a condition that is incompatible with life.  Therefore there is no clash.  There is a very strong legal argument to support that view that this is compatible with the existing Constitution, and let us remember that if we do not explore the possibility at least of including this in the legislation we are consigning more women every day to continue to go through these cruel and unacceptable circumstances.

The law likes to deal with certainties.  This point is made time and again.  That makes it very difficult to deal particularly with inevitable miscarriage because that diagnosis is not always correct.  It nearly always is but not always.  That raises serious issues in the law, not insurmountable ones but ones that are beyond the scope of this Bill.  In respect of the idea that, as Deputy Naughten referred to, the retired Supreme Court judge, Ms McGuinness, said, try it in the courts, the advice I have is that is not wise and we are not going there.  I will take the advice from my Attorney General.  I have to bear in mind that if this Bill is referred to the Supreme Court and is struck down on a point of law where I have been given advice and did not take that advice that would be very serious from my point of view.  That is not a reasonable thing to do.  That is not to disrespect other people's points of view or other people's legal views.<\/p><p>  Deputy Daly talked about rape and incest etc.  Clearly these are very serious situations but they are beyond the scope of this Bill and we have made it very clear that this Bill aims to clarify the law as requested by the European Court of Human Rights.  I will be the first to acknowledge that the European Court of Human Rights did not specify that we need legislation but it was the view of the expert group in its deliberations that legislation and regulation was the best possible approach to take and that is why we have taken that approach.  We have been very careful to put as much as possible into the primary legislation, leaving very little for the regulations.  Clearly, the areas that have been mentioned are outside the scope of this Bill.  Deputy Daly mentioned that there are 1,500 such cases a year.  I am pretty sure that is not accurate and I will ask her later where those figures come from.  I have no wish to embarrass anybody but it strikes me as an extraordinarily high figure which I do not see anywhere else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070200007#G01200","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372787400,"counter":507,"content":"<p>To the extent that Deputy Clare Daly suggests that we have chosen not to do this in circumstances where we know we could, I reject that.  That is not the case.  I, too, know persons quite close to me who have been affected by this particular circumstance that members have described here and the humanity of it.  So far as I, as a man, can ever understand it, I am aware of exactly what Deputy Boyd Barrett and others have described here in terms of the experiences of people I know.<\/p><p>  If I thought that this could be achieved within this legislation, I can assure the committee that I would be pressing hard for it to be done.  I do not believe that it can be done.  The reason, merely to remind ourselves again, is that when the people put this provision into the Constitution in 1983, they put an enormously effective and restrictive measure into the Constitution which prohibited abortion in practically every circumstance that was imaginable apart from the one with which we are dealing in this legislation which is where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother that can only be averted through a termination.  When I say, \"effective\", it was intended to be restrictive and it has had that effect, save the very restricted circumstances with which we are dealing arising from the X case.  It only allows a termination in circumstances, as I have stated, where there is a risk to the life of the mother.  That is what the people decided in 1983.<\/p><p>  Can I just say, since the issue has been raised and since we are having a frank discussion, I hope that issue is revisited in the future as I hope that clause in the Constitution is revisited.  However, in the meantime, I have huge respect for this document, including parts of it that were put in by the people that I did not agree with, but it is in the Constitution and we must uphold it.  In particular, members of the Government must uphold it.  I would suggest the Oireachtas does as well, irrespective of how troubling it is that we cannot extend the provisions that we are making here to the circumstances that have been so well described by the Deputies, and I do not disagree with them or the strength of the submissions that have been made.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Boyd Barrett's point about constitutional certainty, members of Government, Attorneys General and judges, are human beings.  They strive to do the best they can.  The Minister and the Government are saying that we have done everything.  Every aspect of this proposed legislation has been gone through and carefully discussed and considered by the Attorney General as to its constitutionality, but one does not know definitively whether something is constitutional until it is tested by the Supreme Court.  It is being advocated here that we should allow the matter to go back to the Supreme Court prior to enacting this legislation, in other words, we should either take a chance that the Supreme Court will say it is all right or pause this process and find some way of getting that issue before the Supreme Court.  That is really what is being suggested here.  That is not a sustainable argument.<\/p><p>  On the point in relation to the European Court of Human Rights and the D case and how that came up in the court, it came up because what was being argued before the court was that the applicant D had not exhausted all her domestic remedies.  What the Irish Government was saying in Strasbourg was that she could have a chance of this issue being dealt with in her favour in the Supreme Court and that it is possible, but, as I have stated, we cannot proceed on the basis of something that is possible and that might be decided by the Supreme Court.  We cannot do that in legislation, particularly when one looks at how profoundly restrictive is the provision in the Constitution that the people put in there.  That is the position with which we must deal.  I find it in part very troubling, but we cannot operate on the basis that we ignore what the Constitution says.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070200008#H00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1372787400,"counter":508,"content":"<p>Did the Attorney General advise that this was unlikely to get past the Supreme Court or that it was not a good idea to bring it forward?

The point we are making to him here is that there is very substantial legal support, argument and advice that this provision we propose to allow for terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormality also have a good chance - nothing is certain, as the Minister of State, Deputy White, stated - of passing muster legally.

It would appear that unless we deal with it now, the position will remain that medical conditions due to pregnancy that are not in themselves life-threatening - for example, miscarriage - must be allowed to become life-threatening before action can be taken.

Sadly, it merely was not part of the parlance or of the issues of debate and discussion.  Therefore, as with every other political party, there are views this way and there are views that way, and without the certainty of policy, it puts me in a very difficult position.  However, I have articulated my own view internally and I am sharing it with colleagues here.

In the context of the current situation, Deputy Ciara Conway put it well when talking about the practical challenges that exist where women must go to England and must use the services of DHL or a similar company to bring the remains back.

This amendment tries to address the issue of potential late-term abortions.  It is not the intention of the Government to provide legislation that facilitates late-term abortions.  Everyone is in agreement with it and no one is in dispute.  The difficulty is that the way the legislation was drafted means only the Medical Council prohibits late-term abortions taking place.  Naturally, the rules and regulations of the Medical Council can change and have changed over time.  Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith provided evidence to this committee on the point that there is no gestational limit.  The Government has made the argument that it cannot legally include a gestational limit based on the X case determination.  I am including an amendment to the definition, in respect of reasonable opinion, that deletes &quot;as far as practicable&quot;.<\/p><p>  I can provide a potential example, which I outlined on Second Stage.  A woman is suicidal because she has a foetus with a serious abnormality and a limited lifespan following birth.  If the woman, who does not have an underlying mental health issue, goes to a psychiatrist and says she is suicidal and does not want to give birth to the baby and that the possibility of giving birth to a baby with a limited lifespan is causing her suicidal ideation, the only way to fulfil the needs of this woman, who does not want to give birth, is to ensure the foetus is not viable <i>in utero<\/i>.  This is especially the case if we are talking about late-term pregnancy.  Foetal abnormalities are usually identified in the third trimester when they are on the cusp of viability or are viable.  The definition of reasonable opinion, as currently drafted, allows for the foetus to be terminated <i>in utero<\/i> so that the foetus is not born alive because &quot;as far as practicable&quot; is included in the definition.  The consultant psychiatrist can say that it is not practicable to give birth to this foetus because, on its birth, that will be the reason for the suicidal ideation.  I am trying to provide clarity.<\/p><p>  The heads of the Bill state:<blockquote>This emphasis on preserving unborn human life as far as practicable governs the actual medical procedure &ndash; the termination of pregnancy only and not whether there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  In circumstances where the unborn may be potentially viable outside the womb, doctors must make all efforts to sustain its life after delivery.  However, that requirement does not go so far as to oblige a medical practitioner to disregard a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman on the basis that it will result in the death of the unborn. <\/blockquote>There is a need for clarity on the definition of unborn.  If the words &quot;as far as practicable&quot; are left in legislation, there is a risk it could allow for late-term abortions.  If the Minister has another mechanism to deal with it, I am happy to deal with it in that way.  The difficulty is that it is a problem as currently drafted and it must be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070200011#L00500","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1372789200,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I will deal with amendment Nos. 7 and 10 and Deputy Billy Kelleher will deal with amendments Nos. 27, 31 and 45.

Section 5 refers to other treatments that have an equal effect but do not result in the death of the unborn, in which case those treatments must take preference.  People have been postulating that medical treatment may be more effective in treating suicidal ideation than abortion, which many psychiatrists believe is not a treatment at all.  The person presenting may not have any obligation, nor does the doctor, to take that into consideration in making the decision.  It seems reasonable to me that if the doctor believes there is a better treatment, which does not result in the loss of the life of the unborn, the doctor cannot then say that he or she will not bother with the treatment and will recommend abortion.

It is not about meeting the need but averting the risk to the life of the mother.

I have some sympathy for it, but I cannot accept it, as currently worded.<\/p> <p>I intend to table an amendment in this area on Report Stage.  The Deputy would be surprised at how complex this area is and on how the balancing of rights within the Bill must be carefully adjudicated.  There has been much discussion with the Attorney General on this and we are probably coming near to an agreement on a wording that could satisfy the sentiment here.  That said, I am not in a position to accept any of these amendments.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 6, 7, 10, 27, 31 and 45 seek to strengthen the Bill's provisions relating to the right to life of the unborn.  The use of the phrase \"as far as practicable\" in legislation reflects the wording used in Article 40.3.3&deg;.  I am aware that concerns have been raised around the need to insert a gestational limit on carrying out medical procedures covered by the Bill.  In this regard it is important to stress again that the proposed legislation only covers situations in which there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of a pregnant woman which may only be averted by termination of the pregnancy.  To be clear, it will only allow a pregnancy to be terminated in situations where it is expected that a woman would otherwise die.  It must equally be stated that a woman has a right to a termination but neither she nor anybody else has a right to terminate the life of a child or a viable child that is born.<\/p><p> With regard to the Deputy's other amendments, it is very clear that the life of the child, once born, must be sustained if it is at all viable.  It should also be clarified that in such situations while a woman has a right to have the pregnancy brought to an end the provisions in the Bill intend to ensure that in circumstances where the unborn might be potentially viable outside the womb, doctors must make all efforts to sustain it after delivery.  It has been suggested that the legislation should include a clear provision to that effect and an explicit reference to viability.  As currently drafted the Bill prohibits the killing of a viable foetus and including a reference to viability would not provide any further clarity in that respect as different pregnancies become viable at different points in their development and a clinical foetal assessment would still be required, as it is now.  To put it in common parlance, nobody has a right, be they the mother, obstetrician, a doctor or any citizen of this State or other, to end the life of a newborn baby that is viable.<\/p><p> In circumstances where the unborn might be potentially viable outside the womb doctors must make all efforts to sustain its life after delivery.  However, that requirement does not go so far as to oblige a medical practitioner to disregard a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman on the basis that it will result in the death of the unborn.  Essentially, the decision to be reached is not so much a balancing of the competing rights, rather it is a clinical assessment as to whether the mother's life, as opposed to her health, is threatened by a real and substantial risk that can only be averted by a termination of the pregnancy.<\/p><p> In addition, the Bill makes it clear that only medical practitioners on the register established under section 43 of the 2007 Act can make the relevant medical assessment.  These provisions were made to ensure that the medical practitioners who will implement the Bill will follow best medical practice.  In the Bill \"registered medical practitioner\" means a doctor registered by the Medical Council under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  This definition refers to a person permitted by law to practise as a medical practitioner in the State.  In the performance of their professional activities all such medical practitioners are, as a matter of law, subject to the ethical and professional control of the Medical Council.  This is a key point.  Practice will change and evolve as modern technology improves and changes.  We cannot prescribe in law for something that could change next month in the prescriptive manner being suggested.<\/p><p> With regard to the second proposal, the Bill makes it explicitly clear that a medical procedure in the course of which or as a result of which an unborn life is ended is only permissible if the risk to the pregnant woman's life can only be averted by such a medical procedure.  This is the critical point.  If alternative options are available to the medical practitioners and they go ahead with such a procedure, they will be in breach of the proposed legislation.  Therefore, I urge members of the committee not to support the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070200012#M00700","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372790400,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

The normal medical procedure in late term is induction, which is to induce the birth at an earlier stage than 40 weeks gestation.  In those circumstances, that foetus could potentially be viable outside the womb and would have legal protection once born.  If the psychiatrist is of the view that the process whereby the woman physically gives birth to a live baby is the basis of her suicidal intent, under the definition of reasonable opinion as it is currently worded is there not a responsibility to ensure that the foetus is not born alive because, from a practical point of view in respect of that particular woman, to give birth to that baby is the reason she has that suicidal intent?

I think there is a body of legal opinion that would accept that the standard of good faith is more subjective and that what is being sought - I imagine by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v as well as myself - is a standard requiring more objectivity or reference to objectivity.  For example, the 2009 Medical Council guidelines stipulate that psychiatrists undertake a full assessment of any suicide risk in light of the clinical research on this issue.  Clinical research is an objective standard.  The reason we are here is to codify a situation that has been unsatisfactory, but equally, we are given assurances that it is restrictive.  That being the case, why do we have to imply something rather than stating it explicitly?  We are talking about best clinical practice because the good faith argument and the use of that term in medical negligence cases has evolved to a point of requiring reasonable objectivity on the part of the medical practitioner.  Good faith in case law, at least in part, would be seen as more of a subjective test.  This speaks to the standard to which we require medical practitioners to operate.  As I have explained in person to the Minister, I would be more comforted if we had reference to an objective standard here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070200017#R00200","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1372792800,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I am aware of Deputy Mulherin's concerns in this regard and I understand them.  I have been reflecting on this.  When we talk about clinical research we talk about a more objective base.  That can often be to do with clinical research around medications and how they work.  However, clinical research around assessing suicide is subjective.  I do not believe that referring to it in the context of this Bill will advance the Bill.  I think the Attorney General is of a similar view.  Because of its subjectivity this whole area is the reason we have two psychiatrists involved in the certification process and also the reason for a second opinion, as opposed to any idea that a contemporaneous assessment could be done.  The Bill explicitly states that a psychiatrist will have to form an opinion and that must be a reasonable opinion following a full assessment.  This will take some time as it cannot be done in a morning.  A second opinion must then be obtained.  The two must jointly certify subsequently.  I understand clearly what has been said, but not all clinical research is objective, and certainly not that which deals with assessing suicide risk and ideation, because it is a question of assessing someone with suicidal ideation and determining the risk it presents in terms of the intent to take one's own life.  We talk a lot about suicide, which is a subject that causes much pain in Irish life today, and it requires much more research.  I and my colleagues - particularly the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch - are determined to address it.  I do not wish to give the impression that this Bill is in any way changing our approach to the treatment of the threat of suicide or how it is assessed.  Rather, it underpins and underscores the fact that it is a very real problem in Irish society, albeit one that is quite rare in pregnancy, and also one that is extremely difficult to assess.  We do not have any biochemical markers and we have very little clinical research that is based on objectivity.  There is a lot of research around the subject, but to say that it is absolutely hard evidence is difficult.  However, I do not profess to be a psychiatrist, notwithstanding the fact that I spent 20 years visiting St. Ita's hospital as a visiting GP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070200017#R00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1372792800,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I reiterate that we have discussed the issue of certainty.  We all recognise that it is very difficult to attain certainty in practically any part of this area of discussion.  We want to strive for and to achieve it as best we can.  I agree with Deputy Mulherin that there is an element of subjectivity in the notion of good faith.  It has a high measure of subjectivity in the sense that one cannot look into another person's mind.  I suppose one could perhaps demonstrate afterwards that the circumstances proved that the person was not in fact acting in good faith.  To return to the point being suggested, that we insert the phrase \"best medical practice\", one would have to define medical best practice.  One could not possibly leave a phrase such as \"best medical practice\" at large; it would have to be defined.  How it would be defined could only be based on the tools already available, which are the standards set by the professions that are sometimes tested in cases of medical negligence.  If this committee or any committee were to sit down and put together a booklet of what constitutes best medical practice, whom would we ask?  We would have to ask the professional bodies and the colleges of practitioners, the GPs, the psychiatrists, the obstetricians and gynaecologists.  We would have to bring them to the committee and ask their opinion of what is best medical practice in any particular instance.

This whole conversation is not much comfort, as we are trying to make sure this is a restrictive regime, but the Medical Council in its guidelines is saying that the assessment by psychiatrists should be based on clinical research.  I refer to the many people who have a problem with the suicide ground.  I would be quite happy if every practitioner who is a professional psychiatrist accepted that at a certain point a woman would actually require a termination.

First, I intend to bring forward an amendment which would insert a definition of \"appropriately qualified practitioner\" in line 25 of page 5.  This relates to other amendments we will propose further down the road.  In some places the current draft Bill is too prescriptive about who the practitioners should be.  We need to debate that and I will propose that we have a heading that refers to a definition of appropriately qualified practitioners.  That would include general practitioners, medical practitioners, midwives, obstetricians, gynaecologists and so on.  That relates to other matters.  I will also table an amendment on the definition of the unborn in section 2 which is problematic in that it defines human life as beginning at the point of implantation.  This is a contentious issue to say the least and may cause problems in dealing with the issue of inevitable miscarriage and fatal foetal abnormalities that I would like to see dealt with.  Many others have expressed their willingness to deal with this further down the line, whether in this legislation or elsewhere.<\/p><p>  Finally, the issue we discussed earlier in respect of section 2 for the Government to consider, will be the subject of some amendment.  In fact the Minister prompted the thought.  He has referred constantly to viable life as the key definition.  To Deputies who were concerned about what the Minister described as a misplaced fear that a baby that was born might be destroyed, he referred to viable life as the key issue.  Working in another direction, that definition is very significant in terms of the debate we had about fatal foetal abnormalities because while the Minister rightly used that definition it also has an impact on the debate about whether the Minister's legal advice on fatal foetal abnormalities is correct if we talk about pregnancies in which the life is not viable and therefore there is not a clash with the right to life of the unborn because there is not a viable life.  We are not talking about a viable life.  I want to signal my intention on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070200019#T00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1372794000,"counter":661,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 11:<blockquote><br \/>In page 7, lines 22 and 23, to delete &ldquo;, or by another person pursuant to an arrangement entered into under section 38 of the Health Act 2004&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>This amendment seeks to limit the place where any of these procedures could be carried out to an institution managed by the HSE and to make it impossible for it to be done in private institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070200019#T00500","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1372794000,"counter":662,"content":"<p>This amendment aims to remove from the definition of appropriate institution those hospitals that are not owned by the HSE.

This amendment would have grave consequences for the safety of women in the Dublin region and beyond and therefore I cannot support it.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Deputy may wish to note that, as currently drafted, the names of all institutions which will be permitted to carry out the medical procedure referred to in this legislation lawfully have been listed in a Schedule to the Bill and any changes to these provisions will require approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas which should give him considerable comfort.<\/p><p>  I take this opportunity to say that there will be a need for some technical amendments to that list on Report Stage because, believe it or not, the names of some of these hospitals are quite complex when one goes back to their original legal standing and charters, etc., and it is not as simple as it appears, even though it seems ludicrous that it is not so.  For clarity, there are several women - there have been five already this year of whom I know and possibly more since I last checked - whose children had to be delivered in a model 4 hospital, such as St. James's or Beaumont because of serious co-morbidity around their cardiac status or indeed some young women with cystic fibrosis.

First, I believe that regulations on a piece of legislation such as this should have a positive vote of the Oireachtas.  The Minister, in his contribution to amendment No. 11, gave the impression that regulations would be brought back before the Oireachtas.  As the legislation is currently drafted, that is not the case; instead, they would be laid before the Oireachtas.  In such a case the Opposition would be required to table a motion - usually in Private Members' time, because it is not normally given permission by the Government to move one in Government time - to strike out that statutory instrument and ministerial order.  That is the difficulty.  My amendment would provide that if the Minister wished to include other institutions in the list of those approved to carry out these procedures, or to make any other regulations that were required, he or she would have to table a motion before the House and get its approval.  It would help to provide clarity and a safety net for some who have concerns about the legislation.<\/p><p>  The second reason I tabled this amendment is that in December last when the Government made its initial decision, which was for a twin-track approach involving primary legislation and regulation, the Taoiseach made it quite clear that both would be published in tandem and that we would have the secondary legislation for consideration along with the primary legislation.  As the Minister will be aware, this is an issue I flagged on Second Stage, when I seemed to get an indication from the Aire St&aacute;it that there was an intention to produce regulations.  However, we are on Committee Stage and we still have not seen those regulations.  It would help to provide some of the clarity that is required regarding the implementation of this legislation.  In view of the fact that under the legislation as currently drafted the regulation will be laid before the House rather than approved by the House, it is imperative that those regulations be made available to us to consider in tandem with the primary legislation.  However, this has not happened.  I urge the Minister to accept my amendment and allow for the regulations to be formally laid before and approved by the House prior to their enactment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070200020#U03100","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1372795200,"counter":702,"content":"<p>A similar issue arose on the Animal Health Bill.  We have a problem with regulations being made all the time.  They are signed and there is the negative idea that one does not annul them.  I made a suggestion on that Bill somewhat similar to the one made by Deputy Denis Naughten, but with a variation, that before regulations could be signed by the Minister, draft regulations be brought before the appropriate Oireachtas committee, in this case, the Joint Committee on Health and Children, for debate.  We are doing this in dealing with European Union legislation.  When all such legislation is brought before us, we are advised in some cases that no further action is required and in others that we should have an input.  In general, it is not specific to this Bill, but as part of our approach to D&aacute;il reform, we should be proactive about regulations.  I ask the Minister to consider, in the spirit of what Deputy Denis Naughten has said, bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage to provide that any regulation made under this Bill would be brought before the appropriate committee of the House for debate, before being signed, and that he would take into account its recommendations.  That would reassure people tremendously and it would be good practice, if it was provided for systematically in all new Bills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070200021#V00100","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1372795200,"counter":703,"content":"<p>The amendments proposed by Deputies Denis Naughten and &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v are unnecessary because the regulations to be made under this Bill will pertain solely to the prescribed forms, in other words, the forms to be used in certification, for notification and to apply for a formal medical review.  Everything else is included in the primary legislation.  That is much preferable to having secondary legislation also.  We have managed to include everything in the primary legislation.  I repeat that the regulations to be made under the Bill will only relate to the prescribed forms.  The standard procedures for the approval of regulations will be sufficient.

My experience of laying regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas is that because they are not brought before a committee or dealt with in a plenary session of the Houses, many Deputies have complained during the years that they missed regulations because of the hundreds of documents placed in the Oireachtas Library.  In the case of EU legislation, we found that it was much better to place it before the appropriate committee in order that people would know about it and that they would not be able to argue they had not been warned.  I hear what the Minister has said about the forms and accept it.  However, given that he can change the list of hospitals in the Schedule, it would be preferable if the regulations were brought to the committee for debate before signing them.  It would be a small step and allay people's fears that they could be signed, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and missed by everybody.

There is at this time no proposal to add an institution; therefore, no regulations are contemplated, as I understand it, to add a hospital.  Is the Deputy proposing an amendment to section 3 to provide that were the Minister to propose to add an institution, the regulations should be brought before the Houses?  Is the Deputy proposing that the adding of one or two institutions be the subject of a debate in the Houses?  As that is one issue I have not discussed with the Minister, I am on somewhat of a limb.  My personal view is that it would be excessive, given that if the Minister were to issue an order, it would be laid before the Houses for a period of three weeks and if somebody had an objection to it, he or she could say a particular hospital should not be added to the list.  That is what we are talking about.  <\/p><p>  Let me make one general point as Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke generally about committees and legislation.  We are talking about statutory instruments.  Without being political at this late hour, the Government has initiated serious reforms in the scrutiny of legislation; in fact, this legislation has been the subject of considerable pre-legislative scrutiny at the committee.  When I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, we also did that in respect of various legislative items.  That is already happening and is a very good advance.  However, if all statutory instruments were to be the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny in committees, it would be an enormous additional volume of work for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070200021#V01100","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1372795200,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I am conscious that we are approaching 10 p.m., at which time we have agreed to finish.

If there is no issue with this, it would take the committee exactly 30 seconds to sort the matter out; if there is an issue of concern, it could be debated and the committee could make recommendations to the Minister.  When I was Minister, I brought draft regulations before the relevant committee, to which I listened and I amended them.  I found it to be a very good exercise and one that saved future difficulty.
