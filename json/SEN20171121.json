It relates to the sports capital allocations and other governmental allocations from the Minister of State's Department, specifically the matter of a bond being held against the allocation of funding made to sporting and other organisations by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  I have two examples to share.  I raise the first on behalf of Councillor Sorcha O'Neill of Kildare County Council who is in the Public Gallery this afternoon.<\/p> <p>In 2002, a capital allocation of &euro;640,000 was given by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to Kill International Equestrian Centre, one of the conditions of the funding being that a charge in favour of the State body be placed on the property for a period of at least ten years.  That ten-year period expired in 2013 and a release was executed.  Shortly thereafter, miraculously, the facility, having benefitted from this significant State investment, was sold at a huge profit.  That is not right and should not be allowed to happen.  The second instance involves a project in my own county of Donegal where F&aacute;ilte Ireland provided funding in the region of &euro;1 million to a development that was sold earlier this year, inside the ten-year bond execution.<\/p> <p>I hope the Minister of State will agree to review the existing provisions.  Councillor O'Neill informs me that in the case of the lotto grants given by Rehab, the bond condition extends to any point in the future rather than expiring after ten years.  The sports capital grant programme and, by extension, the F&aacute;ilte Ireland grant programme, was introduced by the then Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Dr. James McDaid, in 1998.  It has been hugely successful but, 19 years later, there is a need to review this particular clause.  Sporting, charitable organisations and community organisations that draw down funding under the scheme may subsequently find themselves in financial difficulty and having to sell their projects on.  The problem, however, is that as a result of the State investment, those projects are worth more money.<\/p> <p>In conjunction with reviewing the bond clause, consideration might also be given to providing additional departmental assistance to sporting and community organisations that find themselves in difficulty to find more efficient and effective ways of managing their operations.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State indicate whether any asset tracking is done by his Department in respect of the number of projects that have received State funding and were subsequently sold for private gain?  Is any type of score card kept showing those figures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017112100002#B00100","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1511274600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Domhnaill as ucht an t-&aacute;bhar seo a ard&uacute; inniu.  I am currently up to my eyes in sports capital applications and, all going well, will be in a position to begin allocating funding by the end of the week.  This year we had 2,320 applications from across the country, the largest number we have ever had, with a total value of &euro;155 million.  Initially we had a budget of only &euro;30 million, which would have made it extremely difficult to meet the demand.  Fortunately, the Government was able to increase that allocation in the budget to &euro;60 million in total.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Brendan Griffin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2333\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2333&amp;amp;pid=BrendanGriffinFG&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is an additional &euro;30 million.  We expect that to break down into &euro;56 million for local projects and &euro;4 million for the regional non-local projects.  It is the main vehicle for the Government to assist grassroots sport with capital projects.  We also, of course, fund Sport Ireland to the tune of almost &euro;50 million per annum.  The sports capital programme is very important.  Since the Senator's fellow county man introduced the scheme in 1998, some &euro;911 million has been distributed to clubs throughout the country, and this current round will bring the amount to almost &euro;1 billion.  It is a very impressive amount of money.<\/p><p>In answer to the Senator's final question, I am not currently aware of the number of organisations that have been subsequently sold into private hands, but I will seek them out.  It is something I would be interested in knowing about, and of course I would share the Senator's concern about protecting the public finances and public money. <\/p><p>Technically, in order to secure the State's investment in facilities aided by sports capital programme grants, a deed of covenant and charge is put in place once accumulated grants to a particular club or organisation exceed a certain threshold.  Currently the threshold is set at &euro;300,000.  This creates a charge over the property in favour of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport up to the value of the total sports capital programme grants allocated to the club or organisation.  The charge comes into effect in the event that the property ceases to be used for the purposes for which the grant was awarded within 15 years.  This period can be extended in cases of larger grants.  That is something that I think is positive, however the threshold is perhaps something we could look at.  The figure of &euro;300,000 is a lot of money, particularly in the current context, where &euro;150,000 is the maximum amount available to any applicant in the local scheme.  That is worthy of review, and I will seek such a review to see if there can be a change.  However, I do note that the 15-year period is five years longer than the period that is in place with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  <\/p><p>Regarding F&aacute;ilte Ireland grants, my role and the role of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, does not particularly involve the administration of grants, but rather the setting of general policy.  We are not directly involved in setting the terms and conditions for grants allocated by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  However, I can confirm that like the charge required under the sports capital programme, F&aacute;ilte Ireland requires a legal agreement incorporating a charge over a portion of grant-aided lands.  This period is normally ten years, as it was in the case of the example cited by the Senator just now. <\/p><p>For larger capital grants, it is F&aacute;ilte Ireland's policy to acquire a charge on the grant-aided property, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland's permission is required for any sale while the charge is in place.  During the ten-year period of the grant, F&aacute;ilte Ireland would only consider agreeing to a sale where the prospective purchaser consents to adhere to the terms and conditions of the original letter of offer for the remaining term of the grant period.  The prospective purchaser would also be required to provide appropriate security to F&aacute;ilte Ireland during that period.  In the event of a breach of the original agreement, F&aacute;ilte Ireland would be entitled to seek repayment of the grant. <\/p><p>In the case referred to by the Senator, I am informed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland that a deed of discharge was executed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in August 2013 as the grant conditions had been fully complied with.  Again, however, I would be very open to reviewing the period of time required, and to ensuring that the thresholds are such that public moneys are protected to the optimum level.<\/p><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  It is something that is particularly pertinent at the moment, given where we are in the sports capital programme cycle, and it is something that I will certainly pursue further. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017112100002#B00200","speaker":"1318","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511274600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Very briefly, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017112100002#C00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1511274600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I want to thank the Minister of State, because he has been very constructive, engaging and open this afternoon.

Disablement benefit has been a very welcome development for many ex-miners.  I live a short distance from Arigna, which is in the vicinity of north Roscommon, south Sligo and Leitrim, and many men worked hard in the mines all their lives to provide for their families.  Unfortunately, many suffered severe illnesses due to working long hours in the mines.  As one can imagine, they had to work in very difficult conditions, resulting in health consequences.<\/p> <p>In 2010 the national coal miners' group secured agreement that the Department of Health would extend disablement benefit to former miners suffering from the prescribed occupational disease pneumoconiosis, known as \"black lung disease\".  Since this development seven years ago, which I strongly lobbied for on behalf of miners, hundreds of miners across the country have applied for disablement benefit, not just those who had been employed at Arigna but also those who had worked at Castlecomer, Ballingarry and Rossmore mines.<\/p> <p>I am glad to say that, over the last number of years, our office has assisted many ex-miners in their applications for disablement.  Unfortunately, there have been some delays in processing applications and more staffing resources were deployed when I highlighted the problem.  To date, I understand that more than &euro;1 million has been paid in disablement benefit to former miners nationally, with approximately half of that paid to former Arigna miners.  The Minister might confirm these figures and outline how many applicants have availed of disablement benefit to date.  Is she satisfied that there are enough resources to expedite the existing applications from former miners seeking disablement benefit?  I hope no applicant is currently facing unnecessary delays.<\/p> <p>Recognition of the plight of these miners would not have happened without the sterling work of many people, including former Roscommon county councillor Charlie Hopkins and Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who was the Minister at the time and who became a strong advocate of the national coal miners' group.  The miners were hard-working men and many of them suffered greatly.  I want to recognise their vital contribution to their local and national economy.  The coal mining industry sustained the community of Arigna and all the area, as well as many others down through the centuries.  I am heartened that many miners affected by ill-health have availed of disablement benefit as a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017112100002#D00300","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1511274600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this topic, which I know is particularly important to people in his neck of the woods.  Any person, including a former miner, who has suffered an occupational injury or prescribed occupational disease, is entitled to apply for disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme, which was introduced with effect from 1 May 1967.  In order to qualify for a payment under this scheme, applicants must show that they were insurably employed at the time they sustained the injury or disease and that it was caused by their occupation at the time.  If these conditions are satisfied, applicants are examined to determine whether and to what extent they have suffered a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of that injury or disease.<\/p> <p>In 2010, the then Minister met with miners&rsquo; representatives and it was agreed at that meeting that former miners who suffered from the prescribed occupational disease pneumoconiosis, which is particularly associated with mining, would have their applications expedited.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Applications for disablement benefit should normally be made within three months of the entitlement commencing.  However, many of the applications from former miners concern injuries that occurred up to 50 years ago.  Given the passage of time and the lack of witnesses in some instances, investigations into the circumstances surrounding these cases can be difficult and time-consuming, with the result that applications typically are taking much longer to process than we would expect.  Where application forms are not completed in full or where medical or other evidence has been requested from applicants, it can take some time to process applications.  However, I assure the Senator that the Department is committed to ensuring that all benefit claims are processed as expeditiously as possible and that the scheme is continuously monitored and reviewed to ensure that customers are responded to as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>To respond to the Deputy's final request, I advise him that, to date, 565 applications have been received from former coal miners.

The Minister for Health is committed to securing and further developing the role of the Midlands Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, as a constituent hospital in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.<\/p> <p>Reports on Portlaoise hospital in recent years have pointed to the need for restructuring of some services to ensure that patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff who can safely meet their needs.  Since 2014, the focus has been on supporting the hospital to develop and enhance management capability, implementing changes required to address clinical service deficiencies, and incorporating the hospital into the governance structures in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.

Will he assure us that Ireland will not sign up to permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, on security and defence at a European level?  What are his views on the concerns raised regarding Ireland's neutrality, our triple-lock system and our crucial role in peace-building and arms control if we did sign up?  I also ask him to address the position regarding the European defence fund.<\/p> <p>I was glad Ireland was not among the countries that recently sent a notification to Federica Mogherini in respect of a new permanent structured co-operation on security and defence but I am concerned that we have seen mixed signals from the Government regarding that agreement.  The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy McEntee has, for, example, spoken about the hope that Ireland might be able to participate in a way that respects our long-standing practice and policy of neutrality.  Our long-standing policy of neutrality is not only something we must respect, it is also something that has earned us respect internationally.  Ireland's multilateralism is grounded in our neutrality.  It has underpinned Ireland's reputation as an honest broker, its effectiveness within the UN system and its outstanding contribution to peace-building, from the work of a former Minister, the late Frank Aiken, who first drove the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, to the anti-nuclear treaty signed by the current Minister, Deputy Coveney, in September.  Permanent structured co-operation on security and defence with nations that are not neutral and have different mandates, interests and military histories is not compatible with our neutrality.<\/p> <p>While there may be scope within the EU treaties for such co-operation, those treaties are not our only frame of consideration.  We must also consider our State, our legislation and the frame of the UN.  It is notable that while the specific needs of NATO members are given some discussion in the PESCO notification, there is no similar discussion of United Nations mandates or missions.  The UN, as far as I can see, is only mentioned once.  Peacekeeping and peace-building are not mentioned at all in the lengthy notification about PESCO and co-operation on security and defence.  This must be a concern to a country which has prided itself on its role in peace-building and peacekeeping and which has always placed that role at the centre of it defence policies.<\/p> <p>The answer to the global challenges we face is not, regardless of what may be posited by President Macron, another army.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Areas such as human trafficking and cybercrime, while important, are all areas where co-operation can be facilitated through our civilian policing systems.  They are not a justification for PESCO and its attendant military commitments.  Signing PESCO would tie Ireland into a relentless long-term spiral of increasing military spending, which would not necessarily go towards much-needed improvements in the terms and conditions of service members, as PESCO also sets out criteria for how that money should be spent.<\/p><p>Does the Minister of State agree that Ireland cannot be part of the proposed European defence fund as multi-country procurement would mean we were accessories to the purchase of weapons which might be used outside a UN mandate?  Irish companies that wish to compete for military contracts are free to do so under EU procurement law regardless of whether Ireland signs up to PESCO or not.  It is crucial that our national defence policies in no way appear to be involved with or influenced by the commercial interests of private companies.  Ireland's historic freedom from military industrial interest has contributed, along with our neutrality, to our very effective and necessary work on disarmament.  I had the opportunity to be in Croke Park where the global ban on cluster munitions was negotiated.  These are the medals of honour for Ireland and the things we must be proud of.<\/p><p>Mine is not a romantic view.  I am very aware of the realities of security and the realities of war and death that shadow any conversation about military co-operation.  In any talk of efficiencies, procurement and exercises, we are in the end talking about the circumstances under which Ireland might contribute directly or indirectly to the loss of life.  The bar must be high.  The triple-lock is not a technicality but an essential safeguard.  Rather than being a follower on a slippery slope towards ever deeper militarisation and a possible European army, Ireland must take the chance to be a leader.  We can and should act as beacons for a renewed focus on peace-building and constructive diplomacy within Europe and the wider world at a time when Europe has deeply neglected peace-building within and between nations.  I ask the Minister of State to make it clear to our European friends that Ireland's neutrality is an asset to Europe.  It is no coincidence it was an Irish man, Eamon Gilmore, who was able to so effectively act as EU envoy in the peace negotiations in Columbia. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017112100002#G00300","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511274600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>The Senator has been speaking for five and a half minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017112100002#H00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1511274600,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I will conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017112100002#H00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1511274600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Normally the Senator would only be allowed four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017112100002#H00400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1511274600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister of State to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017112100002#H00500","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1511274600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on this important issue of permanent structured co-operation, commonly referred to as PESCO.  I am happy to inform the House that the Government earlier today approved the formal notification by Ireland of our intention to participate, subject to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann's approval in the near future.  PESCO provides a treaty based mechanism whereby EU member states can participate jointly in capability development projects.  These capabilities can then be made available for common security and defence policy, CSDP, crisis management and peacekeeping operations.  Participation in any particular PESCO project is entirely voluntary.  As such, Ireland, along with all other member States, is free to decide for itself whether to opt in to any project on a case-by-case basis.  Ireland has been centrally involved in the development of the CSDP from the outset and has been one of the leading contributors to CSDP operations.<\/p> <p>Ireland supports the role the EU can play in support of international peace and security with the UN at its core.  PESCO is a further initiative in strengthening the Union&rsquo;s capacity in this regard.  It should be noted that all CSDP operations to date have either been mandated or supported by the UN and endorsed in UN Security Council resolutions.  This commitment to the UN is restated in the PESCO notification which recalls \"the commitment of the European Union and its Member States to the promotion of a rules-based global order with multilateralism as its key principle and the United Nations at its core\".<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paul Kehoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Last September, at the informal meeting of Defence Ministers in Tallinn, I met the UN Under-Secretary General for Peacekeeping, Mr. Jean-Pierre Lacroix.

PESCO is also a means of enhancing interoperability and, working with EU partners, ensuring that our troops are equipped with the latest and best equipment and training.<\/p><p>A key challenge to the European Union's capacity to mount crisis-management operations has been a lack of essential capabilities and the political will from member states to commit the required capabilities for CSDP operations.  PESCO has been designed to address this challenge, enhancing the political commitment of member states to both develop and deliver capabilities in support of CSDP.<\/p><p>Participation in PESCO is provided for in Articles 42.6 and 46, and Protocol 10 of the Treaty on European Union.  Participation in PESCO has no implications for Ireland's policy of military neutrality, for the triple-lock or the roles we play in peacekeeping, peace building and arms control.  The participation criteria expressly stipulate that PESCO will be implemented in full compliance with the Treaty on European Union and its protocols, respecting the constitutional provisions of the member states.  Three other neutral EU member states, Finland, Sweden and Austria, have already committed to join PESCO.<\/p><p>PESCO was comprehensively debated in the context of the Lisbon treaty which was approved by the Irish people when they voted on the treaty in October 2009.

In times of far more pressure during the 1940s members of the Minister of State's party and other parties met to discuss the role Ireland would play.  I was looking back on those debates from the 1940s, in which one Member said, \"This country belongs not to the Government or to any political party: it is the common heritage of Irish men and women of all classes.\"  These comments were made under great international pressure.<\/p> <p>The decision the Minister of State is proposing to the Oireachtas will damage not only Ireland's heritage and record, but also our capacity in the future.  We have thrown away the opportunity to lead out a new approach that focuses on peace building.  The Minister of State invoked the UN and quoted what I note is the only reference to the UN in the PESCO document.  However, he has not said whether he agrees that Europe needs to focus on peace building rather than simply security or told us what role he sees for Ireland in championing a peace building approach.<\/p> <p>Finally, regarding the European defence fund, how, if we have multi-country procurement, can we be assured that the weapons we co-purchase will only be used in accord with the triple-lock?

The first issue I want to highlight is the European pillar of social rights, as unveiled last Friday by EU leaders, including the Taoiseach, at the EU social summit in Stockholm, which was the first such summit for 20 years.  I welcome this document, even if it is not perfect.  If the EU is to thrive, it must resist the temptation to become a purely economic union, or indeed a military union as we have seen today, worryingly.  Instead, the EU must focus on the development of a more progressive, fairer and more equal society as the foundation for the building of peace and social cohesion.  This must be a priority for the EU.  I urge the Government to underline in the next phase of the discussions the importance of the new social pillar not just as a discussion document or theoretical framework, but as something that is measurable and enforceable.  Will we be able to discuss the social pillar in the House?  In particular, will the social pillar underpin the European semester process?<\/p> <p>The second issue I want to highlight is a source of great concern.  In response to a Commencement matter I raised in the Chamber earlier this afternoon, the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, informed me that the Cabinet has decided to pursue Irish membership of the permanent structured co-operation on security and defence initiative, known as PESCO.  It seems that we will subsequently seek membership of the European defence fund, although this was not confirmed by the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>This is a really serious concern in the context of Ireland's neutrality and its role in peace building.  I suggest that Ireland has an opportunity and a responsibility to choose not to be a follower on the slippery slope towards ever-deeper militarisation, a possible European army and the securitisation agenda, which has damaged Europe and its credibility.  Ireland has a chance to be a leader.  It could and should be a beacon for a renewed focus on peace-building and constructive diplomacy in Europe and the wider world.  Our true friends in Europe will understand that Ireland's neutrality and peace building role is at the centre of its focused approach and is an asset to Europe.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am very concerned that in the PESCO notification document the words \"peace\", \"peace building\" or \"peacekeeping\" do not appear even once.

The efforts of the Labour Party's Deputy Alan Kelly in the D&aacute;il have tried to ascertain the truth and have led to the situation we have now, where we see a discrepancy, to put it mildly, between what the Taoiseach says the T&aacute;naiste knew and what it seems, from Department of Justice and Equality documents, that she did know.<\/p> <p>I understand the T&aacute;naiste is answering questions and making a statement in the D&aacute;il tonight.

Dublin Airport has an opportunity to become an international hub for Europe.  Over 19,000 people have jobs at the airport and there are nine ancillary jobs associated with each of those.  Dublin Airport is hugely important to the economies of Fingal, Dublin and the country in general.

I challenge Senator Conway-Walsh and her party on how they have treated whistleblowers before she comes into this House and criticises the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Government of which I am a part.  I would be very happy to have that debate at any time.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh made reference to tonight's \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme.  We need to watch and hear the programme in its entirety.  However, my information is that it is about 14 of the 47 hospitals which have exceeded the 20% limit of private treatment.  From our side of the House, we have pursued a model that has got differing viewpoints in terms of universality of health care and health treatment.<\/p><p>The hospital contract signed in 2008 had a very clear objective, to which we all subscribe, which is to improve access for public patients to public hospital care.  That has not changed.  It is a minefield with a number of different consultant contracts working in different ways.  The obligation on the HSE and now the hospital groups is one that requires a piece of work to be done.  None of us wants to see patients suffer.  As I was driving up this morning, I heard people being interviewed regarding cataracts and hip replacements.  We all want people to be treated in a timely way and with hospital care that is dignified and respectful.  We will all work to strengthen the compliance which is not perhaps as robust as it should be.  Certainly it is 14 of 47 hospitals.  I would be happy to have the debate after the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme.<\/p><p>I fully agree with Senator Lawless's remarks on the situation in Myanmar.  We all thought Aung San Suu Kyi would show vision and her leadership would be a breath of fresh air, but she has been a disappointment to many of us.  I agree with the Senator that it is a humanitarian crisis that requires urgent intervention in order that people be treated with respect and dignity.  I will be very happy to ask the Minister to come to the House.  Perhaps it might be quicker for the Senator to raise it as a Commencement matter.  He is right to raise the matter and I fully support him.<\/p><p>Senators Higgins, Craughwell and Warfield raised the issue of the Defence Forces and permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, and Senator Craughwell mentioned the Shannon stopover.  I certainly do not believe the Shannon stopover is in breach of our neutrality.  I know the Minister of State at the Department of Defence gave Senator Higgins a very lengthy reply on the Commencement and the Cathaoirleach made reference to that.  I fully understand her sincerity and passion on the matter.  I will not read back to her the Minister of State's reply.  We can have a debate on the matter.  In his reply to the Senator, the Minister of State was very clear that it is in keeping with our previous international agreements.<\/p><p>I believe Senator Warfield referenced the Lisbon treaty.  That was approved by the people in a vote in 2009.  It was part of that discourse and debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017112100002#X00600","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511274600,"counter":128,"content":"<p>We had to vote on it twice, though.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017112100002#Z00100","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1511274600,"counter":129,"content":"<p>The Irish people voted.

Irrespective of our political ideology, we all will work and are working to make our society, our country and our community more progressive and more equal.  I think all of us would subscribe to that.<\/p> <p>Senator Bacik referred to online safety.  The events of the past number of days have again highlighted the absolute importance of and the need for not only security and education of young people, but also empowerment of all of us in respect of this issue, which has become a new dimension and a new part of our lives.  Senator Bacik's point was well made, and I would be happy to try to have that debate, if not before Christmas, immediately after Christmas.<\/p> <p>Senator James Reilly referred to Dublin Airport and the ongoing issues regarding the need for a new runway.  Any passenger going through Dublin Airport will recognise that it is completely chock-a-block, which at one level is healthy and positive for us as a country.  It also requires Dublin Airport Authority to move other routes back to Cork and perhaps to Shannon.  As a country, we need clarity and direction on the issue Senator Reilly has raised.  I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Ross, come before the House in this regard.<\/p> <p>Senator Robbie Gallagher referred to Cavan general hospital and the issues there.  It is a very complex matter.  Before the last general election, the Government had a very comprehensive strategy for smaller hospitals which saw a huge amount of money invested in older, smaller county homes in some cases.  I am not familiar with Cavan general hospital specifically.  Senator Gallagher raised issues regarding trauma.  Trauma is very hard to define because a variety of specialisms could be involved, whether endoscopy, colorectal, urology, orthopaedic or neurosurgery, so I think the issue he has raised is not as simple as he has outlined.  However, the Government is giving consideration to the issue he is concerned about.<\/p> <p>Senator Joe O'Reilly congratulated the Minister, Deputy Naughten, on the future of rural post offices.  Senator O'Reilly is right to welcome the &euro;30 million in additional funding secured by the Minister for five-day postal delivery and six-day parcel delivery.  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell has recognised the importance of a post office network in this House previously and has raised it on a number of occasions.  I would be very happy to have that debate in the future and I commend Senator O'Reilly on his contribution.<\/p> <p>I would be happy to accept Senator Warfield's amendment to the Order of the Business and I am sure we will have a debate at a future date on the matter.<\/p> <p>Senators Norris and McDowell referred to the issue of freedom of speech.  Those of us who are democrats and republicans recognise the importance of freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom to write and have one's works published and freedom to assemble.  We steadfastly cherish all these rights and they are imbued in us.  I am all in favour of divergence of viewpoint, whether in committee, on the public airwaves or through the medium of newspaper.  Senator McDowell used the phrase \"catechism of political correctness\".  That catechism has many different authors and doctors, but the problem we have now is that political correctness in some cases has gone too far.  We will probably be criticised for saying that, but that is not to condone bad behaviour or ill-tempered remarks.  I have a fear of the way in which social media is going in the world, that some people can and do, as Senator McDowell rightly said, say what they want when they want and how they want without any ramification or consequence.  They can impugn the character of people very unfairly.  We need to see this issue addressed.  I would be very happy to have a debate in this House on the matter and I join the Senators in condemning the remarks passed on the death of Peter Matthews, a former Member of our Lower House.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Peter Mathews was a gentleman.

This is a short technical Bill comprising seven sections dealing with specific issues of health insurance, in particular the risk equalisation scheme which supports our system of community-rated health insurance.  More than 2.1 million people in Ireland hold private health insurance.  Health insurance in Ireland is community rated which means, in general, that everyone can buy the same health insurance policy at the same price.  Older and sicker people pay the same amount as young and healthier people.  Community rating means health insurers must offer health insurance policies at the same price to everyone regardless of the person's current or potential health status.  The Health Insurance Acts require all insurers to apply community rating.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Older and more sick customers, however, are not shared equally across the Irish market.  Some insurers have higher risk profiles than others given that they have a much higher proportions of older members.  The number of older customers insured is spread unevenly across individual health insurers, which is a legacy issue arising from the relatively recently arrival of competition.  Before that arrival, there was a monopoly market and all customers, young and old, were covered by a single insurer.  This is a central issue within Irish health insurance and, in order to support community rating and reduce the incentives for insurers to target or avoid particular groups of people, some form of risk equalisation is required.  <\/p><p>Risk equalisation supports community rating by providing cross-subsidies between insurers with different risk profiles.  It is essentially a financial transfer mechanism whereby money flows from insurers with healthier members to insurers with sicker members.  The overall goal is to channel competition in the health insurance market in a way which benefits everyone who wishes to purchase private health insurance.  Risk equalisation reduces insurers' incentives to attract only low-risk consumers or to charge higher prices for products that are marketed to high-risk people.  <\/p><p>A permanent risk equalisation scheme was introduced in Ireland in 2013.  Under this scheme, credits are paid to all insurers for their older and sicker members.  These credits are funded directly by stamp duty levies on all health insurance contracts.  In effect, the scheme redistributes funds between insurers to meet some of the additional costs of insuring older people and sicker members.  None of the stamp duty on health insurance contracts goes to the Government.  It is all redistributed to compensate for the additional costs of insuring older people and less healthy people.  In this way the cost of insurance is shared between all insured people and we can ensure that sicker and older people are treated fairly.  <\/p><p>Legislation is needed each year to update the amount of credits paid to insurers under the risk equalisation scheme and the amount of stamp duty levied on health insurance contracts to fund the credits.  As part of the process, the Health Insurance Authority carries out an evaluation of the market and recommends the level of credits which should apply next year.  The Minister has considered and accepted the recent recommendations made by the authority for the rates next year, which were: a general decrease in the amount of risk equalisation credits payable in respect of those aged over 65 based on age, gender and level of cover; the stamp duty to remain unchanged in respect of advanced contracts at &euro;444 per adult and &euro;148 per child; and a reduction of stamp duty in respect of non-advanced contracts to &euro;177 per adult and &euro;59 per child.<\/p><p>Lower levels of risk equalisation credits will be provided to insurers next year.  The provision of lower credits is possible because there has been a reduction in the market average claims cost per insured person in the previous 12 months.  As the scheme is designed to be self-financing, with the total amount of credits provided matching the stamp duty raised, the main stamp duty levy on health insurance products remains unchanged next year.  In addition, the stamp duty for non-advanced contracts is being reduced by 20%.  <\/p><p>In previous years it has been necessary to significantly increase the stamp duty on all policies in order to fund the rising cost of an older and less healthy population of insured people.  Health insurers have often cited increasing stamp duty rates as contributing directly to increases in insurance premiums.  The Minister for Health is therefore pleased that it has been possible this year to maintain the stamp duty at the existing level.  Furthermore the credits and levy rates proposed for next year strike a fair balance between the need to sustain community rating and the need to ensure that young people continue to avail of health insurance.  Small increases are also proposed to the existing level of hospital utilisation credits provided to insurers under the scheme, increasing to &euro;100 per night for overnight stays, currently &euro;90 per night, and to &euro;50 for day case admissions, currently &euro;30.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These utilisation credits are a proxy for health status and will provide additional support in respect of less healthy people.  This change will result in a higher proportion of credits being directed to sicker lives than to older lives.  This is a step towards improving the health status element of the scheme within the boundaries of the current risk equalisation scheme.<br\/><br\/>While the changes to the credits will help to maintain levels of support for community rating, further improvements to the scheme are also planned.  The Minister is committed to making the risk equalisation scheme as effective as possible in a way that promotes fair and open competition.  As the scheme is a state aid, it requires approval from the EU.  The current scheme has been approved up to 2020.  For the purposes of its further continuation, it is planned to enhance the sophistication of the scheme.  This requires a more refined measure of health status.  The most appropriate measure is based on diagnosis-related group activity data, which allows for better targeting of credits to everyone who requires a higher level of health care.  The Minister has asked his officials to focus on processing this in conjunction with the Health Insurance Authority in the months ahead.  A working group has been established to inform the private hospital data collection aspect of this process and any implications arising.  Refining the health status measure using diagnosis-related group data will further reduce the incentive for insurers to attract low-risk people and avoid high-risk people.<br\/><br\/>The Bill makes a number of changes to the lifetime community rating scheme that is in operation in the health insurance market.  The scheme was introduced in 2015 to encourage people to take out insurance at a younger age.  The clear impact of lifetime community rating can been shown by the increase of over 150,000 in the number of people holding health insurance between January 2015 and January 2017.  Earlier this year, the independent Health Insurance Authority reviewed the operation of the lifetime community rating scheme and made a number of recommendations to the Minister.  The changes that are being made now will ensure the scheme continues to operate smoothly and in a fair and balanced manner.<br\/><br\/>Under the existing scheme, people holding health insurance who leave the country to go abroad for work or other reasons may incur loadings on their return.  The changes included in the Bill mean that people will be able to work, travel or live abroad without incurring loadings on their return.  People will also be permitted to have breaks in insurance cover of at least six months while living in this country without incurring loadings upon the resumption of cover.  A change being made to take account of time served working in the Defence Forces or as an EU staff member working in this country will ensure that loadings are not unfairly incurred when people in such groups seek to purchase health insurance with Irish providers.  The Minister is ensuring that loadings are payable for ten years only rather than for life, as is currently the case.  This is a fairer and more reasonable approach to loadings on health insurance premiums.  This Bill provides the basis for these amendments to lifetime community rating.  Following the enactment of this legislation, the Minister will make a regulation next year that will set out the specific details of the changes and further enhance the operation of the lifetime community rating scheme.<br\/><br\/>I will now outline the specific sections of the Bill.  Section 1 defines the principal Act as the Health Insurance Act 1994.  Section 2 amends section 7A of the 1994 Act to expand the Minister's regulation-making powers in respect of the operation of the scheme.  It also provides that when increases in unadjusted net premiums apply, they are payable for ten years only.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 amends section 11C of the 1994 Act to provide for 1 April 2018 as the effective date for revised credits to be payable from the risk equalisation fund.  Section 4 amends Schedule 3 to the 1994 Act to provide for the revised amounts payable from the risk equalisation fund in respect of the hospital utilisation credit in the cases of health insurance contracts renewed or effected from 1 April 2018.  Schedule 3 contains revised amounts for the provision of inpatient services on an overnight basis and on a day-case basis.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional debate to follow.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017112100002#CC02000","speaker":"1307","continuing":true}]
