These targets cover sectors of the economy that fall outside the scope of the EU Emissions Trading System, including transport, buildings, agriculture and waste management.  For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005, which was jointly the most demanding reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this Decision.<\/p>  <p>  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the EPA in April 2017, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020.  The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.<\/p>  <p>  Concerning renewable energy, the EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009\/28\/EC set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020.  Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter transport target also being legally binding. Meeting the 16% target remains challenging.<\/p>  <p>  SEAI has reported that, in 2016, overall energy use increased by 3.7%, while the economy grew by 5.1%.\u00a0 9.5% of Ireland's overall energy requirements in 2016 were met from renewable sources.\u00a0 As regards Ireland&rsquo;s renewable electricity target, renewable electricity accounted for 27.2% of total consumption by end 2016.\u00a0\u00a0The SEAI's most recent forecast of Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with its renewable energy targets (December 2017) is that Ireland will achieve between 13.2% and 15.4% of its 16% renewable energy target by 2020, indicating that Ireland should be between 82% to 96%\u00a0 of the way to its target.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)\u00a0tabled by the EU on behalf of its Member States, which commits to a reduction of at least 40% in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels.\u00a0 This\u00a0will be met through reductions of 43% in the Emission Trading System (ETS) and 30% in the non-ETS sector compared with 2005 levels.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's contribution to the overall 30% reduction in the non-ETS sector by 2030, as well as the contributions to be made by other Member States, will be established in the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) proposal, which will replace the current Effort Sharing Decision.  In December 2017, the European Parliament and the Council reached a provisional agreement on the ESR proposal and I expect that this agreement to be shortly formally endorsed by both the European Parliament and Council.  The final agreement sets a target of a 30% reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s 2005 emissions by 2030, with a starting point of May 2019, based on average emissions over the period 2016 to 2018. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400069#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Angling Sector Promotion","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400069#WRA00900"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[7255\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400069#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the supports available to develop angling with particular reference to County Sligo and the north west; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>In December last, I announced funding of approximate &euro;540,000 by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) for 28 projects under the National Strategy for Angling Development (NSAD), which were\u00a0based on applications received from Counties Sligo, Donegal and Leitrim.\u00a0 These projects are to be implemented over the next year.<\/p><p>IFI&rsquo;s angling sponsorship scheme also supported seven projects in the North West for novice angler events, angling festivals, angling guides and schools' programmes during 2017.

The targets cover sectors of the economy that fall outside the scope of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).  These sectors, including the built-environment, transport\u00a0and agriculture, account for almost 55% of total EU-28 emissions and 71% of Irish emissions.  The proposal is the successor\u00a0to the Effort Sharing Decision, which established national emissions targets for Member States in the non-ETS sectors between 2013 and 2020.<\/p>  <p>  For the ESR, targets have been proposed for Member States based on GDP per capita and the cost-effectiveness of domestic emissions reductions within individual Member States.  The final agreement sets a target of 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 for Ireland.\u00a0 Mitigation options built into the ESR agreement include land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), and the possibility to transfer credits from the EU ETS.<\/p>  <p>  The ESR was provisionally agreed on 21 December 2017 by the Council\u00a0and the European Parliament, and following final approval and formal adoption by the Council, it will enter into force.<\/p>  <p>  During the ESR negotiations, I emphasised the need to prioritise a successful conclusion which retains a high environmental ambition for the EU, but provides each Member State with the capacity to contribute to that ambition in a cost-effective and fair manner.  I am satisfied that the provisional agreed text provides appropriate recognition of different Member State circumstances, and the need to provide flexibility to reduce emissions as cost-effectively as possible in the context of the overall EU target.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of emissions, the EPA develops national projections on an annual basis, in collaboration with relevant State and other bodies.  In addition to this, they also produce emission projections for each sector.<\/p>  <p>  The latest EPA projections were published in April 2017.  Greenhouse gas emissions were projected to 2035 using two scenarios: a &lsquo;With Existing Measures&rsquo; scenario and a &lsquo;With Additional Measures&rsquo; scenario.  The With Existing Measures scenario assumes that no additional policies and measures, beyond those already in place by the end of 2015, are implemented.  The With Additional Measures scenario assumes implementation of the With Existing Measures scenario in addition to further implementation of Government renewable and energy efficiency targets for 2020, as set out in the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) and the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP). <\/p>  <p>  Emissions from Agriculture are projected to reduce by 2.4% between 2020 and 2035 under both scenarios.  For 2035, it is estimated that fertiliser nitrogen use will reduce from 401,000 tonnes in 2020 to 395,000 tonnes in 2035.  The beef herd is forecasted to contract by 11% between 2020 and 2035 from 5.6 million to 4.9 million.  These agriculture emissions projections are based on data from Teagasc&rsquo;s FAPRI-Ireland model which were provided to the EPA in December 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of addressing the significant challenge to reduce emissions, I published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan last July. It provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A key objective of the Plan is to prepare for the emissions targets that Ireland will take on for 2030.\u00a0 The Plan sets out over 70 individual mitigation measures and 106 related actions to reduce emissions in the four sectors with the most significant contribution to national emissions (Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use). Action across all sectors will be paramount to building the foundations for Ireland&rsquo;s low carbon transformation, considering the cross-cutting nature of the climate challenge.<\/p>  <p>  The National Mitigation Plan highlights a number of measures that are already contributing to emission reductions in the agriculture sector, including: the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP); Knowledge Transfer Programme; Green, Low Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS); Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II); Organic Farming Scheme; Smart Farming Programme; Business, Environment and Technology through Training Extension and Research (BETTER) Farms Programme.<\/p>  <p>  Although the Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve either Ireland&rsquo;s proposed 2030 target or the 2050 transition objective, it begins the process of developing medium-to-long-term policy options so as to achieve progressive emissions reductions in each of the four key sectors, and to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the National Mitigation Plan is a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  This continuous review process reflects the broad and evolving nature of the sectoral challenges outlined in the Plan, coupled with the continued development and deployment of emerging low carbon and cost effective technologies across different sectors of the economy. <\/p>  <p>  The Government will also publish a new National Development Plan soon and this will provide an opportunity for further prioritisation of expenditure required to implement the National Mitigation Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400069#WRA02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400069#WRA02500"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[7482\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400069#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the steps his Department has taken or will take in the future to ensure that companies competing for State procurement of services, such as the national broadband plan, do not collude with each other in the bidding and competitive tendering process to the detriment of the State's finances; the penalties a company might incur if found to have engaged in such collusion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>The Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.\u00a0\u00a0The State led intervention aims to\u00a0provide\u00a0high speed broadband to areas where commercial operators are unlikely to invest.<\/p>  <p>\u00a0 The nature of this intervention has taken the form of a\u00a0competitive dialogue procurement procedure.\u00a0 This process is used for complex contracts where a Contracting Authority is seeking technical solutions to go to market on.

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal which compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies including Solar PV at various scales including Utility (farm scale) to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply. The assessment included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  The new scheme will be defined by a series of renewable electricity auctions, where the most cost effective projects within an auction structure will receive financial support in\u00a0the form of a premium, in addition to the price they receive from the market.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the very strong level of interest in solar PV in Ireland and the most recent data available to me indicates that at present, there are 621 solar applications at the distribution level and 37 solar applications at the transmission level, at various stages in the grid connection application process.

Ireland's contribution to the overall 30% reduction in the non-ETS sector by 2030, as well as the contributions to be made by other Member States, will be established in the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), which will replace the current Effort Sharing Decision. In December 2017, the European Parliament and the Council reached a provisional agreement on the proposed ESR and I expect that this agreement to be shortly formally endorsed by both the European Parliament and Council. This provisional agreement sets a target of a 30% reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s 2005 emissions by 2030, with a starting point of May 2019, based on average emissions over the period 2016 to 2018.<\/p><p>Official inventories of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are prepared annually by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The most recent data, for the year 2015, is available on the EPA's website at: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>According to this data, the breakdown of emissions by sector in 2015 is as follows: <table><tr><th>Sector<\/th><th>Mt CO2eq.<\/th><th>% of total 2015 emissions<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Agriculture<\/td><td>19.81<\/td><td>33.1%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Transport<\/td><td>11.83<\/td><td>19.8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Energy Industries<\/td><td>11.80<\/td><td>19.8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Residential<\/td><td>6.04<\/td><td>10.1%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Manufacturing Combustion<\/td><td>4.55<\/td><td>7.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Industrial Processes<\/td><td>1.99 <\/td><td>3.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>F-Gases<\/td><td>1.14 <\/td><td>1.9%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Commercial Services<\/td><td>0.94 <\/td><td>1.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waste<\/td><td>0.97<\/td><td>1.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Public Services<\/td><td>0.81<\/td><td>1.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total ETS<\/td><td>16.84<\/td><td>28%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Non-ETS<\/td><td>43.04<\/td><td>72%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total for all sectors<\/td><td>59.88<\/td><td>100%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The latest EPA report on greenhouse gas emissions, published on 27 November, indicates that Ireland complied with its annual limits in the period 2013-2016. However, EPA projections indicate that Ireland is expected to exceed its annual limits from 2017 onwards, and that emissions could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020, and between 1% and 3% below 2005 levels by 2030. The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. It is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. In the light of this, Ireland&rsquo;s 2030 target will present a very significant challenge. <\/p><p>As a means\u00a0of addressing this challenge, I published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan last July. It provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A key objective of the Plan is to close the gap to Ireland's 2020 EU target and to prepare for the EU targets that Ireland will take on for 2030. \u00a0The Plan sets out over 70 individual mitigation measures and 106 related actions\u00a0to reduce emissions in the four sectors with the most significant contribution to national emissions (Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use). Action across all sectors will be paramount to building the foundations for Ireland&rsquo;s low carbon transformation considering the cross-cutting nature of the climate challenge.<\/p><p>Although the Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve either Ireland&rsquo;s proposed 2030 target or the 2050 transition objective, it begins the process of developing medium-to-long-term policy options so as to achieve progressive emissions reductions in each of the four key sectors, and to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. <\/p><p>It is important to note that the National Mitigation Plan is a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options. This continuous review process reflects the broad and evolving nature of the sectoral challenges outlined in the Plan, coupled with the continued development and deployment of emerging low carbon and cost effective technologies across different sectors of the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400070#WRB04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":120,"content":"<p>Question No. 68 answered with Question No. 26.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400070#WRB05100"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[7268\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400070#WRB05200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the status of the roll-out of broadband to areas in the south west of County Dublin that are currently lacking in broadband (details supplied); if the matter will be addressed in the near future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1311","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>The Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location. \u00a0The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector.

As part of that initiative, staff working in the Foreign Births Registration Unit of the Department were briefed on the new Regulations, as well as on transgender issues more widely. <\/p>  <p>  Separately, my Department is participating in the ongoing review of the Gender Recognition Act 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Within my Department, a Sub-Committee of the Management Board on Gender Equality, Equality and Diversity was established in 2016 to support an inclusive and diverse working environment.  The Committee is chaired by two members of the Management Board.  The initiative works to foster a culture of respect and equality to benefit the Department, its staff and ultimately the citizens that we serve.  The focus of the Sub-Committee is the Department&rsquo;s treatment of the grounds for discrimination in employment equality law.  Significant progress has been made on a number of Departmental initiatives to address barriers to equality in our work place and in service provision. <\/p>  <p>  The Sub-Committee, in cooperation with the Human Resources Unit and other sections, runs regular events to celebrate and support equality and diversity at home and through our Mission network overseas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400072#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400072#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[7647\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400072#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the preparedness of his Department in the context of the incoming general data protection regulation, GDPR, EU 2016\/679; if staff in his Department have undertaken or been offered specific training and-or briefing in respect of the GDPR; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":204,"content":"<p>My Department commenced preparations for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in mid-2016, with the appointment of a Data Protection Officer, who holds a professional qualification in data protection.

This decision was based on article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage.  The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The personal tax credits and standard rate bands available to a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership are therefore equal in value to the personal tax credits and bands available to two individuals, with the difference being that one spouse&rsquo;s personal tax credit and a portion of his or her standard rate band may be transferred to their spouse if they so choose.  This can be of benefit where one spouse has low income or does not work outside the home and therefore does not use their own credit and rate bands in full.<\/p><p>Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of income tax as a separate and unconnected individual.Each partner is entitled in his or her own right to the tax credits and standard rate band appropriate to a single person, but do not have the option to partially transfer their personal tax credit and\/or rate band.  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership, which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.<\/p><p>From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a tax regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners.  Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status.  It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting.  It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.\u00a0 <\/p><p>It should also be noted that, while there may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for the couple and for persons connected with them.To counter tax avoidance, special provisions often apply in respect of transactions between &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo; as defined throughout the various Tax Acts.  The definition of &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo; usually extends to the relatives and children of a taxpayer&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner.Such provisions would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a taxpayer&rsquo;s cohabiting partner where the couple has no legal recognition of their status as a couple. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400073#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Portfolio","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400073#WRE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[7700\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400073#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will request NAMA to ensure a building (details supplied) will be kept as a historical heritage building for the local community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1434","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":220,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that I, as Minister for Finance, have no role in respect of NAMA's commercial operations or decisions.

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination and can be a difficult diagnosis to make in cases which do not develop the characteristic rash.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease. <\/p>  <p>  Testing for Lyme disease is available in each of the HSE&rsquo;s Hospital Groups, who have a number of Infectious Disease Consultants who are expert in the diagnosis and management of the disease. Laboratories in Ireland generally follow the laboratory testing recommendations of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Disease Society of America, the European Federation of Neurological Societies, and the British Infection Association. Irish laboratories have their own quality assurance methods to make sure the tests are working correctly as well as being accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Body to perform the test correctly.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory. This laboratory uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities which involves a screening test followed by a confirmatory test.  Testing which is performed abroad may be performed in laboratories which have not met National or International Accreditation (Quality Standards) and these tests may be more likely to give a &ldquo;false positive&rdquo; result. <\/p>  <p>  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics by General Practitioners.  In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2006.  Antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications, and are generally given for up to three weeks.

These guidelines were devised by experts in transgender healthcare, along with members of the International Transgender, Transsexual and LGBT community, and supported by the Transgender Equality Network of Ireland (TENI).<\/p>  <p>  The guidelines recommend a comprehensive multidisciplinary psychosocial assessment prior to commencement of hormone therapy by endocrinology services. The assessment focuses on more than just assessment for the possible diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria. The guidelines highlight several criteria which must be met prior to referral for hormonal intervention. It is important that co-morbid conditions are identified and addressed, and that people access the supports that they need to manage co-morbid difficulties, which can impact on response to medical transition (including hormone treatment). <\/p>  <p>  International best practice involves an assessment by a multi-disciplinary team and shared decision making in the best interests of the individual. Both WPATH and the Endocrine Society Guidelines 2017 specify the assessment must be carried out by a mental health professional (s) with experience in transgender healthcare and possess specific skills. Endocrinologists and General Practitioners (GPs) do not possess these skills, and require access to the multidisciplinary team as described. GPs would only see a small number of gender variant individuals during their lifetime in clinical practice, and would not be in a position to build up the requisite skillset outlined in WPATH and Endocrine Society Guidelines or have the time resource to conduct a comprehensive evaluation. <\/p>  <p>  Informed consent is essential, whereby benefits and risks of hormone treatment and surgery are discussed with individuals seeking these interventions. Although regret rates are low, it can happen and can also lead to high levels of psychological distress. Healthcare providers work with people to try to prevent negative outcomes. The emerging evidence on good outcomes following medical and\/or surgical transitioning is based on use of multi-disciplinary psychosocial assessment, fulfilment of criteria for hormones and on-going psychological support throughout the process. It is important that psychological support is available to individuals before, during and after transitioning. <\/p>  <p>  Prescription of hormone blockers and cross-sex hormones for transgender people is relatively new. Significant side effects can occur with cross sex hormones including irreversible physical changes and infertility. There is a lack of long-term research on outcomes. For these reasons the decision to prescribe should only be made by specialists (i.e. Endocrinologists) in consultation with other professionals involved in the assessment process. Shared decision-making is in accordance with best practice internationally.  Prescriptions can then be supported by local GPs with specialist guidance. <\/p>  <p>  The Best Practice approach as outlined above is endorsed in the Service Development Model as developed by the Quality Improvement Division of the HSE in 2017, in collaboration with TENI. This model is providing the framework for the development of National Gender Clinics and MDTs for children and adults, funded by the Acute Hospitals and Mental Health Divisions of the HSE. Recruitment will commence to develop these national teams in 2018. This investment in new posts in 2018 which includes one consultant endocrinologist (adult services), one consultant endocrinologist (paediatric services), one social worker (adult services), one speech and language therapist (adult services), one senior psychologist (adult services), one senior psychologist (paediatric services), one clinical nurse specialist (Paediatric services), two administrative support officers (adult and paediatric services) is a concerted measure by the HSE to address the waiting times and immediate service needs of children, adolescents and adults in transition. The HSE, across a number of programmes including mental health, acute hospitals, primary care and social inclusion, is committed to building services for this community in accordance with International Best Practice. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is a member of the group established to review the operation of the Gender Recognition Act, and the Department has no plans to make a submission to the review group. The number of persons waiting to see physicians regarding hormone replacements therapy and the number of physicians treating persons for hormone replacement therapy are service matters.

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.<\/p><p>The Deputy may be aware of the key recommendation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility<i><\/i>that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  The Expert Panel Report also concluded that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  Therefore, medical card provision is based on financial assessment.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Accordingly, a patient suffering from either MS or MND will not have automatic eligibility for a medical card.<\/p><p>Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.  In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.<\/p><p>Within the application process, the HSE endeavours to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  The legislation allows the HSE, in certain circumstances, to exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. <\/p><p>The HSE is required to undertake reviews of eligibility in order to ensure that a person continues to meet the qualifying criteria required to continue holding eligibility.  Where a medical card is due to expire, these cards are reviewed and a renewal notice is sent out to the medical card holder three months in advance of the expiry date.  It is important to note that the person under review maintains eligibility for the card while the review is being conducted, including any period where additional information is requested.  It should be noted that no reviews of discretionary medical cards are taking place at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400083#WRP01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":470,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400083#WRP01600"},{"type":"question","counter":471,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[7692\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400083#WRP01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to include qualified chiropractors within the regulatory framework under the proposed European Union (Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Dangers arising from Medical Exposure to Ionising Radiation) Regulations 2018 in view of the fact that registered chiropractors are included in similar regulations in other EU countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":472,"content":"<p>This questions relates to the transposition of the medical provisions of the Basic Safety Standards Directive (BSSD) by my Department and whether chiropractors will be designated as referrers and practitioners in the transposing regulations.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017.<\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-licence use for pain not associated with shingles.<\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN.<\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  In August 2017 the HSE advised GPs of the changes and of treatment alternatives.<\/p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes.  The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision.<\/p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,500 applications from GPs, of which some 10% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.<\/p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  Of some 200 appeals to date, the HSE advises that over 50% have been accepted on clinical grounds.<\/p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at .<\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.

The Deputy is correct to refer to the dairy sector, but labour pressures also exist in the horticultural and meat processing sectors.  The reasons for the shortages include: the significant value added growth expansion of the sector in recent years; the growth in the economy as a whole, now approaching full employment; and also economic growth in other EU countries which have traditionally supplied workers for the sector.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and I have had extensive engagement with the industry on the shortage of labour in the dairy, horticulture and meat processing sectors.  The issues within the Horticulture sector have been discussed at the Horticulture Industry Forum which my colleague, Minister of State Doyle, co-chairs, while the challenges faced by the meat processing industry in securing labour have also been raised with me by meat industry representatives.  I am aware of the impact that these labour shortages are having, and I am committed to helping the sectors involved find appropriate solutions.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the dairy sector, last November I established a multi stakeholder industry group with a view to ensuring that Irish dairying has access to the human capital it requires to achieve future growth.  The Chair, former Secretary General of my Department Tom Moran, expects to finalise an action plan towards the end of this month which will address the short term and medium term labour issues facing the dairy sector.  This action plan will be submitted to the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC) for approval.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the work of this group, a range of other measures are being pursued by the dairy sector to try to attract and retain labour, including exchanges with New Zealand; and efforts at regional level to engage with and attract people on the live register, homemakers and drystock farmers to avail of opportunities on dairy farms.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and I are also engaged in discussions with my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and her officials in relation to employment permits for non-European Economic Area nationals, as a further strand in the range of options available to address the labour gap.

The Framework sets out the context to ensure Local Authorities, regions and sectors can assess the key risks and vulnerabilities of climate change, implement climate resilience actions, and ensure climate adaptation considerations are mainstreamed into all local, regional and national policy making. It includes a number of key actions and supporting objectives. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Framework, seven Government Departments - or Agencies, where appropriate - with responsibility for the twelve priority sectors identified in the Framework will be required to prepare sectoral adaptation plans in line with the requirements of Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Climate Act and the policies laid out in the Framework. <\/p>  <p>  The Framework does not identify specific locations or propose adaptation measures or projects in relation to sectors, such as specific measures in relation to flood relief and drainage. Respecting the principle of subsidiarity, detailed adaptation measures will be developed across sectors and Local Government, in accordance with the Framework. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Climate Act responsibility for the development of sectoral adaptation plans, and the prioritisation of the actions within them, rests with the lead Government Minister responsible for developing the plan. For example, the Framework provides\u00a0that the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works will prepare a statutory sectoral adaptation plan on flood risk management.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that under the non-statutory 2012 National Climate Change Adaptation Framework, which has now been superseded by the National Adaptation Framework, four draft sectoral plans covering five sectors have already been developed, including for flood risk management, agriculture and forestry, transport, and the electricity and gas networks. These plans will be reviewed and updated in line with the requirements of the new statutory National Adaptation Framework. <\/p>  <p>  Local understanding is also crucial to getting adaptation right and in this regard Local Authorities will be preparing their own adaptation strategies under the Framework. In publishing the Framework last month, I also announced a funding commitment from my Department of &euro;10 million over five years to establish\u00a0four Local Authority Regional Climate Action Offices. These will underpin a risk-based approach to climate action at the local and regional level and will provide a coherent and coordinated response to climate change, both in terms of adaptation and mitigation.

At its heart is a commitment to transform Ireland into a low carbon society and economy by 2050 and reduce the country&rsquo;s fossil fuel dependency. This ambitious vision for Ireland&rsquo;s energy system envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from that sector by 80-95% relative to 1990 levels by 2050. The White Paper identifies the long-term strategic importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050.\u00a0 It also recognises that oil and natural gas will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in that transition period.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In 2016, imported fossil fuels accounted for 69% of our energy needs at a cost of\u00a0&euro;3.4 billion. Given the inextricable link between energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, achievement of the commitments set out in the National Policy Position and the Energy White Paper will require a significant transformation of Ireland&rsquo;s energy system from being predominantly fossil-fuel based to a clean, low carbon energy system.<\/p><p>As a means\u00a0of addressing this challenge, the 2017 National Mitigation Plan<font color=\"#0D0D0D\">sets out over 70 individual mitigation measures and 106 related actions\u00a0to reduce emissions in the electricity generation,\u00a0built environment, transport and agriculture sectors. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter target also being legally binding. The most recent annual data from the SEAI indicates that 27.2% of electricity, 6.8% of heat and 5.0% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2016.\u00a0Overall, SEAI analysis shows that 9.5% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2016 were met from renewable sources.\u00a0 <\/font>The SEAI projects\u00a0that Ireland will achieve between 13.2% and 15.4% of its 16% renewable energy target by 2020, indicating that Ireland should be between 82% and 96%\u00a0 of its target. <\/p><p>While the focus of my Department remains firmly on meeting our 2020 renewable target and on implementation of renewable energy measures, including the new\u00a0 Renewable Electricity Support Scheme\u00a0and the Support Scheme for Renewal Heat, contingency planning has commenced to explore the potential extent, mechanisms and costs of addressing our targets within the framework of the\u00a02009 Directive.<\/p><p>Any requirement for the purchase of statistical transfers under the Directive to meet compliance would be undertaken against a background of discussions by the Irish authorities with the EU Commission and relevant Member States.

Notwithstanding ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contains 40 actions to alleviate\u00a0some of the deficits.  The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.  This includes ComReg, who attend as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in their role as the independent Regulator.<\/p><p>In October 2017, together with Minister Kyne, I hosted the first National Stakeholder Forum in Athlone.\u00a0 It arose from the Taskforce&rsquo;s recognition that, given the rapid technological change and the emergence of new equipment and solutions to deliver telecommunications services, stakeholders needed an opportunity to raise concerns on impediments to the rollout of services. Representatives from the telecoms industry, Government Departments and consumer groups attended the event. Issues impacting on rollout of mobile networks were discussed at the Forum, and there were also some new recommended actions\u00a0for the Taskforce to help improve services to consumers and in preparing for roll-out of the\u00a0National Broadband Plan\u00a0network, once contracts are in place.

The closing date for written submissions to the Group was 5th February 2018 and given its representation on the Group my Department did not make a written submission.   <\/p>  <p>  The areas within the Department which have had the most contact with transgender customers are Client Identity Services for the issue of Gender Recognition Certificates and the General Registers Office in relation to issuing a new birth certificate from the register of gender recognition.  Contact by transgender customers is with a small team of experienced and sensitive staff members who deal with these applications in a confidential and supportive manner.  The staff have been praised by the transgender community for the sensitive and efficient way in which applications are processed and handled. <\/p>  <p>  Guidance to be put in place for staff in my department regarding transgender matters and their engagement with customers will reflect the sensitive nature of the individual's situation and best practice in terms of customer service delivery.<\/p>  <p>  Central guidance is a matter for the Chief Human Resources Officer for the Civil Service. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400095#WRBB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Conservation Grant Applications","counter":738,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400096#WRCC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":739,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[7608\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400096#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of a water conservation grant for persons (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":740,"content":"<p>Statutory Instrument 434 of 2015 provided for the extension of the deadline for the submission of a completed application for the Water Conservation Grant to the Department of Social Protection from 8th October 2015 to 22nd October 2015.<\/p>  <p>  An application was made in respect of the details provided for the first named person and property using the online application system available at that time.

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit and treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from 1st December 2017.<\/p><p>This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the Class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings. These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.<\/p><p>The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published on 18 October 2017.  The Review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.<\/p><p>The Review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure.  In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers became eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the Actuarial Review.<\/p><p>As part of the Review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.<\/p><p>The Review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  <\/p><p>It should be noted that the projected expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit assume the same incidence rate as prevail in the employed (PRSI Class A) population.

It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.<\/p><p>This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension (contributory).  <\/p><p>The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.  <\/p><p>The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the Social Insurance Fund in the years ahead including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400096#WRCC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":747,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400096#WRCC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":748,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[7645\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021400096#WRCC01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the preparedness of her Department in the context of the incoming general data protection regulation, GDPR, EU 2016\/679; if staff in her Department have undertaken or been offered specific training and-or briefing on the GDPR; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":749,"content":"<p>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect on the 25th May 2018.

Unlike the current Homemakers scheme, this credit will apply to periods both before and after 1994.  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for such pensioners to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).
