The announcement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, of a comprehensive review of farm taxation in last October&rsquo;s budget presents an opportunity, for the first time in a generation, for all stakeholders to step back and assess how well or otherwise the tax system is working to support the farming sector in Ireland today.  While fully integrated into the general taxation system, the structure and operating environment of farming remains unique to any other business sector.  In developing its submission, the IFA emphasised that a comprehensive review of the taxation system for farming requires an understanding of the market environment facing Irish agriculture and the key characteristics of that sector.  The key objectives for the IFA in the independent review of taxation are to ensure valuable tax reliefs, which are critical to the development and growth of the agrisector, are maintained; to secure new tax incentives that are necessary to drive structural improvements by incentivising land transfer, mobility and investment, to examine how the taxation system can better accommodate the extreme volatility in farm incomes and to examine how tax returns can be simplified to drive down compliance costs.<\/p><p>  Farming is continuing to contribute to the economic recovery that now is clearly evident, through continued growth in agrifood exports and employment.  Agrifood exports reached a record high of almost &euro;10 billion in 2013 and the value of our exports has increased by a further 11% in the first four months of this year.  However, despite the contribution of the farming sector to national economic recovery, continued low levels of farm income, coupled with increasing income volatility, provide a threat to the viability of the Irish family farm and the sector&rsquo;s growth prospects.  Against this backdrop, the burden of taxation on farm families has, in common with other sectors, increased significantly in recent years.  Marginal rates of tax are now at a very high level, which is removing resources required for investment in the farm enterprise.  Increases in the rates of capital taxes and reductions in tax-free thresholds have added to the costs of investment and asset transfer.<\/p><p>  Key characteristics which differentiate agriculture from other business sectors and which are critical in developing an appropriate taxation system are that farming is a capital-intensive industry with significant, recurring, investment requirements.  Moreover, with a high level of owner-occupancy of farms, the minimisation of costs to facilitate lifetime intergenerational transfer is critical.  In addition, the main business structure of family farms continues to be that of sole trader, with the result that farm incomes are subject to high tax rates, even at low profit levels and increasing exposure to international markets and competition is driving necessary structural reform, increasing scale and improved efficiency.<\/p> <p> IFA's submission focused on the existing main tax reliefs relevant to farming, and whether they could be adapted to work more effectively, whilst also proposing a number of new measures to address particular issues.<\/p><p> IFA proposes two new and innovative taxation measures that, if implemented, would tackle two of the major challenges facing agriculture.  These are the growing income volatility and the barriers to lifetime farm transfers.<\/p><p> We can clearly see the impact of volatility in the tillage sector, for example, which, in 2013, experienced a fall in incomes of 20% to less than &euro;30,000 due to price collapse, and despite increased yields.  Prices in this sector continue to fall through 2014.<\/p><p> The first of two proposals to manage income volatility and encourage lifetime transfer is an income-smoothing mechanism that would operate within the income tax system, in addition to income averaging.  This would allow a farmer place on deposit a portion of his or her pre-tax income, in a designated commercial farming account - tax deposit account.  This could then be drawn down by the farmer and used for the running of his business when required, and would be taxable in the year it was drawn down.<\/p><p> The second proposal is a phased transfer partnership, PTP.  This is a progression model in which there would a defined, phased transfer of the family farm over a set time period.  It would require an agreed transfer contract where both parent and child would work together in partnership over the period of the phased and progressive transfer of assets.  As an incentive to the farm holder to enter into the contract, he or she would receive tax relief on a portion of their farm income, up to an agreed ceiling.<\/p><p> In addition to these incentive measures, IFA has submitted a comprehensive set of proposals covering all aspects of farming business.  In respect of income tax, the IFA has proposed the introduction of an optional system of increased capital allowances which would provide capital allowances of up to 50% for the first two years; extending the 100% trained farmers' stock relief to all farmers for a period of four years, up to 2020; the extension of income averaging to farm profits where the farmer or spouse has an additional source of self-employed income; and the introduction of an earned income tax credit to remove the discrimination in the income tax system between employees and the self-employed.<\/p><p> In the areas of farm transfer, succession and mobility, the IFA has proposed the retention and index-linking of the capital acquisitions tax tax-free exemption thresholds, and retention of 90% agricultural relief; improvement in the uptake of the land leasing tax exemption scheme through recognition of incorporated farm businesses as qualifying lessees, and removal of the 40 year age limit for qualifying lessors; reintroduction of indexation for capital gains tax, CGT, and retention of CGT retirement relief; and retention of young trained farmers stamp duty exemption and consanguinity reliefs for transfers between family members - it should be noted that consanguinity relief is due to be cease from 31 December 2014.<\/p><p> To encourage greater numbers of farm partnerships, there must be an extension of existing tax reliefs for milk production partnerships to all registered farm partnerships and reintroduction of CGT relief in the event of a farm partnership dissolution.<\/p><p> IFA has identified a number of sector-specific issues that require changes in the taxation system, and other general taxation issues of relevance to farm enterprises.  These include compulsory purchase of supply licences - co-operative shares - must be treated as a qualifying business expenditure, and offset against income tax; introduction of a tax-relieved loan scheme open to farmers and non-farmers who wish to invest in the development of the dairy sector; exclusion of forestry-felling income from the high income earners restriction; retention of  the existing pay-and-file deadline for self-assessed tax returns; and extension of a simplified system of farm income assessment for farmers with a non-complex farming system.<\/p><p> I wish to conclude with some comments on budget 2015, to which the outcomes of the agri-taxation review will be closely linked.  On the expenditure side, funding for farm schemes underpins farm incomes and output.  Under the new rural development programme, RDP, there is an overall allocation of &euro;2.1 billion of EU funding and &euro;1.9 billion of national funding for the period 2014-2020.<\/p><p> I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the Government's funding commitment earlier this year to the rural development programme for the next six years.  Over &euro;500 million of funding for RDP farm schemes must be provided in October's budget.  This funding will deliver programmes of support for low-income farmers, the provision of environmental services, encourage young farmers, promote on-farm investment and support farming in marginal areas.<\/p><p> IFA's priorities for expenditure in October's budget are: commencement of contracts for the new green low-carbon agri-environment, GLAS, scheme in early 2015, with places for 30,000 farmers in the scheme in its first year and payments disbursed in 2015; allocation of &euro;30 million for the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, in 2015 to fund on-farm investment programmes across all sectors; funding of &euro;52 million for the beef data and genomic scheme to support the vulnerable suckler sector; and increased capital funding allocations for the horticulture, forestry and aquaculture sectors to achieve output targets and employment growth.<\/p><p> Farming is facing significant challenges at present, but the opportunities for continued growth are many.  The achievement of Food Harvest 2020 growth targets will result in a significant return to the Exchequer through an increased tax take from additional economic activity, earnings and employment at farm, processing and industry services level.  As an immediate priority, full funding of farm schemes that provide income support for vulnerable sectors and investment support across all sectors is critical in Budget 2015.  On the taxation side, the agri-taxation review must result in a set of proposals supporting the long-term growth of the sector.  These must be implemented, starting with this October's budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Downey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405586100,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Downey.

The dairy sector is a good example of the latter where, since 2007, dairy farmers have seen milk prices vary, from 20 cents a litre to 40 cents a litre.  For a family farm structure, it is extremely difficult to deal with such volatility.  The taxation system needs to look at this issue and needs to facilitate farmers to address the problem of volatility in the future.<\/p><p>  I will go down through some of the main aspects of our submission and set out what we feel needs to be addressed.  First, on the issue of income volatility, income averaging has been an important relief for farmers over a number of years.  It is an important relief.  On income averaging, our concern would be that a farmer cannot earn &euro;1 of off-farm income because if a farmer does so, he or she loses income averaging.  If, for example, a farmer finds his product prices have collapsed, he or she is in a serious cash-flow situation and he or she decides to take on a part-time job in order to get through that period of time, be it three months, six months, 12 months or whatever, because the farmer takes that decision to improve his or her cash-flow and income situation, the current taxation system excludes him or her from income averaging.  That is unfair.  It does not make sense.  That needs to be addressed in the farm income taxation review.<\/p><p>  In terms of the issue of volatility, in Australia there is a farm management deposit scheme which is designed to address the issue of volatility.  From an Irish perspective, if a farmer has a good year, in terms of product prices and income, there needs to be an opportunity for him or her to put some of that money away tax-efficiently so that in the event of a bad year he or she can draw down that money to get him through it.  In that regard, there is precedent in Australia.<\/p> <p>With quota abolition and all these free trade agreements - there are suggestions of a TTIP agreement and a Mercosur agreement, and an agreement has been brokered with Canada - we are moving into much more of a free trade scenario, which will lead to more volatility.  We believe the taxation system needs to protect family farms in that scenario.<\/p><p> Certainly over the next two to three years and even at the moment, many farmers are looking at developing their farms.  With the abolition of quotas, farmers are looking at expansion.  If one decides to take on an additional cow, one does not just have to fund the cow; one must also fund the slurry storage, etc.  There are a range of environmental regulations behind every additional animal one puts on one's farm.  We certainly believe that the cattle allowance needs to be much more flexible in this regard.  At the moment it is eight years, but we feel it should be from three to eight years and that it should have a floating allowance of 50% just to give farmers the opportunity to make these investments, given the uncertainty that is out there.  <\/p><p> We have two issues regarding stock relief.  In respect of herd expansion, there is a substantial cost from the taxation perspective, with only 25% stock relief.  We certainly believe there should be 100% stock relief for additional expenditure of up to &euro;100,000.  A technical but important point concerns TB.  The Department's policy on TB would be that it generally does not do full depopulations, but one could find a farmer losing 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or even more of his herd.  We feel that the taxation system needs to take that into account.  At the moment, the stock relief requirement is there for depopulations.  It needs to take account of the fact that a farmer could lose 20 or 30 cows, which is traumatic enough from a financial point of view, but if he gets penalised on the taxation side, it is extremely traumatic.  Again, we feel that this needs to be addressed in the review.  <\/p><p> In respect of land policy and taxation to support Irish agriculture, the key issue is that we have people who want to transfer their farms to the next generation and the tax system needs to facilitate those people so that they can do so in a tax-efficient manner.  The tax system needs to support land mobility more than it does at the moment.  There are a number of issues in respect of capital gains tax.  Indexation was abolished when capital gains tax went down to 20%.  It is now at 33%, and we feel that this needs to be looked at.  The capital gains tax restructuring relief in respect of land consolidation is certainly a measure we welcome, as we think it is a very good measure, but, again, we feel it should be improved.  If a farmer with two 30-acre blocks decides to buy an 80-acre block when it comes up for sale, he does not get the tax relief if he sells the two 30-acre blocks.  We feel that if a farmer decides to consolidate by selling two smaller blocks to buy one block, the system should allow it.  It has an advantage from his perspective, but those two blocks may be bought by two farmers, which will help their situation.  We feel this needs to be looked at.<\/p><p> Our main point regarding capital acquisitions tax is that agricultural relief is hugely important in the transfer of farms from one generation to the next, and it is essential that this relief is maintained and improved.  In respect of income tax and land leasing, one could find a member in his late fifties or early sixties whose son or daughter has just completed the green cert and wants to take over the farm.  There was an early retirement scheme in the past that allowed that to take place where the older farmer had a level of income and the younger farmer could take over and develop the farm.  With no early retirement scheme in place, we feel the issue of land leasing needs to be looked at again in that if a parent wants to lease the farm to his or her son or daughter for a period of time - and we would stress that it should be up to retirement age rather than continuous - the tax relief should be available in that scenario.  We feel it is ridiculous that a parent can lease a farm to a stranger and qualify for tax relief but cannot lease it to his or her own son or daughter.  In the context of improving land mobility, we feel this needs to be examined.  <\/p><p> The 2% stamp duty rate is hugely important and we hope it will be retained.  The young farmer stamp duty rate is important as well.  In the past, there was installation aid as an encouragement for people under 35.  One has the single farm payment, but stamp duty relief is important as an incentive for the early transfer of farms.  We certainly believe it is important to maintain that.  <\/p><p> Another important issue relates to pay and file dates.  It was proposed last year that these dates would be brought forward, which would be of huge concern to our members, particularly in light of the CAP.  The CAP is putting payments back further in the year rather than bringing them forward.  For many farmers, until they get the single farm payment and disadvantaged area payments, they cannot pay their bills.  If the pay and file dates are brought forward, it would post major challenges for farm families.<\/p><p> That is a short rundown through our submission.  There are many challenges facing farmers and we feel that there are certain aspects of the tax system that need to be tweaked, particularly in the context of the volatility about which people are concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700004#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Enright","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405586700,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Enright and Mr. Downey for the comprehensive presentations they made.  It is fair to say that both of them have quite a bit in common - volatility, 2020 targets, capital allowances, stamp duty, investment in co-operatives and so on.  I will not go through them all because we would be here all day if we went into every issue.  It seems that volatility is a major issue for the upper end of farming.  Again, the idea that one puts the money aside and then averages it seems to make sense.  I think that is a reasonable idea.  It would be good if we could find common cause across farming organisations as to what the requirements are.<br \/>A total of 60% of farmers have an off-farm income.  Off-farm income is a very valid issue and must be looked at in one form or another.  It should depend on what percentage of one's income is off-farm, but the idea that if one is out if one has any off-farm income does not make any sense.  <br \/>I hear what the witnesses are saying with regard to capital loans and stock relief.  It will be a huge issue for the dairy sector if there is to be expansion, because 18,000 out of 120,000 farmers are engaged in dairying, which is about 15%.  I will home in on a few points.  In respect of the 120,000 farmers, do the witnesses have any data between them regarding how many of them have a taxable income?  I am not talking about a farm income.  We must take into account the fact that in most cases, people look at their family income and take the farm income.  Some people in this country seem to be against people having mixed sources of income.  It is fair to say that if we are going to keep rural populations in many areas of the country, a large proportion of the current farming population would not make a full living out of farming and never will.  The number of farmers would fall very low if they were all to be full-time farmers.  For many farmers, the other big advantage of having a mixture of farm income and possibly some other income - a lot of farming does not take 40 hours per week - is that it helps to deal with the volatility issue, because if one thing is up, the other thing might be down and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  I certainly saw much better farming in my own area when people got employment, because they could invest in the farms, they knew they were going to stay and they could take a much longer view if they had a steady off-farm job.  Therefore, I would be very interested if anybody had information on taxable incomes.  What is the taxable income - zero to &euro;30,000, &euro;30,000 to &euro;60,000, and so on?  The second issue, which was raised by the IFA the other day, is the fact we must figure out how many of those farmers do not have a PAYE income.  The reason I want to know is that we need to calculate how much it would cost to give earned income - self-employed income - what is now the employee tax-free allowance.<\/p> <p>Compared to what it was in the past, the employee allowance is massive.  At &euro;1,650 of a tax credit, it is the same amount as the individual allowance.  If we are to get some sense of the difference it would make and the number it would impact, we must remember that social welfare pensions and carer's allowance attract the PAYE tax credit.  If someone is getting a contributory old age pension or an invalidity pension they get the PAYE allowance, but for some reason if they are on farm assist or disability allowance they do not get it because it is not taxable income.  I would be interested to hear what the cost would be if we were to say it was earned income, as was the case previously, rather than unearned income.  <\/p><p> I am particularly interested in that because I have long been a proponent of much higher compulsory PRSI for the self-employed in return for benefits, invalidity pension in particular, which Deputy Pringle said was coming down the track.  I favour that because it will force people to protect themselves against a future event.  Farmers are vulnerable to accidents and so on and to wind up with no income other than a means tested income as a result of an accident or becoming ill can be a huge hit.  One way of compensating for that would be to try to deal with this issue for the purely self-employed.  I would be interested to see the breakdown in that regard.<\/p><p> Regarding the pay and file dates, it appears to me that the pay date has to remain, and we have been getting vibes that it will remain, but would it cause a problem for self-employed people if the file date was brought forward, which they need because the budget was brought forward?  I understand the argument from the official side is that the data needs to be in by the end of August to ensure that when the budget is done in mid-October, they will know what the income for the year is, which allows them better guess the tax take, even if they do not get the cash until the end of October.  Are they saying pay and file dates should remain or that the pay date should remain the same?  Is one a red line issue or are they both red line issues?  We should get some sense of that today.  They would probably win on the pay; the file date appears to be a much greater challenge.<\/p><p> The IFA representative mentioned a number of issues to do with the CAP.  In terms of putting any reasonable capital programme in place, they will find it hard to spend it because by the time they get a scheme up and running, people apply and get the work done, and they are always much slower to do that than they anticipate, it will become a cash cow for the Department.  That might be useful for the Department as a cash cow but we must consider that only 62% of the Leader money from the last CAP was spent, and we are in the last mile.  It is vitally important to make the scheme available and have a nominal amount, but the actual cash drawdown in 2015, and I know this from endless schemes for which I had responsibility, will be relatively small.<\/p><p> I presume the &euro;52 million for the beef data and genomic schemes will be provided.  I understand from the Department that it will announce GLAS and it will then give farmers a certain amount of time to submit the applications, and in that respect we will have problems in commonage areas and so on.  There will be a closing day and all the online applications will have to be in by that date.  The Department will then have to process and validate the 30,000 applications.  My understanding from the Department is that the 30,000 applicants will go to the starting line on the same day.  We have an announcement date.  People have to be given reasonable time to line up all the planners in all the farm circumstances, for example, where they get 50% agreement on the shareholdings, commonages and so on.  They all get the line.  They have to be approved, and then allowed proceed.  My understanding is that if that were to happen on 1 September, which is an easy figure to work out, they will pay one third of a year's GLAS payment in December.  If it happens on 1 October, they pay one quarter, a sixth on 1 November, and one twelfth on 1 December.  Obviously, if they do it on 1 June they will get half their payment.<\/p><p> The timelines on this are critical.  At this point we come to a conundrum because if my memory serves me right, in the AEOS 3, the farmers asked for more time because there was pressure on planners.  In this case we are talking about five times the number in a group.  What is the timeline on this?  This goes back to what was said about income averaging and PAYE income.  One of the big problems now is that people's incomes are collapsing.  In terms of anyone dependent on REPS payment, their income is collapsing.  When that is taken out of the net income, after all the expenses, it is greatly reducing.  A fair number of these people are not able to collaborate because all of them have farm incomes.  I would like to hear the witness's comments on that.  My guess is that no matter what promises they get farmers will be screaming for extensions to allow them submit all their plans but if the system gets clogged up with planners and all the extra requirement in the plans, they might be the cause of their own delay.  I can understand that if they are under pressure but we will wind up with a situation where the Department has to process all of that.<\/p><p> I do not see a huge amount of GLAS money coming forward next year and if that happens, does the Department have a plan B in that regard?  Will we enhance the genomic scheme or do something for farmers next year to try to keep the cash flow?  Otherwise, we will be facing a big problem.  I could make many more comments but I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700005#E00300","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405587300,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Enright and Mr. Downey for their presentations.  There is a common theme in both presentations regarding volatility with regard to income and particularly how it affects the weaker sector within the industry.  The necessity and importance of the part of Mr. Downey's proposal on the &euro;500 million funding for the rural development programme farmers being provided in this October's budget must be emphasised.<\/p><p>  On the proposals in general, Mr. Enright mentioned that small holding penalties can be detrimental to people in the low income sector.  I refer to single farm payment penalties and so forth.  I share that view.<\/p><p>  Regarding land mobility, tax reliefs and land consolidation, it seems simple in theory and if there is the political will, that can be resolved very easily.  All it will take is a basic understanding of how that can happen, and it should be facilitated to happen.<\/p><p>  I refer to the extra environmental costs and investment, particularly as we move towards the 2020 target, and the importance of on-farm investment to ensure the country meets its potential in that regard.  Incentives should be put in place to encourage producers to reach that target.<\/p><p>  One of Mr. Downey's suggestions was a phased transfer partnership, which would require an agreed transfer contract where both parent and child would work together.  There is no definition of the age of the child, which might help.  I am sure they are not talking about a nine month old child.  That needs to be explained.<\/p><p>  I am also encouraged by the suggestion regarding a tax deposit account, given the volatility of the market, the volatility of income and the role played by weather.<\/p> <p>I refer to the situation two years ago.  Farmers could be having a reasonably good year this year and would have a nice fairly good return and then maybe at the end of the year - such as happened with the fodder crisis two years ago- the gains could be lost and any further investment could be inhibited.  There is much positive information in the presentations.  However, I am concerned about how the child is, so to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700006#F00200","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405587900,"counter":20,"content":"<p>This is a great opportunity to review the overall scheme after a lifetime.  Much has happened since all these taxation issues were implemented many years ago.  As has been pointed out, agriculture plays a key role in the economy, with exports worth &euro;10 billion and growing.  I refer to the targets under Food Harvest 2020.  The key elements in the presentations are land transfer and income volatility.  In my view the fact that we have more farmers in this country who are aged over 80 years than the number aged under 30 years will be a significant issue in the future.  That statistic must be reversed in the time period between now and 2020, which may be ambitious but certainly it must happen in the very near future, in order for agriculture to be productive and viable.  In the past, agriculture was not regarded as a business but it will need to be so regarded in the future and for that to happen we need to get more young farmers.  The child of today to whom Deputy Ferris referred is the farmer of tomorrow and we need to get him or her into the system.<\/p><p>  Land transfer is the big issue and the leasing issue has to be addressed.  I refer to the IFA proposal which I find interesting.  I would welcome more discussion on the proposal to merge income volatility and to encourage lifetime transfer and the tax deposit account issue.  I would like more information on that aspect because it is a good idea.  No sector in agriculture - it could be beef today and tillage tomorrow or dairying in the year after - will be exempt from volatility.  We need to have a system that applies across the board in that regard.<\/p><p>  The other issue which needs to be monitored and addressed is the issue of the pay and file dates.  Filing is one issue but payment is a serious issue.  For example, a request for payment in August prior to the arrival of the single farm payment cheque, the harvest cheque or weanling sales would be a serious issue for income in all farms across the board and payment would not be possible.  The issue of stamp duty also needs to be addressed significantly.  I suggest the big issues are income volatility and associated matters and incentives for encouraging more younger farmers into the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700007#G00200","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1405587900,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their submissions to the committee.  A crucial stage has been reached and it is important to do everything possible to increase farm incomes.  In particular, the beef and sheep sectors are going through a very difficult time at the minute.  Beef has been very difficult over the past number of months and the sector will experience a significant drop in income.  The incomes in the sheep sector are beginning to drop off although these would not have been as bad in earlier times.  However, prices in the sheep sector are beginning to drop off as well now.  We must all do whatever we can.  The dairy sector looks to be that little bit better but I know that dairy farmers will be making significant investments in their operations prior to 2015.  It is crucial to have the GLAS scheme up and running and putting money into farmers' pockets as early as possible in 2015.  It is looking as if it will be in the last quarter of the year before that scheme will be in place.  Quite a number of farmers have been out of REPS for the past two years and have suffered huge losses.  REPS was the real driver while AEOS and the other schemes were that little bit smaller and did not put in the same amount of money into the farmers' pockets.  Quite a number of farmers make investments in the farm using their off-farm income.  It could be asked whether this is a wise choice but farmers will continue to do this.  Lads working in jobs off the farm such as council workers or working in the forestry have in the past invested that money in their farm.<\/p><p>  It is very important to encourage young farmers to take over because the percentage of the farming population in the older age group has been referred to.  There are too many older farmers and we must encourage younger farmers to take over farming in their own right.  There used to be a big gain for farmers who were leasing quota heretofore and were then forced to sell it.  At least there was no capital gains tax on that process so that was a positive aspect.  I thank the witnesses for their submissions.  The committee will work with them to ensure that everything possible can be done for incomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700007#G00300","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1405587900,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the delegations for their attendance.  I will not repeat the points made by other members.  Land mobility is a key issue.  We need to encourage people to participate in land leasing.  Capital acquisitions tax and agricultural relief are crucial to land mobility.  For younger farmers to have the opportunity to access and to grow their enterprises, we must encourage more people to participate in land leasing.  I refer to the changeover from the RDP when a very bad thing happened because those who had long-term leases were the ones who were penalised and ended up worse off than those who had been on conacre.  Fianna F&aacute;il wanted us to do a cost-benefit analysis on the &euro;25 million that was set aside for that but in my view that money was very well spent because people could not be penalised for having entered into what we were encouraging them to do in the long term.<\/p><p>  I take on board the points made about farm partnerships.  I refer to the IFA policy on compulsory purchase.  Is it an element of roll-over relief on the supply licences and co-op shares?  The days of building roads through farms has gone.  I ask Ms Rowena Dwyer to comment.  <\/p><p>  The role of this committee is to deal with all aspects of agriculture as opposed to finance but the finances are key.  It is important to hear submissions from all the farming organisations and to engage with them well in advance of the budget so that we can work with a concerted voice in the autumn to ensure that the agriculture sector is well protected.  This review of the taxation model provides a significant opportunity and we must ensure we get it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700007#G00400","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1405587900,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Not too many questions have been asked, apart from the definition of \"the child\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700007#G00500","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405587900,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I have a 20 year old child at home at the moment and he certainly would not describe himself as a child-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700007#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Downey"},{"type":"speech","time":1405587900,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Does he bring home the washing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700007#G00700","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405587900,"counter":26,"content":"<p>He has just finished his green certificate.  We are talking here about young trained farmers qualifying for this and we want them to be incentivised by a phased transfer system.  It makes absolute sense to go down that route.  This is the first time anyone has challenged the whole farm succession issue.  To provide a phased process, a period of time by which one gets into a contract and the transfer takes place, gives security both to parents and to young trained farmers during that process.  It is a good proposal.<\/p> <p>From the point of view of the Exchequer, it could be a benefit, even though there could be a tax incentive within it, in that there would be two active farmers working on a farm plus a young active farmer coming into it to drive it forward.  There is a benefit in that for the Exchequer in the long term.  <\/p><p> Land leasing continues to be a major issue for us and we need to take the road blocks out of that process.  Deputy Heydon spoke the tax relief secured on land leasing.  If farmers did not get such tax relief, it would be the death-knell for land leasing.  If there is to be a future for agriculture, we must have land mobility and stability within that system whereby a farmer can lease land for a period and actively  farm it for that period, knowing that he will have access to it next year, the year after and year after that.  That is the only system that will work.  It was welcome to get the provision of such tax relief and it is essential that we drive forward the land leasing issue.  <\/p><p> Co-operatives want farmers to compulsory share-up in their co-operatives, in other words, to buy shares in them to build their sustainability.  Farmers should be able to write off such investment against income tax because it is an investment they have to make in their industry.  When such shares are sold, they are taxable at that stage.  That is a reasonable measure.  It means there is a tax incentive for farmers to buy shares in their co-operatives and the co-operatives will get the money they need to advance and drive forward their businesses.  That measure would involve a minimal cost to the Exchequer.<\/p><p> Most members referred to the tax deposit scheme.  It would operate on the basis of having a special tax deposit account.  One option open to a farmer is to invest a pension which would mean the money would be taken out of the system, pushed to one side and no longer available to farmer and the tax would be foregone on it.  That would be a negative from the point of view of the Exchequer.  Another option is that a farmer could invest in a company and pay 12.5% tax on all of his income.  By placing the money in a deposit account, it means the tax will be foregone for that year but when the money comes back into the business, and it will have to come back in it within a five-year period, the tax will have to be paid on it at that stage.  It will come back into the business when it will be of more advantage to the farmer in a low income year and it will help to keep the cashflow steady on that farm over that period.  It should be possible for the farmer to secure a loan against 50% of its value, because tax on it would be paid at the rate of 50%, and therefore, it would not affect the cashflow on the farm, and the farmer could continue to grow the farm.  There will be a particular period of high investment over the next period and a number of measures in our proposal deal with achieving what is set out in Food Harvest 2020 where there will no longer be milk quotas next year, when farmers will have make considerable investment, particularly in the area of incentives for stock relief for those first four years.<\/p><p> It is essential that the &euro;500 million for the rural development programme is in place in this year's budget.  Schemes under it must be got up and running.  A number of members asked questions about the timeline around GLAS.  The rules and regulations around it should be available by next year and applications for it should be in place early next year.  The idea that all applicants must have their applications in before there is an opportunity for the planners to put in the full plans for it is a non-runner.  This scheme must be brought in on a phased basis over the year.  Those who submit their applications will get them in early and the scheme can be got up and running as quickly as possible.  On the issue of the planners being involved, we should let them worry about that, we should get the scheme up and running and get the money in place to make sure that happens.  As was clearly laid out, no scheme was available last year.  A number of farmers have not participated in a scheme for the past two or even three years.  They are ready and willing to get up and running as quickly as possible with a new scheme.<\/p><p> On the issue of the pay and file date, it is essential that the pay date is held.  We would prefer to leave the file date as it is.  There would have to be a period of readjustment within that and it creates complications for the accountants and the professional system but it is essential that the pay date is held.  <\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked a question on the tax credits.  We estimate there is a &euro;170 million paid by self- employed people in extra tax that is not paid people within the PAYE system.  To break that down, a single farmer on an income of &euro;20,00 pays 20% tax whereas an employee in the PAYE system on an equivalent amount would pay about 10% tax.  There are 135,000 individuals who pay at that level and some 90,000 of them probably earn more than &euro;17,000, therefore, we are looking at a figure of &euro;170 million.  That is an amount foregone.  This is what the lack of an allowance costs the self-employed and we consider that to be an anomaly in the system.  We are well aware of the state of the public finances but we flag this as a major issue and it is something that should be addressed in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700007#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Downey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405588500,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Smith wish to add a further comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700008#H00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405588500,"counter":29,"content":"<p>There was a suggestion that the PRSI rates for the self-employed should increase.  We need to be very wary of that because the availability of cash is the problem on most farms and having the ability to pay the bills on a day-to-day basis.  If there is an suggestion of an increase it will have to be optional and we would insist on that.  In the context of capital expenditure, we are not so pessimistic.  Already this year we have met the banks in the context of the difficulties experienced by livestock and tillage farmers and they have told us that this year farmers have plans to spend approximately &euro;300 million to &euro;450 million.  There represents a good deal of expenditure on farms.  Payments under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, need to be put in place early to give farmers the confidence to proceed with investments.  I have no doubt if the experience of the farm waste management scheme is anything to go by, that all of that TAMS money will be spent in the context of keeping jobs in rural Ireland.<\/p><p>  An important job of work we have to do with regard to GLAS payments is to make sure that the money to provide for them is in the budget.  I see no reason the scheme cannot be open and paid from 1 January next year.  Such cashflow concerns are seriously damaging confidence, particularly in low income sectors and vulnerable regions.

It is crucial for farmers to have access to land.  Mr. Eddie Downey covered much of the land leasing issue.  An elderly farmer can lease land to a stranger and tax relief on land leasing can be secured, but that farmer cannot lease land to his son, daughter or nephew.  It is important to get that issue addressed.<\/p><p>  Another important issue is land mobility, the transferring of land to the younger generation.  It is heart-breaking for a young farmer, or a middle aged farmer like myself, to be looking out across the field at land that is not farmed to its maximum or anywhere near it, while other farmers are farming their land to its potential.  We must encourage a greater level of land leasing.  We must also get an extension of stamp duty relief for young farmers in terms of land mobility.  Facing a bill of &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 when young farmers are starting off knocks them back straight away.  In terms of land mobility, if farmers do not have the land, they do not have anything.  Another important issue is land consolidation.  If one has 40 acres, one can sell that land and buy a home, but one cannot sell two bits of land and move to a better place that would help everybody environmentally in terms of the carbon footprint<\/p><p>  On the pay and file date issue, as Mr. Eddie Downey said, farmers cannot pay before the pay date.  Towards the end of the year dairy farmers have paid off all their bills.  From talking to accountants, they say it will be legitimately impossible to have it ready any sooner.  They are battling as it is and if we try to move back the date, bearing in mind that we are approaching the traditional two-week holiday period, accountants who have, say, 200 clients, might have to drop 10% of them to be able to logistically get the books right.<\/p><p>  There are a few other points that Ms Mary Buckley wishes to address. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700008#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Enright"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405589100,"counter":32,"content":"<p>It has been stated that agriculture is the backbone of our economy and an important aspect is stimulating economic activity in rural areas and helping businesses become viable.

If the capital allowances can be accelerated for farmers who have to invest a good deal of money in building, they will have more money available and they will spend it.<\/p><p>  In terms of getting money front-loaded for the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, particularly the dairy equipment scheme, we will need that in the period starting 2015.  Come 2019, most of the expansions on farms will have taken place in terms of post-quota and achieving the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020.  In terms of the rural development programme, we need to get the TAMS in particular front-loaded, and also GLAS.

I thank the Chairman for the invitation to address this committee.  It was on 14 February last year that I first sat before the members to present my credentials as chairman designate of Horse Racing Ireland.  I formally took over from the previous chairman, Denis Brosnan, in March of last year.  My background lies in family business where I have been chairman and chief executive officer, CEO, of the Keeling Group, a multinational group of companies employing in excess of 1,600 people in Ireland, England and Holland.  Having overseen its development from a fresh produce grower in the 1970s, I retired as CEO in March 2013.<\/p><p>  My strong interest in horse racing stretches back 60 years, having been a racegoer, a sponsor, an owner, a breeder and a director of Fairyhouse Racecourse.  That experience, along with my business background and my belief that horse racing and breeding is the sort of industry to help Ireland recover from recession, is what allowed me to take this role.<\/p><p>  When I last addressed the committee I outlined four key priorities for developing and securing the thoroughbred sector in Ireland.  I said we needed to achieve a long-term secure funding base arising from the changes in betting tax, that we needed to increase prize money to ensure owners have an incentive to keep horses training in Ireland, that we must reduce the cost of the sector, in particular from streamlining the activities of the Turf Club and Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and that we must focus on race course development.<\/p><p>  To do all of this we need secure funding.  That leads me to my primary aim today, which is to emphasise the importance of a long-term secure funding system arising from the changes in the betting tax.  At 1%, Ireland has the lowest betting regime in the world.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, published the findings of the Indecon report in July 2012, which strongly supported the sufficient and sustainable funding for the sector.  On that day almost two years ago, the Minister pointed out that the Government had recently published the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2012 to put into effect the extension of the betting duty to remote and online betting operators.  We still look forward to seeing its implementation.<\/p><p>  Last year, I also spoke of the need to reduce costs through, among other measures, streamlining the activities of HRI and The Turf Club, which is another strong recommendation in the Indecon report.<\/p> <p>Progress in this regard has been painfully slow.  This is very disappointing and frustrating as it is necessary to deliver cost reductions to all participants in the sport.  The Bill sets out the way to make that much-needed progress.  I welcome its publication and ask the committee to recommend its early introduction.<\/p><p> My colleague, Mr. Kavanagh, will go through the detail of the Bill.  In addition to his role as chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, he holds various international positions, including chairman of the European Pattern Committee and vice chairman of the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities.  His leading role in these international bodies reflects the high regard in which Irish racing is held internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700009#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Keeling","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405589700,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to present to them and for the interest they have always taken in our sport and industry.  The Bill represents the culmination of a review of the industry that was initiated by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in December 2011 and incorporates the recommendations of a report prepared by Indecon economic consultants.  The proposed new legislation strengthens governance and transparency within the racing industry and will create greater accountability to the Government in the decisions and membership of Horse Racing Ireland, which was one of the key recommendations made in the report.<br \/>The legislation will increase the number of ministerial appointees to the board and clearly assign governance and regulatory responsibility, clarifying previously grey areas such point to point meetings, finance and administration.  It will provide a single transparent structure for the administration and financial management of the industry.  It will eliminate duplication and increase efficiencies in areas such as finance, information technology and administration.  The Bill proposes to establish a new statutory committee to focus on the requirements of persons employed in the industry and represent their interests on the board of Horse Racing Ireland.  It will also establish a new statutory committee to focus on the requirements of the betting sector, both on-course and off-course, and represent their interests on the board.<br \/>The Bill requires HRI to provide any information requested by the Minister and the Turf Club to provide information for the Minister or HRI as requested.  Under these provisions, the horse and greyhound racing fund can be paid over by instalments and the Minister may withhold instalments depending on performance against plans submitted by HRI or Bord na gCon.  The Bill will allow the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to undertake regular value for money reviews of the horse and greyhound racing fund and HRI.  It will allow for the introduction of a framework agreement between HRI and the Turf Club on funding provided for integrity services, an issue raised by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General during the course of its audit.  It provides that there will be no change to the role of hunt clubs in the running of point to point racing.<br \/>Horse Racing Ireland welcomes the proposed Bill and the transparency and clarity it will bring to the running of the industry.  As Mr. Keeling said, the horse racing and breeding industries are significant contributors to the rural economy and it is appropriate that the governance and financial structures should reflect that importance.  Several key economic facts are worth considering, although I am sure they have been presented by the various delegations that have appeared before the committee.  The industry contributes &euro;1.1 billion annually to the economy and provides 16,000 jobs, mainly in rural areas.  Irish horses are exported to some 37 countries every year, to a value of more than &euro;200 million.  There are 6,500 breeders in Ireland, 15% of whom are overseas investors, spread across every county.  Racing festivals contribute some &euro;260 million per year to local economies.  The Galway races, for instance, which take place the week after next, are worth &euro;60 million to the local economy.  In 2013 attendances at race meetings grew to 1.24 million, including approximately 80,000 tourists.  I understand our marketing department submitted material to the committee in advance of the meeting, including our fact book containing useful and interesting facts about the industry.<br \/>Horse Racing Ireland would like to see the Bill implemented at the earliest possible date.  Since the review was commissioned by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the industry has been eagerly waiting legislation and several board changes have had to be deferred pending its introduction.  The Bill will be the third in a series of Acts of the Oireachtas which create a more democratic and inclusive structure for the governance of racing in Ireland.  The previous Acts are the Irish Horseracing Industry Act 1994 and the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, the second of which created a representative governing body for the industry and transferred various functions to that body.  These Acts were introduced with general all-party support.  In bringing forward the 2001 Act the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Mr. Joe Walsh, explained the thinking behind it thus:<blockquote>[T]he Government considers racing to be strategically important because of the employment it creates and sustains at all levels and the significant contribution it makes to rural development, farm and other incomes, the business and services sector, tourism, the economy as a whole and the international reputation of the State ... There was a large body of opinion in the industry which held the same view as mine ... that better efficiencies of operation and cohesion could be achieved if at least all the main administrative and financial streams of the racing business could be brought together into one new body ... From now on, all elements of the industry will deal with one body in relation to their participation in racing and their financing arrangements.<\/blockquote>The recommendations made in the Indecon report which are reflected in the proposed Bill were that through streamlining, further cost savings could be made in the industry.  Participants in horse racing - owners, trainers and riders - are levied charges by both HRI and the Turf Club.  These charges are a significant burden and the board of HRI is committed to reducing and rationalising them.  This year, as a first step, we implemented a 10% cut in the charges levied on our clients.  The intention is that savings generated from streamlining, as proposed in the heads of Bill and estimated to amount to a minimum of &euro;1.5 million per annum, will be passed on to owners, trainers and riders through a further programme of cost reductions and rationalisation.  The high level of charges, particularly race entry fees, are acting as a disincentive to owners to have horses in training in Ireland as opposed to in other countries.  The Indecon report was based on 44 submissions from various industry bodies and individuals and there has been an extensive period of consultation to produce the heads of the Bill.  The industry recognises the responsibilities that come with being in receipt of Exchequer funding and the requirement to be as efficient and transparent as possible.<br \/>While Horse Racing Ireland is supportive of the Bill, there are two specific areas of concern to which we wish to draw the attention of the committee.  The first relates to head 9, liability for the thoroughbred foal levy.  Our concern is that there may be an unintended consequence of the proposed wording whereby British breeders whose foals are born in Ireland may not be required to pay the levy as they will be able to register their foals in Britain.  This is because Britain and Ireland operate a single stud book, which is very useful in the free movement of horses between the two islands.  This anomaly can be corrected by simply amending the wording of section 38A(2) of the 1994 Act, as set out under head 9, to read: &quot;The levy shall be paid by the owner of a thoroughbred foal born in the State in advance of registering the foal in a stud-book in the State&quot;.  Likewise, we are proposing a small change in section 38A(2A) in order that it would read, &quot;A person who maintains a stud-book will not register a foal if the owner or keeper of the foal is unable to provide proof that the levy has been paid&quot;.  These changes would leave it beyond any doubt that the payment of the statutory foal levy was a precondition to the registration of a foal.<br \/>The second issue we wish to raise relates to the horse and greyhound racing fund, as set out in head 15.  The proposed wording of section 12(9)(c) of the 2001 Act, as inserted by the Bill, envisages a situation where funding may be withheld by the Minister in certain circumstances.  This is a new development and as there is a large group of people within the industry whose livelihoods depend on the funding of the horse and greyhound racing fund, we ask that these provisions be reconsidered and the existing provisions in section 12 of the 2001 Act retained.<br \/>The Indecon report made recommendations in five separate areas, namely, funding, size and structure of the board, streamlining of functions between HRI and the Turf Club, marketing and competitiveness, and legislation.  The proposed heads of Bill deals with the second through to the fifth of these but do not resolve the funding issue which is critical to the future of the industry.  I understand this issue does not relate directly to the committee and is the subject of separate legislation which is moving through the Oireachtas.  In the past five years Horse Racing Ireland has suffered annual funding cuts of &euro;15.9 million on average, while at the same time our direct competitors in Britain and France have seen an increase in funding.  The solution to this dilemma is straightforward and would save the Exchequer approximately &euro;30 million per year.  It involves addressing the betting tax anomaly which sees one third of all betting in Ireland avoiding tax, while that which is taxed is subject to the lowest rate of betting tax in the world.<br \/>HRI wishes to see the recommendations on the funding of the horse racing sector set out in the Indecon report implemented as soon as possible.  We ask the committee to take this into consideration in its deliberations.  These recommendations include the introduction of measures to secure a significant increase in taxation from betting, a multi-annual commitment of funds to support the development of the horse racing sector and greater funding certainty to support medium-term planning for integrity services.<\/p> <p>As betting revenues increase, there should be potential to significantly reduce general Exchequer expenditure on the sector.  All betting operators should be required to obtain a licence.  Taxation for betting exchanges and remote betting should be levied on the same basis as for traditional bookmakers.  Taxation on betting should be on a place of consumption basis.  The rate of betting duty should initially be set at 1% and reviewed after one year and effective compliance measures should be introduced.  As I said, this is a matter for the Betting (Amendment) Bill, which is not the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  <\/p><p> It is essential that these issues are addressed.  Otherwise, Ireland will continue to lose ground to its international competitors.  Our industry is a great industry.  The people involved in it have a great passion for it.  Horse racing and thoroughbred breeding are one of the few industries in which Ireland has proven natural advantages in terms of our climate, land and people.  To be fully able to develop this industry, the funding structure needs to be put on a permanent basis.  This is what was envisaged in the 2001 legislation but this has gone awry due to changes in betting taxation, particularly the decision in 2006 to reduce the betting duty from 2% to 1%.  <\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to present to it and for its interest in this sector.  The chairman and I are happy to respond to any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700010#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405590300,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I draw Mr. Kavanagh's attention to the screen on his right, on which it is indicated that the Betting (Amendment) Bill is at Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.

On the betting tax issue, the reason this tax is low is that it was confined to bookmakers and there was migration to online betting.  It is my hope that this Bill will be enacted and become law.  We can then set a new betting tax.  People in the horse racing industry have said to me that if a 3% tax on betting was introduced not only would this hugely increase funding to horse racing, but it would allow funding for other equine activities.  While this issue does not come within the remit of the legislation we are discussing today, it must be part of the suite of actions to develop the horse racing industry.  In my view, the only way of developing this industry is to ensure there is in place a source of revenue that is tax based, although not from general taxation.  It would be hard to persuade the public to put money into what some people would see as a luxury activity.  The introduction of a higher betting tax is the solution to many of the problems in this area.<\/p><p>  As rightly pointed out, this Bill deals with governance issues.  It is important there is good governance in place when there is a great deal of money going through an industry.  I have noted the two issues raised.  The witnesses can take it they will be given careful consideration by Fianna F&aacute;il in the context of it proposing any recommendations to this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700011#L00500","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1405590300,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

I have a few concerns which may not be particularly related to this Bill but about which the representatives might be able to enlighten me.  As I understand it, the Turf Club and Horse Racing Ireland have premises in the Curragh.  Would it be possible in the context of the putting in place of a more cohesive plan in this area for rented premises to be shared as a cost saving measure?

Our engagement on this legislation thus far has been good.  It is the committee's first time dealing with pre-legislative scrutiny of a Bill.  In my view, this will prove its merits when we come to deal with the more detailed elements of the Bill.  We had a particularly good engagement last Tuesday with four different delegations in that there was a healthy and robust debate between the bookmakers and others on particular issues.  I concur with the points made by both witnesses today in relation to funding.  In my view, there is an element of the industry that tends to paint the bookmakers as the big bad problem.  We must find ways to work better with them in terms of their expertise in marketing and so on in this area.  There are synergies that can be made.<\/p><p>  Mr. Keeling referred in his presentation to the focus on racecourse redevelopment.  Perhaps he would update the committee on where we are in terms of redevelopment of the Curragh, which is one of the most important jobs of work in terms of racecourse redevelopment.  The Betting (Amendment) Bill is currently before the D&aacute;il.  It is not before time.  There has been huge frustration about the length of time it has taken to get that Bill to its current Stage.  Ms Sharon Byrne of Boylesports mentioned when before the committee recently that there was a great deal of focus on the betting shops.  The elephant in the room was the fact that much of the movement in terms of shop closures was the move to online betting.  We must ensure we have in place a structure that captures this.  We can then discuss issues such as rates and returning the industry to a self-financing position.<\/p><p>  I would like now to comment on a couple of points raised in Mr. Kavanagh's presentation.  On the fixtures committee, concern was expressed by some of the delegations that have appeared before the committee thus far about the fixtures committee.  I would welcome if Mr. Kavanagh could elaborate on how the programmes committee has worked up to now and his view on the impact of what is proposed in this Bill if it goes ahead.  Another issue of concern is that Horse Racing Ireland, through necessity, governs or controls a number of racecourses directly and the possible conflict of interest in its having responsibility for racecourses which it owns and manages on a daily basis and privately owned racecourses?<\/p><p>  The media rights committee and the importance of it has also received considerable mention.  Ms Sharon Byrne of Boylesports mentioned on Tuesday that the bookmaking industry paid &euro;24 million towards the Horse and Greyhound Fund and &euro;30 million in respect of the provision of television services in bookmakers.  Often there is so much focus on tax matters that we lose sight of the importance of media rights.  Is Mr. Kavanagh happy that the proposed media rights committee will be robust and well placed to ensure the maximisation of a return for the industry, which is extremely important?  <\/p><p>  Particular sections of the industry are unhappy that they are to lose their representation on the board.  For example, stable staff and jockeys have expressed concern at having to share their board membership position.  Perhaps Mr. Kavanagh would outline his views on how the board as a representative board has worked to date and say whether he would have a difficulty with the number of representatives on the board being increased from 12 to 15, which would mean everybody would have their own representative?  In Mr. Kavanagh's view, would that be unworkable and cause difficulties?  It is important in the context of the compilation of our report that we are aware of people's views in this regard.  Perhaps allowing everybody representation would not be a bad thing.<\/p> <p>Would Mr. Keeling, in his capacity as chairman, envisage a difficulty with that?  It might be a better recommendation for us.  That is how I am leaning at present.  I am interested in hearing the views of the delegates on it.<\/p><p> When the ITBA representatives were here on Tuesday, they mentioned funding and marketing.  In Mr. Kavanagh's presentation, he highlighted the importance of marketing and competitiveness.  Will he outline what steps have been taken to improve marketing and competitiveness since the publication of the Indecon report?<\/p><p> With regard to the funding for ITM and its very important work, the chairman of the ITBA made a comparison with Dairygold on Tuesday.  When Kerry Group relaunched Dairygold, it invested over &euro;1.2 million promoting a product and brand that were extremely well known.  Approximately &euro;1 million was invested in ITM.  Is that sufficient?  Are we getting the best return for it?  Is this an area where we could invest more?  Could we get more back if we did?<\/p><p> In his presentation, Mr. Kavanagh said the proposed legislation would strengthen governance and transparency.  Some concern has been raised over the legislative head on the setting of directives.  It is stated HRI can set its own directives if any of the others do not cover what is required.  That could be seen as a catch-all that gives full power to the incumbent CEO or board.  We must be very cognisant of future-proofing.  At a time when there are different individuals involved, the current politicians have moved on and the board members have all changed, the structures will have to be sufficiently robust.<\/p><p> Mr. Kavanagh mentioned the establishment of a new statutory committee to focus on requirements of persons employed in the industry and representing the interests of the board of HRI.  Let me ask about the specific issue of stall handlers.  This manifested as a problem in Dundalk last year.  Have the issues that arose been addressed?<\/p><p> Mr. Kavanagh mentioned in his presentation the Turf Club and funding for integrity services.  It has been suggested by some in the industry that if HRI controls the money, that, in itself, could be a problem in regard to integrity services.  To be truly independent and have adequate integrity, it is argued, one must have one&rsquo;s own funding supply.  What are the views of the delegates on that?  We take integrity for granted.  We have integrity in the industry and if we ever lose it we will not get it back.  If we lose it, it will be too late to seek redress.  It is really important that any initiative we take copperfasten and strengthen the perception of integrity as much as integrity itself.  Both are equally important.<\/p><p> Was point-to-point racing mentioned in the Indecon report?  Where did that come into the mix?  I take the point made by the delegation on head 9.  The ITBA raised that here during the week.  We will definitely make a recommendation to ensure there are no anomalies in that regard.<\/p><p> I completely agree with the points on funding.  We need to return to a point where the industry is self-financing.  It never wanted to be in its current position.  It employs approximately 16,000 people, as Mr. Kavanagh stated.  It used to employ well over 20,000 people.  I do not see why we cannot return to that figure.  This would result in economic activity in parts of the country where there are very few alternatives.  I support the efforts in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700011#L00900","speaker":"949","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405590900,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their excellent submission and contributions this morning.  I have some comments and questions to add to those of Deputy Heydon.  While I realise we are supposed to be focusing on the Bill, I believe having the delegates present is a great opportunity to talk about bookmakers.  If we were to increase the tax, should it affect the bookmaker or the customer?  Should we split it between the two?  Would it not be mad to tax turnover rather than profit?  I would go out of business in certain years if I were taxed on turnover, because the margin differs depending on trends associated with commodities in the global market.  I would be interested in hearing Mr. Keeling's comments on taxation.  In asking this, I am taking advantage of his presence today.<\/p><p>  I heard Mr. Keeling speak very well on the radio around the time of the Derby.  We were all sad about the Derby this year and the runners.  It is so important to our fixtures and to how we present ourselves to the world.  Dubai Duty Free was the sponsor - my goodness.  Will the delegates comment on the pattern committee?  How can we get France, England and Ireland to ensure races are properly spaced out?  How could we have the equivalent of a Triple Crown such that we would be assured of getting the French and English runners as opposed to simply having an uncompetitive race, albeit with the most wonderful horse we will see for years?  We still like a bit of competition.<\/p><p>  With regard to integrity, which is the nub of the Bill, I would like a few comments from Mr. Kavanagh on the investment to date in integrity services.  There is so much involved in integrity, including in respect of cameras on course and keeping up to date.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Ferris, who is not present, was very interested in the comments of the delegation.  This is a difficult time for the Turf Club and HRI because change is afoot.  Change is hard but good.  The comments of Deputy Ferris on the premises interest me greatly.  Is there enough room for everyone?  Can we put up Chinese walls and save substantial money, for the good of the industry.  I would like to hear the delegates comments on that.  I would like to hear the comments of the Turf Club also when its representatives are present.<\/p><p>  If there were a huge court case in years to come, what would happen?  At present, I understand that the Turf Club has a fund in its backroom that would fund a High Court or Supreme Court case.  This could be expensive.  If HRI's funding from the Government is such that there are only so many euros to go around, what would happen if there were a very expensive court case and this legislation were passed as it stands?<\/p><p>  With regard to the comments of Deputy Martin Heydon, not everyone is as passionate as we all are about the industry.  The past few days have served the industry very well.  To me, the racing bodies are like an IDA or Enterprise Ireland of the rural sector throughout the country.  I refer to all the foreign direct investment.  I was very interested in hearing Mr. Kavanagh's comments on how far we are falling behind.  This is why it is important that we get this betting legislation right.  If in the future we had a Government that did not particularly like racing and whose mandate just did not cover it, I would worry about who would be put on the board.  Every submission we have heard expressed worry about the board.  Everyone wants a place on the board.  The Indecon report referred to 12 members.  We want to hear the delegates' comments on the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700012#M00200","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1405590900,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for indulging me again.  We have had a fascinating three sessions so far.  I welcome the comments made by Mr. Keeling and Mr. Kavanagh, who are representing HRI.<\/p><p>  There is to be a consolidation.  Given this consolidation, could Mr. Kavanagh outline where the savings will accrue?  Deputy Ferris alluded to premises.  Will everything operate from one building?  What staff will be let go?  Obviously, staff costs comprise one of the high associated costs.  If there is to be consolidation under the Bill, what will the exact process be?<\/p><p>  With regard to head 5, might there be a conflict over the allocation of grants, loans and disbursements to the racecourses, particularly considering that HRI manages and owns four of the racetracks and that 20% of the race meetings are associated with those four racetracks?<\/p> <p> Second, can the witnesses outline what subsidiaries of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, they will be managing?  This is specifically mentioned in head 5 of the Bill.  A consistent theme running through all the presentations thus far is with regard to funding.  While everyone has been focused on the betting side, as Deputy Heydon has mentioned, huge funding comes from the media rights.  The legislation refers to the exclusivity of the HRI to decide on the media rights.  As everyone is aware that some racetracks are much more progressive, what are HRI's views with regard to progressive racetracks that are not under its remit which actually try to sell the product?  In the context of the legislation, Mr. Kavanagh might outline exactly what he thinks would be the impact in respect of them trying to sell the product.  Mr. Kavanagh might outline exactly what he thinks in this regard.<\/p><p> Sponsorship is a huge part of racing and during his presentation, Mr. Keeling mentioned he had been a sponsor previously.  Another area is the Tote and according to reports members have received, the Tote has actually lost money over the past four years.  How is this accounted for in the accounts of HRI?  Is it right that a sector which generates &euro;50 million in turnover generates no income for the racing industry?  This goes back to head 5 of the Bill on managing any subsidiary of HRI and pertains to the capacity of HRI to manage the Tote.  One point that stands out for me is that the Tote operated by the greyhound industry makes returns to that industry.  However, it also has someone in charge of it who actually is a betting person and is associated with the betting industry.  The witnesses should comment on this point.  Deputy Heydon mentioned the overreaching part in this legislation, whereby the HRI will have the right to make directives and enforce them on the industry, and I certainly have a concern in this regard.  As for the fees that are being collected at present by the Turf Club on the registration side, the Bill proposes this should be managed by HRI.  Will HRI return all those fees to the Turf Club?  Should the Turf Club be fortunate enough to generate any income itself, will it be taken into account when HRI is making a return to the Turf Club to safeguard the integrity of racing?  The most important thing for people is to believe the integrity of racing is of the highest standard.  It is important that funding is in place and should not be compromised in any way by what the Turf Club might do to generate income itself.<\/p><p> There are a couple of other matters.  In all the presentations, no one has mentioned anything about the customer, be that a betting customer or a punter who goes racing.  It is strange that this aspect of the industry is not mentioned in the Bill.  Mr. Keeling might comment on whether it is possible that someone who is not an integral part of industry but is part of the industry, in the sense that he or she goes racing and gambles, might be considered for the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700012#M00300","speaker":"1053","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405591500,"counter":53,"content":"<p>There are a number of questions to which the witnesses may respond in whichever way they wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700013#N00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405591500,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I will take the first one.  In respect of board numbers, I agree that from my own experience, smaller is better and certainly a board of 12 or 13 is as big as one would want.  It is always more difficult to manage a bigger number and can be slow progress.  While everyone would like representative numbers, I perceive increasing the size to be more difficult.  Another element is that when I took office in March 2013, I was promised a new board.  Things have been a bit slower because we have not had a new board.  We have a lot of board members whose time is up, some of whom wish to move on.  It is difficult at present and the sooner we get a new board, the sooner we can get in new enthusiasm and grow, but I certainly would not like to see bigger numbers.<\/p><p>  On the development of the Curragh, we have agreed a new shareholding structure to build the Curragh in which HRI has one third, the Turf Club has one third and benefactors have one third.  We are getting a company to do that at present and much preparatory work is entailed in getting agreement.  There is no point in rushing into it and we probably need to spend approximately &euro;5 million to get to planning permission stage.  Thereafter, we cannot do anything else until we have funding, but it is my ambition to have the Curragh built by 2017.  I reiterate that without funding, it would be very difficult.  We can get the project started and can get it to planning permission stage but thereafter, it would be difficult.<\/p><p>  As for the question on betting tax, it is a duty, not a corporation tax, and in my view the customer should pay it.  I have been going to races for many years and have been in situations where one paid 20% tax.  However, it did not stop people from betting and I believe the customer should pay the betting tax.

The two premises will remain.  It is not the intention, however, to have one structure for integrity.  Ireland is unique in that we have a separate integrity body to look after the refereeing of and the integrity of the sport.  That is a valuable concept and a valuable principle but it is different in other jurisdictions.  The Turf Club is independently responsible for deciding who can get a licence to train or to ride or what discipline should be imposed on trainers or riders in the event that there is a breach of the rules.  As for Deputy Heydon's questions, I will try to hit the main ones and he should revert to me if I have missed something.  I agree with him that bookies are not the big bad problem and one welcome element of this legislation is the creation of a forum comprising all the betting industry, including off-course and on-course operators, betting exchanges and the Tote, which will represent the views of bookmakers to the board of Horse Racing Ireland.  Many of the issues with which the bookmakers deal have a direct impact on our activities, such as field sizes, which affect the value of races from a betting perspective, the times at which races are run and the dates on which races are run.  Consequently, creating a formal statutory body that creates a communications structure between the betting industry and the board of Horse Racing Ireland can only be a good thing.<\/p><p>  On the fixtures committee, I understand the Bill proposes to standardise the size of all committees at five people.  The fixtures are the single biggest decision of expenditure that the board of Horse Racing Ireland will take.  We are due to take a decision next Monday on next year's fixture list at the board meeting next Monday.  Effectively, that will determine the budget for the following year because it then leads on to prize money and integrity costs for servicing each of those fixtures.  Consequently, the only change to the fixtures committee is that its size will be reduced from seven to five members.  I understand that is a standard process across all the committees so, for example, the size of the media rights committee is being increased from three to five.  I believe the fixtures and programme structure works well at present.  There is a programmes committee that deals with the day-to-day programme of races, that is, the category and type of race that is run at each track.<\/p> <p>It is a mirror committee of the fixtures committee and they work together to bring in the best race programme.  It is a consultative process and there are working groups working to those committees which are representative of various industry bodies.  The committees comprise members of the HRI board.<\/p><p> The media rights committee, which has been one of the successes of HRI, is chaired by the racecourse representative on the HRI board.  For the past six years, Mr. John Moloney has chaired it.  It negotiates the media rights for Irish racing.  The 1994 Act clearly stated that the media rights, the property rights over the sale of pictures or commentaries at a race meeting, belonged to the racecourses.  Other parties would dispute that the racecourses have full entitlement to it.  Some of the jockeys and owners claim it is akin to a situation in which a musical, show or play is staged in a theatre.  Whatever the arguments, the legislation is black and white that the rights belong to the racecourses.<\/p><p> The 2001 Act introduced a new provision whereby a HRI media rights committee would negotiate media rights.  Since then, we have doubled the value of the media rights to the racecourses and Irish racing.  It works well, and the racecourses would concur.  Media rights comprise not only the pictures and commentaries of races but the information on the runners and riders which appears in the daily newspapers.  One cannot sell one without the other; in order to sell pictures, one must have details of runners and riders which are the property of HRI.  The beauty of the media rights committee is that it binds all the racecourses, small and large, together with HRI in one negotiation.  The media rights committee is able to sit across from potential purchasers and negotiate the sale of complete rights to Irish racing.<\/p><p> The value of those rights is maximised by selling them as a package.  While an individual racecourse selling its own rights might get a little more, it would be to the detriment of the overall rights because it would diminish the value of the rights for the other racecourses.  The figure of &euro;30 million which Ms Sharon Byrne mentioned on Tuesday was for the picture rights to both Irish and British racing.  Given that there are four times as many British race meetings as Irish, a significant amount of it goes to the British racing industry.  We also sell Irish pictures to the British betting industry, so there is a reverse movement.<\/p><p> The Chairman dealt with the issue of board representation and board size.  While it is not for me to comment, a representative board of 14 people comprising different sectors of the industry could be a potential nightmare scenario.  However, having observed other racing authorities worldwide, I believe it would be a very effective structure because it would get people around a table to discuss problems.  In Britain, there is great fragmentation and much business is done by representatives of organisations shouting at each other across the media.  Perhaps Indecon had this view.  I support the representative board structure.<\/p><p> Indecon gave 12 pages of its report to the size of the board and who should be on it, examining board structures in other semi-State bodies in Ireland and overseas and in other racing authorities overseas, and concluded that a board size of 12 was right and that other bodies not represented should be represented through these new subsidiary committees.  It used the example of the racegoers' consultative forum, which picks up Deputy Lawlor's point, as an effective way of getting the views of those who are not sitting around the board table to the board.<\/p><p> One never has enough funding for ITM.  It does a good job with limited resources and was the first of its kind.  As I said in my presentation, Ireland's exports over 65% of its annual output of thoroughbreds.  We produce 7,500 foals and export more than 5,000 of them, principally to Britain but also to 36 other countries.  Promoting and maximising that is a major task.  The horses are of the best advertisement we have.  The continued success of Irish horses at major races internationally is a strong marketing tool.  New markets that have developed very strongly in recent years include Australia, particularly for staying flat horses.  In 2012, the first seven horses in the Melbourne Cup were bred in Ireland.  It is remarkable that the first seven finishers in Australia's biggest sporting event were born in Ireland.  Last year's winner was also born in Ireland.  This year, there has been a major success story for Irish horses in Hong Kong, which is an important market.  ITM has had a significant cut in funding, as have all areas of expenditure, and we are trying to manage scarce resources.  When we get our funding structure sorted - and, please God, what is happening in the House will accelerate it - the marketing of horses internationally will be a significant area were money needs to be focused.<\/p><p> Deputy Heydon asked about directives.  HRI already has directives, and this is clarifying that these are the terms of trade under which HRI engages with its customers or the people with whom it deals.  My chairman came into his new remit with a mission to reduce the cost to owners, trainers and participants in the sport.  We reduced our charges by 10% last year, and this is just a step along the way.  The charges are determined by directives, and this is how the board fulfils its powers under the legislation.  I do not foresee a situation in which HRI would issue directives to the Turf Club or that the Turf Club would issue rules with which HRI would comply.  It is simply the terms of trade HRI would apply to its customers.  The issue of stalls handlers has been resolved satisfactorily.<\/p><p> While a very good horse won the Irish Derby this year, there was a very small field of only five runners.  The Irish Derby has been less competitive than we would have liked it to have been in recent years.  We have raised this complex issue at international level.  A number of factors are at play, going back to the breeding industry and the types of courses certain owners are breeding.  There is a school of thought that because some of the major international owners are not breeding enough staying types, the pool of horses to run in a race such as the Irish Derby is more limited.  There are issues around the date of the race and the fact that the French Derby's distance was reduced from 12 to 10 furlongs with the winner going on to a 12 furlong race in France which is run on Bastille Day.  While previously the Irish Derby was the decider between the winners of the English and French derbies, the French runners now evade the Irish Derby.  We have raised this with our international counterparts and I will have a meeting next week in London on the issue.<\/p><p> As much as anyone in the business, HRI has a strong interest in the integrity of the sport.  We are selling the pictures of our racing and promoting it to the public and the political system to persuade the Government to fund racing.  We are developing the industry and promoting the sale of Irish horses internationally.  Confidence in the integrity of the sport is a key element in that.  During the past ten years we have had a unique structure whereby there is a separate racing regulatory body, the Turf Club, which regulates the sport, and it has been effective.  HRI spends approximately &euro;6 million per year funding the activities of the Turf Club and a further &euro;2.5 million per year on racecourse services, which is the provision of starting stalls, camera facilities for stewards at race meetings and photo finish equipment.  It is a strong element of our activity.  This Bill does not diminish the integrity role but enhances it by taking away non-core work and allowing us to focus on the integrity of the sport.<\/p><p> In recent years there has been a significant improvement in the quality of pictures available to stewards, which were not up to standard in previous years.  HRI has done an investment together with the racecourses.<\/p> <p>It was a complicated tender involving 26 racecourses and ourselves.  Previously we had a situation whereby two parties filmed the day's racing, one to transmit pictures into the stewards' room in order that the stewards could deliberate on the fairness of a race, and another to transmit through closed-circuit television for the customers at the race meeting.  Those pictures were then sold on to the betting industry.  We examined this arrangement and proposed a rationalisation of the service.  Since the start of this year a single body has been providing both of these services with extra cameras at all race meetings and at a lower cost for the service.  To me, that is a perfect example of a win-win situation.  The customer at the races get better pictures; SIS, which buys the pictures, gets better pictures; and the stewards get better pictures.<\/p><p> There is another element of integrity, and this is an important check and balance in the system.  Only one area of our expenditure in the legislation is subject to a binding third-party arbitration clause.  The integrity budget is agreed with the Turf Club every year.  If there is no agreement there is a facility under the legislation - this has been the case since the previous Acts - whereby the matter can be referred to binding third-party arbitration.  I am pleased to say that clause has never been effected and we have been able to agree an integrity services budget each year.  The importance of integrity is reflected in the fact that no other element of our expenditure is subject to binding third-party arbitration.<\/p><p> Reference was made to how we are falling behind France and the United Kingdom.  We are, and the committee is aware of that, but essentially that is a decision for a different forum.  The French racing industry is between two and a half and three times the size of our industry.  The French breeding industry is smaller than ours but the French industry is funded through a tote monopoly.  Central funding there amounts to &euro;400 million per year.  We are effectively trying to compete with an industry that is slightly bigger than ours but with only 10% of the funding structure of the French industry.  Having said that, there are elements of the French funding structure that I would question.<\/p><p> Deputy Lawlor asked about savings.  The likely savings areas are all in administration and information technology.  There are two separate IT departments and two separate finance departments.  The savings are in these areas as well as human resources and payroll - in other words, back-of-house services.  The intention is to realise them through a voluntary rationalisation scheme, as we have done in recent years.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the question of a potential conflict in the allocation of grants or fixtures between courses owned by Horse Racing Ireland and independent courses.  This is not dissimilar to another situation.  I am not exactly familiar with Bord na gCon but, as I understand it, Bord na gCon controls or owns 12 of the 17 greyhound stadiums in the country.  The GAA authorities own Croke Park.  Likewise, the soccer and rugby authorities own the Aviva Stadium.  Horse Racing Ireland got into ownership of racecourses to protect them for racing.  There are two principal examples, one being Leopardstown.  Undoubtedly, were it not owned by a racing authority, it would now be a combined residential and industrial development because the land is so valuable.  This is the case for several racecourses throughout the country which sit on valuable land banks.  Sometimes the racecourses do not get sufficient credit for the value of the land they put at the disposal of the industry.<\/p><p> Some Deputies raised the issue of fixtures.  There are sufficient checks and balances in the system.  I believe that in some cases we are harder on the HRI-owned tracks when it comes to fixtures because of the need to be seen to be transparent.  There is an appeals process in respect of fixtures, if necessary.  Again, that has seldom if ever been used.<\/p><p> Deputy Lawlor asked about the subsidiaries we manage.  We manage four racecourses and a holding company for racecourses.  HRI Racecourses Limited is the holding company.  The subsidiaries include Leopardstown, Navan, Fairyhouse and Tipperary racecourses.  There is also a Leopardstown golf subsidiary, because Leopardstown develops non-racing commercial activities in golf and on the property side of the business.  Tote Ireland is a commercial subsidiary and Irish Thoroughbred Marketing is a commercial subsidiary as well.<\/p><p> I dispute Deputy Lawlor's assertion about the tote losing money.  In the past three years the tote has put a new management team in place.  This year, fingers crossed and given a good Galway race week, it is on target for a cash profit of &euro;1 million.  The tote turnover was up 5.5% last year and 11.3% in the first half of this year.  It made a profit of &euro;500,000 last year and a profit of &euro;150,000 the previous year and, as I said, it is likely to be &euro;1 million this year.  It is moving in a positive direction.<\/p><p> It is difficult to compare the horse racing tote with other tote operations in countries such as France or in Hong Kong, which have a tote monopoly.  Comparison with the greyhound tote is also difficult because the betting options on greyhound racing are limited, whereas the betting options on horse racing are plentiful.  If a person wants to have a bet on the greyhounds, he bets either with the tote at the track or with one of the small number of on-course bookmakers on the track.  Essentially, it is difficult to get a bet on a betting exchange or with an off-course bookmaker.  The tote is moving in the right direction.<\/p><p> There is another point about the tote.  Through the media rights committee we have generated extra income streams for racecourses of &euro;2 million per year from the sale of pictures of Irish racing to some of the most obscure parts of the world.  Let us consider the tote turnover after a race meeting, such as that which took place in Killarney today.  There is a significant increase on last year.  This is down to the fact that betting on the racing is taking place in the United Kingdom, Cyprus and Israel, believe it or not.  The rights have been sold to At the Races and it sells on the rights, comprised of a combined package of betting into the tote pools and the pictures of the races.  Under the split, a total of 75% of the revenue goes to the racecourses and 25% to the tote.  A figure of approximately &euro;2 million is going back to racecourses through that vehicle.  It has been a positive development through the media rights arrangement.<\/p><p> There was a question about the fees collected by the Turf Club.  The legislation intends that those fees would be returned to the Turf Club.  The Turf Club will determine what is to be charged for licences and point-to-point registrations.  HRI will transfer that money, having processed it through a single administrative structure, back to the Turf Club.  Then each year there will be an annual budget discussion about the integrity budget.  In that discussion, other income will have to be considered or taken into account.  It will not necessarily be deducted from it, but there would have to be a single debate about the budget for racing.  It would not be reasonable to have two separate budgets for racing.  As I noted earlier, there is a catch-all arbitration clause in the event that agreement cannot be reached.<\/p><p> Deputy Lawlor made a point about the customer and I agree with him.  At times the industry can be production-led as opposed to consumer-led.  Much of the time when we are around the table we are dealing with breeders, trainers, racecourse people and people who are putting the show on.  There is a significant racegoers' consultative forum which is a statutory sub-committee of Horse Racing Ireland.  The forum is made up of 12 racegoers from throughout the country who represent the views of racegoers back to the board of Horse Racing Ireland.  Indecon suggested this was a good template for the new statutory sub-committee on betting and the new statutory sub-committee for staff or persons employed in the industry.  Certainly, if properly managed and resourced, those committees, the betting sub-committee and the racegoers' forum, could represent the views of customers to the main board.  As an industry, racing can and should become more customer-focused.<\/p><p> I am sure I have missed some questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700013#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405592700,"counter":58,"content":"<p>There was a question on point-to-point racing and another on potential court case costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700015#P00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405592700,"counter":59,"content":"<p>No change is envisaged for point-to-point races and no change is envisaged in the role of the hunt clubs.  Horse Racing Ireland provides funding of approximately &euro;1.5 million per year to point-to-point races.  Approximately &euro;800,000 of this goes to the hunt clubs for prize money.  They run the point-to-point races throughout the country.  Approximately &euro;200,000 goes in grants to the hunt clubs to support their costs in running point-to-point races.  Approximately half a million euro or &euro;450,000 goes to the national hunt committee of the Turf Club to provide stewards and regulation at the point-to-point races.  Clearly, there is a spend on the part of Horse Racing Ireland in this area.<\/p> <p>Point-to-point races are a significant part of the national hunt industry and form its backbone.  Of the 17,979 runners over jumps last year in Ireland in the national hunt season, 7,419 were ex-point-to-point racers.  That means 40% of horses running over jumps in Ireland are ex-point-to-point racers so the two sectors are inextricably linked.  Horses run point-to-point races and go on to race on the track, and there are many races at the track for point-to-point racers, which are called hunter chases.  Many of the best jockeys, trainers and officials come through the point-to-point sector.  There is a duplication in the registration of point-to-point racers in that one must register if a horse is to run in point-to-point races and on the track.  That is proposed to be rationalised or streamlined in this process.  That is the only change envisaged in point-to-point races.<\/p><p> With regard to court cases or potential cases, we are involved with one currently because there is a High Court appeal against the Turf Club, which has the potential to go to the Supreme Court.  The board of Horse Racing Ireland holds the view that the Turf Club must defend its authority to enforce its rules.  We have always provided a contingency fund of &euro;250,000 per year for unforeseen legal costs such as this and I see this as the case in future.  The Bill envisages that the Turf Club will continue to have sources of income which will be collected by Horse Racing Ireland.  It envisages that the rates of that income or charges on licensees will be decided by the Turf Club and the money will be transferred back to the Turf Club.  It would be illogical for two bodies to be out of synchronisation on a policy they may have for charges on clients, with one body trying to reduce the cost to participants in the sport but the other trying to raise them.  With the legislation, the issue would become part of an annual budget discussion subject to check and balance from an arbitration system if necessary.  None of us wants to visit the High Court on a regular basis but it happens in racing and the legislation makes provision for that.  If we consider the record of Horse Racing Ireland with issues like that, it has always supported the Turf Club in carrying out its integrity role.  It is in Horse Racing Ireland's best interest to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700015#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405593300,"counter":61,"content":"<p>That might cover everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071700016#Q00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1405593300,"counter":62,"content":"<p>To clarify, when I speak about the Tote I refer to the figures published in four previously published sets of accounts.

The Tote's cost base has decreased from &euro;8 million in 2007 to &euro;4.8 million in 2012, equating to a &euro;3.2 million reduction in costs.  Regrettably, some of that comes from fewer Tote staff at race meetings because Tote is struggling in a competitive betting environment.

One of the issues we want to address over the coming years is a reduction in the cost burden on participants in the sport to make it easier for people to enter it.  Since our funding has been cut, that is what the industry has had to do to plug gaps.  In my introduction I noted the horse and greyhound racing fund is &euro;17 million down on where it was in 2008.  In response, the industry has sought to plug the gap by holding entry fees for races at a high level or introducing a plethora of charges on participants.  We are told every day that this is an active disincentive to people participating.

HRI operates a policy of only providing grants of around 50%, which is much lower than other sports capital grants and Bord na gCon grants, which can be between 80% and 100%.

RCPI is specifically concerned with protecting and improving health in Ireland, and has policy groups in three key areas relevant to today's discussion, namely, alcohol, tobacco and obesity.<\/p><p>  Every month in Ireland 88 deaths, approximately three per day, are directly attributable to alcohol.  Alcohol-related harm costs Ireland an estimated &euro;3.7 billion a year.  A recent WHO report found that Ireland is the third highest binge-drinking nation in the world, and on average we consume almost 12 litres of alcohol per year, which is well in excess of the Government's Healthy Ireland target of 9.2 litres.  A recent Health Research Board, HRB, survey found that two-thirds of males and half of females started drinking before the legal age of 18 years of age and 75% of people who consume alcohol do so in a harmful way.  Meanwhile, the death rate from liver cirrhosis has doubled in Ireland since the 1970&rsquo;s, in parallel with our increased alcohol intake.<\/p><p>  Despite good progress, the toll of tobacco-related deaths is still unacceptably high in Ireland.  One out of every two people who smoke long term will die from a smoking-related disease.  This accounts each year for at least 5,200 deaths, representing approximately 19% of deaths in Ireland.  The cost of treating an in-patient for a smoking-related disease in Ireland amounts to &euro;7,700, while Ireland spends on average &euro;500 million per year on smoking-related diseases.<\/p><p>  Obesity is now an epidemic in Ireland.  One in four Irish children and two out of three Irish adults are overweight or obese.  The estimated cost of this to the Irish State is &euro;1.13 billion per year.  If the current trends of obesity continue, it is estimated that the direct health care costs alone will reach &euro;5.4 billion by 2030.  RCPI is therefore fully supportive of the Irish Heart Foundation&rsquo;s call for a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks.<\/p><p>  These stark statistics reflect the daily alarming reality observed by physicians and other health professionals.  We are increasingly concerned at the alarming increase in human suffering, ill health and death, with dreadful consequences for patients and their families as a result of alcohol, tobacco and sugar.  With this in mind, RCPI has proposed a number of evidenced-based fiscal solutions to the Government.  We propose that Ireland turn off the tap of cheap alcohol to some of the most vulnerable individuals in Ireland.<\/p> <p>We propose the Government introduce minimum unit pricing, MUP, as proposed in the public health (alcohol) Bill, as a matter of the highest priority.  The purpose of this is to target the problems caused by cheap strong alcohol, which is largely consumed by problem drinkers and young adults and bought from the off-trade, especially supermarkets.  This initiative has little or no impact on the majority of alcoholic products sold in bars or restaurants and does not affect the price paid for alcohol by the retailer.  The effect of such price changes are immediate and substantial, and of proven benefit.  In parts of Canada where MUP has been introduced, a 10% increase in the MUP of alcohol reduced consumption by 8.4%, and led to a reduction of 32% in alcohol related deaths within one year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Frank Murray","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405588200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Murray but I am afraid I will have to cut him short.

The Irish Heart Foundation also developed a submission on tobacco with the Irish Cancer Society and fully endorses the points Ms O'Meara will make to the committee today.<br \/>Members of the committee are well aware of Ireland&rsquo;s obesity rates.  Three per cent of preschool children and 7% of children in first to fifth classes of primary school are obese.  By adulthood, almost a quarter of Irish people are obese.  The Irish Heart Foundation is proposing a package of measures to make healthy food more affordable and to stop calorific, sugary sweetened drinks, SSDs, being a normal part of many children&rsquo;s diets.  We are calling for a tax on SSDs to increase their price by 20%.  We are seeking part of the resulting revenue for a fruit and vegetable subsidy and the establishment of a children&rsquo;s future health fund.<br \/>Research for the Department of Health shows that fizzy drinks are the most consumed beverage in Ireland, at 83 litres <i>per capita<\/i>each year.  That is three times higher than consumption of bottled water, and SSD consumption is highest among young people.  Sugary drinks play a unique role in obesity.  They have no nutritional value and do not provide a feeling of fullness.  As a result, people usually consume SSDs in addition to the food they eat.<br \/>To achieve improvements in health, the level of the SSD tax must be high enough to cause people to cut down.  A health impact assessment for the Department of Health by the Institute of Public Health and Oxford University Institute of Public Health recommended the introduction of an SSD tax.<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  <\/font>They found the effect of the tax would be among the highest consumers and also among young people.  People are understandably weary of taxation in this country, yet our recent national poll showed a majority of the public are in favour of the tax.  That is a clear signal that people want stronger measures to be taken on obesity.  Almost 90% of those polled also agreed that sugary drinks contribute to obesity among children and that they are drinking too much of such drinks.<br \/>The industry claims that taxation will not work, but in 1992 the removal of a tax on soft drinks in Ireland drove consumption up, suggesting the products are price sensitive.  The industry also claims the tax would cost jobs.  However, reduced spending on sugary drinks would be redistributed in the economy to other products, and research in the Irish market has also found the employment effects of a such a tax combined with the fruit and vegetable subsidy we propose would be neutral at worst and perhaps positive, because the fruit and vegetable sector is more labour intensive.  We recognise that people find it difficult to buy healthy foods.  Our second recommendation therefore seeks a healthy food subsidy to reduce any regressive impact of a tax on sugary drinks.  Research finds that a tax and subsidy combination would be broadly neutral with respect to poverty in Ireland.  The evidence from around the world supports a multi-pronged approach for children and adolescents where we tax less healthy, energy-dense foods and subsidise healthier foods.<br \/>This is budget season and for that reason we are focusing on fiscal measures.  However, we recognise that there are many other things which must be done to reduce obesity.  That is why we are calling for the establishment of a children&rsquo;s future health fund to provide for complementary measures to the fiscal measures outlined such as improving food education, cooking and gardening skills, as well as providing healthier meals to schoolchildren.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Cliona Loughnane"},{"type":"speech","time":1405588200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Loughnane and call Ms O'Meara.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700004#C00400","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405588200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Thank you, Vice Chairman.  I am delighted to be present to make a pre-budget submission on behalf of the Irish Cancer Society, which as Ms Loughnane said, we published jointly with the Irish Heart Foundation.  Our vision and ambition is nothing less than a future without cancer.  That is why we fight tobacco with everything we have got.  Smoking is the single biggest preventable cause of cancer in Ireland.  Almost one in five of all deaths is attributable to smoking.  The Government has estimated that tobacco costs the State between &euro;1 billion and &euro;2 billion every year.  That is between 6% and 15% of the entire health budget.  In fact, another study puts the economic cost to Ireland of premature mortality caused by smoking at &euro;3.5 billion per year.<br \/>High levels of tobacco taxation in Ireland have proven to be an extremely successful health policy.  Successive taxation increases have brought smoking rates down to their lowest level, from 31% in 1998 to 21.5% in 2013, yet there is still reluctance on the part of successive Governments to raise the tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products by more than a nominal amount.  One of our proposals outlined in the pre-budget submission would increase the amount of taxation coming into the Exchequer every year by up to &euro;77 million.  Another addresses the excessive amount of profit tobacco companies make every year.  All of that is against the backdrop of the Government&rsquo;s &ndash; and therefore the Department of Finance&rsquo;s &ndash; stated aim of a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025.<br \/>We have six recommendations in the pre-budget submission but I will focus on two areas today, namely, taxation and smuggling.  The current tax structure on cigarettes is designed to benefit big tobacco manufacturers rather than the State.  It is inadvertently doing that.  That is because the current tax structure on cigarettes is made up of two categories of excise tax: one specific tax, which is levied on the volume of cigarettes sold, and an <i>ad valorem<\/i>tax, which is calculated on the price of a packet of cigarettes.  We propose an increase in the specific tax rate to the maximum allowable under EU law, which would be 76.5%.  That would have the effect of squeezing tobacco manufacturers, increasing the duty received by the Exchequer and ending the practice which has emerged in recent years where smokers can down-trade their cigarette brands rather than quit because cigarette companies are introducing lower price cigarette brands to manipulate the specific versus the <i>ad valorem<\/i>tax rate.<br \/>We also want the Government to end the practice of <i>ad hoc <\/i>hikes in tobacco tax and commit to an annual price escalator of at least 5% above inflation.  That would mean an increase of approximately 50 cent in budget 2015 and would yield &euro;77 million per annum for the Department of Finance.<br \/>I am running out of time so I wish to speak briefly on smuggling.  First, I wish to nail a myth.  The smuggling rate of tobacco in Ireland is falling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700004#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen O'Meara"},{"type":"speech","time":1405588200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I am afraid Ms O'Meara has run out of time.

Briefly, by way of background, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland is a nationwide, grassroots-led, volunteer-led organisation.  We represent the voice of the now 48,000 people living with dementia in Ireland, 63% of whom continue to live at home.  We are also the leading provider of dementia services in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The theme of our budget submission, which I hope members have had a chance to read, is supporting care in the community, in particular making living at home the first option.  Our call within the submission is a simple one: that we invest in existing Government and health policy, namely, to maintain people living at home for as long as possible.  We know at first hand that the policy is the right one for people with dementia.  It is the right policy for their families and carers and it is also economically the right policy in terms of the overall cost of care.  Equally, we know that it will not and cannot happen without supports.  People need to be supported at home and in the community.  We call, therefore, for further resources for home care, day care, respite and further support for the carers who carry the lion's share of the workload.  Equally, we call for increased resources in the community such as community nursing and primary care and important community-based services such as occupational therapy and language therapy, for example.  We know it is the right policy.  We know when we invest we can get better outcomes.  Equally, without it we also know what we get, namely, the worst possible outcome which is premature entry into expensive long-term care situations, which is wrong for, and perhaps even detrimental to, a person with dementia.  It is certainly wrong for their families and ultimately a poorer outcome economically for the State.<\/p><p>  Specifically, we call within our submission for more home-based and community-based supports.  We ask that those supports would be made available on an equal access basis, unlike the current supports which tend to be something of a geographical lottery.<\/p> <p>Supports and resources must be ring-fenced and sustainable.  I doubt there is anyone at this meeting who has not come in contact with dementia in their wider family.  Unfortunately, I can promise that in the next 20 years, not one family will not be affected by dementia.  We will not leverage the economic benefits unless we invest in a sustainable and ring-fenced way.  There is a growing awareness of dementia internationally.  Members will be aware that it was on the agenda of the recent G8 summit.  That has led for the first time to the development of a world dementia forum.  In Ireland, we are awaiting anxiously the publication of a national dementia strategy which we believe will bring about systemic change for all people living with dementia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700004#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Martin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405588800,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Mental Health Reform, the national coalition of organisations which promotes improvement to mental health services, welcomes this opportunity to speak to the finance committee about its pre-budget submission.<\/p><p>  There is a need for continued investment in the development of community-based mental health services.  There is a need for the counselling and primary care service to be invested in, so the number of peoples who can avail of counselling services through their general practitioner is increased.  There is a need that people with severe and long-term mental health difficulties can avail of a medical card.<\/p><p>  Up to the end of last year, there has been no additional funding for mental health services.  Instead, we have just had a designated amount of re-allocation of funding in mental health services to foster the development of health and social care staff.  That has been effective in bringing about the real configuration of services towards having more psychologists, occupational therapists and social workers available in community-based mental health services.  We are very far off still from the number of staff recommended in the Government&rsquo;s policy with a quarter down on levels recommended in A Vision for Change.  At the end of last year, there was less than half the staff required to provide child and adolescent mental health services.  The services, accordingly, cannot provide the holistic range of supports needed that would help people recover.  This means we have not been able to put in place the crisis intervention supports across the country that were set out in the policy.  We do not have home treatment as the norm of services, crisis houses or effective liaison between primary care and mental health services.<\/p><p>  Last year, the HSE, Health Service Executive, implemented a free counselling service of up to eight sessions for medical cardholders who were referred by their GP.  This was a progressive step that we welcomed.  We estimate, however, there are probably 690,000 people who experience anxiety and depression during the course of the year.  This is based on a comparative analysis of the UK&rsquo;s figures.  In the first six months of this year, we had 5,000 referrals.  One can see there is a significant gap between the availability of this service and the level of need.  Only 0.5% of the total mental health budget is going to counselling in primary care.  In the UK, it is 5%.<\/p><p>  There is a need to ensure that people with long-term and severe mental health difficulties have the opportunity to have a medical card.  This is a low-cost, cost-effective option and a way of providing security so people can take up work without fear of losing their mental health treatments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Shari McDaid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405588800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I express my sincere thanks to the committee for the invitation to present at this hearing on our 2015 pre-budget submission.<\/p><p>  People with acquired brain injury, which may be caused by road traffic accidents, assaults, falls, strokes, tumours can experience varying levels of disability.  Having a brain injury is life-changing and requires massive adjustments on the part of the individual and their families who have to alter their life plans to re-build and accommodate a new way of living.  For over a decade, Acquired Brain Injury Ireland, ABI, has been working to support people with acquired brain injury to be rehabilitated to reach their maximum independence and recover their potential using community-based neuro-rehabilitation services.  Our organisation grew out of a response to the complete dearth in the availability of such services.  We now operate over 100 specific services in almost every county including residential rehabilitation, home and community services, transitional living supports, step-down facilities, day-resource facilities, case management and vocational assessment.  We also provide a range of family support services and engage in advocacy work.  We enjoy a positive relationship with the HSE as our main funder.<\/p><p>  Many people with ABI, once they finish their acute phase of rehabilitation, are faced with two very stark choices.  Either they get discharged into the community with no supports or services or they continue to live in acute care wards, community hospitals and nursing homes for years.  I know of several cases, including a very recent case of a newly married professional 31 year woman with a brain tumour waiting two and half years in an acute hospital before she got access only to a 12-week specialist rehabilitation programme.  She was then offered a choice of returning to that hospital ward or a long-term hospital setting.  She now lives in that long-stay hospital setting.  She has rehabilitation potential and could be rehabilitated in her own community.  These are people who are voiceless and live on the margins of our society.<\/p><p>  We have set four key policy areas where we are seeking the Government&rsquo;s support in our 2015 pre-budget submission.  We are asking the committee to recognise people with acquired brain injury as having a set of unique and condition-specific medical and health issues by making commitment to develop a dedicated ABI programme funding for community neuro-rehabilitation in the 2015 budget.  We are seeking an annual investment of &euro;25 million.  Investing in community neuro-rehabilitation has a range of advantages at the individual, community, family and societal levels.  It is an innovative, collaborative and value for money measure which enables all the natural supports in the community to be mobilised.  I seek the committee&rsquo;s support in bringing this issue to the attention of decision-makers.  Will the committee commit to investing in community neuro-rehabilitation?  In this way, it will start the process of policy recognition for the 13,000 people a year who acquire a brain injury.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1405588800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>In fairness to the organisations, many of their submissions speak for themselves.

It was argued that there is a much broader range of issues concerning the consumption of fat, salt and processed foods to be addressed.  Is there international evidence to suggest sugar is the issue?

A normal bottle of cola contains 12.5 teaspoons of sugar.  We are accustomed to seeing people drinking bottles of cola but if we were to see the liquid part removed and somebody ingesting 12.5 teaspoons of sugar in one go, we would be quite disturbed.  There is much scientific evidence on this.<\/p><p>  There are also issues with products containing fat but randomised controlled trials from countries across the world show that an increase in the consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks leads to an increase in calorie consumption and weight and, therefore, may be responsible for an increase in obesity.  There is also a dose&ndash;response relationship such that the more sugar-sweetened drinks one consumes, the more weight one puts on.  The evidence is incontrovertible that this is a very particular product with a real part in the obesity epidemic.  As I stated in my opening statement, one reason for this is that drinks do not seem to satiate as much as other products.  When one drinks 12.5 teaspoons of sugar, one does not feel as full as when one eats a product with that quantity of sugar in it.

It is not a sugar tax, <i>per se<\/i>.  The Nevin Economic Research Institute examined the household budget survey in order to discover how much people spend - approximately &euro;3 to &euro;4 - each week on these products.  Introducing a tax that would increase the price by 20% - this is what we are seeking because we believe it to be necessary to encourage people to reduce their levels of consumption - would lead to an increase of 67 cent to 83 cent in the amount households spend on these products each week.  It would, therefore, still be a small amount in the context of a household budget.  We are, however, conscious that 10% of the population is living in food poverty at present.  We do not believe it is acceptable to raise prices on unhealthy products without helping people to access healthier products.  In that context, a fruit and vegetable subsidy seems like a very good idea to us.  One of the reasons for that is that there are schemes already in place which could be bolstered by funding which would come from this tax revenue.  We have in mind schemes such as the school fruit scheme, which is offered through the CAP, in this regard.  This scheme is not fully funded to schools and it is only available for a very short period.  What we are talking about is allowing schools to have access to free fruit during the entire academic year.<br \/>Trying to build on structures that are already in place is the easiest way to develop models.  In that context, the Department of Social Protection is already providing a school meal programme.  However, many DEIS schools are finding it difficult to access the programme because it does not meet any capital or staffing costs.  In light of the reduction in the number of people on community employment schemes who might have worked in this area previously, it is very difficult for schools to get involved.

Such funding is badly needed because services are patchy, irregular and failing to reach the communities and people who really need them, namely, heavily addicted smokers.  Smoking is a major health inequality issue and I concur with Professor Murray on the social justice issues.  The burden of illness caused by smoking is carried disproportionately by disadvantaged communities and poor people.  Women are dying younger because there is a higher death rate among women from lung cancer than from breast cancer.  Unfortunately, most of these deaths are of women who had smoked since they were teenagers and who came from poor and, often, single parent communities.  This is an issue of social justice.

One goes to purchase groceries and leaves with a potentially harmful product.  It has become part of the weekly shop for many.  As Senator Thomas Byrne noted, alcohol is a loss leader in some cases, with implications for VAT returns.

The tourism industry is being damaged by drunkenness and drink related behaviour on the streets and in town centres.<\/p> <p>I argue there is a huge economic benefit in restricting the number of outlets and monitoring the way they sell alcohol to ensure there is less under age drinking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700009#H00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Frank Murray","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405591800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I am quite in favour of the pub industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700010#J00200","speaker":"1048"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405591800,"counter":190,"content":"<p>To me, the big problem is the supermarkets, the convenience stores and the petrol stations where it is hard to see the same levels of enforcement with regard to selling to people who are under age or selling vast quantities.<\/p><p>  The point the Deputy made about size is interesting.  There is no such thing as a six pack any more; it is now a slab and that has come about through clever marketing by the alcohol industry.  Outlets are now selling much bigger quantities.  According to Alcohol Action Ireland, there has been a 500% increase in the number of off licences in the past 20 years.  I do not see the social benefit of that, and what the Deputy said in that respect is right.  In addition to the fiscal measures being suggested here, I encourage members to take back to their parties and to the Houses of the Oireachtas the message that there is a need to take other steps beside price measures.  Deputy Spring was correct when he said that the availability of alcohol is an issue and he is right on the money when he said that there is a need to restrict the sale of high potency alcohol.  I would support that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Frank Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1405591800,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700010#J00400","speaker":"1048"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405591800,"counter":192,"content":"<p>In terms of the size of the sugar sweetened drinks, the Deputy is right.  What we think of as small now would not be what my grandfather would have thought of as small in the past.  In New York there is what is called \"the big gulp\"; we do not have that here yet.  These are 32 oz drinks.  There has been a big push there to change the size of those.  The industry has completely opposed it and it has now gone to the courts, and I am not sure what will happen there.  We would like the tax to be introduced to directly address this in terms of the volume sold.  We would like the tax to be on volume metric basis, which would be on the volume of the product.  In that way the tax would increase if one were to buy a 1 litre drink or a multi-pack of drinks.  The best way to introduce the tax would be on a per volume basis.  That is the way it has been done in France.  It has put a 7 cent tax on a litre drink.  We do not believe that amount would increase the price enough but it is a move in the right direction.<\/p><p>  On the diet drinks, we would like the sugar sweetened drinks tax to be on the added sugars, that is, the full fat or the full sugar drinks.

Agriculture is Ireland's largest indigenous industry, with an estimated 300,000 people relying directly or indirectly on the industry for jobs.  It supports economic activity throughout rural Ireland.  When we look ahead at this year's budget the core objective of the Government must be to focus on supporting sectors delivering jobs and export growth.<\/p><p>  As committee members are aware, 2013 was a very difficult year for many farmers.  The already low income cattle and sheep sectors were particularly badly hit, with incomes falling to between &euro;10,000 and &euro;16,000.  Despite these difficulties farming continues to contribute to the economic recovery which is now clearly evident through continued growth in agrifood exports and employment.  Agrifood exports reached a record high of almost &euro;10 billion in 2013 and the value of exports has increased by a further 11% in the first four months of the year.<\/p><p>  Funding for farm schemes underpins farm income and output.  Under the new rural development programme there is an overall allocation of &euro;2.1 billion of EU funding and &euro;1.9 billion of national funding for the period from 2014 to 2020.  I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the funding commitment made earlier this year by the Government to the rural development programme for the next six years.  More than &euro;500 million funding for rural development schemes must be provided in the October budget.  This funding will deliver programmes of support for low-income farmers, provide environmental services, encourage young farmers, promote on-farm investment and support farming in marginal areas.  With the significant increase in EU funding available in 2015 the level of funding for rural development programme farm schemes can be provided without an increase in Exchequer funding in the agriculture budget for 2015.<\/p><p>  Priorities for farming in the budget for 2015 are the commencement of contracts for the new green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, in early 2015, with places for 30,000 farmers in the scheme in its first year and payments being disbursed in 2015; the allocation of &euro;30 million for the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, in 2015 to fund on-farm investment programmes in all sectors; funding of &euro;52 million for the beef data genomic scheme in support of the vulnerable suckler herd; and increased capital funding allocations for horticulture, forestry and agriculture to achieve output targets and employment growth.<\/p><p>  On the taxation side, the IFA believes the agri-taxation review provides an opportunity to identify the key challenges faced by agriculture, the potential for growth and development of the sector and the taxation measures which can most appropriately address the challenges and realise this potential.  These taxation measures must encourage on-farm investment, assist farmers in managing volatility, encourage new entrants into farming and increase land mobility.  The priorities are the introduction of a tax deposit scheme to managing income volatility, the retention of 90% agricultural relief to support the transfer of viable family farms, the introduction of a phased transfer-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700012#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Downey"},{"type":"speech","time":1405592700,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I must ask Mr. Downey to conclude soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700012#Q00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405592700,"counter":231,"content":"<p>-----partnership model for transfer from one generation to the next, and extension of the land leasing scheme.

The pre-budget submission addresses a number of issues, but for the purposes of the presentation I will focus on those of particular importance to Irish farmers with regard to growing and developing their farm enterprise in a sector which is of crucial economic importance to the Irish economy which, as has already been stated, has grown to the tune of &euro;10 billion.<\/p><p>  Farm income volatility and cash flow can be a serious impediment to Irish farmers, and we aspire to create an environment which would smooth out some of this volatility, particularly in the context of expansion.  The ICMSA proposals a farm management deposit scheme, the details of which have been circulated and are available.  I am happy to answer questions on it.  As my time is limited I cannot go into it in detail.<\/p><p>  Flexibility in the write-off of capital expenditure is important and should be between three and eight years, with the potential to use up to 50% in any particular year.  Incomes fluctuate depending on markets and tools must be available to the farmers to make it more fit for purpose.<\/p><p>  It is vital that GLAS, TAMS and the areas of natural constraint are adequately funded by the Department of Finance.  As previously stated, all of this funding comes back to the local economy and none of it goes into offshore accounts, unlike large corporations.  With up to 300,000 jobs supported it is value for money.  We advocate frontloading these schemes and having them in place and ready for use as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  Other areas of concern to us are the retention of stock relief, being able to transfer a family farm from one generation to the next without tax liability and the reintroduction of indexation with regard to capital gains tax.  When capital gains tax was reduced from 40% to 20% indexation was not as important, but the rate has increased to 33% and a fresh look at indexation needs to be taken to make the system equitable.<\/p><p>  With regard to capital acquisitions, it is vital the 90% rate is retained for farmers.  The early retirement scheme is gone.  Income tax relief on land leasing should be extended to family members and we would restrict this tax relief to those aged between 55 and 65 so it would not be counter-productive.<\/p> <p>In Irish society today it is very difficult for a father or mother to hand over a farm to a son or daughter with all the potential variables that exist.  They just do not know in terms of status of marriage and they have to have their own income for another few years.  We would like that extended to family members.  I think we could come up with a mechanism to avoid it being open to the potential abuse that is suggested if it was introduced.  Obviously there is the extension of the 1% stamp duty for untrained farmers and a plethora of other items I could discuss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700012#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Comer","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405593300,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I appreciate the opportunity to present my submission to the committee.  Committee members should not believe the current car registration statistics because they are being manipulated by manufacturers.  The basis of my proposition is to increase Exchequer revenue through efficient taxation.  We are not looking for a handout or a tax break.  If we reduce vehicle registration tax significantly or abolish VRT over a period of years, the resultant increase in sales and employment would more than compensate for the loss of tax revenue from the reduction or abolition.  One estimate puts the benefit at ten times the amount of the reduction.<\/p><p>  There are many estimates as to how the market would react to a reduction in or the abolition of VRT and many anti-reform activists will always cast doubt as to the potential size of the market and claim we cannot afford a reduction.  My analysis proves the opposite and concludes we really cannot afford not to reform VTR.<\/p><p>  I will give three recent concrete proven examples of the potential size of the market.  In 2013 some 52,000 cars were registered in Northern Ireland while 74,000 cars were registered in the South.  We have 2.5 times Northern Ireland's population and its property crash and banking crisis is as significant as ours.  If we extrapolate the Northern Ireland number, we should still be selling 130,000 new cars per annum, even in the depths of this recession.<\/p><p>  In 2013, some 50,000 used cars were imported from the UK where VAT is paid to the UK Exchequer and there is little or no consumer protection, a very significant problem that gets little or no publicity.  So many cars are imported because of the lack of new car sales which produce used cars for the used car market in Ireland.  Irish car retailers cannot meet the demand for used cars owing to the lack of new car sales.  Every time we import a used car we export jobs and pay VAT to the UK Exchequer.  We believe these imports constitute a substitution purchase for a new car and if prices were reduced, buyers would purchase a new car rather than importing a used car.  This has been proven economically.<\/p><p>  In 2009 the new car market fell to 50,000 units.  In 2010 and 2011 the market increased to 90,000 units after the introduction of a scrappage scheme where a VTR subsidy of &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,250 was given by the Exchequer.  In 2013 the market fell back to 74,000 units following a 2% VAT increase and a 3% VTR increase.<\/p><p>  These three recent and unquestionable figures give a very good idea of the size of the new car market and its potential size in the future.  They also prove the price sensitivity of the market.  The economist, Mr. Peter Bacon, in a report on VRT and other issues in 2009, estimated that the abolition of VRT would leverage the economy ten times.  This means that for every &euro;1 lost on VRT, the economy would gain &euro;10.<\/p><p>  The average family car in Ireland is taxed by almost &euro;8,000 - one of the highest taxes on cars in the European Union.  This is an indiscriminate, inefficient and socially regressive method of taxation.  The European Commission, the Commission on Taxation, consumer groups and representatives of the motor industry have called for its reform or abolition.  I hope the committee members will support the call for major reform of VRT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700013#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405593300,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and committee members for inviting the Irish Road Haulage Association to outline our pre-budget submission regarding heavy goods vehicle road tax.  Road haulage is a key industry in Ireland as it has facilitated our export-led recovery.  However, the costs of operating a truck in the Republic of Ireland are now greatly out of line with Britain, Northern Ireland and numerous other EU member states.<\/p><p>  As a result of the ever-increasing costs, Irish international haulage operators are registering or reflagging their commercial fleet in other European countries where operating costs are far more favourable and, consequently, Irish national hauliers are unable to compete with their Northern Ireland counterparts.  Up to 2,000 trucks have already left the Irish system with many more considering a similar effort in the new year.<\/p><p>  An international truck transporting into Europe will turn over an average of &euro;5,000 per week with 90% of that turnover injected back into the local Irish economy.  Some 20% of that turnover is direct taxation, through VAT, PRSI, road tax, insurance levies and vehicle testing and enforcement.  However, one primary issue at the heart of all this is the cost of taxing a heavy goods vehicle.  A 44-tonne articulated truck costs &euro;4,000 to tax in the Republic of Ireland versus &pound;650 to tax north of the Border in Newry.  It is unsustainable for any Irish haulage business to compete with those levels of road taxation.<\/p><p>  In light of this scenario, the Irish Road Haulage Association has made a proposal to the Government for this year's budget.  The proposal would bring a simple situation for taxing vehicles as applies in other European countries including the UK.  Taxing a HGV should cost &euro;750 for vehicles up 18 tonnes, &euro;1,000 for vehicles up to 38 tonnes, and &euro;1,250 for the larger HGV of 44 tonnes or 46 tonnes.  This would bring our commercial vehicle road tax in line with our European counterparts and as a result greatly facilitate a competitive platform for our national fleet.<\/p><p>  We are not naive about our proposal.  It would cost the Exchequer &euro;20 million initially.  However, if 400 trucks reregister in Ireland, which had previously reregistered outside the state, the cost of &euro;20 million would be covered by the taxes the repatriated vehicles would contribute to the Irish Exchequer.  In addition, we propose the implementation of a pay-as-you-go road charging mechanism.  Last year the Irish Road Haulage Association did a survey at our borders and ports of foreign vehicles entering our roads every day.  A charge of &euro;10 per day would net the Irish economy &euro;23 million.  In order to implement such a pay-as-you-go system, the current road tax structure needs to change to the three categories I previously outlined.<\/p><p>  We also seek the realignment of the road tax across all commercial vehicles.  At the moment 300,000 vehicles pay an average of &euro;330 to &euro;450, many of them vans, some commercial and some non-commercial.  With a realignment of all commercial vehicles, bringing the &euro;330 to an average of &euro;400 along with the &euro;750, &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,250 I mentioned earlier, the &euro;20 million would be recouped immediately.<\/p><p>  Finally, by way of example of haulage operators moving out of the Republic of Ireland to other jurisdictions, an Irish Road Haulage Association member in Dundalk moved 58 trucks to Liverpool, bringing about a loss of &euro;230,000 to Louth County Council in road tax alone.  Another haulier in Limerick recently moved 29 trucks to Holland.  We have lost 2,000 vehicles in the national fleet in the past 18 months.<\/p><p>  The IRHA projects that up to 5,000 trucks will move out of the Republic of Ireland within the next 12 months if road tax is not brought into line with the rest of Europe, including the UK, leaving the Irish economy completely reliant on foreign vehicles for their transport requirements from this island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700013#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Gavin"},{"type":"speech","time":1405593300,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I need to suspend the meeting temporarily, as there is a vote on the Order of Business in the Chamber.

I know that the representatives of the farming organisations will also appear before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine where the specifics will be taken up.  The taxation issues they raised are often raised regarding the spending matters, various schemes and the rural development programme.  They would be issues for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine through the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine.

I opposed the scrappage scheme because I thought the industry should be doing it.  When the scrappage scheme ended, we saw some brands in the industry bringing in their own scrappage schemes, which is what they were called in their advertisements.  I thought that one of the biggest problems over the past few years was the lack of finance.  What should have happened is that these manufacturers should have come in with their own finance schemes to stimulate the market, which they have now done.  They are very large corporations.  I am not saying this to disagree with Mr. Murphy but to challenge the industry.  There is constant lobbying of Government to change tax, etc.<\/p><p> I agree with many of the points made and see the sense in what Mr. Murphy said but, first of all, the industry should reduce prices or look to cut costs and then maybe the Government should do something rather than the other way around.  I appreciate what Mr. Murphy said about registration figures, as I have read up on this, but the people talking about all the new car registrations are those in the Society of the Irish Motor Industry.<\/p><p> There is a huge range of finance products available now in the motor industry.  Would that not lead to an increase in sales?  They have, by and large, been provided by the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700013#R00600","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405593900,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I would just like to make it clear that we are not members of the SIMI for the exact reasons the Senator pointed out.  The manufacturers' finance offers have been in the market since 2009.  The offers have been available throughout this recession and we would not have survived without the manufacturers' finance offers.  However, the others have come through as well.  Every single manufacturer has its own finance offer.  One is getting everything from 0% to 1.4% to 3% to 5%.  One would hardly ever get a rate above 5% whereas if one went to a bank to get a car loan, it would charge between 9.5% and 10%.  These finance offers have been there throughout this recession but they still have not stimulated the demand to the level we would expect.<\/p><p>  The problem is that disposable incomes have fallen significantly since the onset of this recession and people cannot afford the cars.  I am talking about new and used cars.  In the UK, the average price of a used car is &pound;6,000 sterling while the average price of a used car in Ireland is approximately &euro;15,000.  It is a huge difference.  Built into the price of a used car is residual VRT.  VRT is supposed to be paid on registration of the car but it exists in the value of the car all the way through to the very end.  It is a pricing issue.  A tax of 43% on any product must be considered excessive, especially given the fall in disposable incomes in this country over the past number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700014#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1405593900,"counter":241,"content":"<p>It is an issue in which I am very interested and I would be happy to communicate with Mr. Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700014#S00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405593900,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I am very interested in it.

The number of cattle has eased; therefore, we hope prices will steady and start to rise again.  A beef forum has been pulled together.  All parties in the beef industry are sitting around the table.  It is an opportunity to put this on a firm footing.  It has never been done before.  We have never had a properly structured beef industry and we see it as being particularly important that the forum is promoted.  The Minister must drive it and ensure we have a functioning beef industry going forward in order that farmers can have confidence in it.  Processors themselves can see that by working together we will have a future in the industry, but not with the current system, which is purely adversarial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700014#S02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Downey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405594500,"counter":260,"content":"<p>As a consumer I like what Mr. Murphy is proposing, but I have concerns about it as a legislator.

We hear all the time about how the Department of Finance and the Exchequer are afraid to risk a reduction.  The scrappage scheme proved that taking a risk paid off.  Sales increased from 50,000 units to 90,000 units in one year.  When we introduced a 2% VAT increase and a 3% VRT increase, the opposite happened; there was a drop to 74,000 units &ndash; in effect, a loss of 26,000 units over two years.  We do not have a problem taking a risk in one direction in terms of increasing taxes.  We seem to think we can increase taxation and the number of units sold will stay the same, but the market is so price-sensitive that if one increases the price, one will sell fewer cars.  That has been proven.  If one reduces the price, one will sell more cars.<\/p><p>  The Department of Finance has a large staff.  Surely someone can carry out a proper analysis rather than taking a schoolboy approach to increasing tax and multiplying it by the number of units that are sold and saying that an extra &euro;50 million will be generated.  Following the previous increase in 2012, the objective was to raise an extra &euro;50 million but the Exchequer lost &euro;116 million.  That is an error of &euro;166 million.  In spite of the current state of the country, nobody batted an eyelid.  When I recommend the exact opposite of this, which is less risky, the argument I hear is that the Government cannot afford to lose the money, yet nobody is accountable when the decision is taken to increase the tax and &euro;166 million is lost.

I have spoken to companies such as Topaz and Tedcastles and they indicate that diesel sales in commercial fleets are up.  There is a big swing back to purchasing fuel in this country.  There has been a big swing also away from trucks that were operating in the black market using laundered fuel because if one purchases fuel with proper invoices there is a rebate available for tax-compliant hauliers.  The scheme is very successful.<\/p><p>  At the time of the discussions on the fuel rebate we put forward proposals that were tax-neutral.  We are not looking for handouts.  Other industries can put their hands up and get millions of euro, but we are very small, fragmented family businesses that do not have much clout.  We try to be tax-neutral in our proposals.  Road tax is a serious issue.  It costs &euro;4,000 to tax one truck in Dublin while it costs &pound;650 to tax a truck in Newry.  If one goes to Newry every day one has to pay &pound;10 sterling on top of that.  Our economists tell us on a business basis that we should move our fleet out of the country.  If that were to happen, Irish exports would be in big trouble.

The average fleet size is four to five trucks.  What our members are considering is four or five hauliers getting together and setting up offices in Liverpool, Belgium, France and Bulgaria.  Nobody wants to reflag or to have a Bulgarian registration on their truck hauling Irish beef out of a factory in Carlow.  That does not look good for our image or our export product.  However, there is a solution - namely, to bring our road tax in line with the rest of Europe and the UK.  There should be three categories: &euro;750 for a small truck, &euro;1,000 for a medium-sized truck and &euro;1,250 for a large one.  There could be three options to pay for it.  The first would be to stem the flow of vehicles out of the country.  Of the 2,000 trucks that are already gone, if we got even 400 of them back the direct taxation on them alone would bring in &euro;20 million.<\/p> <p>If a further 5,000 trucks go, they will either go out of business or leave the jurisdiction.  If we are to stay in the haulage business, the options are to register outside the country or else go out of business.  We cannot compete with a person in the haulage business in Newry.  <\/p><p> The second option is to put a proper tax structure in place.  If we have a proper tax structure, the Government can set about putting a pay-as-you-go system in place.  The Government can implement it at the ports or at the Border crossings.  A charge of &euro;10 a day will yield &euro;23 million.  We counted the vehicles with out-of-state registration numbers coming off the ferries as well as the trucks coming from the eight main Border crossings last summer and arrived at that figure..<\/p><p> The third option is to charge the vehicles coming in, pay as you go, pay a levy at the port, similar to the levy we pay in the United Kingdom.  When we go to the United Kingdom, we must go online and pay &pound;10 every morning for each truck going into the North.  Why not implement the same here?  This system cannot be implemented here without changing our current tax structure, which must happen in this year's budget.  <\/p><p> If it does not happen in this year's budget, the Irish Road Haulage Association will not be before this committee again.  The situation is critical.  At present 2,000 hauliers are making plans to leave the country.  Many believe that spending time before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform may be a waste of my time.  The cost of fuel was about staying in business, but the road tax issue is about of moving the business out of Ireland and that is a major decision for any company.<\/p><p> The third option relates to commercial vehicles.  At present there are 322,000 commercial vehicles, some 300,000 of which are small vans.  Some of these small vans are operated by commercial business haulage companies, some are operated by people who should not be operating them as commercial vans.  The motor tax on small vans is &euro;330 compared to &euro;4,000 for a truck.  That is not very fair.  The motor tax on trucks has been increased by a percentage in each budget.  We are a small community of the total fleet, some 22,000 vehicles between haulage companies and people who own their own trucks, be they farmers or factories.  The remaining 300,000 vans are paying very little.  It is a political decision to increase the motor tax on vans by &euro;20 or &euro;30, in order to balance out the significant difference in the tax on trucks and make it cost neutral.  I will also give two other options to make this cost neutral.  <\/p><p> If we need an export-led economy, is &euro;20 million a great deal of money to spend on the haulage sector?  We proved the argument that the fuel rebate was tax neutral.  We can prove that our proposals are tax neutral.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700015#T01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Gavin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405595100,"counter":275,"content":"<p>May I add to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700016#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1405595100,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071700016#U00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405595100,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Mr. Gavin spoke about those in the haulage business leaving the country.

I know the Chairman might have a difficult job keeping the unruly visitors in the Visitors Gallery quiet, all one of them.<\/p> <p>On a serious note, I am very pleased to update the Joint Committee on Health and Children in support of its quarterly review of my Department's work.  Today's meeting provides me with my first opportunity to meet with the committee in my new capacity as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and I look forward to continued engagement with the committee on the wide range of issues under my Department's remit.<br \/>As members know, the former Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, the first Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, fully embraced the role of Minister, setting out her clear intention to implement the commitments in our programme for Government and forging ahead with an important and ambitious agenda.  My colleague, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, during his short time in the Department, advanced a number of matters and took a strong leading role in progressing towards a Commission of Inquiry into Mother and Baby Homes.  I am determined to continue the momentum that has been created and to press ahead on a range of fronts.<br \/>I want to bring the committee up-to-date on the full range of developments in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs over the last quarter.  It is now more than six months since the establishment of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  The establishment of Tusla was notable in many respects, namely, in achieving a significant programme for Government commitment relating to children, in bringing together a range of child and family services into a more cohesive and co-ordinated structure; in ring-fencing funding of &euro;609 million for services for children and families and, crucially, in improving accountability to the Government and the taxpayer, for such services and funding. <br \/>In recent weeks my predecessor, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, issued the first performance framework for the consideration of Tusla.  The performance framework provides policy guidance, direction and prioritisation parameters for the preparation by its board of the Tusla corporate plan.  I expect the outcome of this engagement to be an agreed three-year corporate plan which is both ambitious and achievable.  I accept that challenges lie ahead for the agency, which is continuing to progress a range of important service reforms under a comprehensive change agenda. <br \/><b><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> <\/font><\/b>In regard to the national children detention facilities project, work is continuing on the construction of new facilities at Oberstown in County Dublin.  The first three residential units, intended to provide for the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from the adult prison system to Oberstown, will be completed this year.  I recently visited the site with my predecessor and we were both very impressed with progress and with the scale and complexity of what is involved.  Completion of this project will meet the programme for Government commitment to end the detention of children in prisons, something about which this committee is very concerned.  My officials are working with the Public Appointments Service on the associated care staff recruitment programme, with the intention that new staff will be deployed for orientation and training on a staged basis during 2014.<br \/>Later in the year, I intend to present a Bill to the Oireachtas to amend certain provisions of the Children Act 2001.  This will provide for the merging of the three existing children detention schools into a single legal entity and will also address a number of legal and policy issues associated with managing all children under the age of 18 on that site. <br \/>In advance of the appearance of the former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, before the committee in April, she published the Children First Bill 2014 and subsequently introduced the Bill on Second Stage to the D&aacute;il on 30 April 2014.  The Bill will place elements of the Children First National Guidance on a statutory basis and impose a duty on certain specific individuals to report child protection concerns to Tusla.  It will also improve child protection arrangements in organisations providing services to children, requiring each to produce an organisation-specific child safeguarding statement. <br \/>Child protection must be high on the agenda in all sectors of society and must be in our minds in all our dealings with children.  There is no greater testament to this and justification for such an approach than the litany of harrowing reports on child protection that have been published over the past number of years.  The children first legislation is designed to complement and enhance a range of established and more recent enactments in the complex arena of child protection.  I look forward to engaging with Members of both Houses during the parliamentary process to enact this important piece of legislation.<br \/>In April of this year the new National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020, entitled Better Outcomes: Brighter Futures, was launched.  This is the first overarching national policy framework spanning children and young people from birth to age 24 years.  It sets out the Government&rsquo;s objectives for improving children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s lives over the period 2014 to 2020 and how we intend to achieve these objectives.  We have worked to establish a shared set of outcomes for children and young people and identify a range of commitments in place across Government and progress these based on a structured, systematic and outcomes-focused approach.  There is no doubt that enhancing children's and young people's lives will have long-term positive impacts for the individuals themselves and society in general. <br \/>A structure has been established to guide and support the delivery of the framework in the form of a consortium of high level officials from across Departments and agencies, together with key representatives from the soon to be established advisory council, which comprises NGO stakeholders.  The consortium, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, has met on two occasions, most recently last Friday, 11 July.  The consortium will report to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy on this whole of Government approach.<br \/>Following completion of Better Outcomes: Brighter Futures, work is continuing on the development of Ireland's first ever early years strategy, which I intend to launch later this year.  A total of &euro;3 million in capital funding was set aside in 2014 for community not-for-profit child care services, parent and toddler groups and childminders.  On Tuesday of this week, I announced the allocation of &euro;2.5 million to 163 grantees in the community not-for-profit child care sector.  This represents funding for essential repairs, maintenance or refurbishment works and also for works to improve energy ratings within facilities.<br \/>New national quality standards for early years services will form part of the new regulatory environment and will provide the basis against which services will be inspected and reported on.  New training and mentoring supports for services are also being put in place as part of the quality agenda.  In March of this year, the former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, launched a learner fund, totalling &euro;3 million over two years, to support staff in early years services who need to up-skill to meet new qualification requirements.<br \/>A national strategy on children and young people's participation in decision-making is being developed under the national policy framework for children and young people and will be published in 2014.  Considerable progress has been made in the development of this strategy, including bilateral meetings with key Departments and agencies.  Consultation with the non-Government sector is also planned in the coming weeks.  I want to welcome the very constructive role played by the Oireachtas and, in particular, by a number of Deputies and Senators on this committee, in engaging with young people through the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g representative structures.<br \/>One of the national outcomes in Better Outcomes: Brighter Futures is the active and healthy physical and mental well-being of all children.  One of the specific aims of realising this outcome is that all children will enjoy play, recreation, sport, arts culture and nature.  In this context, national recreation week ran from Monday, 2 June to Sunday, 8 June.  The focus for this year's events was on giving young people an opportunity to participate in recreation activities they have never before tried.  My Department funded a number of events, which were supported by a network of local authority managers and staff responsible for the local delivery of play and recreation services in communities across the country.<br \/>National play day took place on Sunday, 6 July.  The aim of national play day is to help increase public awareness of the importance of play in supporting children's physical and social development.  The focus for national play day in 2014 was on going out to play and a variety of projects were funded that created opportunities for outdoor play at street, neighbourhood and community level.  I want to commend local authority managers and staff for their participation in the various events and the encouragement they offer to children and their families to experience play in their own locality. <br \/>In May, the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, launched Erasmus+ 2014-2020, the EU's support programme for life-long learning, training and sport.  My predecessor welcomed this extensive and valuable new Erasmus+ programme, 10% of which is ring-fenced for activity in the youth field.  The youth programme will provide more than &euro;16 million to Ireland over the next seven years and this year alone Ireland will benefit from &euro;2.89 million.  Its youth priorities include the promotion of young people's social inclusion and well-being, notably through projects tackling youth unemployment, and the promotion of healthy behaviours, in particular through outdoor activities and grassroots sport.  The programme also aims to raise awareness about EU citizenship, rights, active participation of young people and to develop basic and transversal skills - for example, entrepreneurship, digital skills and multilingualism.<\/p> <p>It is important that youth organisations nationwide bring forward proposals under the programme in order that as many young people as possible can avail of transnational exchanges and opportunities to enhance their skills, competencies and employability.<\/p><p> The most pressing issue that has arisen since the most recent quarterly meeting with the joint committee is that of mother and baby homes and related matters.  This has developed into an issue of national concern and international interest.  There is no denying that what we have learned about the deaths of particularly vulnerable young children in such institutions has been very distressing, in particular, the scale of the number of deaths of infants and young children over several decades in the past. <\/p><p> This issue relates to the responsibilities of a range of Departments.  Work has been progressing, under the auspices of an interdepartmental group chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, to examine the full scope of the inquiry that will take place into such matters.  It is our intention that the inquiry will be established under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 and will have all the necessary powers that it requires to ensure full co-operation and the submission of a comprehensive report to Government.  The commission of investigation's formal establishment will require a resolution of both Houses.  Calls have been made to have many elements considered by the commission and we must agree on appropriate and realistic terms of reference to bring the inquiry to as satisfactory a conclusion as possible.<\/p><p> The Cabinet was updated on Tuesday evening in regard to the work of the interdepartmental group.  The Government agreed to the publication of the group's report, which was laid before the Oireachtas yesterday, and also agreed that Judge Yvonne Murphy will chair the commission of inquiry.  I am grateful to Judge Murphy for accepting this challenging and important task.  I expect it will be the autumn before the terms of reference for the inquiry are agreed and published.  I am committed to continuing to engage with Opposition spokespersons in this work and grateful to spokespersons for taking time to discuss this matter with me in recent days.  I will report to the D&aacute;il this afternoon on these matters and look forward to statements from Deputies on the subject.<\/p><p> The Government is also committed to improving arrangements for adoption information and tracing.  I intend to finalise legislative proposals and refer the general scheme and heads of the adoption (information and tracing) Bill to the committee as soon as possible.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for providing me with an opportunity to update the joint committee.  A challenging few months lie ahead and I look forward to updating members again in the autumn.  Members will appreciate that, as the new Minister, I have had a limited opportunity to read in depth into my brief, notwithstanding my interest in many aspects of the Department's responsibilities over the years.  I will endeavour to address members' questions in full and, where an immediate response is not possible, to revert with responses as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014071700003#B00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405586700,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, to his first committee meeting in his current role.  I mean no disrespect in expressing disappointment that a new Minister has been appointed to this portfolio only two short months after the appointment of the previous Minister.  Given that this is the Minister's first meeting with the joint committee, I had expected him to outline his priorities for the Department for the remainder of the Government's term.  I ask him to outline his priorities and brief members on rumours that responsibility for various public health issues will transfer from the Department of Health to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  If these rumours are true, will the Minister specify the issues for which responsibility will transfer to his Department?<br \/>Two weeks ago, a reputable newspaper reported that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, will not be able to meet its budgetary target this year.  What deficit did the agency carry over from the Health Service Executive?  If it is unable to meet its budgetary target, what actions will the Minister take to ensure front-line services are not affected by the budget overrun?<br \/>I expected the Minister to provide an update on the eight-point plan for early years education.  The former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, initiated the eight-point plan in direct response to a &quot;Prime Time&quot; expos&eacute; on child care facilities entitled, &quot;A Breach of Trust&quot;.  It is disappointing that the Minister did not provide an update on this extremely important issue.  What is the position regarding the new regulations?  Despite the Oireachtas passing the relevant legislation before Christmas 2013, the regulations are still not in operation.  Some areas do not have an inspector and the early years strategy has not been published.  This is a fundamentally important document which will set out a road map for the progress of the child care sector in the years ahead.  I ask the Minister to update the joint committee on these matters. <br \/>I welcome the announcement of funding for 163 not-for-profit services.  I understand there are 4,300 child care services in operation.  Will the Minister confirm that approximately 30% of these are in the not-for-profit sector?<br \/>I welcome the cross-party approach taken by the Minister's predecessor on the issue of mother and baby homes and yesterday's meeting between Opposition spokespersons and the Minister to discuss the issue.  If the commission of inquiry is to be successful, it is imperative that it progresses in a non-partisan manner in consultation with the various advocacy groups.  We will have an opportunity to discuss this issue further later today.  <br \/>The Minister's statement did not refer to a number of reports that were published this week.  The national review panel on children who died in State care published a series of reports this week.  The reports draw the worrying conclusion that a number of problems from the past have not been addressed.  I refer specifically to poor inter-agency co-operation, shortcomings in child and adolescent mental health after-care services and the insufficient number of social workers.  Given the importance of the review panel's reports, I had expected the Minister to refer to them.<br \/>It was intended that the Children First Bill would implement measures to address poor inter-agency co-operation.  This legislation was promised as a priority when the Government assumed office three years ago.  While Second Stage has been completed, we continue to wait for the Committee Stage to commence.  Will the Minister give a commitment to enact this Bill without delay in the new D&aacute;il term?  Legislation on after care, on which the joint committee will launch a report later today, is also important and must receive priority in the Department.<br \/>This week, details of an audit of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme emerged as a result of a freedom of information request.  The audit raises a number of areas of significant concern <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>Pobal's dual role as a mentor and guardian of the ECCE scheme.  It refers to a conflict of interest and asks whether it was appropriate to have Pobal administer the scheme without placing the contract out to tender.  It also raised the issue of value for money in the scheme.  I ask the Minister to respond to some of the concerns raised in the audit.  <br \/>When the House returns from the summer recess in September it will have been almost two years since citizens voted on the referendum on children's rights, which was supported by all political parties.<\/p> <p>Due to a political judgment that was made, this result is now the subject of judicial proceedings.  Can the Minister give the committee a timeframe for when the judicial proceedings will be concluded?  Also, is the legislation to give effect to the referendum ready to be enacted, if and when the judicial proceedings are completed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014071700005#D00200","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405587300,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I wish the new Minister for Children and Youth Affairs success with his new portfolio of responsibilities.  I note that question No. 7 about the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes is grouped with a range of questions.  The report was issued yesterday on the interdepartmental group's deliberations.  It is fair to say that the conclusions are accurate with regard to the provision of background material to inform the separate task of finalising detailed terms of reference.  On that basis, one can accept that it achieves some of that, but there is much that it does not address.  My critical concern is that there might be a reliance on this cross-departmental report in the compilation of the terms of reference for the commission of investigation.  If that were the case, much would be missed.<br \/>I am concerned about a number of areas, not least that Table 2 in the document refers to nine specific locations.  I welcome the fact that the Bethany Home is included in that list of nine.  However, I do not believe that the reference to the county homes and Magdalen laundries as part of a mapping exercise across a range of settings will be adequate by any stretch of the imagination.  I believe that the county homes and the Magdalen laundries must be integral to the principal project of the new commission of investigation, that is, to address all of these sites, all mother and baby homes and similar institutions.  I made this case <i>ad nauseam<\/i>to the former Minister and yesterday to the current Minister, Deputy Reilly, when we met for the first time since he took office.<br \/>There are a range of other things that have not been mentioned.  The cross-border and international dimensions are very important and that is not reflected in an adequate way in the cross-departmental report.  That is hugely important in terms of placements and adoptions on a cross-border basis and internationally and it is critical to the terms of reference that must ultimately be agreed.<br \/>With regard to the reference to a social history, much of this comes from the mapping exercise and the conclusions E and F.  We must have more than a social history.  It is absolutely vital that the opportunity is not lost to address properly all of the salient facts and expose them to full public scrutiny.  A social history may indeed be welcome of itself, but that will not suffice in terms of the victims and survivors of said institutions.  A light must be shone in all of these areas, such that nothing is left untold.<br \/>I wish to record some disappointment.  In previous meetings with the former Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, I had requested a heads-up in respect of the appointment to the chair of the commission of investigation.  It came up, but not the name, yesterday in our meeting.  I would have liked to have had the opportunity to have privately indicated to the Minister my concerns about Judge Yvonne Murphy.  That concern would be based not on other work she has done but particularly regarding the report on symphysiotomy.  I have read that report at least a couple of times and remain deeply disappointed that it did not properly reflect point No. 2, methodologies that would allow for the achievement of truth and justice for all of the victims of that barbaric practice.  That causes me concern regarding her appointment in this instance.<br \/>I had offered to give a view in previous meetings and I am disappointed that the opportunity was not provided.  However, the announcement has been made and I must try to find some solace in the fact that the Minister has designated her as chair of a commission of investigation, rather than the sole member.  I strongly commend to the Minister the appointment of a number of people to constitute the commission rather than a sole individual.  It is very important.  Again, I refer to the international dimension.  There is a pool of very highly qualified and respected international judicial figures.  I had instanced one of those in the submission I made to the Minister, both in writing and orally, and while I was not making an argument for that specific person, I was trying to indicate how important it was that the appointees would be of such stature that they would deservedly have the confidence of all who are looking forward to the unfolding work of the new commission.<br \/>As regards the conclusions of the cross-departmental team, I agree with the point made in 8.c.  It says that legislative reform is likely to deliver a much more effective approach and should proceed as speedily as possible.  This, of course, refers to the wider area regarding those who have been through these adoption experiences.  It would not be too harsh to describe some of them as very questionable adoption practices, if not illegal for their time.  The information and tracing Bill must be expedited.  It is very important that this is done, and the Minister should respond accordingly.<br \/>Briefly, with regard to the two other matters I raised relating to the recommendations of the Ombudsman for Children's report on the services for children in care, question No. 8, when will the national plan for residential care be ready?  When will the Children First Bill be enacted?  Regarding the children's referendum, what is the Minister's understanding of the expected conclusion of the Supreme Court ruling on the challenge to the referendum and, consequently, when will its provisions come into effect?  My final question relates to question No. 9.<\/p> <p>In this instance, I note 4,500 reports have been published.  What percentage of the total number of reports does this represent?  Are there specific black spots in respect of unpublished reports?  How many additional inspectors have been recruited and how many will be recruited to ensure adherence to the regulations to be published before the end of August?  Finally, will the Secretary General of the Department provide this Deputy and members of the joint committee with the Labour Court ruling that is referred to repeatedly by Tusla as the reason it is not in a position to employ early childhood education, ECE, graduates as inspectors?  I ask him to please furnish members with this information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014071700006#E00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405587900,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and it is great to see him here.  There is much talk during Cabinet reshuffles of promotions, demotions or whatever but this is a dream job.  The Minister has an opportunity to take a strong step to make Ireland one of the best places in which to be a child, to grow up and to transition into adulthood.  There is a saying that third time is a charm and as this is the third Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in the present Administration, the Minister hopefully is sure to succeed and that it really is a charm.  There is a long list of issues in respect of children and young people and I stress the point to the Minister that very often, one forgets about young people in this portfolio.  While there is a long list, today I will only concentrate on a few areas based on the questions I had submitted.<br \/>However, I certainly will be happy to engage with the Minister and his officials on how to ensure we are not simply firefighting.  Obviously, we must ensure the well-being of those particularly vulnerable children who are in crisis but we must also ensure the foundation blocks are in place and that there is early intervention and prevention.  In the context of early intervention and prevention, sometimes people immediately think of toddlers and babies but they must be considered at all stages in a child's life.  Were one to read the national review panel reports published yesterday, this can be seen to be true.  I refer in particular to the case of &quot;Luke&quot;, for whom this can be seen so many times during his life.  The report stated &quot;the high threshold for tolerance by the HSE of information concerning child neglect for the first nine years of Luke's life&quot; was unacceptable.  Tragically, he died at the age of 19 and for me, this is an area about which we must be very concerned.  The review panel reports have shown that quite a lot of agencies are involved and quite a considerable amount of resources are involved in a child's life on behalf of the State.  The difficulty, again and again, is these resources are not connected.  All too often, children are failed because by the time a social worker identifies that X resources are needed for a child and by the time the resource in question becomes available, that child's life has moved on and the resource no longer is the appropriate resource for the child and therefore, it fails again.  Ultimately, however, it is the child who really is failed.  I will echo my request regarding the issue of the national review panel reports.  The former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, had agreed to it and consequently, I am surprised that members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children did not get advance notice of the reports and did not receive them.  Although I awoke yesterday to read about it in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, I believe the Oireachtas has a role in examining and scrutinising these reports.<br \/>Part of my question No. 15 pertained to the Child and Family Agency and this hits at the issue of the provision of resources because during the passage of the Act, Members were told of the 4,000 staff the new agency would have.  This is true as if one looks at a headcount, the agency has a staff of 3,942.  In reality, however, when one considers the number of full-time equivalents, the number of staff is 3,483.76.  This shows to me that at present, the agency does not have the resources to make it succeed.  I also have had concerns about out-of-hours services, as well as the resources that are outside the agency but which are so critical to its success such as the child and adolescent mental health services.  Moreover, if one studies the review panel reports published yesterday, public health nurses also play a vital role.  Many, albeit not all, asked to be transferred over but yet were not.  How can one be sure that such joined-up working is succeeding?  I had difficulty in this regard even during the passage of the Act and while I acknowledge plans are being developed, I do not know how one will know the agency is succeeding.  Is it by the number of children who die in care?  Will it be like road accident statistics where the numbers rise and fall and where we will applaud ourselves when fewer children die in the care of the State in a particular year?  Were that to be the case, it would be untenable.  However, targets must be set and published.  Although the head of the agency talks about accountability and transparency, yet I still have not had sight of clear targets that members of the joint committee can follow in order that they can know when they can appropriately applaud the agency and when they must state its performance is not good enough and more must happen.  I believe there is an issue in respect of the provision of resources but often, that issue can mask problems about implementation and consequently, this is an issue that must be examined.<br \/>As for question No. 13 that I asked on direct provision, I welcome the response and acknowledge that the former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, met the Seanad cross-party group headed by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and myself.  However, one agreement we had with the Minister at that time but on which no action has been taken was for the Department to commission internally a report on the needs of children in direct provision.  This would be in line with the proposal by the special rapporteur on child protection, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, who suggested there should be a report to examine whether the system itself is detrimental to the welfare and development of children and, if appropriate, whether the adoption of an alternative form of support and accommodation would be more suitable for families and for children in particular.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to drawing up that report.  I believe that is the role for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Obviously, direct provision falls under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality but the children in direct provision cannot be ignored and I have concerns regarding welfare and protection that I have raised previously.<br \/>Finally, with regard to question No. 14, I welcome the Minister's openness about looking at the definitions of children at risk and vulnerable groups.  We must ensure that we are inclusive and that as many children as possible are included.  This brings me to agreeing wholeheartedly with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on the mother and baby homes and similar institutions, both about the investigation itself and the need regarding the right to identity in respect of information and tracing for adoption.  One regret I have on this issue is while there obviously is an historic dimension that must be addressed, a child being adopted even today in Ireland will not have a right to his or her identity.  The importance of the right to identity is known and we know the past must be redressed.  Surely, however, one should seek to make the system of adoption more open in order that children who are being adopted today will have this right.  That would be one way to show we are learning about the past and are making remedy and redressing that.  I reiterate I have a long list but these are the issues on which I wish to focus today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014071700007#F00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1405587900,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and will hand back over to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014071700007#F00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1405587900,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I thank members.  I will try to go through as many of the questions as possible myself and will refer to the Secretary General where necessary.  Deputy Troy asked me the reason I would not include my priorities into my opening statement.  First, I would like to give further consideration to the areas I would like to prioritise.  Second, the priorities that spring to mind immediately obviously are to continue to implement the programme for Government commitments, which I will do, as well as to focus on the Brighter Future Better Outcomes framework.  Members have mentioned outcomes and as they are aware from my previous role, I am a great believer in measuring outcomes and developing measurement thereof, rather than simply looking at output.  In many parts of the public service, we have run into trouble because of outputs and of ticking boxes, rather than looking at what actually was being achieved from the perspective of the client.  This could not be more important anywhere than in the care of children.<\/p><p>  Deputy Troy mentioned rumours of public health elements coming into this brief and I am aware there have been some reports that this would be perceived as a dilution or a downgrading.  On the contrary, I would perceive such a move as strengthening the children portfolio.  The Department has established itself and, as Senator van Turnhout has pointed out, it has a phenomenal job to do.  It reaches into every other Department and many elements of public health specifically affect children.  It is known that every euro one spends on children is where one will get the best return, whether it be in health or other aspects of their care such as education, etc.<\/p> <p>This is where one will get the best return, be it in health or other aspects of their care such as education.  The two Secretaries General will meet and discuss what the most appropriate parts to bring to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs are because whatever happens, it has to be done with one key objective in mind, which is achieving better outcomes for children.<\/p><p> Deputy Troy expressed concern that Tusla will not meet its budget this year.  Tusla has a budget of &euro;602 million, which includes &euro;6.7 million in additional funding - &euro;12 million in a full year - to assist in the reform of child protection services.  Unlike many other public bodies, Tusla was not subject to an expenditure reduction requirement other than in respect of the public pay savings under the Haddington Road agreement.  There were areas of expenditure which transferred to Tusla which are subject to financial pressure.  For example, there is spending of about &euro;34 million on legal costs, which is a huge amount of money.  I reiterate the point I made yesterday and many times previously that we must ensure the moneys we have to go the people we are trying to serve - in this case, children - and not on legal fees.  This sum is far too high and is acknowledged by Gordon Jeyes as being so.  It is implementing a range of reforms to get value in this area.  The agency's cash drawdown from my Department is currently well within the agreed levels but it is projecting an expenditure level that is about &euro;23 million ahead of allocation, or just under 4%.  The Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are working very closely with the chief executive and head of finance in the agency on its financial outturn in its first year of operation.  As I say, a huge part of that is made up of legal fees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014071700007#F00400","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405588500,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Was any deficit carried over?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014071700008#G00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1405588500,"counter":298,"content":"<p>That covers the early years programme and the eight-point plan.  I think there is a reasonably comprehensive answer to the Deputy's question at question No. 29.  He spoke about the 4,200 different organisations, 30% of which are not for profit.  I will let the Secretary General answer that question.  In respect of the National Review Panel for Serious Incidents and Child Deaths, these are obviously of huge concern.  As the Deputy is aware, the national review panel is independent.  Its purpose is to bring transparency in order that we can learn from these tragedies and not continue to repeat the same mistakes.  Reading the report, it is obvious there was a raft of things that seemed to be looked at in isolation rather than in a joined-up fashion, that there were delays in reports and information changing hands and that, as often happened in the past, issues were looked at in isolation rather than looking at the person and how all these things affected that individual.  There needs to be more cohesion, and action has certainly been taken in the Department to correct many of the things highlighted in the report.  That is not to say there is not room for further improvement because there certainly is room for improvement and a need for more work in this area.<\/p><p>  The Deputy spoke about the number of social workers.  Recruitment has taken place and a number have been recruited since the beginning of the year.  Others must still be recruited and the Deputy mentioned the figures.  This is an ongoing process.  We are still awaiting the Children First legislation but that is to come in the autumn.  The aftercare report and legislation will launched this afternoon.  The audit of the ECCE scheme and Pobal was a proactive measure carried out by the Department to ensure we are getting value for money.  It has shown up areas where further improvement can take place.  The more transparency we have when we look at everything in public life, the more accountability and the better the outcome we get for the taxpayer and the people who use our services.<\/p><p>  The referendum on judicial proceedings is a matter in the courts.  The hearing is in December.  I agree 100% with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in regarding the commission of investigation into the mother and baby homes.  It is our intention that far more than social history will be done here.  We will look into all these issues.  We must have a thorough understanding of what happened and must be able to put it into the social context of the times.  As I said yesterday, we want to be sufficiently inclusive to ensure we get a thorough understanding of the issues but not so expansive as to result in us not having a timely and cost-effective commission.  What people want is to get knowledge as quickly as possible in a comprehensive fashion, and that is the aim of this commission.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned his concerns around Judge Murphy.  I do not think there is anyone better placed than Judge Murphy given her record with regard to Cloyne, Dublin and symphysiotomy.  She knows how to run a commission.  We purposely appointed her as a chair and not as a sole person in order that she could avail of the opportunity to bring other people on to the commission.  I will not prejudge her decision or that of the Government in that regard but, clearly, one can see the way we are leaning.<\/p><p>  Adoption practices are best addressed through separate legislation in order that it can be done expeditiously.  Otherwise, it will get caught up in the commission and delay the legislation and the commission.  I think we would all agree that it is very important that people are able to trace their identity and know who they are genetically.  Senator van Turnhout spoke about this and putting in place a legal right for people to know.  We could certainly do that from this point on in the legislation.  We propose to debate and do that.  It is a bit like the law in many other areas.  If a person entered into an agreement under certain terms and conditions, one cannot take their right to privacy away if they gave their child up on the basis that they had the right to reserve whereas from a point in the future, it would be clear in law that they would give up that right if they gave their child up for adoption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014071700008#G00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1405588500,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I contest whether they entered into that right of privacy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014071700008#G00400","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1405588500,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Fair enough, but it is a legal consideration that we cannot just dismiss.

There is a lag in the number of inspections, however, as the inspectors do an induction process when they are appointed.  We expect to see that rectified in due course.  Further recruitment is under way and more inspectors will take up position in September.  The agency has identified the main blackspots in parts of Dublin as a priority and will be undertaking a further recruitment campaign to address staffing issues there.<\/p><p> When the Department was established, it inherited a range of programmes which it is reviewing.  We have an internal audit function with an independent audit committee.  We take each of the programmes we are operating very seriously to see if there is greater scope for greater value for money and areas where greater controls could be implemented.  There was a detailed audit of the free preschool year.  Pobal plays an important role in providing this service.  A Department of our size could not administer the range of schemes for which it has responsibility.  Up to 4,500 providers participate in that particular scheme while the Department has a staff of 130 to cover its full range of responsibilities.  We could devote a large cohort of our staff to that scheme alone and not have time to do our other work as a result.<\/p><p> We have an arrangement with Pobal which is absolutely legally compliant.  We, along with other Departments which have a similar relationship with Pobal, have obtained legal advice on this.  Pobal was established by the Government and is in its control.  It appoints the board of directors while the Comptroller and Auditor General audits its accounts.  It is more an agency relationship than a commercial relationship with the Department.  We work with Pobal to improve how the free preschool year is operated.  A major information technology project is being delivered and we will see substantial productivity improvement, building on work that has been achieved by Pobal in this area.<\/p><p> The question of value for money relates to the &euro;2.5 million fee given to Pobal for operating the scheme with the total cost being &euro;175 million.  Looking at the &euro;2.5 million on its own, as the internal audit did, it raises questions as to how it is determined.  Prior to the audit, the Department and Pobal had agreed to move away from providing a fee to Pobal which did not have a proper costed activity base.  Pobal did work for us which we did not pay it and then in other areas, such as the &euro;2.5 million, it did work for us for which we did pay it.  It is important all it does is properly costed with some external objective benchmarks and we can show value for money on that.  That is the basis of the internal audit recommendation.  Those recommendations form part of an action plan which is being implemented and overseen by the Department&rsquo;s independent audit committee.  The issues identified by the Department in the internal audit process will be advanced.  We have the fullest co-operation from Pobal in that respect.<\/p><p> On the question of a conflict in interest, the current arrangement is that the compliance function is a dedicated and separate function to other roles performed by Pobal.  It reports to a management unit that has other responsibilities.  We have agreed with Pobal that it would be better that it would report to a specific compliance function that it would have in place for all of its programmes.  Pobal will be re-organising how it does its compliance function to ensure there can be no perception of a conflict of interest.  There has been a positive set of responses to the internal audit findings.  I am satisfied we will have the oversight in place and that in implementing that action plan we will address all the issues outlined in the internal audit report.<\/p><p> The Supreme Court will hear two appeals against the High Court ruling on the children&rsquo;s referendum which was in favour of the Government in early December.  I am not certain how quickly we will get a ruling but the full consideration of both appeals will take place at the same time.  Once the ruling is made, and on the basis that the referendum is validated, we have legislation ready to introduce to the House to give effect to the referendum result.<\/p><p> We have covered some of the ground about public health nurses in recognising that the task force on the establishment of the Child and Family Agency made a range of recommendations, some of which were easier to implement immediately.  Through the legislation we have put a range of functions in place for the agency.  There are other recommendations which will require fuller and deeper consideration.  They would also have been too much to advance in the agency&rsquo;s first year of operations.<\/p><p> In respect of relevant child and youth services which have stayed in the Health Service Executive, HSE, there is a joint protocol in place with Tusla to ensure close co-operation between the various services.  We will examine that level of integration to see what the best arrangements are for the future.  That will have to be considered in conjunction with other Departments too.  We do not have a position on it at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014071700008#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405589100,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and wish him well in his new portfolio, one of the most important in the Cabinet.

An awful evil was inflicted on many young mothers and children in the past.  Yesterday, across the water, we were brought into a different realm with reports of widespread child abuse inflicted by family members, service providers, doctors, teachers and others close to children.  Sometimes the voice of abused children is not heard.  The Minister must work on behalf of all children.<\/p><p>  I welcome that the breakdown of funding for individual family resource centres will be forwarded to me.<\/p> <p>I ask that it include the number of staff involved and the cost.  What training is offered to the clients who use the family resource centre and how many participate in training programmes?

Unfortunately, however, it is a question of money.  When we had money, we should have done much more to facilitate young parents who have huge mortgages with a second preschool year.  I urge the Minister to pursue budget provision for a second free preschool year, perhaps on a phased basis.

His is an evolving Department which is doing pioneering work in some areas.  In that sense, it is a good challenge and I sincerely wish him the best.<\/p><p>  I briefly wish to raise some issues about the questions I tabled on mother and baby homes and adoptions.  In regard to children in care and the appalling treatment some have experienced, resulting in death in some instances, it is difficult to trump the horror associated with it.  A new body has been established to register health and social workers.  As of this year just under 3,700 social workers have applied to register with this body.  However, the board has acknowledged that some of these individuals do not have particularly extensive experience and as of one or two weeks ago the number of registrations was lower than 3,700 applications.  Approximately 400 people have applied but not been registered.  The very fact that they have applied for registration is sufficient to allow them to operate as social workers, even though they are, in effect, unregistered social workers in the employ of the HSE.  In the context of the serious care issues that arise, I am concerned about the fact that the figures do not add up.<\/p><p>  Complaints about serious incidents of child safety breaches and abuse have been made against staff in certain care institutions.  What steps would the Minister recommend complainants take in such cases?<\/p><p>  The issue of adoption is linked with mother and baby homes, but it is also separate.  There is an urgent need to address the issue of adoption through information and tracing legislation, but the problem with the response I have received to my question is that we have been raising this issue for the past three years and the answer has always been the same.  That is not the Minister's fault, but three years have passed and the legislation has not yet been delivered as promised.  What assurances can we be given that it will be tabled in the autumn?  The over-complication and lack of recognition of the Department's legal interpretation have been disputed by others who argue that the right to privacy is not enshrined as the Minister indicated, particularly in the context of adoption.  This issue is urgent.  The Chinese walls erected in the context of mother and baby homes have set off alarm bells among the groups involved because illegal practices of adoption and coercion need to be addressed.  It is not adequate to say these issues will be covered by the new legislation because it will only deal with the provision of information and tracing in the future.  It will not take account of what happened to people in the past and the need for an investigation.<\/p><p>  I concur with Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's comments on the commission and have similar concerns, although they are not in any way derogatory of Judge Murphy.  It is not sufficient that she be given the option to bring in others.  It is an absolute necessity that she bring in others.  One of the reasons for Ireland's hammering at the United Nations hearings in Geneva was the approach taken to symphysiotomy did not lend itself to accountability.  Nobody was held to account for what happened and that responsibility was written out of the story.  Unfortunately, that was the approach taken to Judge Murphy's role.  We need to include a truth finding aspect, but the Minister's reference to a timely and cost effective process rings alarm bells for people.  Does it mean \"limiting\"?  We need to build consultation and involvement with survivor groups into the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014071700010#J00200","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1405589700,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and wish him well in his new role.  <\/p><p>  In regard to question No. 4 on mother and baby homes, I am disappointed that we do not have terms of reference.  I note the appointment of a chairperson.  It is important that an international dimension be included in the commission.  I ask the Minister to give a firm commitment that the terms of reference will be in place at the start of the next D&aacute;il term and that they will be inclusive and fit for purpose.<\/p><p>  With regard to question No. 5 on free preschool places for children with learning difficulties, it is virtually impossible for children with additional needs to receive support in ECCE services.  It is commonplace that assessments are made later in the preschool year and they do not determine the supports children require.  It is an appalling example of two Departments ignoring their policy responsibilities.  The preschool ratio is one carer to 11 children, but the ratio for children with special needs to be much lower.  I ask the Minister to investigate how this can be rectified in order that assessments will be made at the beginning of the preschool year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014071700010#J00300","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1405589700,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister and wish him well in his new appointment.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of adoption, it can be difficult to deal with competing rights, but the right of the adopted child to know his or her parents should supersede the right to privacy.  While it is a difficult legal issue, I urge the Minister to make progress on it.  If it means getting agreement on waiving previous legal commitments, that should be done.  It is important to take a proactive approach.<\/p><p>  With regard to the detention centre for young offenders, I listened to Mr. John Lonergan during the years and we can all identify the child or young person in our constituencies who will end up in prison.  It comes down to early access to education.  When former Deputy John O'Donoghue was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, his Department carried out research in conjunction with the USA on the correlation between young offenders in detention centres and dyslexia and learning difficulties.  A considerable amount of money was spent on an education centre in Mountjoy Prison which for industrial relations reasons was not used for several years.<\/p> <p>I do not know whether it is used now.  I urge the Minister to study the best practice in other jurisdictions, particularly in England.  There is a detention centre for young offenders in Warrington where the programme is based on building up self esteem, giving young offenders a role in life and putting resources into education.  I am familiar with young offenders in my constituency.  They spend their time bored, lying on their beds, with nothing to do.  In England I met young offenders whose colleagues in other centres were writing to the governor of the Warrington centre asking to be admitted to it.  It is worth paying a visit to it.  I hope the new centre will get off on the correct footing and that the staff are educated in how to deal with the needs of young people.<\/p><p> I see no mention of the children's hospital, which is a very important issue.  I have concerns about it and have tabled a number of questions to the Minister for Health during recent months but have received evasive answers.

At yesterday's press briefing, Mr. Paul Harrison of the Child and Family Agency said 9,000 children who have been referred to the Child and Family Agency await the allocation of a social worker.  What is more staggering is that 3,000 of them are considered high priority.  I am extremely concerned about the figure, which I questioned yesterday on the radio.  I am alarmed that it is so high.

While we must focus on children in care, my Department is to protect all children in the State and ensure they all get the best care during their childhoods and the best outcomes we can create.  Many of these matters cut across public health issues, for example we do not want children smoking or drinking alcohol, we want them to be conscious of the value of being physically active and aware of their weight, without being consumed by it.  We know there are issues on both end of the spectrum for which we need to watch out.<\/p><p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne asked about question No. 20 and the number of staff who participate in training, and I will let the Secretary General answer.  I am a great supporter of a second pre-school year, as is the T&aacute;naiste.  However, we must check the quality of what we deliver now before we extend it.  This is not a way of delaying it; we just need to assure ourselves we are spending the money in the right way and getting the outcomes we need.<\/p><p>  Deputy Daly mentioned the challenge, with which I concur completely, and the appalling treatment some children have had in care in the past and that we must learn from it and ensure we do not repeat the mistakes, which has been a recurring theme in many parts of our public services.  I understand the Deputy's point about the 400 social workers who applied for registration, have not been registered but are still working in their roles.  I will get a report on it because it is critically important.  The Deputy's other point is equally important, regarding how we process complaints and how people get satisfaction.  In my previous Department, we discussed a patient safety agency, which is being established on an administrative basis.  We will need some mechanism that will give people the comfort that they can make a complaint and get a resolution quickly, and that if they are not happy with the resolution being presented by the local agency, there is a national, more independent mechanism for addressing the situation.<\/p><p>  I want to reassure the Deputy that we consider the issue of identity and tracing to be urgent.  This is not a ploy to delay it but a mechanism to accelerate the legislation.  The Department has done much work already on it and the Deputy will be able to take me to task if it does not come through, because it is a priority, as do others in government.  While it is for the Government to make the final decision on the commission issue, and I do not want to pre-empt it, it would be beneficial to have an international presence on it.  To do it, I would want to talk to Judge Murphy and get a Government decision.<\/p><p>  While I understand Deputy McLellan's disappointment about the terms of reference, it is better done right than rushed.  The last thing we need is a ten-year tribunal to the frustration of many of the people involved and enormous cost to the taxpayer.  This is not an excuse for trying to close down the areas that must be investigated.  There is no point in having the commission if we leave whole rafts of people no wiser than when we started and feeling excluded.  It will not work.  Mechanisms will have to be found to make it as inclusive as possible and fit for purpose.  The Deputy also mentioned the ratios around 1:11 for children and the same applied to those with disabilities and special needs.  A working group from my Department and the Departments of Health and Education and Skills is examining it.  Wearing a previous hat, we were the first to put a civil servant at principal officer level across the three Departments to examine such issues.<\/p><p>  I hear what Deputy Timmins said about the right of a child to know versus the right of privacy, which Deputy Daly also raised.  While I do not consider myself in any position to make judgments on it, I know the issues and we will do our best.  If we can come to another solution for those who are in the situation it will be all to the benefit.  We will examine it and will get the best legal advice we can with a view to being proactive and trying to resolve the issue, not as an excuse for doing nothing and leaving matters as they are.<\/p><p>  I could not agree more with the Deputy on Oberstown and early intervention for learning difficulties.  There is a serious issue regarding children with dyslexia and other learning issues such as attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity, ADDH.  They end up in trouble and are sent down the wrong road instead of receiving the support and help they need.  I will examine other centres, which the Department has already done.  I worked in Oberstown as a visiting doctor for several years, and things have moved on there in terms of the care they give and the normalisation of life they try to bring for children, educating them and keeping them in school.  There is another initiative in the Department around community programmes, which are aimed at supporting children to get on in their own schools and communities and preventing them ending up in institutions of care such as Oberstown.<\/p><p>  We would all like the national children's hospital built as expeditiously as possible.  I was talking to the Minister for Health about it last night.  We will continue to raise concerns and there will be ongoing input and support from my Department to the Minister for Health.<\/p> <p>It is the remit of the Minister for Health and it is his project to deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014071700011#K00700","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405590900,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Mr. Breslin, Ms Hogan and Mr. Savage for attending.
