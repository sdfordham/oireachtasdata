What I was most disgusted about during the recess was the fact that the Government used it to make savage cuts to intellectual and disability services.  For example, St. Michael's House serves more than 1,600 young men and women and children in the north east.  In August, the Minister announced a cut of &euro;1 million to its services, backdated to 1 July.  Respite care has been cut, which means that no staff overtime is available and there will be no new day services.  People will need to be returned from respite care to their families.  They are the people most in need of services.<\/p><p>This is ironic, given that I listened to the Minister's comments on the health budget yesterday when he stated that he was not too concerned about being a couple of euro over it.  He has proven not to be efficient with his personal finances, but he has also proven year on year that he is not able to manage the health budget.  One day before the Christmas recess last year, he ran into the House late in the evening and sought an additional &euro;300 million for the health service.  At the time and again this year, we stated that his budget did not stack up and was a fantasy.  This year, there will be a further major job overrun.  To what does the Minister assign blame and what is the reason for it?<\/p> <p>He says there are serious demographic issues and old people get sick.  So is it their fault that the health budget is over-running?  Is it their fault that young people in St. Michael's House will not now receive the services they deserve?  Is it the fault of the elderly that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Government have cut the respite care grant by 30%?  <\/p><p>We now have a whole new narrative whereby the Minister, Deputy Reilly, like the hurler on the ditch, is blaming the service users for the fact that he cannot manage his budget.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800003#B00500","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379511300,"counter":11,"content":"<p>That is not what he said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800004#C00200","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1379511300,"counter":12,"content":"<p>This is the third year in a row that this situation has arisen.

I ask that the Leader offer our collective condolences and sympathy to the family of our Saoi, Nobel laureate and most important poet since W.B. Yeats, Seamus Heaney.  The 30 August, the day Seamus Heaney died, was a sad day.  He is a loss to his family, the world of poetry and the world of Irish society and Irish citizens.  From the front cover of <i>The New York Times<\/i>to the hourly news bulletins on our national broadcaster it was apparent to all of us that Seamus Heaney was both a global and local poet.  He was beyond the parish yet he was part of it too.  He was political and understood how poetry and theatre could offer clarity and illumination.  He never shirked his responsibility as a citizen poet.  He was a generous, inspiring, loving man and poet.  I call on the Leader to set aside a modest amount of time to allow Senators to reflect on the death of this great poet and respond to his legacy.<\/p><p> In his play, &quot;The Cure at Troy&quot;, he wrote these evocative lines: <blockquote>History says, Don't hope<br \/>On this side of the grave,<br \/>But then, once in a lifetime<br \/>The longed-for tidal wave<br \/>Of justice can rise up<br \/>And hope and history rhyme.<\/blockquote>Speaking of history, the Taoiseach's nominees have tabled a motion on the history of the junior cycle for discussion during Private Members' time this evening.

The National Roads Authority, NRA, has delivered on major projects of connectivity between our major cities, although a significant piece of the jigsaw remains to be completed, namely, the Atlantic corridor.  As a country, we are faced with the major challenge of counteracting congestion in our city centres and making them more viable and sustainable.  In terms of our capital city, an article in yesterday's <i>The Irish Times<\/i> is further example of empire building and in-fighting between the archaic structures of local government and the needs of citizens and business people.  This incident is not isolated.  I have first-hand experience of similar challenges in Galway city with regard to traffic management.<\/p><p>  If we are to progress with the same vision as in respect of our motorways we must tackle city centre congestion over the next ten years.  As Mayor of Galway, I initiated and facilitated a traffic report with an advisory group consisting of people from Engineers Ireland, NUI Galway and the Galway Chamber of Commerce.  Their role was to engage with the citizens of Galway, the local authorities and relevant agencies to elicit cost-effective measures that would alleviate traffic flow in the city.  The response from the citizens was very positive and more than 30 recommendations were published and presented to the city council.  A number of these measures have been implemented.  However, a lot more needs to be done to tackle this serious issue.<\/p><p>  I recently facilitated a second report, due to be published in the coming weeks, calling on the citizens of Galway to describe how their journeys have changed over the past 12 months following a number of significant infrastructural changes.  I note my Galway colleague, Deputy Noel Grealish, in an article in the Galway <i>Sentinel<\/i>  has called on Galway city and county councils to use joined up thinking in addressing the ongoing traffic congestion in the city.  This is not an isolated issue for Galway but one which has major national implications for business, tourism and investment in our main cities throughout the country.

The campaign posters are a shocking waste of public money by the Government.  Let us not lie about this - it is taxpayers' money.  The Government states it is party money but where does party money come from?  The Government is worried about &euro;4 million being spent on the Seanad, which has done a significant amount of work on legislation.  The Seanad is different from the D&aacute;il where Deputies have little fights and call each other names before the teams are wheeled in to make the obvious decision.

We did not vote down Bills but persuaded governments to withdraw Bills by virtue of our intelligence, capacity and special knowledge.  For this reason, it is vital that we keep the Seanad. <\/p><p>The Government can say party rather than Government money is being spent on the campaign.

With all the talk about political reform, it is high time that the budget was done in a different way and not presented as a <i>fait accompli<\/i> as has been the case for far too long.  After discussions with his party and with senior officials in Departments, the Minister for Finance comes to the House and then presents what is a <i>fait accompli<\/i> and very few changes are made.  We in the Oireachtas need to change how we do business and the budget represents a good opportunity to do that.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach made a very interesting comment last week when he said he feels the pain of people who are suffering at the moment.  Does he really feel the pain of those unemployed people who spend almost every hour of the day trying to get a job?  I do not believe the Taoiseach really feels the pain of the people who have emigrated and the parents who have watched their loved ones emigrate.  I do not believe he feels the pain of people with disabilities and carers who have experienced cuts.  All the savage cuts imposed by the Government have driven more people into poverty.  If the Taoiseach genuinely felt their pain he would not be about to impose a further austerity budget on the people.<\/p><p>  My party would welcome a smaller adjustment.  However, it is not about the adjustment but about how it is made.  It is about where the money comes from and where the cuts are made.  In recent years all the evidence from various bodies, including State bodies, has shown that lower and middle-income families and the unemployed have disproportionately taken the brunt of the cuts - often very savage cuts.  If the Taoiseach really feels those people's pain, he should do things differently this year and introduce a fairer budget.

As a person who has advocated the introduction of calorie counts on menus in restaurants generally in so far as is practical - obviously it could be too onerous in the case of restaurants that change their menus each day - it is only fitting that a start be made here in the Houses of the Oireachtas to show true leadership on this issue.

As the Senator remarked, she is an example to us all.  In particular, I would like to have a debate on the point the Senator made about creating an award for conscience.  That would be very important in these Houses, especially given the manner in which people have abused power in the Lower House to discriminate very strongly and unfairly against members of a political party who exercised their conscience and, as a consequence, have had to make considerable sacrifices, for which I applaud them.

Almost 100,000 farmers are facing penalties dating back from 2008 to 2013 due to digitisation of maps.  The Minister introduced the BVD scheme a couple of years ago for which I congratulate him.  I have done some research in my own herd for the IFA on the scheme.  Many of the new BVD tags are falling out.

I am aware it is an EU scheme and that if a person is in breach of a scheme a penalty must apply.  I ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to consider imposing the penalties over a two-year period rather than imposing the full penalty this year.  If a person has a penalty of &euro;1,000, I suggest that &euro;500 be taken this year and &euro;500 next year as that would lessen the pain in what has been a very trying year in respect of agricultural costs.

The EU had to take the unprecedented step of writing to the Irish Government to cajole it into applying for millions of euro in development funds that it has so far failed to seek for the west, and this is a major scandal and beggars belief.  It would appear that the committee informed the Minister that there is funding for the construction of the western rail corridor if the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport would only apply for it.  The committee has even offered to travel here on a fact finding mission to help identify projects for consideration.  It seems to me that there is a major lack of stewardship here.  The committee is concerned about balanced regional development and that it must inquire as to why funding for the west is not being sought is really remarkable.  That was the view of Mr. Tierney in <i>The Connacht Tribune<\/i> and I agree with him.  It is amazing that an EU committee would have to browbeat an Irish Government Department into applying for available funding, given all the challenges that this country faces.

They were very taken by the point that this was the only forum in which members of the Irish diaspora, who had been forced through circumstances not of their own choice in many cases to emigrate, had some little say in the halls of Parliament.<\/p><p>Let me make one or two brief points as I am troubled by these matters.  I would like the Leader to use the offices of his parliamentary party to ask the Taoiseach and the director and co-director of the referendum campaign, Deputies Bruton and Doherty, to formally retract something which at least one of them admitted is fundamentally inaccurate, namely, the &euro;20 million makey-up figure which is now emblazoned on tens of thousands of posters around the country.  Not only is it inaccurate but it contains within it an incredible bit of subversion of democracy.  They admit that the direct costs are about &euro;6 million and part of the makey-up costs are the costs of processing citizens' questions.  Will citizens stop asking questions of Government, the Civil Service and the bureaucracy if Seanad &Eacute;ireann ceases to exist?  Is it a good thing that an avenue for people to ask questions of those who should be answerable and accountable to them will disappear?  I am not so sure that it is.  <\/p><p>I would also ask that the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, clarify something he has said three times, once in an Oireachtas committee, once on RTE and once to me personally, namely, that the money that will be saved - it probably is a pretty neat fit for the &euro;6 million figure, not the &euro;20 million figure - is not going to be spent taking children off waiting lists for Crumlin hospital or on employing extra special needs assistants, but will be redeployed within the Leinster House bureaucracy to fund the activities of the new committees.<\/p> <p>Parenthetically, instead of the imperfect quasi-democracy that gives us our Senators, these committees will consist of a cohort of people who are entirely appointed by the Taoiseach.  This is the same Taoiseach whose bona fides for appointing experts to committees are evident from the fact that he ejected the D&aacute;il's only senior banking and financial consultant, Deputy Mathews, from a committee on which the Deputy's expertise might have been relevant because he disagreed with the Taoiseach on abortion.  The Taoiseach also kicked the only Member who has conducted doctoral studies on food safety and food science off the health committee, which has primary responsibility for food safety, because he disagreed with the Taoiseach on whether the Roscommon emergency department should be kept open.  It is important that we get clarity from the Leader's party, which has paid for referendum posters that contain a fat inaccuracy.<\/p><p>In passing, I wish to comment on our colleagues from Sinn F&eacute;in who are not present today.  They have criticised the Seanad as being elitist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800014#N00400","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379515800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>They are never here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800015#O00200","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1379515800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Some will comment on the appropriateness or otherwise of Fine Gael - perhaps we should call them Shinne Gael, now that they are working together on the abolition campaign - to comment on anyone's elitism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800015#O00300","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1379515800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>The Senator's time has concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800015#O00400","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1379515800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>For a group of people who would not acknowledge the legitimacy of D&aacute;il elections from the 3rd to the 27th D&aacute;il, who believed that the Government of Ireland was Mr. Tom Maguire, the last survivor of the 2nd D&aacute;il who was sitting in a retirement home in Mayo, or seven guys in a shebeen in Belfast called the army council, and who thought that everyone else in the country who had voted in 31 D&aacute;il elections was wrong to accuse others in this Chamber of elitism is a little rich.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800015#O00500","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1379515800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Like others, I was not going to speak about the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad, given that we should be discussing more pressing matters, for example, the upcoming budget.

It is also a sad time for many people in south and east Limerick, particularly the communities of Bruff, Grange, Meanus and Lough Gur.<\/p><p>Michael J. Noonan was an absolute gentleman.  He bore his fight against a long illness with dignity and true grace that was characteristic of the man.  Anyone, in either House of the Oireachtas, who came across Michael J.

Noonan was very much liked right across the political spectrum.  Following his 30 years in public life he continued to be a valued community leader in Bruff and contributed to numerous excellent voluntary projects in the town, including voluntary housing.  He was very much cognisant of the sacrifices made by previous generations and as secretary of the Se&aacute;n Wall Commemoration Committee which commemorated ambushes in Grange and Caherguillamore, where many young men and women lost their lives for the cause of Irish freedom, was very cognisant of the fact that their memory should remain alive and be respected.  Occasions such as the commemoration of our noble dead can be hijacked by various political interest groups.

He wrote the famous poem &quot;September 1913&quot;, a line or two from which is particularly relevant to the debate on the future or otherwise of this House.  In that poem, William Butler Yeats asks:<blockquote><br \/>What need you, being come to sense,<br \/>But fumble in a greasy till<br \/>And add the halfpence to the pence.....<\/blockquote>In a sense, the poster in regard to the &euro;20 million cost of the Seanad is about adding the half pence to the pence.

I served on a previous Oireachtas commission.  I had faith in the members serving on that commission, which was, up to 18 months ago, able to clarify the cost of the Seanad.

The true amount is not &euro;20 million.  <\/p><p>  It has often be said that Members of this House should not lead the campaign for saving the Seanad or otherwise.

To date only 397 houses have been transferred for social housing, which is appalling.  Far more houses should be transferred given the need for social housing at the moment.  Senator Hayden also referred to the capital budget.  I hope that item can be addressed in some way in the capital budget.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane spoke about budget debates.

Senator Walsh called for a debate on the report of the OECD and the troika on unemployment and I certainly will try to arrange that.  Senator O'Neill raised the issues of single farm payments, problems with tags on cattle and the difficulties farmers have faced this year.  I have requested that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, come into the House to discuss these matters, as well as Common Agricultural Policy reform.  While I understand that he will, it will be approximately three to four weeks before he is in a position to do so.  Senator Barrett suggested the Referendum Commission may have had some omissions regarding votes for Northern Ireland citizens in particular.  I am sure this matter will be raised with the Referendum Commission.  The Senator also called for a debate on the reform of the banking system.<\/p><p>Senator Landy raised the issue of a code for voluntary housing.  It is a matter he has raised here previously and I note his points in that regard and those in respect of Seanad reform, as well as the comments of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, at a recent conference.

Within Ireland, it is estimated that one in three people will develop cancer during their lifetime.  Bearing this in mind, it is worth remembering that finding and diagnosing cancer at an early stage can result in better outcomes for patients.  Screening programmes, early detection and more effective treatment options have led to improved outcomes and survival rates for cancer patients. <\/p><p>  Ireland now has three quality assured cancer screening programmes run by the National Cancer Screening Service, NCSS.  They are as follows: BreastCheck with its national breast screening programme; CervicalCheck with its national cervical screening programme; and BowelScreen with its newly launched national bowel screening programme.<\/p><p>  The HSE's national cancer control programme, HSE-NCCP, continues to reorganise cancer services to achieve better results for patients.  The programme is working to ensure that designated cancer centres for individual tumour types have adequate case volumes, expertise and concentration of multi-disciplinary specialist skills.<\/p><p>  As a Minister in the Department of Health, I would like to see more emphasis on disease prevention rather than intervention.  Healthy lifestyle choices are a key element of creating good health, particularly where cancer is concerned.  The European code against cancer has highlighted the fact that the risk of cancer can be minimised by adopting a healthy lifestyle.<\/p><p>  Lifestyle trends that threaten health were one of the main motivations which prompted the development of Healthy Ireland - A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013-2025. <i><\/i>The Healthy Ireland framework was launched in March and provides a framework for action to improve the health and well-being of the citizens of this country.  In line with the recommendations made in the report under discussion here today, it takes a whole of government approach to the issue of health and well-being.  It also encourages all sectors of society to get involved in making Ireland a healthier place to live, work and play.<\/p><p>  One of the most significant lifestyle choices threatening health is smoking.  As Members will be aware, 5,200 people die in Ireland every year due to smoking and 44% of these are deaths from cancer.  Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in Ireland.<\/p> <p> Many successful tobacco control initiatives have been introduced in Ireland.  Examples include the workplace smoking ban, the ban on the display of tobacco products at point of sale, and the introduction of graphic warnings.  In the coming weeks, the Minister for Health will be launching a new tobacco policy for Ireland.  The recommendations outlined in the Seanad's report being discussed here today will help inform that policy.<\/p><p>It is internationally recognised that the countries which have developed and enhanced their tobacco control legislation, policies and services are those which are successful in reducing smoking rates.  The new tobacco policy will set out what we need to do in order to move to a tobacco-free Ireland.  The Minister has indicated many times that his priority, while not forgetting current smokers, is to prevent children from starting to smoke.  The bans on tobacco advertising, packs of ten cigarettes and point-of-sale display have assisted in reducing the number of ten to 17 year olds who smoke from nearly 19% in 2002 to 12% in 2010.  The trends are clear.  The rates are reducing.  The initiatives introduced since that last tobacco policy in 2000 have assisted in this reduction.  This new policy, over a decade later, sets out the framework for achieving further reductions over the coming years.<\/p><p>Alcohol is also key when considering lifestyle choices which impact on health.  Alcohol plays a complex role in Irish society.  While it is associated with many aspects of Irish social and cultural life, it is also responsible for a wide range of health and social harms in society and places a significant burden on the resources of the State in dealing with the consequences of its use and misuse.  A recent report from the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, entitled Reducing Alcohol Health Harm, highlighted the links between alcohol and cancer.  Alcohol is classified as a group 1 carcinogen and it is one of the most significant causes of cancer in Ireland, being a risk factor in seven types of cancer.  Alcohol increases the risk of more than 60 medical conditions; even at low-risk levels of consumption it increases the risk of developing many major diseases, including numerous cancers and gastrointestinal conditions.<\/p><p>The college reported that between 2000 and 2004, alcohol was estimated to cause 4.4% of deaths in Ireland.  The rate of hospital discharges for alcoholic liver diseases increased by 247% for 15 to 34 year olds and by 224% for 35 to 49 year olds between 1995 and 2007.<\/p><p>Research from the National Cancer Control Programme found that approximately 5% of newly-diagnosed cancers and cancer deaths are attributable to alcohol, with around 900 cases and 500 deaths each year.  The greatest impact was on organs of the upper aerodigestive tract.  Cancer risk due to alcohol is deemed to be the same, regardless of the type of alcohol consumed, and even drinking within the recommended limits carries an increased risk.  So what are we going to do about the misuse of alcohol?<\/p><p>My Department has submitted proposals to the Government based on the recommendations of the national substance misuse strategy report launched last year.  These proposals cover all of the areas mentioned in the report, including: legislation on minimum unit pricing; the advertising of alcohol; sponsorship; labelling of alcohol products; and prevention and intervention activities on alcohol.<\/p><p>Minimum unit pricing is a mechanism whereby a statutory floor in price levels is imposed for alcohol products that must be legally observed by retailers.  The primary function of this measure is to reduce at-risk levels of alcohol consumption, especially by those who drink in a harmful and hazardous way, and it would also have a greater impact on discouraging children from drinking.  The primary aim of minimum unit pricing is to target harmful and hazardous drinkers and reduce their consumption.  Another aim is an overall reduction in consumption across the entire community.  The means of attaining both aims is increasing the price of alcohol that is cheap relative to its strength.  This is because research has shown that harmful and hazardous drinkers tend to purchase disproportionate amounts of cheap alcohol, no matter what the income level of the drinker.  Therefore, there is evidence that increasing the price of such cheap alcohol using minimum unit pricing should lead to a reduction in the consumption of alcohol by such harmful drinkers.<\/p><p>We have consulted and negotiated extensively with other colleagues in the Government.  Of course we have to weigh up all of the different arguments before deciding how to proceed. Governments across Europe and elsewhere have already taken measures, while others are actively considering measures along the lines that we are addressing.<\/p> <p>The Cabinet committee on social policy has considered these proposals and it is my intention to submit a finalised package of proposals to the Government shortly for consideration and approval.<\/p><p>Obesity, discussion on which must necessarily encompass lifestyle factors such as diet and levels of physical activity, is also a significant risk factor for cancer.  The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased at an alarming speed in recent decades, so much so that the World Health Organization, WHO, refers to it as a global epidemic.  The high levels of obesity in all age groups of the Irish population are of increasing concern, but of particular concern are the rising levels of obesity in young children.  The situation in Ireland mirrors the global obesity epidemic, with 61% of Irish adults now overweight or obese and an alarming figure of one in four children overweight or obese at three years of age.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, Irish children are consuming large amounts of energy-dense foods, often outside the home, while many are not engaging in sufficient physical activity to prevent excess weight gain.  Most worrying is the fact that childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in Europe, with body weight now the most prevalent childhood disease.  Some 26% of nine year old Irish children are overweight or obese.  The WHO Europe Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative, COSI, in which Ireland participated in 2009, found that 23% of seven year olds were overweight or obese.<\/p><p>Obesity in adulthood drives the development and worsens the outcome of chronic diseases including cancer, type 2 diabetes and dementia.  Between 70% and 80% of health care costs in Europe are spent on chronic diseases.  Most of these health budgets are spent on treatment.  Chronic disease management is a key challenge for future health care provision in Ireland.  This challenge is not merely a financial one, but also an organisational one that requires a health system with a greater focus on prevention, co-ordination, continuity, integration and information flows that follow the patient.  Approximately 80% of the overall disease burden in Europe is due to chronic diseases and the pattern in Ireland is similar.<\/p><p>Chronic conditions will generally increase by approximately 40% during the next ten years due to our aging population and the impact of lifestyle factors.  This trend is not sustainable from a cost or hospital capacity perspective.  A new model of structured integrated care involving primary care with an emphasis on prevention will be required.  We need to shift our health systems away from a medical curative model of health care and encourage patients to participate actively in the management of their own conditions.  There is evidence that patient empowerment improves health outcomes.  Knowledge of the disease and its treatment not only improves quality of life but reduces dependency on health services.<\/p><p>In working to prevent chronic disease, it is of fundamental importance that we promote measures to increase physical activity generally, but especially among children, and that we continue to warn of the dangers of excessive consumption of foods high in fat, sugar and salt.  Eating healthy food and being physically active are two of the most important steps that we can take to improve our health.<\/p><p>It is widely acknowledged that no single initiative will reverse the growing obesity trend, but a combination of measures should make a difference.  For this reason, the special action group on obesity is concentrating on a specific range of measures, including actions such as calorie posting in restaurants, healthy eating guidelines, measures to restrict the availability of top shelf food and drinks, nutritional labelling, marketing of food and drink to children, the supply of healthy food products in vending machines, the detection and treatment of obesity and the promotion of physical activity.  Many of these initiatives are at an advanced stage and the group will continue to liaise with Departments and organisations in a cross-sectoral approach to progress this area further and to help halt the rise in overweight and obesity.  The healthy eating guide and food pyramid for the general public alongside the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, guide for professionals are positive steps in the achieving this aim.<\/p><p>There is significant evidence that physical activity promotes well being and physical and mental health, prevents disease, improves quality of life and has economic, social and cultural benefits.  However, the majority of Irish people do not meet the levels of physical activity indicated in the national physical activity guidelines.  One of the commitments in the healthy Ireland framework is to develop a plan to promote increased physical activity levels across the population.  The ambitious initial key performance indicator is to increase the proportion of the population across each life stage undertaking regular physical activity by 20%.  A working group, which will be co-chaired by the Departments of Health and Transport, Tourism and Sport, has been established to develop this plan.  It will provide a strong focus for modifying unhealthy life habits and promoting awareness of the benefits of physical activity, not just for health, but also in a wider socioeconomic context.  It is hoped to have a draft plan completed by the end of 2013.<\/p> <p>I commend the work the Seanad Public Consultation Committee has done in the area, and thank the committee for this opportunity to respond to the issues outlined in its report.<\/p><p>Improving our own health is a responsibility we all share.  I firmly believe that we must harness all the resources available to us to work together to ensure that people can lead balanced and healthy lives.  Although cancer is a serious threat to the lives and health of the population in Ireland I believe that our health policies are already addressing some of the key risk factors and I hope that future trends will reflect the progress that has been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800023#X00800","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379519700,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, and welcome him back to the House again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800026#AA00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1379519700,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and am glad of the opportunity to make a few points.  The Seanad Public Consultation Committee is one of the good news stories of the Oireachtas during this Administration.  It did not exist hitherto and I wish to pay tribute to Senator Cummins, the Leader of the House, who has done his best to introduce a variety of different initiatives to this House.  As he said on the Order of Business today, it is good to see that the other House is beginning to follow suit.  I do not mean to be facetious about this but while we were lucky to have a journalist present for the today's Order of Business - Mr. Fiach Kelly, and fair play to him for being here - the reality is that there is nobody in the Press Gallery now.  Yet this issue is important as is the public consultation that informed this succinct and factual report.  It is also based on good research and has informed the Minister's consideration of the issue.  He has highlighted some things that he will do on foot of the report.  That is democracy in action.  Is it any wonder there are difficulties in trying to put forward a case for this House when the Government on the one hand, and a willing accomplice in the media on the other, continually choose to ignore the good work, such as this, that is going on?<\/p><p>The members of the committee, including Senators O'Donovan, Bacik, Bradford, Cummins, Paul Coghlan, Daly, Mullen, Higgins, O'Donnell, O'Keeffe and Wilson, deserve our credit and thanks for the consultation that took place in 2012.  The report is a very good one.  It brought a few things home to me on obesity, the role of alcohol in breast cancer - which is not something people would ordinarily associate with it - and the sheer impact that lifestyle has on the incidence of cancer.  Much can be achieved if we adjust our lifestyles.<\/p><p>As regards diet, people far too often reach for convenience foods which are not the best for us.  Politicians who live outside Dublin may be more prone to eating meals in the car while driving.  I do it several times a week from a plastic coffee cup that is probably very bad for me, and some kind of meat sandwich with additives.  How many of us reach for the little tubs of fresh fruit?  Probably very few.<\/p><p>Despite the best efforts of the Department of Health, the HSE and various Government agencies, including NGOs, that try to influence dietary and exercise regimes, there is also a whole lifestyle that is promoted by fiction on television.  We all enjoy taking refuge in that from time to time.  It is not always the healthiest lifestyle.  For example, children's television programmes might glorify smokers, drinkers and layabouts.  In Hollywood movies, such people are slim, trim and look fantastic whereas real life is very different.  Should we take an interest in that, rather than the obvious things like advertising?  I am not talking about censorship but we should examine standards in our entertainment that seem to trivialise a certain lifestyle as being acceptable. <\/p> <p>It lends the false impression that that person can look as good as Hollywood actor A, B or C while having that lifestyle.  That is perhaps something we might look at.  <\/p><p>From a health perspective, the National Cancer Control Programme, NCCP, is successful statistically in terms of outcomes.  I use the word &quot;statistically&quot; because for 80% of the country that is the case.  However, it is not representative of the roll-out of services countrywide.  The mission statement of the National Cancer Control Programme is &quot;centrally developed, locally delivered&quot;.  As Senator O'Keeffe will testify and, up to recently Senator Cummins could testify in regard to the south east, there are gaping holes on the map of Ireland in terms of radiotherapy, for example.  That is not to suggest that we need to have a Mayo clinic or St. James's Hospital on every corner.  However, we do need specialist centres that are, as per the mission statement of the NCCP, centrally developed and locally delivered.  We need to at least begin to plan for the delivery of radiotherapy within a three hour, one and a half hours each way, commutable distance so that mothers who have to undergo eight minutes of radiotherapy per day and have children to care for can get home to care for them rather than have to travel to Galway or Dublin for treatment.  <\/p><p>I do not like when the Government - the previous Government was just as guilty of this as is the current Government - takes refuge in the Queen for certain things when it comes to health.  It is constantly stated by Government that it is working well with its Northern counterparts.  It brings somebody in Glencolmcille who needs radiotherapy no closer to getting treatment because there is a promise of a centre for radiotherapy in Altnagelvin.  Even if there were such a centre there would still be gaping wounds in parts of Ireland.  Professor Tom Keane changed the landscape of northern Canada in facilitating centres for radiotherapy.  While we should still go to hospitals such as St. James's and Beaumont and others in Cork and Galway for specialist treatments, diagnoses and surgery, all follow-up treatments, including radiotherapy, should be delivered in more central locations.  I accept that there are costs associated with doing so in terms of the provision of accelerators and radiographers and so on.  Nevertheless, it is a plan we need to put in place and aspire to, notwithstanding budgetary constraints at this time.  It is something for which we must aim.  Perhaps there is a private sector aspect to this in terms of funding, as has been done in other areas.<\/p><p>My mother who died of cancer, which from the outset was terminal, received her treatment in the Beacon Clinic.  I recall that at that time brain scans were assessed for radiotherapy in Pittsburgh but delivered in Sandyford.  What is proposed can be done.  We have all been involved in emotive campaigns in regard to cancer services for the north west, south east and other areas.  This is something that can be done.  Some Government will at some time put this plan in place.  Why not this one?<\/p><p>This is a very good report.  In terms of alcohol, minimum pricing is an absolute must.  It is critical that when we do this the price is set high enough.  We all know that as Christmas approaches, cases of beer will be on sale in local supermarkets for &euro;14.  While if I purchased a case of beer I would still have most or a large portion of it next June, sadly younger people would consume it within two hours, which is the type of practise we need to move away from.  While other Senators have a different view in regard to price fixing and so on there is a need for minimum pricing on alcohol.  At a minimum, we must try it for a period.  Ireland is now ranked second in the world in terms of binge drinking.  We are all guilty of it.<\/p> <p>In terms of diet, all I see in shops are multicoloured fizzy drinks.  One has to search for old fashioned orange or lemonade now as virtually all the products are pink or blue and could not be good for us.  The most unhealthy sweets are placed at the front of shops, near checkouts.  I am sure codes of conduct could help in this regard.<\/p><p>In terms of exercise, physical education very much takes a back seat in the education system.  While we have some schools where sport is particularly strong, for example, in the many Dublin schools which focus on rugby, not every child is involved in the local GAA, athletics or soccer club.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan will be more familiar with this issue than I am.  However, some level of physical activity should be made compulsory and scheduled every day, rather than once or twice or week.  Adults need at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity each day, whereas children need 60 minutes of aerobic activity daily.  Exercise is habit forming and becomes easy to continue if one takes part in it every day, rather than sporadically.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, for coming before the House.  While I have always praised Leaders of the House, I regard Senator Cummins as the best Leader the Seanad has had on the basis that he has shown great flexibility in trying to introduce new initiatives.  This does not mean he and I have not been dug out of each other in the odd debate.  It is vital that this is the case as we would not be of any benefit to the political system if it were otherwise.  It is sad that initiatives of this nature go unnoticed as they demonstrate that democracy works.  I do not say this because there will be a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad in a few weeks.  These types of initiatives show that the Oireachtas, not only the Seanad, can be used as a successful vehicle for laundering, if one likes, a message from people who have knowledge of certain issues, for example, those who provided the House with information in the consultation phase, and passing it on to the relevant Minister and officials to ensure the correct steps are taken. <\/p><p>I congratulate all the members of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee and the Leader and thank the Minister of State. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800026#AA00300","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379520300,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  While the future of the House may be a little uncertain, one thing that is certain is that lifestyle affects one's health.  One of the key statistics in the report is that we know, without fear of contradiction, that 30% of common cancers are influenced by the way in which we live our lives.  As Senator MacSharry noted, one of the initiatives launched in this Seanad was the establishment of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  As a member of the committee, I embraced the initiative wholeheartedly and proposed this issue for discussion.  We did a good job and I am pleased the Minister of State has come before the House to discuss this extremely important topic.<\/p><p>This process came about as a result of a briefing Dr. Kate Allen, who works for the World Cancer Research Fund, gave to the Irish Cancer Society.  Dr. Allen spoke in such stark terms that I decided it was necessary to promote the message that we have some control over our lives.  This is not a matter for the Health Service Executive, Department of Health or someone else but for each and every one of us.  We must try to understand how to lead a healthier lifestyle.  As public representatives, we have a duty and responsibility to try to get this message across in a clear fashion.  The issue came before the Seanad Public Consultation Committee for this reason.  It will not be a surprise to those present that this report is probably one of the shortest reports ever presented to the Oireachtas.  My co-author, Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, and I both have experience in journalism and we deliberately decided to produce a short report.  We did so because we did not want to wrap up the report in another report or produce a document that no one could get at.  It needs to be clear that the report makes simple recommendations, all of which are achievable.  We had a good debate on which of the recommendations made by witnesses we would choose and we chose those we believed could be achieved by this Government.  <\/p> <p>One or two of them are obviously more controversial than others, not least the restriction on the price of alcohol that Senator MacSharry mentioned.  However, in the main many of them are very practical.  What is the point in getting bogged down in another report by another group?  We have more statistics than we know what to do with.  I suggest part of the dilemma in the current debate on cancer is that the public is getting confused.  There are many scare stories about cancer on the one hand and how many people will get cancer and so forth.  There is confusion about the effect of drinking a glass of wine, or eating a bar of chocolate, nuts or porridge.  People are getting consumed and confused by that.  One of our key responsibilities was to lay out our recommendations for Government in a very clear way and I hope we have done that.  I hope anybody picking up the report can read it very quickly and get a grasp of the scale of the challenge facing us.<\/p><p>I welcome the health strategy launched in March.  I attended the launch and found it very impressive.  It is a very wide-ranging long-term strategy.  We can launch as many strategies as we like, but the implementation of the strategy is what should concern us.  I am delighted to see an interdepartmental group involving the Departments of Health, and Transport, Tourism and Sport to encourage people to be more physically active, which is what we need.  As Senator MacSharry said, not everybody in school likes hurling, soccer, football or whatever, but children spend a considerable amount of time in school every day.  Even if they could run around during the day, it would be a help.<\/p><p>I had the pleasure of welcoming the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, to Sligo last week.  We visited a girls' school in Collooney where the area for running around is small.  The main road to Ballina passes in front of the school and is very dangerous.  Those 50 or 55 students are very constrained in the amount of running around they can do.  They are not alone.  Some time ago we threw out the value of physical education of literally running around even if it is in an unstructured way.  One practical thing we could resume doing is having children being able to run around during the school day and not relying on parents having to take them to something else after school to ensure they get the exercise they need.<\/p><p>We often criticise the HSE, which is very easy to do given that it has many problems.  However, we are certainly blessed with the people who work there and in the many organisations associated with health and health-care provision in Ireland.  They have been screaming that we have a problem in the country and voicing concern, particularly over obesity.  One of the recent briefings was entitled &quot;Childhood Obesity Catastrophe in Ireland: Time to Face the Inaction&quot;.  Many people who attended that briefing made the points the Minister of State will have heard previously about childhood obesity.  If the health-care professionals are calling it a catastrophe and referring to inaction, we should be doing more to bring home the message to parents, children, single people and older people that lifestyle is a major contributory factor.  During that briefing we were surprised to learn the relationship between the consumption of alcohol and the incidence of breast cancer in women.  Many people did not know or realise that and yet it appears to have drifted into the ether along with all the other things.<\/p><p>It is about informing the public and having a campaign and strategy that is rooted in education and information and not frightening people.  I was impressed by the Irish Cancer Society's new strategy statement, Towards a Future without Cancer.  It concentrates on the idea that we could have a future without cancer and a mission to eliminate cancer.  One of the speakers, Dr. John Seffrin from the US, mentioned a 68% survival rate for white men with cancer in the United States heading for 80%.<\/p> <p>The message he was trying to get across was that we need not be afraid of this in the way we were 20 years ago.  In Ireland, we still are in the stage of being afraid, and all the statistics refer to the fear and terror and its rise, as well as the numbers who are dying every day, hour and week.  This is the kind of thing that almost paralyses people and prevents them from taking control of their lives.  Consequently, one returns repeatedly to the need for this to be about people taking charge of their lives and how the Government can link into that.  If health care professionals are terrifically concerned and wish to become involved, Members have a duty to listen and deliver on that.<\/p><p> Although they were present at the time, it probably is worth reading into the record the groups who appeared to give evidence to the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  Moreover, such was their concern that they also attended the launch of the report.  I refer to the Nutrition and Health Foundation, the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute, the Alcohol Forum, the Irish Cancer Society, the national cancer control programme, the Institute of Public Health in Ireland, the Alcohol Action Ireland group, the health promotion research centre in NUI Galway, ASH Ireland, the World Cancer Research Fund, which of course sparked the discussion in the first instance, and <i>safe<\/i>food.  These are all the key people involved.  All these groups attended and I note they sent their senior people to both the meeting and the launch.<\/p><p> My request is that the obesity group really should be the cancer group and should not concentrate solely on obesity.  While I do not wish to reduce its importance, it should be extended to include alcohol and tobacco and should be turned into a task force on cancer, which would then have all the additional benefits of people being healthier in respect of many other conditions such as diabetes, to give one example.<\/p><p> I am delighted the Minister of State is present and that Members are having this debate.  I thank the Leader of the House for encouraging and supporting the Seanad Public Consultation Committee in respect of this initiative.  This is the kind of work the Seanad can do well because its Members have that space and some expertise on which they can call, as well as being able to take the time to frame it properly.  As a public representative, I take this matter very seriously and I would like to believe the current Administration, led by the Department of Health in tandem perhaps with the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Education and Skills, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, can have a role in stating that a foundation is being laid down for a strong approach to giving responsibility to people to feel there is a future without cancer and that they will be supported to make this first step towards living a healthier lifestyle.  While it is not easy, it certainly can be done.  One hopes some of these recommendations will not be put on the shelf but will be used and considered over time and that everyone can benefit from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800028#CC00200","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379520900,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I must admit I knew very little about the fact that this process was taking place or the consultations it involved.

I may be feeling a little cynical today but I want this process to be something other than people sitting around and basking in the glow of a feel-good factor of making platitudinous statements about the way the world should be.  We are not like a boy scout club but Members of what is still one half of the national Parliament.  We have here with us a Minister of State who sits at one of the highest tables in government.  We can do stuff rather than just talk about it.  Let us do a quick report card on some of things that can be done that have come up in my two and a half years in the House.<\/p><p>  As the Minister of State may know, I am a cancer expert in my day job, but first things first.  We proposed legislation a year and three quarters ago to ban smoking in cars in which there were children, and there was great support for it inside and outside the House.  It had one of its primary effects which was to lead to debate on the issue of smoking in cars where children were present.  It had an educational effect in that people who did not realise the exact level of danger to which they were subjecting small children when they smoked cigarettes in a car with them present, would modify their behaviour.  For the first time this became something people talked about.  I am very sad, however, that this legislation is jammed somewhere in the bureaucracy of the Department of Health.  We originally thought it would be in place before summer 2012.  We did not get it in place before summer 2013 and I am not sure when it will be in place at this stage, but I know that the Minister of State, his senior colleague and a few others, by twisting the right arms and greasing the right elbows, can make this happen very quickly, and we can get it out of the way.  <\/p><p>  I have to be careful about this because the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is the best qualified and the best Minister for Health we have had for some time.  I also believe he has been dealt awful cards and is trying to forge a reform programme at a time when reform programmes are difficult to forge.  I know he has the real will to tackle the problem.  However, we must be blunt about this, the only smoking legislation the Government has passed in the current Oireachtas is legislation to make it easier to sell cigarettes.  That is it.  The only legislation that has come through was the legislation the Government was forced to introduce to comply with the European Court of Justice and the European directives ending the fixing of lower prices for tobacco, which effectively meant that the Government was making it easier for the companies to sell tobacco products.  I am not saying this happened for any reason other than for the fact that the Government's hands were forced into doing it.  To try to redress that balance, one would think that the Government would give a very high priority to passing some legislation that would curtail the smoking habit.  <\/p><p>  We cannot have this discussion today and not acknowledge the appalling situation that arose when the Prime Minister of this country and several of his senior Ministers met, in flagrant violation of international conventions about the way that Government should deal with the tobacco industry, for a private session with the tobacco industry, which ostensibly was to discuss some issues which might have had some fiscal and economic concern but were in fact used, as we now know, by the tobacco industry, through the agency of a PR company that was well connected to the senior party of the Government, to enable it to get a message across to the Government, articulating its opposition to the Minister's laudable proposal to introduce plain packaging and other measures.  This was wrong.   <\/p><p>  For us to sit here and say we are all getting together to talk about how we can modify lifestyle to reduce cancer while we are not passing legislation which would make it harder to smoke in cars with children and are facilitating the input of the tobacco industry in meeting the senior in the Government, is pure and simple hypocrisy.  That is the only way to describe it.  We need to have a clear, unequivocal <i>mea culpa<\/i> rub of the soap on the soul from the Taoiseach and the senior Ministers apologising to the people of this country for having had that meeting and acknowledging that it was, at worst, a major error.<br \/> Malignant melanoma, the least common but most fatal form of skin cancer, is a particular horror disease.  The incidence of malignant melanoma in Ireland between 1998 and 2008 went up from 400 to 800 cases and between 2008 and last year it went up from 800 to approximately 1,100 cases.  This is entirely due to the fact that we were designed by God to live under grey, misty, cloudy skies.  Our skin colour and skin defences against the sun are not adequate to give us good protection when we get higher levels of sunlight and we now get the higher levels of sunlight for reasons relating to travel, etc.  It is a real problem in Ireland.  The cancer, which according to the international legislature is considered an uncommon cancer, is a relatively common cancer in Ireland.  We are probably looking at 300 to 400 deaths per year in Ireland if current trends continue over the next few years, which would put it in the same league, although somewhat fewer, in terms of the number of deaths as breast cancer.  It is a disease which disproportionately affects younger people, so what can we do?  <\/p><p>  The first thing we need to do is to introduce legislation to deal with the use of sunbeds.  Rather than talking, waffling and sprouting rameis about telling people to cut down on their calories, which is important, we have it in our power in this House to bring in legislation to severely curtail and possibly to ban sunbed use, certainly to ban sunbed use by people who are under the age of 18, and to have the strictest of controls over the way sunbed services are delivered in this country.  Parenthetically, I also mentioned that it was not about setting up a bureaucracy called the NCCP, or about centralising or saying we will make the tractors here and deliver them locally the way that was done in the Urals.  I was probably too late for that comment to have any impact on the Minister, Deputy Noonan, who is the individual who deserves the most credit in the history of this country for improving cancer services.  This is about appointing a few extra doctors whereby people could see a doctor who was a cancer specialist.  It was the Minister, Deputy Noonan, who - I say this in the best spirit, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery - lifted a line from a speech of mine in 1994 in which I said there were hospitals in this country to which I would not let a relative of mine go if they had cancer.  The Minister acted on that and he set about trying to appoint people.  I probably approached the Minister too late in the budgetary cycle last year to remove VAT from sunblock products.  Sunblock is currently taxed as if it is a discretionary cosmetic item, but it is a medicinal item.  If we are serious about reducing the incidence of skin cancer and cancers in general in this country, there is no way around it.  We have to tackle the problems of melanoma and sunbeds.  We cannot block people from going on sun holidays although we can educate them .  We can tackle the use of sunbeds with the speedy introduction of legislation and we can drop VAT from sunblock.<\/p><p>  What of alcohol?  It is a strange phenomena that this Chamber, probably uniquely in the world, allows three different groups of alcohol vendors to be nominating bodies for one half of our national Parliament.  I understand there are complex historical reasons for that, but it is not appropriate.  In the event that the Seanad is preserved, I would hope that there would be a commitment from the Government to introduce reform, along the lines of my Bill, which would take these rather obscure nominating bodies out of the way and completely democratise not only the electoral process but the nomination process.  We need to have a really serious think about alcohol.  We have to understand that everybody who makes their living selling alcohol is our adversary in public health.<\/p> <p>They are not our partners.  They are our adversaries.  Like many people, I enjoy a drink.  I am not being personal or moral about it.  I am saying that as a point of public policy, our goal as a society is to reduce alcohol consumption.  Their goal is to sell more alcohol.  Regardless of how these companies try to couch their activities, for example, in terms of quasi-governed responsibility partnership campaigns, they are there for one reason.  If my pension fund was tied up in businesses involved in flogging booze, I would not want them to do anything else.  We should not see them as partners.  We should see them as our adversaries and we should curtail their activities.  Our business is to put them out of business - pure and simple - and that is what we should be aiming to do.  We need to examine, independently of the alcohol industry, the way we govern the alcohol problem in this country.  We should encourage no drinking, or else responsible drinking.  We cannot believe that these people are our partners in this initiative.<\/p><p>I would like to list some of the things that would happen if we all stopped drinking.  Liver disease would become uncommon.  Five or six of the most common cancers would become substantially less common.  Waiting lists in our health service would probably disappear.  Our accident and emergency units would be much more manageable.  Far more discretionary money would be available to families to spend on their children's food, clothing, education and cultural activities, etc.  Parents would have far more time for parenting their children, rather than spending their time drinking.  All of the arguments in favour of taking action in this area are overwhelming.  One of the big arguments relates to cancer.<\/p><p>It is important to transmit the right message with regard to diet and obesity.  It is easy for us to pick targets from some obscure part of the foreign chemical industry that makes food additives or trans fats.  We sometimes tend to forget that this country's biggest obesity problems do not necessarily come from eating bad foods; they come from eating too much food.  I probably take 20 dietary histories a week in the course of my day job.  They provide overwhelming evidence that many people are struggling with their weight not because they eat nachos with cheese, etc. - although many of them do - but because they eat too much bread, too many potatoes, too much sugar and too many scones, etc.  We need to have a serious think about the implications it will have for certain parts of our own food industry when we start having a serious think about tackling food.<\/p><p>I compliment my colleagues for introducing this initiative.  If it is a case of aphoristic waffle delivered in a fairly empty Chamber, getting no coverage and with no actual action coming from it, I suggest it will provide yet another soundbite for the &quot;abolish the Seanad&quot; campaign.  When the Minister of State leaves this House today, I ask him to focus on getting the Protection of Children&rsquo;s Health from Tobacco Smoke Bill 2012 passed, on bringing further legislation through to tighten up on tobacco in general, on regulating sunbeds and banning their use by young children and on ensuring next month's budget provides for sunblock products to be subject to no VAT or the medicinal rate of VAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800031#FF00100","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379521800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I thank him for his observations  I am glad he has agreed to get his officials to look at the recommendations made in the Seanad Public Consultation Committee report, which focuses on how lifestyle changes can prevent approximately one third of all cancers.  As Members have said, the committee was established by the 24th Seanad at the suggestion of the Independent Members who were nominated by the Taoiseach.  The committee has published a number of excellent reports, some of which have already been acted on by the Government.  Action is certainly needed in other cases.<\/p><p>This is a short report, as Senator O'Keeffe mentioned.  It recommends that certain actions be taken.  We believe the recommendations in the report should be acted on and we hope they will be.  I always listen to what Senator Crown has to say about health matters, particularly with regard to cancer.  The Protection of Children&rsquo;s Health from Tobacco Smoke Bill 2012, which he introduced along with Senator Daly, has been the subject of a long delay.  I understand the Department contacted the Senators not long ago to ask them for final comments on the Bill that the Government intends to introduce.  I hope the legislation in question will be brought before the Seanad, given that the idea was initiated by Members of this House.<\/p><p>I do not mean to be facetious when I say I am glad the reform proposals for the other House that have been announced, and which were mentioned by Senator MacSharry, provide for a system that will mirror this House's public consultation system, which allows us to study and advise on public policy matters.  That is to be welcomed.  The report before the House was compiled following some extremely informative and deliberate sessions in this House.  As Senator O'Keeffe said, the committee engaged with people who work at the coalface.  It was harrowing to listen to some of the statistics regarding various cancers and the effect they have on people.  We all learned a great deal from these extremely informative sessions.  I join other Senators in thanking all of the individuals and organisations that made an excellent input into this report.<\/p><p>Cancer is a disease that affects almost every family in the country in one way or another.  The Seanad Public Consultation Committee strongly felt that it was worthwhile to identify simple everyday actions that individuals could take to prevent the onset of cancer.  Smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption have been revealed as the three key areas in which lifestyle changes can prevent the incidence of cancer.  The committee believes the Government must take a lead in highlighting the research revealed in this report and in driving change through appropriate policy-making and legislation.  For example, some 85% of all cases of lung cancer in the Irish population relate to tobacco.  The Seanad Public Consultation Committee report recommends the banning of cigarette vending machines and the introduction of a ban on smoking on all educational campuses.  We believe such measures would go some way towards preventing the onset of lung disease because they would stop people from starting to smoke at an early age.<\/p><p>The child obesity figures were also telling.  There are over 30,000 obese children in Ireland, which is a staggering figure.  I was shocked to learn that the number of obese children is increasing by an average of 10,000 per annum and that the cost to the State of dealing with people with health complications arising from the obesity epidemic is over &euro;4 billion.  Those figures certainly put this problem into perspective.  Immediate action needs to be taken to educate children and their parents on the importance of nutrition and physical activities.  A focus on self-esteem is also required.<\/p><p>The alcohol problem that exists in Ireland is a regular issue of concern in this House.  We have discussed it with the Minister of State previously.  One of the most startling facts to be revealed through the public consultation process was that drinking between three and six standard drinks each day significantly increases the risk of cancer of the breast, liver, mouth, throat, oesophagus and bowel.  We might have thought there was a link between alcohol consumption and liver, mouth and throat cancer, but we were shocked to learn that the other cancers might be linked to the over-use of alcohol.<\/p> <p>There is an opportunity now for the Government to increase awareness of the link between alcohol and these awful illnesses, via the regulation of alcohol marketing and the introduction of alcohol labelling legislation, which would require products containing alcohol to include warnings about cancer.  I would also welcome any other appropriate measures from the Department of Health, the HSE and other publicly-funded organisations, such as the publication of leaflets by the HSE, television or radio campaigns or an Internet campaign which would outline simple lifestyle changes such as those advocated in this public consultation report.  These would help our people become aware of the necessary changes that can be made to prevent cancer.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and hope we see action on this report and on legislation like that put forward by Senator Crown.  I hope too that we have a speedy introduction of the legislation necessary to combat this dreadful disease.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800032#GG00200","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379522400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is good to be here to debate and discuss this report which though short, is heavy in content in terms of the actions and proposals it puts forward.  This is what such documents should be like.  I commend the authors, the committee on its hearings and all of the experts and individuals who took part in the consultation process and thank them for their input.<\/p><p>The starting point in solving any problem is the acceptance of the fact we have a problem.  We are at that position in regard to cancer and the causes of it because of the significant research that has been carried out in recent years.  The facts are indisputable that obesity, alcohol and what we eat all play a part in terms of the levels and incidence of cancer in our State.  The figures are startling - one in four people in this State will get cancer.  The report states that by 2030, twice as many people in the State as now will have cancer.  This is because of our ageing population and population growth.  However, it is appalling to think we will have twice as many people suffering from cancer.  This is a human tragedy that will be traumatic for these individuals and their families, but it will also place a huge financial burden on the State and our health services.<\/p><p>It is obvious that the best place to start dealing with this is by trying to prevent cancer developing initially.  Significant research has been done on treatment for cancer patients, which is fantastic and we need investment in that area to ensure people get the best treatment.  However, we should invest as much again in preventive measures.  The report acknowledges that we have not invested as much as we should in prevention, in raising awareness, in education and other areas.<\/p><p>I would like to mention some sections of the report which merit comment, beginning with the section on smoking.  When we look back at what the previous Government did, we can look with horror on much of what was done.  However, one good initiative was the introduction of the smoking ban.  There was significant political pressure on the Government at the time and a huge lobby against the introduction of that ban.  It was a big challenge for the then Government electorally, particularly smokers, to follow through on the commitment and to put the ban in place.  The question we must ask ourselves now is whether anybody would want to see that decision reversed.  I am sure the majority of people would say &quot;No&quot;.  I believe that even those who were completely against the ban would now see the benefits and would not want the decision reversed.  The same applies to many of the recommendations in this report.  It will take political courage to follow through on them and it will be necessary for the Government, all parties and the political system to face down strong lobbies from the cigarette industry and the alcohol industry.<\/p><p>I am sure the Minister faces such opposition in regard to the proposals on alcohol prevention and reduction in the report commissioned by his Department.  I was a member of the health committee for two years and was involved in drafting the all-party report published by the committee some years ago.  Many recommendations were made by that committee, including one on pricing.  I dissented on the issue of minimum pricing, not because I do not believe pricing plays a part in reducing consumption - I think it does and evidence says it does - but because of my concern that the introduction of minimum pricing would not solve the problem but would bolster the profits of the people who provide alcohol.  I wanted reassurance from the Government and those who propose minimum pricing that this would not be the case, but that has not happened so far.  I still do not know exactly how minimum pricing would work.  Many people argued at the committee that if we were minded to use pricing as an instrument to reduce consumption, we should look at increasing excise duty on alcohol.  In that case the money would come straight to the State and Government coffers and should then be ringfenced for the type of work recommended in this report regarding raising awareness, education and prevention measures in each area.  If the Government is going to use pricing as an instrument, there must be a dividend and that money must be ringfenced so as to ensure that recommendations in this report will be implemented.<\/p><p>The all-party proposals on alcohol consumption contained many other proposals, such as on the issue of sponsorship for sporting organisations, but a different Oireachtas committee came up with a different analysis and set of proposals.  Again, there was strong lobbying done in this regard.  There is significant lobbying done by the alcohol industry and I saw this for myself when a member of the committee.  Hard lobbying is conducted to prevent the Government from doing what is right in these areas and from coming up with measures and proposals that should be implemented.  However, if our proposals were implemented, we would be in the same situation as we are now with regard to the smoking ban and could look back and ask why this was not done earlier or why there was not debate on the issues earlier.  This is something we should consider.<\/p><p>With regard to the proposals relating to children, I have a child of six and a child of two and was very interested in the question of what should be or should not be in a child's lunch box.  The challenge in this regard is to educate ourselves and parents about how we should eat, how we feed our children and how what they eat will impact on their health.  Even simple proposals such as banning junk food and vending machines in schools and workplaces are difficult to implement.  One would be amazed by the amount of opposition there is to even the simplest of proposals such as this.<\/p><p>There is a responsibility on the political system - all parties - to face up to our responsibilities in these areas.  If we are genuine about wanting to reduce the levels and incidence of cancer, we must take tough decisions.  We must face down the vested interests and show courage and support each other.  We in the Opposition must support the Government when it takes the right decisions on these issues rather than support it for selfish, political reasons.  I hope that is how this will play out.<\/p><p>I call on the Minister of State to respond on some of the questions I have raised and to outline what actions he intends to take on board from this document and will implement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800033#HH00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1379522400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will be called upon to reply in five minutes.

The majority of cancers are caused by smoking, alcohol consumption, unhealthy food consumption or obesity.<\/p> <p>As legislators, we should be attempting to influence people to make better choices while not restricting choices.  Ireland unquestionably has the highest incidence of cancer per head in the world.  We must examine this issue with some urgency.  I agree with Senator Crown on sun beds.  It seems like a no-brainer and I would be interested in the Minister of State's reply.<\/p><p>There are some indisputable facts as regards smoking.  For example, it causes 85% of all lung cancers and one third of all other cancers.  Tackling this matter must be our main focus.  I am something of a hard-liner and would go as far as banning cigarettes from the country, although this could cause other problems.  Plain packaging has been introduced effectively in Australia.  It is argued that plain packaging would not work in Ireland or would help counterfeiting.  If it was implemented correctly, it could actually reduce counterfeiting through the use of proper taxation marks, thereby showing whether cigarettes are legitimate.  This should be possible without any difficulty.  According to the majority of independent studies, plain packaging has been successful in Australia, has not led to a demonstrable increase in counterfeiting and has made smoking less appealing to young people.  Similarly, banning smoking on educational campuses would be a good idea.<\/p><p>The second matter on which we should focus is that of alcohol consumption.  I have done a great deal of work on this issue and people are blue in the face listening to me discussing it.  It is serious for a variety of reasons, not least the issue under discussion today.  The implementation of minimum floor pricing for alcohol seems relatively straightforward, although we will be presented with all sorts of difficulties by lobbyists.  We should fight the issue.<\/p><p>A third focus should be that of diet, although this issue can be belittled.  Senator Crown mentioned something along the lines of calories being listed on menus, etc.  Other issues are seen as being more important in this context.  However, the incidence of cancer is much increased among people with unhealthy diets.  Education is key, as Senator Cullinane mentioned.  Recently, a mother told me that she put Actimel in her child's lunch box, but Actimel contains five or seven spoons of sugar, which is ridiculous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800033#HH00400","speaker":"1153","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379523000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>The Senator has used three out of the five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800034#JJ00200","speaker":"1152"},{"type":"speech","time":1379523000,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I would like to say loads more, but the fourth matter on which we should focus is obesity.

This is an incredible number.  As legislators, we should be fighting to make these seemingly simple and small changes.  Taken together in a macro view, they can cause significant improvements in the health and well being of our citizens in the short and long terms.  While we can put these matters on the long finger and cave under lobbying from each industry, now is the time to take cognisance of the larger picture and take brave decisions.

I welcome the Minister of State.  The Leader welcomed the call for action, which reminded me of how I presented a Private Member's motion in November two years ago regarding the points for life initiative and physical activity in schools.  The night before the debate was to take place, the Government asked me to change one word.  There were nine amendments to my motion.  The word was \"action\".  The Government wanted to replace it with \"explore\".  I remember thinking that \"explore\" could mean anything and that, even if we looked into the issue, would we deliver on it?  I hope that there will be action on this matter.<\/p><p>Almost two years later, my points for life initiative only got up and running in a couple of schools this month.  If I had my way as a legislator and as someone with a background in sports and ongoing experience of coaching young people, I would have points for life initiated in 70% or 80% of schools.  I understand that certain factions are opposed to my ideas for imposing initiatives on schools.<\/p><p>Lifestyle changes can reduce cancer rates, obesity and tobacco use.  Unfortunately, the public are not taking any action despite the information and statistics that have been passed on to them.<\/p><p>Cancers stemming from lifestyle are self-inflicted as far as adults are concerned.  Cancer in young children is not caused by lifestyle.  I spent last weekend with Fionnbar and Elma Walsh, parents of a young boy who died of cancer only a few months ago.  His choice was to live.  He passed on a message about suicide to young people.  It has made a significant difference.  The Walshs' main concern when it comes to cancer is not about lifestyle, but about the amount of money invested in research into preventing cancer among young children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800034#JJ00400","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speech","time":1379523000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has ten minutes to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800034#JJ00500","speaker":"1152"},{"type":"speech","time":1379523000,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I did not realise that I had as many as ten minutes.

The report identifies all of the key areas involved.  Senator Noone was curious as to our response to the various recommendations.  I will not go through each response, but I reflected on most in the course of my speech.  Regarding the report's general recommendations, for example, the calls on the Minister for Health to develop a national physical activity plan for all age groups that includes cycling and walking schemes, to ensure the activity plan is central to urban and rural planning and to concentrate on the local level when encouraging significant lifestyle change, the Healthy Ireland initiative is where all of this should happen.  We need to pull together all of the agencies.  I understand Senator Eamonn Coghlan's frustration at being told to replace \"action\" with \"explore\".  Such requests can be disappointing.  It may surprise the House, but this is a frustration that I have encountered as a Minister of State.  One wants actions to be taken quickly, but there often seems to be a good reason for doing something and ten for not doing it.<\/p><p>Progress can be made.  Issues such as alcohol can grow so large each time we discuss them that we lose the opportunity to get a grip on them.  If we take initiatives such as the one achieved by Senator Eamonn Coghlan, even if they are just pilot projects in schools, at least we have made a start.  The Senator can point to what has been achieved in two, six or eight schools.  He and people who agree with him are in a much better position to point to what they have already done and ask for it to be done in all schools.  I have probably become something of an incrementalist in my middle age.  Many of us would like to see initiatives being taken quickly, but if a trail can be laid and people can show that a certain amount has been achieved, they can achieve much more.<\/p><p>There is a manifest link between smoking and cancer.  The Minister for Health will comment further on a smoking policy in the coming weeks.  I hope he will also be able to say more to Senator Crown and others regarding the legislation sponsored by the Senator regarding smoking in cars.<\/p><p>In terms of obesity, I must revert to the Healthy Ireland framework, although not just to point Senators to that document.<\/p> <p>The Healthy Ireland development is a real policy initiative and there are really good people involved.  I thank Senator O'Keeffe for pointing out the number of committed people behind this initiative who want to see it work.  They do not just see it as a document that they have managed to complete, they are now taking this matter up and running with it.  Dr. O'Keeffe in particular is leading on it in the HSE and is very committed to it.  All the agencies are being pulled together, not just the Department of Health.<\/p><p> While it is a terrible clich&eacute;, health is too important to be left to the Department of Health.  It ranges across all the areas that Members here have already mentioned, including the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, local authorities, statutory agencies, public parks and bike trails.  All these areas must be brought together to ensure that we have a real set of policies to achieve our aim.  <\/p><p> As colleagues know, I am dealing with the alcohol issue.  I wish to thank Senators for their various contributions and support in this regard.  I do not wish to single out any Members in particular but I do wish to thank Senator Cullinane for the support he has offered.  I would like to have an opportunity to discuss minimum unit pricing.  I am persuaded of the value of minimum unit pricing for alcohol.  Everybody agrees that pricing is the key factor, it is just that there is a disagreement between the use of minimum unit pricing or excise.  Minimum unit pricing targets alcohol that is cheap relative to its strength.  Excise, however, puts up the price of all alcohol.  It is difficult, although not impossible, to distinguish different types of alcohol for excise which is a fairly blunt instrument.  Excise will increase the price all around, but is that what Senators want to do, or do they wish to target the alcohol that is cheap relative to its strength?<\/p><p> We are garnering evidence from Canada, including British Columbia and Saskatchewan.  They are comparable areas that have introduced minimum unit pricing, so we can demonstrate to colleagues the value and evidence-base of minimum unit pricing.  We should consider taking that route.  Such proposals, along with those on marketing and sponsorship, are before the Government.  I would hope the decisions will be forthcoming within weeks rather than months, but it is a matter for the Government.  <\/p><p> There is genuine disagreement among colleagues on sponsorship and marketing but I wish to draw the attention of the House to a report on sponsorship that was published within the last two weeks.  It is relevant and appeared in the learned journal <i>Alcohol and Alcoholism<\/i>.  We need to understand that increasing proportions of marketing budgets now go on sponsorship rather than advertising.  Many people seem to think that sponsorship is benign.  They may think that advertising is the hardcore activity and that sponsorship just involves a company putting up its logo.  However, the evidence increasingly shows that it is vastly more sophisticated and that the impact is much more significant.  <\/p><p> Last week's remarkable study concerned a frequency analysis of alcohol marketing in televised English professional football.  The study identified an average of 111 visual references and two verbal references to alcohol per hour of broadcasting.  Nearly all visual references were to beer products and were primarily simple logos or branding.  The majority of verbal alcohol references were related to title sponsorship of competitions.  A total of 17 formal alcohol commercials were identified accounting for less than 1% of the total broadcast time.  Therefore the balance is shifting quickly between the spend on what we would regard as traditional advertising and on sponsorship.  The conclusion is that visual alcohol references in televised top-class English football matches are common, with an average of nearly two per minute.  Verbal references are rare and formal alcohol commercials account for less than 1% of broadcast time.  Restriction of all alcohol sports sponsorship, as seen for tobacco, may be justified according to the authors of that study.<\/p><p> We cannot put together a package of measures on alcohol without seriously addressing the issues of marketing and sponsorship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800034#JJ00900","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1379523600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I must ask the Minister of State to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800035#KK00200","nonspeaker":"Acting Chairman (Senator Imelda Henry)"},{"type":"speech","time":1379523600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>The link between alcohol and cancer is undeniable.

They will not learn this through technology or the &quot;X Factor&quot;.  One of the most radical and extraordinary thinkers in education was Neil Postman.  He believed that for education to be meaningful, young people, their parents and teachers must have a common narrative.  The question I put to those Senators who have turned up for this debate is &quot;Do we have a common narrative?&quot;  If we do, how could the Department of Education and Skills, when the History Teachers Association disagrees so vehemently, change history from a core subject to a discrete subject in the junior cycle?  There are many false gods of modern education lurking around and trying to get attention.  One of them is economic utility.  Others include consumerism; technology - a type of plug-in messiah wiring schools for personal computers; multiculturalism, when we should be talking about diversity; and a list of aspirational verbs when we should be talking about the &quot;how&quot; of great teaching and training.  There are many other bogus objectives but few &quot;hows&quot; in all of these pamphlets.<\/p><p>  We have not for a long time had a conversation in this country on the types of subject or knowledge that are fundamental to a quality of life and others which are not.  If we did have a real conversation about this, history would not be becoming a discrete subject, music would be compulsory up to 18 years, the arts would be examinable, formed and standardised and not a parallel of the television, and dance would probably be a core subject.  Most of all, as we are a talking people and speech is our greatest need and means of communication, aurality would be an independent subject with the foundation of human and vocal communication and engagement.  Amidst all of this, the National Council for Curriculum Assessment has created the most outstanding and, might I say, incredible statements of learning for the new changed junior cycle.  These statements arise out of a core concept of innovation and identity within that cycle.  The statements of learning include words like &quot;communicates&quot;, &quot;reaches&quot;, &quot;creates&quot;, &quot;appreciates&quot;, &quot;critically interprets&quot;, &quot;recognises&quot;, &quot;uses&quot;, &quot;describes&quot;, &quot;illustrates&quot;, &quot;predicts&quot;, &quot;improves&quot;, &quot;values&quot;, &quot;learns&quot;, &quot;understands&quot;, &quot;makes&quot; and &quot;takes&quot;.  There are 24 statements of learning in all.  Two verbs have been omitted, namely, &quot;imagines&quot; and &quot;feels&quot;.  Imagination has its own rewards and to feel we have to be able to think.  I believe &quot;feel&quot; and &quot;imagine&quot; should have been given an airing.  Some subjects will lock into some of these aspirations and others will lock easily into others.  However, great subjects do them all.  The study of history does not involve just one, two, three or four of the aspirational verbs, values and recognitions but all of them.  How it is possible to justify art forms or core fundamental knowledge to this formula?  It is not possible to get knowledge to fit a formula regardless of how aspirational the formulaic the verbs.  Knowledge is its own reward.  The NCCA should have argued the brilliance of subjects and the &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; of them.  <\/p><p>  In the midst of all this aspiration and valuing innovation and identity, history is to become a discrete subject, a short course choice.  Short courses do not work for young minds.  Young minds need joined-up education.  That is how their minds are engaged.  They only work at mature and postgraduate level, as anybody who knows anything about teaching knows.  The only areas the students at DCU learned were their core modules, the ones that lasted for two years.  The short courses became a kind of entertainment.  Young minds need a broad sweep of history and a defined and lengthy foundation block to encourage the study of the subject later or it will become the preserve of the elite.  According to Diarmuid Ferriter, all children have a public ownership of history and a public ownership of their own history.  It can never become the right of the elite.<\/p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills is in my opinion re-aligning, repositioning, downgrading, cupboarding and cloaking history behind what it calls a discrete subject.  <i>Discretus<\/i> means separated or set apart - the very educational concept we are supposed to be trying to avoid.  I will elaborate on why this is completely wrong specifically, and fundamentally wrong generally.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, Mr. Gerard Hanlon, president of the History Teachers Association of Ireland, Catriona Crowe and Diarmuid Ferriter, who must have some clue about what they are talking about, said that every child has an entitlement to history, not as a dip-in and out facility.  History education is the entitlement of every child.  The Department of Education and Skills cannot say that young people will get this entitlement from a short course: they will not.  History is more important than most subjects.  It is our heritage.  It explains ourselves to us in that it tells us who we are, what we are, how we are and why we are.  As pointed out by Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, it creates citizens not consumers.  That is all we need to know about it.  That is all the justification we need, not 24 statements of learning.<\/p><p>  Why did the NCCA not argue on that basis?  History is a discipline not an entertainment.  It is a skill, a crafted knowledge, a form, a learning, a thought process, a language, a memory, a fact, an evidence, an interpretation and a culture.  It is our lives, a life, the local, the national, the international.  It is our place.  It is the reason we live the way we do.  It is beyond essential for all young adults beginning life in the middle school cycle.  In addition, history is taught by specialist teachers.  What happens when it becomes a short course, short module or a choice rather than a core subject?  It becomes less coherent.  It becomes more represented in the middle class areas and less represented in working class areas where subjects considered more useful and easier will take its place thereby becoming the preserve of the elite.  History as a short course in the junior cycle will not be studied at leaving certificate level or at university or third leaving, thus the numbers of teachers in the system will fall.  They fell considerably when the subject was removed from the core curriculum in the UK.  Discussion is now taking place in the UK on how to bring it back.  <\/p><p>  We are so busy copying New Zealand, Queensland and Finland.  Why do we not lead the way?  If one wants to reform the junior cycle there are many other changes that can be made.  I am not against change.  However, this change has not been thought out.  If change is what is required, music should become compulsory for every child.  Then we would have a skill, love, passion, creative activity, maths, history, sound, score and melody all in one.  Imagine that?  Therein are statements of learning.  The Irish Chamber Orchestra is doing this in Limerick.  Why do we not copy what it is doing?  That would be something worth copying.  Why are we applauding fragments of knowledge?  That is what short courses are.  We do not need short courses, we need educational revolution and an educational rethink.  If the history syllabus is over-laden with content and that is the greatest reason for the decline in the number of pupils taking history between junior and leaving certificate level, then throw it into fresh combinations, use imagination, creativity and do not relegate it to choice and short courses.  Re-examine the subject and hold it as a core.  Ms Catriona Crowe called all of this what it is, &quot;the greatest elephant in the room.&quot;  She asked why we bother having core subjects at all.  Why do we bother regarding some subjects as essential and fundamental to the rights to knowledge for all young people?  Why not teach the <i>Beano<\/i>?  <\/p><p>  Some knowledges must be compulsory.  Maths, English, the arts and languages are not disposable and cannot be disposed of or shortened.  Why does it accepted that history can be?  Is it because it is difficult or hard?  Perhaps, it takes up too much time and requires reading, writing, study and memory and we cannot have that.  It is the very thing we need now more than ever.  History is not cut and paste.  It is not Internet, 500 channels, Facebook, Twitter and all that other nonsense of the great technological revolution information highway, the tablets of Moses turned Apple.  Technology may be the mechanics of the brain but history is the mind.  It is evidence and informed thought.  It is outside the garbage of the information highway, the antithesis of the lies on the Internet, the tabloid press, the glut and garbage of saturated information.  It is the counteraction against immediacy.  It is evaluation, real resource and reasoning.  It is primary sources, arduous debate, politics, democracy and lack of it.  Unlike the Internet garbage information glut, it teaches that there are no easy answers.  Catriona Crowe asked if we really wanted to live in a country where many children over the age of 12 know nothing of their history?  Are they to know about De Valera and Collins through film?  As I said earlier, just as we are about to remove history as a core subject, the UK is putting it back on its curriculum as a core subject.<\/p> <p>There is a craziness in that proposition.  If we argue that history is not a core subject, it is not based on an educational argument.  Why argue that one subject should compete against other subjects?  To do this is to argue that core knowledge in any one area is of greater significance than in another area, which is not true.  This brings us back to the question as to why we should not teach the <i>Beano<\/i>.  The Minister, for whom I have the utmost respect, needs more advice.  Above all, he should invite some of the directors of the curriculum in England here to explain the reasons they decided to reinstate history as a core subject. <\/p><p> History must continue to be held in its rightful place.  If we are supposed to make young people more intelligent and smarter, the big question is how we can counteract technologies which are defining our progress and who we are, as human beings.  Do we ever question the effects of technology, technological innovation, millions of televisions, the Internet, the information highway and the interactive everything?  Do these things improve us?  No, we are lonelier and more isolated than ever.  Technology may be able to tell us how things work but can it tell us how to live?  Human progress does not necessarily mean technological progress.  What does more information to more people in more diverse forms solve?<\/p><p> We stake so much of human advancement on technological advancement while failing to raise enough educational questions about it.  Do we believe the Internet and the digital economy amount to liberation?  We have international pornography, the adultification of children, a glut of meaningless information and advertising and information as garbage.  We view the Internet as the centre of the world to which we turn for everything.  We are surrendering our culture to it and we are about to surrender education to it.  In doing so, we will also surrender history to it.  This is where history finds its force.<\/p><p> As a result of technology, we have a decline in literacy, socialisation and politics.  We are dependent on our schools to counteract these trends.  This cannot be achieved through short courses.  An outcry is needed about this from all teachers, not only history teachers.  The media have altered social responsibility, psychic habits and political processes.  We are dependent on subjects such as history to counteract incoherent meaninglessness.  We need it for perspective, to prepare students for what is ahead and to show them what has been.  The world's history is the world's judgment and without the former, young people will not have the latter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800036#LL00200","speaker":"1170","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379524800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I second the motion.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  I am proud to support the motion and I commend my colleague, Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, on her passionate speech.  This issue presents us with a serious philosophical challenge.  Much of the framework document for junior cycle is to be applauded and commended.  It is a radical, innovative and creative approach to learning, which offers flexibility and begins to see the student or pupil in terms of a process of lifelong learning that will not only empower young people, but could also create a dynamic model of citizenship.  The opportunity afforded schools and local communities to engage with the statements of learning could also have a profound impact. <\/p><p>Earlier today, as director of the Abbey Theatre, I met first-year students from Larkin Community College, the theatre's neighbour.  Of the 15 students I met, none had visited the Abbey Theatre previously.  We were humbled.  The theatre is working with the college on a pilot short course called &quot;Theatre and Citizenship&quot;.  Over the next six or seven weeks, both organisations will become richer in experience and connectivity because of the amazing young people who are engaging with us on their right to access the national theatre.  I am, therefore, one of the beneficiaries of innovation and identity in developing the new junior cycle. <\/p><p>As with any change, we need to strike a balance between theory, on the one hand, and practice and the Irish experience, on the other.  The motion is not about making anything compulsory.  On the issue of compulsory Irish, I blame the syllabus rather than compulsion for the bad experience many people had when learning the language.  The purpose of the motion is to enhance and celebrate the syllabus.  There is much that is wrong and worrying about the way in which history is currently taught in secondary schools.  It is not perfect, nor is it a compulsory subject.<\/p><p>In 2013, 53,000 students did the junior certificate history examination, whereas only slightly more than 11,000 students did the leaving certificate history examination.  It is possible that the syllabus is over-laden with content.  Only 50% of schools currently require students to take history as a junior certificate subject.  The purpose of the motion is to acknowledge the need to develop a bespoke model of education that attempts to engage with the current context.  Not having history as a core subject will, over time, diminish the status of the subject and, ultimately, its psychological relevance to students.  We are, as Fintan O'Toole observed, in the golden age for the study of Irish history.  The amazing coincidence is that we are also in an age in which there is a dearth of new vision, ideas and ideology.<\/p><p>The Minister took a positive step to encourage greater success in mathematics.  We need a similar imaginative response to the teaching of history.  We must sow the seeds of an enlightened citizenship based on understanding the present through a knowledge of history.  This is what the poets of 1916 took from 1798 - history as a way of interpreting rather than knowing the past.  I commend the motion to the House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800037#MM00200","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1379524800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank the Independent Senators and Taoiseach's nominees for tabling the motion.  As previous speakers noted, history is an extremely important subject, not only in terms of understanding the past but also in terms of the generic skills it provides, which are useful across the curriculum.  The Minister places great emphasis on literacy.  History, as a content heavy subject, involves a great deal of reading, analysis, writing and argumentation, all of which are key skills that are essential if students are to grasp other subjects at school, third level and through lifelong learning.  It is vital, therefore, that students study history.<\/p><p>As noted in the Government amendment, history is not currently compulsory.  That 90% of students take the subject at junior certificate level is an indication that students are voting to study history and schools want to offer the subject.  However, a problem arises at leaving certificate level.  As Senator Mac Conghail pointed out, the take-up at leaving certificate is much lower than at junior certificate level.  During a discussion in the joint committee it emerged that one of the reasons for this decline is that some schools do not offer history as a leaving certificate subject, which is a shame.  As we seek to reform the second level experience as a whole, we must ensure that subjects are offered.  This may require collaboration with other schools or other innovative approaches.  It should not be the case that students are unable to take a subject as important as history in fifth and sixth year.  There is, therefore, a bigger picture to consider.  <\/p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party welcomes junior certificate reform, having initiated the reform process while in government.  I appreciate the position in which the Minister finds himself in that all of us are in favour of students at junior cycle being given an opportunity to experiment with a wider range of subjects in order that they can decide which subjects they wish to choose for the leaving certificate.  While it is my view that all students should study history in the junior cycle, I have argued previously that they should also study science, modern languages and technology.  We must also ensure young people do much more physical exercise in school.  If we place the school system under such pressure, clearly something will have to give.  I appreciate that it would be inconsistent to argue in favour of junior certificate reform, while demanding that all current subjects be studied for the entire three-year junior cycle programme.  I would be concerned, however, if the only choice available to students were between a short course and a full subject because the gap between the two is significant.  It would be a shame if we were to end up in a position where schools no longer offer history at junior certificate level or it is only offered as a short course or 50:50 subject.  Such a scenario would be a great loss, especially as 90% of students currently take history at junior certificate level.  We should aim to ensure that 90% of pupils continue to take history as a full subject, although I accept we may need to shave some time off the current three-year period to make space for other subjects on the curriculum.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to review the matter.  History is a special case and must, like science subjects, have space on the curriculum.  Short courses are not an alternative to offering a full subject.<\/p> <p>For that reason while stressing how important history is and while greatly supporting the motion that has been tabled, we have discussed it as a group and will be abstaining on it because we do not want to vote against it tonight.  However, we ask the Minister to look at it again.  We will table such a motion again in a few months if there is no movement on it.  We understand the genuine concern raised by the Senators who have spoken this evening and from the History Teachers Association of Ireland and others.  There may be room for more engagement and I know the Minister is willing to listen.  That is our perspective.  I very much welcome that the Taoiseach's nominees group has tabled the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800037#MM00300","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379525400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  It is not surprising that this subject would be debated in this House.  I hope the Minister will find something helpful for his future decision making.  Many people are surprised that even though they are committed to the fairly radical reform of the junior certificate curriculum, they are disappointed that history is to become a casualty of that.  History is a living subject that is relevant and central to every aspect of our lives.  That is underlined by every programme I hear on the radio or watch on television on which someone such as Professor Diarmaid Ferriter is brought in to give a perspective.  So it is clear that it is not a cold subject existing in isolation.  We always regarded history as allowing us to learn from and be inspired by the past, and also be deterred from making mistakes that were made in the past.  Given that it has been so central to society, not having it would deprive young people of having knowledge of the past and in a way being prepared for the present at the same time.<\/p><p>It is quite clear that it is not just educators and legislators who are debating history not being a core subject in the junior certificate curriculum, but parents and even young people are also doing so.  In this decade of commemorations of events, including those in 1913 and 1916, it would be very surprising to suggest that the teaching of history in schools might be diminished.  Millions of people are accessing the 1911 census and will hopefully be able to access the 1926 census in the very near future.  That is also history because it is not just a matter of knowing about their roots; they are also giving a context to an environment and an era.  History is all around us.  If people think that history is less important - I will not mention the other subjects that are more important - that has to be debated.<\/p><p>Further to what Senator Power said, I would like to think that the Minister having come to this august assembly today, might be able to go back to the drawing board with his officials in the realisation that there are helpful and strong opinions on the subject that Ireland would the poorer for it and young people would be deprived if that subject is not given the appropriate status.  As the Minister is a reforming Minister, he will realise that reforming does not necessarily mean sidelining something that is important to our lives.  I hope he will take that on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800038#NN00200","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1379525400,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote>To delete all words after &#8220;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann&#8221; and substitute the following:<br \/>&#8220;notes that:<blockquote><blockquote>- the framework for a new Junior Cycle includes English, Irish and Mathematics as compulsory subjects for all students, due to the importance of those subjects in developing literacy and numeracy skills;<br \/>- contrary to recent commentary, History is not currently a compulsory subject for all students at Junior Cycle level.

I believe history is a core in the new junior cycle and therefore I have proposed our amendment which I hope can be supported by everybody.<\/p><p>  This morning I spoke to Dr. Padraig Kirk and wished him well in his new position in charge of the implementation of the new junior cycle programme.  Dr. Kirk is the former CEO of County Louth VEC and is a person of immense qualities and an excellent choice for this task.  I have no doubt he will be a big success.  During our conversation we discussed the position of history in the new junior cycle and he referred to the 24 statements of learning that are at the core of the new programme, in particular the one included as part of the amendment.  These statements provide the basis for schools to plan for, design and evaluate their junior cycle programme.<\/p><p>  The school syllabus must ensure that all statements of learning feature in the programme for all junior cycle students.  Therefore, if the statements of learning are at the core of the junior cycle programme, <i>a fortiori<\/i> history is already at the core and does not need to be reinstated.  To quote from Flann O'Brien's <i>At Swim Two Birds<\/i>, &quot;the conclusion of your syllogism... is fallacious, being based upon licensed premises.&quot;<\/p><p>  There seems to be a gene in our psyche that wants us to make things compulsory in the belief that a specific object will be achieved by these means.  It is, I believe, very much a socio-religious, psychosomatic construct and historical in origin.  It is a top-down approach to learning and culture, which is more about control than learning.  In this context many of us can remember the raim&eacute;is that passed for history which was taught in our schools for many years and which was clearly biased in favour of the dominant ideology of the time.  I would rather watch a film about Eamon de Valera and Michael Collins than listen to the fanatical, declamatory cosmology of a Christian Brother of years gone by.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800038#NN00300","speaker":"1166"},{"type":"speech","time":1379525400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Dorothy Macardle comes to mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800038#NN00400","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1379525400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Dorothy Macardle was a Dundalk girl of course.

It offers a timely opportunity to debate a most important topic, namely, the teaching of history at junior cycle level.  However, as the statement of learning on the matter makes clear, it is already a core part of the junior cycle syllabus.  The next step would be to make compulsory history as an examination subject and we have had too much compulsion in Ireland.

In one school in which I taught, music was compulsory up to the junior certificate.  All students in the school were obliged to study it until that point, after which it became an optional subject for the leaving certificate.  Ten years ago, the position changed whereby music became a subject of choice in the first year.  The numbers taking music to leaving certificate level did not change at all, which is a valid point to make in this debate.  If one provides students with a choice, they can make up their own minds and by the time they come to leaving certificate level, they are well capable of so doing.<\/p><p>I am delighted to note that at present, 91% of students take history to junior certificate level.  However, 11,000 students take history to leaving certificate level and this may suggest a need to examine the core curriculum and syllabus of history.  As I have stated previously many times, students often choose subjects at leaving certificate level based on the national average grade of As or on the demands of the subject.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800039#OO00200","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1379526000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800039#OO00300","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1379526000,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Moreover, from my previous experience of supervising State leaving certificate examinations, I can recall a situation that was changed a few years ago in which English examinations took place in the morning and the students had a three-hour writing marathon, followed by a history examination in the afternoon of three hours and 20 minutes.  I recall watching students shaking their hands every ten minutes because they could not get down on paper fast enough what they wished to express.  At a time like the present, when things are so competitive at third level, unfortunately factors like this have crept into subjects and this has become a key concern of students and a reason for them to choose subjects for the leaving certificate examination.  I read an important and interesting article by Tom Collins in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, in which he wrote the single most important attribute a young person should have acquired by the end of the junior certificate cycle is a love for learning.  That is very important and were one to make something compulsory, as was seen when Irish was made a compulsory subject, one would be in danger of losing all that.  Compulsion of any sort is likely to diminish this possibility.<\/p><p>  This does not take away from the importance of history on which I completely agree.  However, a considerable amount of cross-communication and cross-learning takes place between subjects in schools even as it is and this point has not been referred to in today's debate.  As for my own subject, when teaching Irish music I also teach the history because what was going on at a particular time is highly pertinent to the history of music in question, be it in Ireland or in European countries.  One can understand the music and culture much better if one understands the underlying history.  Consequently, history is being taught in other subjects and I have lobbied for greater correspondence in this regard for many years.  I believe the reform of the junior cycle will encourage greater communication between subjects and will encourage people who are learning Irish, for example, to learn the history.  Similarly, when students are learning music or English, the subject will be incorporated and there will be cross-subject and cross-curricular teaching in this regard.<\/p><p>  As for short courses, I refer to the consideration of one's own town and the new junior cycle reform will offer far greater scope than was the case previously to local people to examine local areas in the first instance.  The 12-year olds who come into secondary schools often do not know the history or significance of, for example, the castle standing at the bottom of the school or are not familiar with the graveyard or its contents and do not know its underlying significance.  Consequently, this proposal has provided the ideal opportunity to examine what is in one's own area.  It also depends on the individual teacher.  I have complete faith that schools are sensible enough to know what they must put on the curriculum.  Teachers are sensible enough to know what they want to teach and to feed that passion into it.  I respect and understand where Senator O'Donnell is coming from and acknowledge this issue must be reconsidered and the numbers ascertained in a few years' time.  While there must be reviews and one must keep looking at it, the advantage of the reform is one can do so.  As the Senator noted, one must look and learn about the hardships and as Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; stated, one must learn from one's mistakes and to learn to move forward.  Nevertheless, I have great confidence in the Minister's words and in his decision that history will not lose out during the junior cycle reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800039#OO00400","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1379526000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I also wish to support my colleagues, Senators O'Donnell and Mac Conghail in the tabling of this motion, which I fully support.  I do not wish to get tied up in knots about terms like \"core\" or \"compulsory\" because I welcome the junior certificate reform.  My own background is in youth work and much of what we practice in non-formal education is being brought into the classroom and the formal education sector, all of which is to be welcomed.  My colleague, Senator Mac Conghail, spoke about the balance between theory and practice and in both my current role and my previous job, I have visited the transition year students of many schools.  In this context, there is a great difference from school to school on how transition year is implemented.  I refer to that capacity and the capability within a school and within individual teachers as to whether they harness the potential of a transition year student year.  There is a similar fluidity to the new junior certificate reform and perhaps that is where part of my hesitancy lies about history not having as central a role as I would wish.  While my colleagues have referred to the statements of learning, I can understand the reason, at the joint committee meeting of 12 June last to which my colleague, Senator O'Donnell, made reference, many eminent people expressed fears about history and whether the students would be ready and prepared.  It can be taught as a subject or a short course and if the latter, comprising 100 hours of learning.  Will that prepare someone to take it at leaving certificate level?  Will it prepare them for university to go further in those subjects?  How could a short course even get one in?  Anyone who loves history will understand the depths and knowledge it has.  Senator Moran mentioned students making choices and I have met many students, some very close to home, who have based their choices both for the junior certificate and as they enter into the leaving certificate cycle, on the points.  It is purely about points and I understand this drive whereby this is what one needs to do to get the college course one seeks.<\/p><p>This point brings me to the amendment to the motion, which refers to the compulsory subjects, the importance of literacy and numeracy skills and of the development thereof, with which everyone agrees.<\/p> <p>All the work I have done on literacy and numeracy, however, tells me one does this in many different ways, not just through particular core subjects such as English.  Literacy can mean a parent in a supermarket telling a child to pick up a can of peas, spelling out the word.<\/p><p>I am a little concerned about us jumping to the next thing when we pick literacy.  People may have forgotten that in 2008, the Department of Education and Skills and the Council of Europe produced an excellent report on language education policy profile concerning modern languages and their importance, but it was dropped because we are doing literacy and numeracy.  I do not say one approach is more important than the other but many of the people being recruited - we are told it is all about growth and jobs - are coming from outside Ireland because we do not have the required modern language skills.  Part of my concern in respect of history is the same as that which applies to the placing of modern languages and issues such as how we prepare students for life.  Yesterday, I attended a very impressive seminar which looked at the work-readiness of students.  Young people are approaching work very differently now.  A person from Accenture told us that after a person begins to work, he or she will want to take a sabbatical to go back to further education or to travel and will afterwards return to work.  The idea of being in a job for life is changing and we must prepare our young people for this changing environment.<\/p><p>I have a difficulty.  In this discussion we may all be on the same side, but when I drill down, I find I do not have confidence that under the junior certificate reforms we will have consistent delivery of the junior cycle in each school, which would be detrimental to students.  There might be a teacher who is visionary and able to encompass this new way of learning but there may be difficulties with some who are traditional and not ready for the change.  The current sixth class will be the first to be tested in this regard.  Will we have consistency throughout the country and will we prepare for it?  I believe we need a little more structure.  In my view, there are certain essential subjects.  History and modern languages are the ones I would like to throw into that pot.  That is where my hesitancy lies and if I try to understand it, I find I do not have the confidence I would like to have.  I do not want children to be guinea pigs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800039#OO00500","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379526600,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I thank everybody for allowing this debate to take place and, in particular, Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell and the Independent group of Taoiseach's nominees.  Before I address the topic in detail, there are a couple of aspects of recent commentary on this matter I would like to clarify.  First, it has been suggested that history is currently a compulsory subject in all schools at junior cycle level.  I do not accuse anybody of saying this but that has been the commentary.  I looked in at the committee debate where one would certainly have got that impression from the protagonists addressing the committee.  Nobody attempted to correct it.  To reiterate, this is not the case.  Second, it has been argued that the new junior cycle will see a dumbing down of the teaching of history.  Again, this is not the case.<\/p><p>  The point of abolishing the junior certificate and reforming junior cycle education is simply to liberate our students in order that they can learn.  In October 2012, I published &quot;A Framework for Junior Cycle&quot;.  The framework builds on the NCCA document called &quot;Towards a Framework for Junior Cycle&quot; which was agreed by all the education partners.  It sets out the principles, skills and statements of learning for the new junior cycle.  The framework also highlights the need for fundamental changes in our approach to learning, teaching, assessment and curricular planning to improve the quality of the learning experiences of all our students.<\/p><p>  The new junior cycle aims to give flexibility to schools by allowing them the chance to design their own curriculum to meet the needs of their students.  It is about placing increased trust in schools by giving them more autonomy and allowing for a decentralisation of power in regard to the curriculum.  We know that the best performing education systems in the world give schools greater autonomy.  That is not an opinion only but, in terms of measuring the results in international terms, is the consequence of giving schools autonomy.  Those schools believe, correctly in my view, that schools are in the best position to know what is right for them.  As we have already heard, this is a radical change in Irish education because we have always been inclined to set rules and issue directives from the centre.<\/p><p>  Why not have compulsion?  In an article about the junior cycle, in the <i>The Irish Times<\/i> today, Professor Tom Collins quoted from P&aacute;draig Pearse's famous essay, <i>The Murder Machine<\/i>, as I will do:<blockquote>I would urge that the Irish school system of the future should give freedom - freedom to the individual school, freedom to the individual teacher, freedom as far as may be to the individual pupil.  Without freedom there can be no right growth, and education is properly the fostering of the right growth of a personality.<\/blockquote>Pearse was a practising teacher, radical in his day, and he set up St. Enda's school.<\/p><p>  In this century, the junior cycle reforms are about this stance.  The more subjects that are made core, the less choice there is for students.  Subject choice is an important motivator in encouraging students to remain in school and to take an interest in what they are studying.  Several years ago, the ESRI carried out a longitudinal study of post-primary students.  That study provides us with immensely relevant data in respect of the factors that will energise - or deflate - the engagement of our young people with school and with learning.  The report emphasised the importance of providing some subject choice for students, in particular offering access to more practically oriented subjects.  Overall, the ESRI findings were particularly clear in regard to lower performing and working class students, especially male working class students.  These are the exact cohorts that we know disengage from the current junior certificate.<\/p><p>  Today, we are talking specifically about history as a subject.  There are demands that history should be a core subject for the junior cycle which, as I noted at the outset, is not the case at present.  Tomorrow, the other subjects waiting in the wings will have similar demands made for them, including science, geography, modern foreign languages, the arts and so on.  I believe all of these subjects are important but do not believe that they should be compulsory core subjects.  The framework outlines mandatory statements of learning which every student must achieve.  As the counter motion states, these include: &quot;understand[ing] the importance of the relationship between past and current events and the forces that drive change&quot;.  It is clear that over the course of the junior cycle, students will need to acquire historical knowledge, awareness and skills.  What is not specified in the new cycle is how these skills are to be acquired.  We believe, following the advice of the NCCA, that this is clearly a matter for schools to determine.<\/p><p>  What are we trying to do?  The focus of the educational experience for our students must be on the quality of learning throughout the three years of junior cycle.  Looking beyond our shores, we can see that in high performing education systems such as those in Finland, New Zealand, and Queensland, schools have been given greater freedom in deciding and creating the programmes they offer.  When schools in Ireland are implementing the new junior cycle, they too will have the autonomy and flexibility to design their own programmes within the parameters of the framework.  Schools will be able to decide what combination of subjects, short courses or other learning experiences will be provided in their three year programme.  The decisions made by schools will be based on the needs of the students in the school areas.  This means that apart from English, Irish and mathematics, which are the essential building blocks for literacy and numeracy, no other subject will be deemed to be compulsory.<\/p><p>  As I mentioned, history is currently not a compulsory subject for all students in junior cycle.  The rules and programme for secondary schools state that history is a core subject for all students in junior cycle who attend voluntary secondary schools.  Voluntary secondary schools, which are primarily faith-based schools, constitute 52% of all post-primary schools.  In other school types - vocational, community and comprehensive schools - the rules and programme make clear that history is not a compulsory subject.  In spite of this, 91.1% of students who recently sat the junior certificate examination took history.  It is the fifth most popular subject in the junior cycle so I cannot understand the sense of alarm about its imminent disappearance.  In spite of the fact that history is not a compulsory subject for all students, the majority of individual schools have very high uptake levels in the subject which are not due to compulsion.  Rather, they are caused by schools recruiting qualified history teachers who stimulate high levels of interest in their students.<\/p> <p>History teachers attract the students through their love of history and by engaging the curiosity of students.  This should continue to be true as the new junior cycle is implemented.  One would think from the debate around this topic that young people come through the entire eight years of primary school ignorant of history, when in fact primary school is history rich and relevant to the coming of age of learning.<\/p><p>The new flexibility being provided to schools has already resulted in innovation at school level.  For example, one school has introduced a new school-designed and assessed course in digital media and animation for junior cycle.  It offered 24 places.  It had 66 applicants.  Another is offering a course in linguistics to first years, while another is offering courses in graphics and computer science.  None of these schools has downgraded or dropped history as a consequence of these innovations. The reformed junior cycle will be implemented on a phased basis from September 2014 with the first cohort coming into first year.<\/p><p>The new history specification will be implemented in schools from 2017.  In other words, it will start in two years' time and take three years to run through.  This specification will be developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and will involve consultation with the key stakeholders and the public.  The new specifications will facilitate the development of skills including: critically interpreting a range of texts - I would have thought that was the essence of historical research, communicating, working with others, critical thinking and managing information, particularly through the use of digital technology.<\/p><p>The new junior cycle will allow schools to provide for the study of history through a number of means, either as a subject in its own right or as a short course, another learning experience.  I think it was Senator Mary Moran who suggested that in, say, Dundalk, some of the local history and the relevance of the former industries and buildings there could be introduced by a teacher with a passion for history and make the town of Dundalk come alive to those young people in a way that is currently not provided for in the generic course. <\/p><p>Short course provision, if that is what is provided for some students, would still be significantly better than the current non-provision of any historical study for more than 5,500 students taking the junior certificate annually.  We do not have 100% of students taking history in any shape or form, just 91% of students take history.<\/p><p>It is likely that much of the innovative work which has characterised transition year history will filter into short course provision in junior cycle.  We have much to be confident about based on what has already happened.  Schools will have considerably more options to add learning experiences in areas of interest to their students.  These options will enable students to be exposed to the richness and wonder with which history is replete.<\/p><p>The implementation of the framework presents an opportunity to recast junior cycle history as a vibrant, student-centred and valuable subject, a subject with significant emphasis on the relevance of past experiences to our lives today.  New approaches are likely to provide a host of new opportunities, in history and elsewhere, for students to carry out group or individual project work.  This will include designing tasks, making oral presentations, undertaking field trips, using ICT for research, and presenting reports.<\/p><p>The new approach is about quality learning, teaching and assessment and will not be based, as currently, on quantitative learning, or rote learning, as we might more accurately describe it.  It will be about learning to learn and, more important, learning to think.  It will highlight the role of what is termed &quot;assessment for learning&quot; throughout the three years, not concentrated into three hours after five or six other subjects have been taken.  This is the opposite of &quot;dumbing down&quot;.  On the contrary, it is about giving our young people the knowledge, skills and values that will enable them to understand and appreciate history.  There will be a dedicated programme of continuous professional development, CPD, provided to history teachers to enhance their skills and confidence.  That continuous professional development will commence in autumn 2016, a year before the new specifications are implemented.<\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity to debate this matter.  I do not think there is much of a difference separating us but there is a fear for change.  The most fearful are the teachers who have got into a groove of doing it in a particular way.  Like the rest of us, they do not necessarily like change.  I will not mention the Seanad and what might possibly happen to it.  That would be inappropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800040#PP00200","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379527200,"counter":187,"content":"<p>We have no choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800041#QQ00200","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1379527200,"counter":188,"content":"<p>None of us in this room will make that decision, it will be decided by the people.  We will live with whatever change they give or do not give us.<\/p><p>The way in which we assess and trust teachers and schools is important.   There is a wide variation in how schools respond.  Schools are circumscribed by their own circumstances in some cases in that if they have a limited number of pupils, particularly in the post primary curriculum, they are limited in respect of the number of subjects they can offer and the levels at which they can offer those subjects, where there is more than one level.  In those areas we may have to find ways in which history can be shared in a town where there are three or four schools and there is one really good teacher.<\/p><p>We need to change the relationship.  As part of the legacy of the centralist establishment of the Department of Education and Skills there is a direct line vertically from Marlborough Street to each individual school.  The school only goes through that line of communication by circular.  That line of communication, important as it is, must be complemented by a horizontal communication with other schools in the area and in the community.  I hope the 16 new education and training boards will facilitate a far greater regional engagement in the harnessing of educational facilities and resources, including history.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800041#QQ00300","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1379527200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and wish him well in his reforms.

I am glad that appears to have been settled and no doubt will be dealt with in the IPA diary next year.  Part of the problem as I interpreted it, listening on the monitor to the Minister and other Senators was that some history teachers are annoyed.  The same point was made here when we discussed the views of the mathematics teachers on the leaving certificate.  What I was saying in a long-winded introduction, having used the wrong source, is that we need to involve the teacher subject associations.  They may feel they have been overlooked.  If people form a history teachers association and come together at conference to discuss issues of history - or in mathematics and so on - they should be brought into the system.<\/p><p>As the Minister said, I am afraid that sometimes our education system is too bureaucratic and we do not listen to an m&uacute;inteoir, the person in the classroom.  There is a Bord Snip nua number - I hope this one is accurate - which points out that if everybody who is a teacher turned up at primary level the number of teachers should be, say, 16 but in fact there are 24 because many teachers have left the classroom and gone into other duties.  The problem with Irish education is that it has become too bureaucratic.  We are missing the point.  We should all be in the classroom, in the subject areas.  In that context what the Minister has said would be well received.<\/p> <p>I support the Minister's views on autonomy for schools.  That measure is badly needed instead of the centralised model as described in which everything happens homogeneously.  We need a vastly scaled down Marlborough Street, particularly when we are short of money to get people into the classroom.  Some of the personnel with posts of responsibility or administrative posts in schools and in universities - I do not want to leave them out - should be put back into the classroom.<\/p><p>I have concerns about comments made by industry representatives on education and I hope that has not influenced the decision on the place of history in the curriculum.  The bodies representing industry have a lot of explaining to do to us and to the Minister about how they goofed on a massive scale in 2008 and should come out with their hands up instead of demanding changes in the curriculum of schoolchildren and those doing the junior certificate examination.  It was adults who made those errors, who have visited the consequences on schoolchildren and on other aspects of Irish society.  I tend to discount such remarks, because as the Minister knows, it tends to be part of the fashion cycle as to what subject should be in and what subject should not be taken.<\/p><p>We should look at teacher training again.  I know the Minister proposes to extend the years of the H.Dip.  The H.Dip did not traditionally have a great reputation as a course, which is an issue that must be addressed.  I would like mathematics teachers to spend as much time in the mathematics department of a university and be as good as any other mathematics graduate because teaching is so important.  We let some of the other professions such as banking and accountancy, whose members let the country down, rise in status, but now we must raise the importance of education.<\/p><p>I know the Minister proposes to set up regional clusters of professors of education but I hope they not only talk to other professors of education but that they get into the classroom and into the vital subjects such as history, mathematics and languages.  Part of the previous fashion of curriculum overloading meant that we allowed the development of languages to lapse and fall behind in Ireland.  We now find in the latest phase of industrial development that there is a shortage of people and we must import people with language skills.  In recent times more language departments were shut down in Irish universities than actually opened.  A view of what gave rise to economic growth was short term and as an economist I would advise against anybody from economics saying what causes economic growth and how the education system should be altered to suit those short-term needs.  I agree fully with what the Minister said about Finland and the autonomy of schools there, which was the system we in Ireland had before it was so rigidly taken under control by the State.  The emphasis on the student, on the subject and reducing the amount of bureaucracy as much as we can will get more scholar per dollar, which was a cliche.<\/p><p>History still has an important role in reducing the tensions and the difficulties on this island.  I recall the Stormont Assembly debate, in the aftermath of 12 July, in which a man with a strong Unionist background said the Orange Order is as Irish as a pint of Guinness.  That was not the version that came to us in schools.  Redefining ourselves through the better knowledge of history is something on which our colleagues across the Chamber and the Minister are in agreement.  I praise Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell for a very spirited speech on these issues.  We cannot discuss these topics enough.  We should never waste a good recession.  So much went wrong in 2008, we are now trying to design a different society, a post-crisis society and I hope a reformed and retained Seanad will assist the Minister in this task for many years in the future.  The Seanad has a major role.  What failed in 2008 and afterwards must be replaced.  I commend the Minister as one of the reforming Ministers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800041#QQ00900","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379527800,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I second the amendment to the motion outlined by my colleague, Senator Jim D'Arcy, who said that the position of history as a subject is secure and that history will continue to be studied by the vast majority of students at junior certificate level.  The Minister outlined in his speech the number of students who are taking the subject and will continue to take the subject.  Change is never easy and the new junior certificate has come about following consultation since April 2010.  There were online consultations and a number of meetings were held around the country with the National Parents Council.  During that period of consultation, the need for a core group of subjects was identified and individuals and groups were asked for their opinions.  I looked at information from the IVEA, the Joint Managerial Board, JMB, and the Teachers Union of Ireland which submitted their thoughts.  None of those three bodies mentioned history, but mentioned English, Irish, mathematics, science, physical education, CSPE and RSE.  Subjects along those lines seemed to be the common theme.  I agree that history is an important subject.<\/p><p>There is clear evidence of the need for change in the junior cycle.  I can see that students do not make much progress in English and maths in their first years, and hence the reason for introducing the assessment earlier.  This will give feedback to parents and they will see where the student stands rather than leaving it for three years when the student sits an exam in June and gets the results in September when the student is facing into the senior cycle, having never got to grips with maths, English, history or science.  That is what we have debated and we are now in the process of introducing a new cycle at the junior level.<\/p><p>As I said change is never easy.  I read an article in yesterday's newspaper in which a science teacher who had supervised 200 students during the two-hour State junior certificate science examination reported that ordinary level students left the examination after 35 minutes, and those taking the higher level paper left after 90 minutes.  Students found the exam too easy and one student said that the examination in his or her favourite subject was too easy and did not give the person an opportunity to prove himself or herself.  She commented that students were not expected to be able to draw a diagram of the circulatory system as it is already printed on the exam paper.  The teacher questioned whether we are encouraging the students to learn in a different way and whether they will have a great understanding of the subject.<\/p><p>As I said change is challenging, but the process to establish the new junior cycle has been worked through with a great deal of work on assessment and consultation.  I think it is welcome for the benefits that have been outlined in this debate.<\/p><p>We have debated the designation of core subjects - maths, English and Irish.  I do not think that Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell is proposing in her motion to make history a compulsory subject, but she wants it to be a core subject.  &quot;Compulsion&quot; is a word that may have negative connotations.  The Minister stated there will be three core subjects and a range of subjects within which schools can chose to offer.  I would have liked to have science as a core subject.  I know there were many calls for that, but the Minister made the case previously on that issue.<\/p><p>History is a very important subject.  The fact that it is the fifth most popular subject that students take supports its strong standing.  Like all learning it depends on the teacher who teaches it.  The next question is the content of the course.  I hope we will have confidence in the proposed changes in our system of education and to know these changes are based on consultation, sound facts and that they will encourage and develop a love of learning and the subject, whatever subject choice takes the students interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800042#RR00200","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1379528400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I call Senator Mooney and he has six minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800043#SS00100","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1379528400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I wish to share my time with Senator Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800043#SS00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1379528400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Last June representatives from the History Teachers Association of Ireland told an Oireachtas joint committee that the new syllabus would lead to many schools dropping history and would further reduce numbers taking the subject at leaving certificate level.  Professor Diarmuid Ferriter of UCD said that it would be a cruel irony if history, as a subject, was downgraded during the decade of commemorations for events such the 1913 Lock-out and the 1916 Rising.  He said that he had concerns that downgrading the subject would lead to a class divide with working class children far less likely to be offered the subject at school.  Another historian, Ms Catriona Crowe, said Ireland should not repeat the mistakes of England.  She pointed out that England is about to reintroduce history as a compulsory subject having removed it in recent years.  <\/p><p>  According to Mr. Fintan O'Mahony of the ASTI: <blockquote>If history is only offered as a short course here and there the numbers will drop and Leaving Cert history will be affected.  We've built the numbers back up since the subject was reformed in 2006, and it's now the fifth most popular elective, and one that students really enjoy.<\/blockquote>There has been a big fall-off in the number of pupils studying history at leaving certificate level, with 53,000 studying it for the junior certificate and only 11,700 at leaving certificate level in 2012.<\/p><p>  Senator van Turnhout mentioned that there is a race for points which is rather unfortunate.  All that I would be concerned about is that the new syllabus would lead to history being sidelined, to a degree, and that schools will no longer offer history.  That would be a great shame, particularly considering the divided nature of the nation. <\/p><p>  I wish to make a final point.  When I went to school history stopped at 1916.

I support the idea of history being a core subject for the junior certificate and quote a Russian proverb: those who keep one eye on the past are half blind but those who keep both eyes on the future can see nothing at all.  It is apt that the Minister quoted P&aacute;draig Pearse's book <i>The Murder Machine<\/i>:<blockquote><br \/>I would urge that the Irish school system of the future should give freedom - freedom to the individual school, freedom to the individual teacher, freedom as far as may be to the individual pupil.  Without freedom there can be no right growth; and education is properly the fostering of the right growth of personality.<\/blockquote>The statement is true.  How many students will know who P&aacute;draig Pearse was if history is not a core subject?  That is the fundamental question for the Minister.<\/p><p>  Let us look at our neighbouring island.  As my colleagues have said, it is restoring history as a core subject but we are going in the opposite direction in Ireland.  We do not seem to have learned from the short history and experience of our neighbouring island.  We live in a country that has so many problems and issues that are relevant today due to our history.  It is important that our students and citizens learn why such troubles exist at this time and how we can learn from past mistakes in order to ensure that we do not continue to make mistakes now and in the future.  I ask the Minister to re-examine the issue.<\/p><p>  I am a member of the Decade of Commemorations committee.  It is appalling that history will become a shorter core subject at this time.  How much can be taught during a short course?  How much history can be crammed into a course that lasts a few weeks or months?  <\/p><p>  Without making history a fundamental part of being an active citizen, one should know the history of one's country and the meaning of one's flag.  If one asked students in Ireland the meaning of the Irish flag and what man created it they could not answer.  Article 7 of the Constitution designated what the Irish flag would be.

The first I heard of Connolly and Larkin was not in the classroom but at the fireside from my late uncle.  At that time history was taught by people who had their own views.

The proposals provide an exciting opportunity for students.<\/p> <p>I support Senator Daly's point on whether young people have a knowledge or interest in our country's history.  Speaking in a personal capacity, I feel that one's interest in history grows with age.  People become more interested in history as they move on in life.<\/p><p> Students are entitled to make choices.  Senator van Turnhout and Senator Clune referred to the fact that secondary education is now a race for points.  Unfortunately that is the case.  Many students select subjects that they feel will get them 600 points to do medicine or whatever.  In my opinion, education is about sharing knowledge and preparing people for life.  I will finish by being the third person to quote from an article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>by Professor Tom Collins.  It is on the issue of history as part of the junior cycle.  He states:<blockquote>The single most important attribute a young person should have acquired at the end of the Junior Cycle is a love for learning.  Compulsion of any sort is likely to diminish this possibility.  There is a difference between what a student should do and what a student must do.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800043#SS03000","speaker":"1162","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379529000,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am trying to remember when he was here last, but when he is here he makes very useful contributions.  Even though he is the Minister of State with responsibility for innovation and technology, he also realises the importance of history.  We do not know who we are unless we know where we came from and what our history is.  As a nation, we have a phenomenal history going back centuries, but our democracy is a very short history.  Sometimes it can be a very blinkered or thwarted history, depending on the teacher.  It often would not have been a very fair history.  Things might have broken down according to the teacher's view of the civil war, which is a criticism of both sides.  I am very confident that in recent years, the teaching of history has been very fair and balanced.  Unfortunately, not enough children are taking history seriously.  We are in the world of Facebook, Twitter, e-mails, the Internet, AskFm and so on.  That is all very important, but history is extremely important as well.<\/p><p>I completely subscribe to the principle of not making anything compulsory.  If I had my way, nothing would be compulsory, because learning should be a love.  We need to engender and develop a culture of the love of learning.  I recently asked children whether they were looking forward to going back to school this year, and they all answered that they were.  I do not know what was wrong in my day, but I certainly did not look forward to going back to school after the summer holidays.  Things are improving and these kids are happy to go back to school and are somewhat motivated.<\/p><p>My view is that the points race is deconstructing quality education.  I completely subscribe to the principle that people should want to learn and learn for the right reasons.  I would subscribe to an interview process and a continuous assessment process for children applying for university.  Technically that could be seen as not fair.  It could be said that human interaction could create an unfairness about it, but overall it would be a far more holistic approach.  I know students who are studying medicine and they neither have the communication skills nor the humanity to be doing medicine.  I know students who are involved in science and other areas who find it boring and would not have the creativity for such disciplines.  I know students studying law who got the points because they were mathematically oriented, but law is not about maths.  The points system is flawed and there is a far better way of doing business.<\/p><p>I welcome this motion and given Senator O'Donnell's background in education and love of language, it is coming from a genuine source.  It is very important that Seanad &Eacute;ireann would debate, discuss and deliberate this aspect of education.  In fact, we should be looking at all aspects of education.  We should be looking at training our young people to be ambassadors of culture and our language.  When I was in school, the teaching of the Irish language turned me off it for years.  My love of it has been reignited as a result of Senator Moran's daughter giving me grinds over the last two years.  We must look at a change in attitude to education.  We were known as the nation of saints and scholars, but being scholars is not about the points system.  It is about knowing who we are, knowing our history, wanting to learn, appreciating books and not wasting the day on Facebook or Twitter, but spending the day acquiring knowledge.  Knowledge is powerful, but is not dangerous.  It is what gives people freedom.  It allows people to be equal.  Education is the single biggest driver to get people out of poverty, and every penny spent on education is well spent.<\/p><p>I welcome the motion. I welcome the debate this evening.

My argument was not about compulsion, but about realigning history to a short course method.  It was not about whether something should be compulsory or not.  Sometimes we need to argue more about the &quot;how&quot; of things.  We have a great aspirational formulaic learning system for outcomes, but we rarely have pamphlets.

Of course, people do not like to use the words \"teaching\" or \"training\" now because we are meant to be helping and project managing, but we are getting nowhere through that approach.  That comes from knowing that history is a heartbeat - it is basically our exit and entrance on to the planet. <\/p><p>Short courses do not work for young minds; they fragment knowledge.

I think that he was the president of Maynooth where I did - I may be showing off in saying this - one of my degrees.  It was a fine university that married the secular and the theological.  When I was there it opened up to outside students, and I learned as much from the theological part as I did from the secular part .  In the article Tom Collins quoted P&aacute;draig Pearse's <i>The Murder Machine. <\/i> The article was a little extreme<i>. <\/i> When freedom is discussed one must talk about freedom for and freedom to and define their terms, which Tom Collins did not do.

We are asking families to live within 500 m of them.  This is untenable.

The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments.<\/p><p>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders, is undertaking a targeted review of the 2006 guidelines, focusing on noise, proximity and shadow flicker.  A press notice was issued in January inviting submissions on this targeted review.  More than 550 submissions were received from individual members of the public and various stakeholders in response to the notice.  In anyone's language, this is a strong response to the first stage of a process that will provide further and more extensive opportunities for the public to shape the review.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, commissioned the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to invite proposals from suitably qualified organisations for the completion of a study to examine the significance of noise related to onshore wind farms.  The objective of the study is to obtain evidence upon which to evaluate the appropriateness of the existing guidelines in respect of noise impacts and, if considered necessary, suggest changes.  It will take account of the following key contextual issues: the evolution of wind turbine technologies since the current guidelines were published; experience to date in their application; research relating to wind turbine noise issues, including an examination of international practice, since the guidelines were adopted; and Ireland's binding targets in terms of renewable energy uptake and penetration.<\/p><p>The SEAI awarded the contract for carrying out the study to Marshall Day Acoustics in July 2013.  Marshall Day Acoustics has significant international experience in this field and has previously participated in reviews of the wind farm noise guidelines for the Australian and New Zealand Governments.  This study will form a key input into the review of the statutory guidelines.  It is expected to be completed shortly to allow preparation and publication of revised statutory guidelines in draft form.<\/p><p>The indicative timetable for the publication of the draft guidelines is the fourth quarter of this year.

I have raised this issue several times.  It relates to the removal of medical cards and the need to implement medical cards for children with disabilities, including moderate intellectual disabilities.  In recent months, I have been inundated by representations from people whose medical cards have been removed.<\/p> <p>That is despite the fact that there have been severe cutbacks in the services they are trying to access.  Their respite care grant has been cut, while waiting times for such services have become longer.  I appreciate that there are more medical cards now than a few years ago, but some of these people have been told that they earn &euro;58 or &euro;62 too much to qualify for medical cards.  One must consider, however, how much it costs for parents of the children involved, in addition to those aged over 18, to access services they cannot obtain in the public domain.  They are spending far in excess of those who are in receipt of medical cards.<\/p><p>More discretion should be exercised when it comes to granting medical cards for those with disabilities.  For example, I know of one family whose child requires special orthopaedic shoes.  Such shoes would cost over &euro;900 a pair.  A child might need three pairs of shoes annually, yet the parents may be told that they earn too much to get a medical card.  The cost of private physiotherapy and occupational therapy far outweighs what it would cost to grant a family a medical card on financial grounds.  The Minister of State should examine the situation.  Hopefully the forthcoming budget will provide better access to health care services.  The Minister of State should consider those who greatly require medical cards for their children with disabilities.  They do not abuse the system by visiting the doctor every day, yet they need the security a medical card can offer to access the medical care and attention they require.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800047#WW01500","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379530800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Moran for raising this issue to which I have given much time, attention and thought.<\/p><p>Medical cards are provided to persons who are, under the provisions of the Health Act 1970 and in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and reasonable expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  Under the legislation, determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE.  The Health Act 1970 is the legislative basis upon which people are granted medical cards.<\/p><p>The HSE has produced national assessment guidelines to provide a clear framework to assist in the making of reasonable, consistent and equitable decisions when assessing an applicant for the General Medical Services scheme.  These guidelines are publicly available and can be downloaded from the HSE's medical card website.<\/p><p>While there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with specific illnesses or with a disability, the HSE has discretion to award a medical card to avoid undue hardship, even where the person exceeds the income guidelines.  The HSE has established a panel of community medical officers to assist in the processing of applications for medical cards on a discretionary basis where a person exceeds the income guidelines but where there are difficult personal circumstances, such as an illness or physical disability.  The community medical officer reviews and interprets medical information provided by the applicant to the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, on a confidential basis.  He or she liaises with general practitioners, hospital consultants and other health professionals, as appropriate, to determine the health needs of the applicant and his or her family and dependants.  The community medical officer then applies discretion, within the guidelines, to determine whether the applicant is suffering from medical hardship.  This thorough process of assessment ensures medical cards are issued to medical applicants whose income is above the guidelines but where illness or disability would cause undue hardship to them in providing GP services for themselves and their dependants.<\/p><p>The HSE also has a system in place in relation to the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford.  Emergency medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.  This can be initiated through the local health office by the office manager who has access to a dedicated fax and e-mail contact within the PCRS.<\/p><p>With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card.  As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months.<\/p><p>The arrangement is slightly different for persons with a terminal illness.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months.  Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure the person gets the card as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>The HSE ensures the system responds to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals.  Where it is drawn to my attention or that of the Department or the HSE that there are problems, for whatever reason, with operating the system I have just described, I will attend to such problems and address them.<\/p><p>The Senator said it would be appropriate or desirable to have more discretion in granting medical cards.  However, the Health Act 1970 distributes medical cards on the basis of means.  That is what the law states and we must operate within the legal parameters.  Earlier this year, I examined the question of universal access to GP care, which is a broader project in the programme for Government, including the roll-out of free GP care.  The original proposal in the programme for Government was to start with people on the long-term illness scheme and then move on to high-tech drugs and others.  There were huge difficulties and legal complications associated with awarding a medical card on the basis of an illness or condition.  It was extremely difficult because of the diagnosis of particular illnesses.  The basis for a diagnosis of a particular condition, illness or disability is never straightforward.  It was always going to be extremely difficult to draw up new legislation that would set out a scheme for awarding medical cards on the basis of an illness or condition.  That is because our system, under the 1970 Act, is based on means and hardship rather than on illness, condition and disability.  I am making that point to emphasise how difficult it would be to go down that route.  <\/p><p>I earnestly hope that we will have universal access, without fees, to GPs and primary care for every citizen irrespective of means or state of health.  It is a commitment in the programme for Government and we will do it, but we obviously have to do it in stages.  We want to have a preventative primary care system so that everybody will get access to it.  Nothing is free because it has to be funded, but we will have universal access to GP care.  That is what I want to see happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800048#XX00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1379530800,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his answer and take on board everything he has said.

While people understand the need for change and are not concerned with the proposed change in roles and responsibilities, they are concerned about service provision in their area.  <\/p><p>As the Minister of State will be aware, Connemara is a huge geographical area.  Services previously provided by community welfare officers in areas such as Carraroe, Tully, Carna, Cill Chiaran and so on are now to be provided from central areas in Galway and Clifden, with people having to travel to these centres to avail of services.  In this regard, a number of issues arise.  First, many of the people who need to avail of these services are financially challenged.  Even if they did have the wherewithal to travel, the public transport system is appalling and there are few connecting services.  For example, there is no public transport from the Carna or Cill Chiaran to Clifden, which is a journey of approximately 50 km.  This means a person who needs to access services in Clifden will either have to own a car, be dependent on another person for a lift or have to pay for a taxi and so on.  This is outside the means of a number of the people who need to avail of these services.  The situation is similar in other areas of Connemara.  What is the future of these services?  <\/p><p>The other issue I wish to raise is a linguistic one.  I commend the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, on the opening of a MABS office in Carraroe.  The argument for the opening of that office was that the people of the Gaeltacht deserved a service as Gaeilge, which is now being provided.  It is a fantastic service, which we welcome.  The corollary now is that because of the relocation of services to Clifden and Galway, service provision as Gaeilge to people in the Gaeltacht, which is their right under the Constitution, will not be easily accessible.  It is a huge issue.  People are worried that the Irish language service provision currently available, which has been traditionally provided by CWOs, will be lost.  They are concerned about the removal of services from rural areas and the impact of this on the Aran Islands and Connemara in general.   <\/p><p>The Minister has received correspondence on this issue from a number of community groups.  There are conflicting reports on it.  The Minister indicated to one community group from Ballinahown that she would have the situation investigated.  The following day, the Department stated in the media that the decision had already been taken.  There appears to be a great deal of confusion around provision of these services.  I hope the Minister of State will be in a position to clarify the situation this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800049#YY00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1379531400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I thank Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.<\/p><p>The staffing needs for all areas within the Department of Social Protection are continuously reviewed to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by that Department.  This includes meeting commitments under the Pathways to Work programme to provide opportunities, support and assistance to the approximately 420,000 people on the live register by intensifying the Department's level of engagement with people who are unemployed and, in particular, those who are, or become, long-term unemployed.<\/p><p>In the coming months, up to 20 staff drawn primarily from the Department's community welfare services, social welfare inspectors and community services will take up new roles as activation case officers in County Galway.  These changes, which are largely predicated on the rationalisation of the community welfare service clinics, will increase activation case officer numbers in the county from 13 to 33 staff.  It was in this context that a decision was made to relocate community welfare services from Connemara to Galway city and Clifden.  Staff based in An Spideal and An Ceathru Rua will relocate to Galway city while services based in Cill Chiaran will relocate to Clifden.  The relocation will take effect from 30 September 2013.  The Minister is very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer-facing services at a local level for customers of the Department.  Customers in these areas will be encouraged to contact the service by phone, e-mail or post in the first instance and, in most cases, their queries will be answered without them having to attend a public clinic in Galway city or Clifden.<\/p><p>As part of the relocation of community welfare services to Galway city and Clifden, the frequency of available public clinics is being increased to five days per week in the case of Galway and to three days per week in the case of Clifden.  The number of staff available to these clinics will be increased, giving customers improved access to services there.  If a customer is unable to travel to Galway city or Clifden, for example due to illness, an officer will arrange a visit to the customer's home if necessary.  The community welfare service on the Aran Islands is currently provided by an officer from the Department who is based in Galway city and who travels to the islands as required.  It is likely that this will continue to be the case in the future.  Customers on the Aran Islands can also contact the community welfare service in Galway by phone, e-mail or post if required.<\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection is conscious of its obligations under the Official Languages Act and is committed to providing a service through Irish to customers.  There are currently a number of staff in the offices covering the Connemara Gaeltacht who provide a service through Irish and this will continue to be the case.  The relocation of services coincides with greater integration between the community welfare service and other locally-based staff of the Department.  This process will be further enhanced by the roll-out of a full Intreo service to Clifden later this year and to Galway city next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013091800049#YY00400","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1379531400,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.
