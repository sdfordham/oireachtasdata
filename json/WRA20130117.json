The SME funds represent a further step in the redeployment of the NPRF towards commercial investment in the Irish economy. By committing its resources as a cornerstone investor, the NPRF is seeking to act as catalyst for attracting additional investment from third-party investors into funds targeted at areas of strategic importance to the economy.  One of the three funds is the SME Credit Fund, to be managed by BlueBay, a specialist credit manager wholly owned by the Royal Bank of Canada, and in respect of which a Letter of Intent has been signed.  The objective is that this fund will be operational in the second quarter of 2013. Lending by the SME Credit Fund will be at competitive market rates with loan sizes ranging from &euro;5 million to &euro;50 million with an estimated average size of &euro;15 million. Returns to investors in the fund will vary according to their position in the fund&rsquo;s capital structure. The NPRF is solely an investor in the fund and plays no part whatsoever in any investment decisions by any of the funds.<\/p><p>  The strategy of the SME Credit Fund will be a combination of origination of loans to SMEs and mid-sized corporates and acquisition of similar loans, particularly from banks that are exiting the Irish market who may be less willing to renew facilities. The SME Credit Fund may also acquire and refinance loans close to maturity where existing lenders are not willing to provide new lines of credit. This is an important aspect in improving the availability of debt financing to SMEs, ensuring that companies will continue to have access to long-term credit facilities, as financial institutions exiting the Irish market may not be prepared to provide such long-term finance or may do so only on a short-term basis with less favourable terms.<\/p><p>  The SME Credit Fund&rsquo;s objective is to provide long-term finance and to be fully repaid out of business cashflow and transactions. This will be a seven-year fund with a need to earn income over that period. There is no element within the SME Credit Fund strategy of acquiring distressed loans with a view to obtaining control.<\/p><p>  The manner in which managers of funds invested in by the NPRF engage with the Irish market is extremely important to the NPRF.  When making the decision to invest in a fund, the NPRF seeks to ensure that both a commercial return is generated and that the fund&rsquo;s impact on the market and its client companies is a positive one over the long term.<\/p><p>  Ultimately, if the SME credit fund is to build the necessary lending platform and scale to generate a commercial return over its seven-year life, it needs to be competitive and successful in the marketplace in developing a high quality book of loans. Therefore, its product and style of operation, both in loan origination and management of loans acquired, will need to be such that it is attractive, relative to the competition, to companies wishing to raise debt finance.<\/p><p>  One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy.  The involvement of BlueBay Asset Management LLP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), as manager of the SME Credit Fund increases lenders in the market.<\/p><p>  Other initiatives to provide credit to SMEs includes setting up the SME Funding Consultation Committee, imposing lending targets on pillar banks, reviewing lending plans that the pillar banks are required to submit and liaising with the Credit Review Office. The credit stream available to SMEs also includes the Microenterprise Loan Scheme and the Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700049#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Question No. 11 answered with Question No. 7.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disposal of Assets","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700049#WRB00600"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[1992\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700049#WRB00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will commit to an external expert examination of the asset disposal programme undertaken by the State supporter banks to ensure that taxpayer interests are being protected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>As you will be aware as part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Financial Measures Programme 2011 the three PLAR banks are required to deleverage c.&euro;70bn of assets by 31 December 2013. Of this they were required to actively dispose of c.&euro;34bn of assets. Each bank agreed comprehensive deleveraging plans to achieve these deleveraging requirements. The CBI has identified the PCAR haircuts within which the banks are required to deleverage their non-core assets with the over-riding safeguard that fire-sales of assets beyond these haircuts are to be avoided.  Both BOI and AIB are currently on track to achieve their Year-end 2013 deleveraging targets. PTSB&rsquo;s programme has been largely postponed pending the EC&rsquo;s decision on its Restructuring Plan. IBRC is subject to an EC Restructuring Plan which requires it to work out its balance sheet over time, including where possible via disposal of loan books. <\/p><p>  To achieve this, each of the banks established dedicated non-core units focused on managing sales processes and are required to report quarterly to the Central Bank which monitors their progress in achieving their deleveraging programmes. Each bank has a deleveraging\/transaction committee to govern, monitor and oversee its deleveraging plans. Representatives from my department and the Central Bank attend the meetings of those committees, as non-voting observers. My department has established a Deleveraging Review Committee to oversee and monitor the operation of the institutions&rsquo; deleveraging committees and to refer transactions that give rise to financial stability considerations to the Central Bank for joint consideration. Additionally, each quarter, the banks and the Authorities meet with and update the External Partners (IMF\/EU\/ECB) as to the progress of the banks deleveraging plans including asset sales. There is significant external oversight.<\/p><p>  In most instances the banks have also employed expert professional sales advisors to assist in ensuring that the sales processes undertaken maximise sales proceeds. These processes are conducted under strict confidentiality rules to ensure the economic position of the banks, and by extension the taxpayer as majority or part owner, is fully protected. As referred to above, the Deleveraging Committees and the main boards of the banks must approve all material sales conducted by the banks.<\/p><p>  To date significant progress has been made. Total deleveraging achieved across government supported banks was &euro;66.5bn as at 30 October 2012. Deleveraging to date has been achieved within average planned assumed discounts. Remaining deleveraging is anticipated to be achieved through run-down and work-out of non-core loan books over time. The asset disposal programmes have largely completed.<\/p><p>  The on-going progress in deleveraging and deposit gathering activities has seen BOI make further progress towards improving its Loan to Deposit (LDR) ratio, reducing from 136% at June 2012 to less than 130% in November 2012. Similarly, AIB&rsquo;s LDR reduced to less than 120% at the end of October (including loans held for sale) from 125% at end of June.<\/p><p>  I am not convinced at this juncture in the Programme that value would be obtained for the State\/taxpayer in conducting an external examination of the asset disposal programmes given the significant level of oversight to date, significant progress achieved so far and the expectation that the capital absorbed as part of the deleveraging programme will not exceed that assumed in the 2011 Financial Measures Programme undertaken by the CBI.<\/p><p>  I will however be kept informed through my officials of on-going progress at each of the banks to ensure that remedial action, if required, can be taken to ensure that the State\/taxpayer&rsquo;s investments are protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700049#WRB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700049#WRB00900"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[1793\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700049#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has been requested by any European or international Government or institution to review this State's corporation tax rate and the tax treatment of royalties.","asker":"984","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>I have not received any request from any European or international institution or Government to review either the State&#8217;s corporation tax rate or tax treatment of royalties.  The Government's position on Ireland's corporation tax rate is very clear and well known to our EU colleagues and our international partners.  The Taoiseach, myself and other members of the Government have repeatedly expressed the Government&#8217;s commitment to the retention of the 12.5% rate.  I reiterated this commitment as recently as my Budget speech on 6th December last year.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to the specific rules we have in Ireland that relate to the use of royalties, the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 requires that a company&#8217;s trading profits be computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice subject to any adjustment required by tax law.  In computing such profits, expenses that are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade are deductible.  This includes royalties or licence fees paid for the use of intellectual property. <\/p><p><br \/>  The tax code in Ireland contains transfer pricing rules that apply the OECD&#8217;s arm&#8217;s length pricing principle to trading transactions between associated companies and such rules are applicable to the use of royalties and licence fees.<\/p><p><br \/>  These rules ensure that the profits chargeable to corporation tax in Ireland fully reflect the functions, assets and risks located here by a multinational groups and other associated companies.<\/p><p><br \/>  Subsidiaries of multinational groups, whether located in Ireland or other countries, often incur certain <i>bona fide<\/i> expenditures, including royalty payments, to group companies in foreign jurisdictions for the use of intellectual property rights. Such payments represent the required remuneration of valuable intangible assets funded and owned outside the State.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Given the complex international dimension to the use of royalty payments, it is important that countries work together to examine these structures and to consider the interaction of international tax rules and their impact on the taxation of companies.  In that context, I would highlight that Ireland is fully committed to working with international bodies to ensure fair play in international tax matters.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland participates fully in both the OECD&#8217;s Forum on Harmful Tax Practices and the EU Code of Conduct Group.  During the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Council, my Department intends working closely with the European Commission and other EU Member States to make progress on new EU proposals on tax evasion and aggressive tax-planning.<\/p><p><br \/>  The tax system in Ireland has a positive international reputation based on transparency and the fact that it is applied equally and openly to all corporate taxpayers.

The January 2011<i> Global<\/i><i>Forum Peer Review<\/i><i>Report<\/i>   on Ireland&#8217;s legal and regulatory framework for transparency and exchange of information found that Ireland has an effective system for the exchange of information in tax matters and is fully compliant with OECD standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700049#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[2026\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700049#WRB01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to tighten existing revenue rules in relation to tax exiles; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":19,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government indicated that, as part of its fiscal policy, the Government will ensure that &ldquo;tax exiles&rdquo; make a fair contribution to the Exchequer.

A total of eight submissions have been received and these have been published.  There was some comment among some submissions regarding possible impact of changes to the residence rules.  The present rules are considered clear and workable and the clarity, certainly and stability of our domestic tax regime enables us to compete effectively in the international economic context.<\/p><p>  Significant concern was expressed regarding potential impact on Foreign Direct Investment, and that such changes could inhibit investment in Ireland, and result in a loss to the Exchequer rather than raise money.  Concerns were similarly expressed about changing the rules with a view to dealing with a small number of cases, and that for a likely small additional yield generated a disproportionate effect could result on a larger proportion of non residents, and bring the Irish tax regime out of line with international standards.<\/p><p>  The present rules are considered to be consistent with international practice and in particular with OECD standards.  It is the view of the Government that our interests would be best served by operating our residence rules within the best practice guidelines of the OECD.<\/p><p>  I am considering the comments made in the submissions in deciding whether to amend the residence rules at this time.  As with all tax items, the matter is kept under review.

Special accommodation needs refers to the provision of housing and support for people who have a particular need in addition to a housing need to enable them to live in the community.  This includes the elderly, people with disabilities, people who have been homeless and victims of domestic violence.  The Government is aware of the important role played by the Approved Housing Bodies in the provision of housing for those who face difficulty in living in our communities. To the extent that such groups are charities and are engaged in the provision of special needs housing, they should be eligible for the exemption for such housing which is provided for in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012.  I understand that most of the various bodies that comprise the voluntary and co-operative sector in respect of the provision of social housing would have been approved for charitable status by the Revenue Commissioners.  Indeed, such bodies must have such charitable status before they can be approved by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for funding to be used in the provision of social housing.<\/p><p>  However, such groups also provide general needs housing in the same way as a local authority provides such housing.  Depending on the level of local authority funding provided, some voluntary bodies may have flexibility to provide housing for those not eligible for local authority housing.  To provide for a blanket exemption for such bodies would obviously be inequitable vis-&agrave;-vis local authorities, whose properties are subject to the Local Property Tax.  For this reason the Government decided not to accept the recommendation of the inter-Departmental Group chaired by Dr Don Thornhill on the design of a property tax (the &ldquo;Thornhill Group&rdquo;) that all charitable bodies should be exempt but to restrict the exemption to those properties that are used to provide accommodation to persons who, for reasons of old age, physical or mental disability or other cause need special accommodation and support to enable them to live in the community.<\/p><p>  Nonetheless, I acknowledge that government policy places significant emphasis on the approved housing body sector as an important part of social housing supply in the future.

The ESRI\/Central Bank report was published in July last year.  Given the wide variation in the estimated revenue yield from a FTT when different factors are taken into account and the uncertainty as to the form the tax would take, the report states that more detail would be needed on the final shape and scope of the tax before a definitive conclusion could be reached about its impact on the Irish financial system and taxation revenue.<\/p><p><br \/>  The report indicates that the &#8220;net revenue gain for Ireland from the introduction of an FTT &#8230; is likely to be modest&#8221;.  Based on assumptions used by the Commission, the report estimates the potential yield from the FTT to be between &#8364;490m and &#8364;730m.  Under the Commission&#8217;s proposal, 2\/3rd of this yield would have gone directly to the EU to fund its Budget.<\/p><p><br \/>  The report identified the following downsides and potential downsides to the introduction of an FTT:<\/p><p><i>-Financial sector impact<\/i>: An FTT could displace financial sector activity, especially when alternative locations are readily available &#8211; in this case the UK.  This would pose a real risk to Ireland given the financial services sector accounts for 10% of GDP.<\/p><p><i>-Macro-economic impact<\/i>: An FTT would likely lead to a lower level of economic activity in the financial sector, which might also result in lower receipts from income tax and corporation tax.<\/p><p><i>-Exchequer impact: <\/i>A 1% stamp duty applies on transfers of shares in Irish companies.  The Commission&#8217;s proposal would involve the abolition of this tax and the loss of existing Stamp Duty revenue, c. &#8364;195m in 2011 and c. &#8364;170 m in 2012.<\/p><p><br \/>  The report also identified that &#8220;financial firms operating in Ireland may make their decision to stay in Ireland or relocate based on a range of factors, and not solely whether a FTT is applied. These considerations include taxation, the legal and regulatory environment, availability of skilled employees, and general costs of conducting business in Ireland, including the additional potential costs associated with the FTT. Nevertheless, given that several firms in both financial intermediation and fund service providers are large employers within their sectors, concentrated employment losses are a possibility if relocation occurred within those sectors&#8221;.<\/p><p><br \/>  There is also empirical evidence which can be relied on to support the contention that the introduction of an FTT may lead to job losses.  Sweden opposes the European Commission&#8217;s proposed FTT because when it introduced such a tax in 1984 its financial services industry reduced in size, and the tax was eventually repealed in 1990.<\/p><p><br \/>  As previously stated the report was based on the original Commission proposal. There is no revised formal FTT proposal from the Commission at this point &#8211; only a proposal to authorise the introduction of an FTT by enhanced co-operation, rather than a proposal outlining the shape of the FTT itself.  The Commission&#8217;s formal proposal for a Directive implementing enhanced co-operation in the area of financial transactions tax will only be available after the Council vote has taken place to authorise enhanced co-operation.  It is also quite possible that the states who do wish to introduce an FTT may amend the Commission proposal, and in this regard it is worth noting that the new French FTT, introduced in August 2012, is closer to a Stamp Duty than to the current Commission proposal.  I do not propose to request a further analysis unless and until the Commission issues a revised proposal, and any decision to request a further analysis will depend on the form that proposal takes.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputies are aware, Ireland will not be one of the enhanced co-operation countries but we will continue to monitor discussions on the FTT to ensure the compatibility of any proposed measure with the internal market and with existing taxes on financial transactions, including our Stamp Duty; and with a view to protecting our existing financial services business.  As the current EU Presidency, we also have a responsibility to act impartially among Member States in chairing meetings and facilitating discussions on the FTT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700049#WRB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation","counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700049#WRB02500"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[1778\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700049#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the methodology and process that will be used by the Revenue Commissioners in the assessment of the property tax on private homes, local authority properties and those owned by approved housing associations.","asker":"981","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":32,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[1777\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700049#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide an update on the discussions between his Department and the Revenue Commissioners on the detail of the valuation and collection of the property tax.","asker":"969","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":33,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 37 together.<\/p><p>  My Department is in regular contact with the Revenue Commissioners with regard to the implementation of this tax through the Interdepartmental Group which was set up to oversee the introduction of Local Property Tax (LPT) and through bilateral discussions with Revenue.<\/p><p>  The legislation governing the Local Property Tax is contained in Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 and was signed into law by the President on 26 December 2012.  The Act sets out how the tax is to be administered and also provides how a residential property is to be valued for LPT purposes, and I set out at some length in a reply to a series of questions yesterday how various aspects of the tax will be administered.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that LPT is a self-assessment tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the chargeable value of the property.  The Revenue Commissioners will not be valuing properties for LPT purposes except where there is a dispute about a valuation provided by a taxpayer, which, because of the banding system, is expected to be in a minority of cases.<\/p><p>  Revenue is, however, actively preparing valuation guidance and developing tools to assist liable persons in assessing the value of their property which will be made available as soon as possible.  Where these guidelines are used honestly, the property valuation will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter.  The guidelines will include drawing property owner&rsquo;s attention to the publicly available property price register which includes some 62,000 of reasonably recent property prices, and a method to help property owners establish average\/indicative values for properties in different locations.<\/p><p>  For 2013, the charge to LPT is based on the market value of the property on 1 May 2013.  In addition, in order to provide necessary certainty, this initial valuation of the property on 1 May 2013 will be the value of the property for the purposes of calculating the LPT charge for all years up to and including 2016.  This value will hold regardless of improvements, extensions etc. to the property in question.  Likewise, where a property is sold during this period, and the value of the property has increased substantially, there is no additional liability to LPT, once the initial valuation has been given honestly and fairly.<\/p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that beginning in March 2013, they will be issuing property owners an LPT tax return, an information booklet and a Revenue Estimate of LPT.  Having established the market value of their property, property owners are obliged to complete the LPT return in which they calculate the amount of tax they owe and state how they will pay the LPT due from a range of options.  For 2013, the LPT return, if completed in paper form, must be submitted to Revenue by 7 May 2013, whereas, if they complete the form online, it must be submitted by 28 May 2013.<\/p><p>  I am also informed that the payment options available to the property owner include payment in full using a debit or credit card, a single debit authority to deduct from a nominated bank or by way of cash payment to certain service providers.  Alternatively, phased payments can be made by the property owner using direct debit, cash payments or by deduction at source from employment or occupational pension income or from certain payments from the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p><p>  Where a property owner fails to submit his\/her LPT return by the relevant due date, the legislation provides that Revenue can enforce collection of an estimated amount of LPT.  The Revenue Commissioners advise that this Revenue Estimate of LPT is not a valuation of their property nor should it be regarded as an accurate calculation of the amount of LPT that they should pay.  Once property owners meet their obligations by valuing their property, submitting their return and advising Revenue of their payment preference within the relevant time limits, the Revenue Estimate of LPT notified to them is no longer relevant.<\/p><p>  In general, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 provides that local authorities are liable for the tax in the same way as any other residential property owner unless the properties are used to accommodate people with special housing needs.  An approved housing association will be similarly liable for LPT on any residential properties that they own unless these properties are used to accommodate people with special housing needs, provided the housing association operates as a charity and has been granted an exemption for tax purposes by Revenue.  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are currently liaising with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and with the voluntary social housing sector to establish how local authorities and voluntary housing organisations, respectively, will notify any LPT liability that they have to Revenue and how they will pay the amount due.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700049#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Banking Sector","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700049#WRB02900"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[2009\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700049#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the progress made in respect of re-organising Permanent TSB and its plans to meet consumer banking needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>A way forward for Permanent TSB was agreed with the Troika in April 2012 which envisaged it playing an important role in the future of Irish retail banking, being a more focused retail bank bringing an element of competition to the marketplace which has consolidated significantly since 2008.

The additional resources required for 2013 are noted in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Expenditure Report 2013. The Estimate cost for implementation of Property Tax in 2013 is &euro;25.9 million.  In line with standard costs associated with administering and collecting taxes, it is expected that Administrative Budget provisions equivalent to 2% of the annual property tax yield will be required in 2014 and 2015, decreasing to 1% after 2015.  <\/p><p>  I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners have a total of 5734 full time equivalent staff serving out of a new Employment Control Framework number of 5874 FTEs. I am advised that the Commissioners are actively seeking to fill the vacant posts mainly by way of redeployment, but it is proving to be a slow process. <\/p><p>  The ECF includes 100 additional posts approved by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the introduction of Local Property Tax. The deployment of resources to administer the new tax is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners who advise me that many aspects of the tax will be embedded into their existing divisions, such as legislation, IT, the Collector General, the Accountant General etc.  At this stage, it is not possible to be precise about the number of FTEs which will be exclusively involved in the administration of the tax on an ongoing basis, however the Commissioners estimate that across all functions, it will range from 200 up to 400 at peak times. This may include up to 50 Temporary Clerical Officers.  In addition, the Commissioners will contract for external service delivery of some data capture and call centre services.<\/p><p>  The Commissioners further advise me that they have established the nucleus of the Local Property Tax Branch in Ennis, where staff are likely to become available for redeployment in the context of the Government's policy on shared services, specifically in the areas of payroll, banking and financial management.  The Commissioners are deploying additional staff to this Branch by reconfiguring their district structure in the South West and relocating functions from Clare to Limerick.  I am satisfied that if Revenue receives the additional 100 staff which were sanctioned in 2013, they will be in a position to prioritise their resources to ensure the successful implementation of Local Property Tax.  <\/p><p>  Finally, I would like to clarify that the Revenue Commissioners will not be involved as a matter of routine in valuing properties for LPT purposes.  LPT is a self-assessment tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the chargeable value of the property.  Revenue is preparing valuation guidance and developing tools to assist liable persons in assessing the value of their property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":54,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRC01250"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[1787\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will set out by year for 2010, 2011 and 2012, the total of any tax allowance clawbacks sought and the total actually obtained by the Revenue Commissioners pursuant to Section 23 of Chapter 11 of Part 10 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.","asker":"1022","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":56,"content":"<p>I assume the Deputy is referring to the clawback of tax relief associated with rented residential accommodation if the property ceases to qualify within the 10 year holding period.

NAMA advises that project appraisal is still on-going and in majority of cases is subject to achieving suitable planning and resolving infrastructural issues with local authorities. Based on its analyses to date, it expects, as announced in May 2012, to invest at least &euro;2 billion in its Irish assets over the next four years, including new development where this makes commercial sense.  Based on recent Government and industry studies, NAMA&rsquo;s &euro;2 billion investment, which it advises is in addition to the &euro;500 million that had been advanced for projects in Ireland prior to May 2012, would be expected to generate up 25,000 direct and indirect construction jobs and potentially an additional 10,000 jobs in the wider economy.   <\/p><p>  As set out in NAMA&rsquo;s end-of-year review for 2012, which is available on the NAMA website, the timing of actual drawdowns in Ireland is dependent, for certain of the proposed projects, on resolution of planning matters and a number of infrastructure issues with various local authorities.  NAMA advises that this is necessary to enhance the commercial viability of these projects. A number of projects within NAMA&rsquo;s portfolio currently have either an unviable planning permission, reflecting the environment in which they were conceived, or no planning permission.  NAMA advises that it is working closely with local authorities within the Greater Dublin Area and the other metropolitan areas in which its debtors and receivers hold properties to overcome these challenges.   NAMA also advises that, where appropriate, it is funding some infrastructure works to unlock strategic land banks for future development where demand has been confirmed and that its plans are, in this respect, aligned with other state agencies, including IDA.  <\/p><p>  NAMA advises that to end-November 2012 it had approved &euro;1.7 billion in advances to debtors, of which over &euro;1 billion has been drawn down to date, including over &euro;460 million drawn down in respect of a range of commercial, retail and residential development projects across its Irish portfolio.

Employment was in decline while unemployment was still rising. This Government immediately set out about putting the economy on the path to recovery and outlined a number of priorities aimed at fixing our broken banking system, restoring order to our public finances, regaining and enhancing our international competitiveness, supporting the protection and creation of jobs, reforming our system of public administration, and rebuilding Ireland&rsquo;s reputation on the international stage. These priorities have been to the centre of Government policies introduced including the Jobs Initiative in May 2011, the first budget of this Government, Budget 2012 on 6th December 2011, the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs in February 2012 and our second budget last month. <\/p><p>  Since taking office, the economy returned to growth for the first time in three years in 2011 and a second successive year of positive growth was recorded last year. Encouragingly there are signs of a stabilisation of domestic demand in the second half of last year, and there is some evidence that confidence appears to be improving. <\/p><p>  Looking to this year, it is fair to say that the external environment in which the Irish economy operates remains challenging. Despite this, the outlook for 2013 is for a further modest expansion of economic activity, with GDP currently expected to increase by 1.5 per cent in real terms.<\/p><p>  In terms of the public finances, 2012 was a successful year. We continued to meet our targets under the EU\/IMF programme and successfully re-engaged with the international bond markets, where the yields on Irish Government bonds have fallen sharply.<\/p><p>  A return to sustainable growth will require continued efforts to restore order to the public finances and for this year we are targeting a further improvement in the fiscal deficit, which is on course to be below 3 per cent of GDP by 2015. We will also need further improvements in our competitiveness and a banking sector capable of supporting real economic activity. These are the areas in which government policy is focused and will underpin our economic recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Regulation","counter":75,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[2004\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to schedule regular meetings with the public interest directors of the covered banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>Public interest directors do not have a formal reporting relationship to the Minister or to the Department of Finance and as yet I have no plans to schedule regular meetings specifically with the public interest directors of the covered banks. However, I did meet with directors of the Boards of AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB last week at which 5 public interest directors were present. The Deputy should also be aware that officials from my Department meet with representatives of the various banks on a regular basis &ndash; including a monthly management meeting with each covered institution at which the CEO would usually attend. Department officials have held a meeting with AIB on the 14th January, will meet BOI today the 17th January and PTSB on the 31st January. Some directors from the various banks will be in attendance at these meetings. As Minister for Finance, I am strongly committed to ensuring that the boards of the covered institutions act at all times in a manner fully consistent with key public interest objectives for the banking sector.<\/p><p>  As I have stated many times before, the primary duty and responsibility of the public interest directors as well as all the other directors is to ensure that the institution on whose board they serve is run properly and appropriately. The responsibility of public interest directors under company law is to the institution on whose board they serve. <\/p><p>  The legal position is that any director appointed to the board of the covered institutions whether under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 or otherwise is subject to the requirements of company law in relation to the discharge of their responsibilities as a company director. As such, the director is legally bound to act in what he or she believes are the interests of the separate legal entity that is the institution itself. These are the directors so called fiduciary responsibilities. To address the scope for actual and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of the directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances where those institutions have received huge financial support from the State, legal clarity, not just to the role of the public interest director but to that of the entire boards of those institutions, was provided under Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010. It provides that the overriding duty of directors of the covered institutions relates to the public interest as set out in the Act. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Social Housing","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD00550"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[2019\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he expects the National Assets Management Agency to be in a position to provide additional social housing in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>The Deputy may wish to consider my response to a parliamentary question from Deputy Barry Cowen on 13th December 2012, which deals with this matter in some detail.

This represents a very substantial contribution by NAMA in the context of the limited number of available residential properties in Ireland controlled by its debtors and receivers and the range of policy measures being adopted by this Government to meet demand for social housing provision.  <\/p><p>  The onus for determining the suitability for social housing of the units identified by NAMA rests, in the first instance, with the local authorities, which assess, in conjunction with the Housing Agency, the demand for identified houses and apartments by reference to criteria including the avoidance of undue segregation in housing within specific developments and areas.  Once local authorities have confirmed demand for units, the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) are, through the Housing Agency, asked to confirm and progress their interest in leasing or purchasing the units.<\/p><p>  I am advised that to date demand has been confirmed by the local authorities for 1,517 of the properties that NAMA has made available. Another 799 properties are being evaluated bringing the overall total that may be deemed suitable to 2,316 potentially.   The local authorities have confirmed that there is no demand in respect of 982 of the properties. I am advised by NAMA that, in the time required by local authorities to assess and confirm demand for units, 652 properties have been sold or privately let by their owners or duly appointed receivers. <\/p><p>  Of the properties for which demand has been confirmed, 203 units have been delivered for social housing to date under the initiative, contract terms have been signed or agreed in respect of a further 65 properties and negotiations are at an advanced stage in relation to the majority of the remaining units. <\/p><p>  I am advised by NAMA that once demand has been confirmed for units and contracts signed there is no impediment to the early delivery of properties by its debtors and receivers for social housing.  I am further advised by NAMA that it has established a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to acquire units from its debtors and receivers where necessary to speed up their direct leasing to housing authorities.  NAMA advises that once the AHBs have confirmed their demand for and contracted to lease properties it will be in a position to make them available through the SPV.<\/p><p>  NAMA is working very closely with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State for Housing and Planning in relation to this very important initiative and all parties are committed to the maximum possible delivery of residential units in 2013.  The Deputy will appreciate that the housing authorities have a key role in this regard and the Housing Agency is working very closely with these bodies to facilitate delivery of units.    However, the pace at which units are delivered is not controlled by NAMA and I am satisfied that NAMA has brought the initiative as far as it can at this point in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Portfolio","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD00750"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[1767\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there is a liaison facility in place in the National Assets Management Agency for homeowners of properties owned by developers who are under the remit of NAMA in order to resolve ongoing issues of health and safety requirements in these developments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, NAMA has acquired loans from five participating institutions and is not the owner of properties nor is it involved in the day-to-day management of properties. The Agency&rsquo;s role is, like a bank, that of a secured lender.  Other than properties that have been enforced, all of which are listed on NAMA&rsquo;s website and which are managed by the appointed receivers\/administrators, properties continue to be managed by their existing owners or their professional managers\/agents. NAMA takes a very close interest in their efficient management and sale with a view to maximum loan repayment in order to protect the position of the taxpayer.  In this respect, the existing legal owners or, in the case of enforcement, the duly appointed receivers\/administrators are responsible for the efficient management of properties.  NAMA requires that its debtors and receivers comply with highest standards in the management of properties, including compliance with all statutory and planning obligations. Queries relating to individual properties should, in this context, be addressed to the existing legal owners or appointed insolvency practitioners.  However, NAMA, through its email address, info@nama.ie, facilitates members of the public who wish to notify purchaser interest or raise issues of concern in respect of properties that form security for its loans.  It should be noted that, while NAMA is prohibited from disclosing the identity of debtors and details of their properties, the Agency advises that it ensures that debtors are aware of any potential purchaser interest or other issues that have been raised in respect to their properties.       <\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that NAMA has established a dedicated email address to facilitate members of the Oireachtas in raising issues of concern to their constituents and that it has addressed a large number of such queries from TDs and Senators.   <\/p><p>  On the general issue, the Deputy may be aware that NAMA is fully engaged in both the formulation and implementation of public policy aimed at addressing the issue of unfinished housing estates.

In terms of the exposure of NAMA debtors and receivers to unfinished housing estates, NAMA advises that of the 243 estates categorised as the most problematic from a public safety perspective, Category 4 estates, 29 or 12% are controlled by its debtors and receivers and 150 or 10% of Category 3 estates are controlled by its debtors and receivers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Levels","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[1987\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will confirm that according to his own projections that there will a 0% increase in the net level of unemployment by the end of 2013 and that even if his projections are realised unemployment will drop by in the region of 2% by the end of 2015; if he will respond to the projections of the Nevin institute that unemployment may even rise over that period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1015","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[1989\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will confirm that according to his Department's own projections that there will a 0% increase in the net level of unemployment by the end of 2013 and that even if his projections are realised unemployment will drop by in the region of 2% by the end of 2015; if he will respond to the projections of the Nevin institute that unemployment may even rise over that period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1032","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 49 together. <\/p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s most recent forecasts, as published on Budget Day, are for employment growth of 0.2 per cent in 2013. The pace of employment growth is projected to pick-up thereafter, with the result that unemployment is expected to fall to just over 13 per cent by the end of 2015. These forecasts are broadly in line with those of other institutions, with the IMF forecasting an unemployment rate of 13.4 per cent in 2015, while the consensus of the private sector, published in December, is for an unemployment rate of 12.5 per cent by end-2015.<\/p><p>  The Nevin Institute&rsquo;s forecasts are predicated on the assumption of average GDP growth of 0.9 per cent between 2012 and 2015, which is significantly lower than the growth forecasted by both the Department (2.0 per cent) and other forecasters. For instance, the IMF is projecting annual average growth of 1.6 per cent over the period, while the private sector consensus is forcasting average growth of 2.0 per cent over the period.<\/p><p>  While unemployment remains stubbornly high, recent trends seem to suggest that some stabilisation has now taken place, with the seasonally adjusted standardised rate at 14.6 per cent in December, having fallen from a peak of 15.0 per cent in February. The Government remains committed to tackling the unacceptably high level of unemployment persisting in Ireland today and creating and sustaining jobs continues to be our main priority. A number of measures were introduced in Budget 2013 to assist in this regard, including several initiative designed to lend support to Ireland&rsquo;s job-rich SMEs.<\/p><p>  However, efforts to address the current employment levels do not stop at Budget 2013. As the Deputy will be aware, I attended the Cabinet Meeting for Jobs today, in which my fellow Ministers and I set forth our respective Department&rsquo;s proposals to improve the climate for employment growth as part of the Action Plan for Jobs. On the back of this, the Government plans to introduce policy initiatives which will further aid the creation of employment and complement measures previously introduced, such as the VAT reduction for the tourist industry, which research published by my Department indicates has already contributed to employment growth in the accommodation and food services sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regulatory Impact Assessments","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD01250"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[1933\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRD01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a detailed regulatory impact assessment was made in advance of the introduction of the local property tax; if so, if it will be made available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":90,"content":"<p>The Local Property Tax was legislated for by way of The Finance (Local Property Tax) Bill 2012.

This package was agreed in the context of the statement by Euro Area Heads of State or Government that the scale of the Greek problem is so large that it requires special attention. <\/p><p>  In this regard, on November 26th euro zone finance ministers agreed to partly reschedule Greece's debt, and offer several other measures to alleviate the country&rsquo;s financial burden. Taken together, these actions are expected to cut Greece's debt by up to 20 percentage points of GDP by 2020. This will bring its debt to GDP level to 124% in 2020, and a debt to GDP level of below 110% is targeted for 2022.<\/p><p>  The measures agreed include:<\/p><p>  - a debt buyback of  bonds held by private investors;<\/p><p>  - a reduction of 100 basis points (bp) in the interest rate on the Greek loan facility. Other program countries, such as Ireland, are not required to participate while they are in programs;<\/p><p>  - the guarantee commitment fee on EFSF loans, amounting to 10 basis points per annum, is to be cancelled;<\/p><p>  - maturities will be extended to 30 years, an increase of 15 years;<\/p><p>  - interest payments on EFSF loans will be deferred for 10 years; and,<\/p><p>  - the SMP measure: Member States will pass on to Greece's segregated account, an amount equivalent to the income on the Securities Market Programme (SMP) portfolio accruing to their national central bank as from budget year 2013.  Again Member States under a full financial assistance programme are not required to participate in this scheme for the period in which they \treceive financial assistance. <\/p><p>  The last of these, the SMP measure, involves a transfer of an accounting profit, but does not involve any retirement of debt by Greece.  <\/p><p>  It is important to note that the concessions that have been agreed are specific to Greece and are accompanied by significant additional conditionality. In Ireland on the other hand we have entered the final year of our programme.

The transaction followed an initial approach by a number of investment banks to the Department late last year which indicated that there was sizeable investor interest in the State&rsquo;s CCN instruments and particularly the holding in Bank of Ireland.  The Sale was managed by officials in the Department&rsquo;s Shareholder Management Unit, with many years&rsquo; experience working in financial markets and was not only timed to take advantage of the improving sentiment towards Ireland and its banks but the huge rally seen in international debt markets which has continued into 2013.<\/p><p>  The transaction when announced saw the State presented with the opportunity to dispose of a minimum of &euro;500 million of its position at a price of par. This stemmed from an underwriting commitment provided by the consortium of banks &ndash; UBS, Deutsche Bank and Davy &ndash; having done a preliminary assessment of market appetite for the notes.  In the end the book build process generated significant excess demand to enable the State to dispose of its entire holding in the CCN&rsquo;s at a price of 101% of their par value plus accrued interest. This generated a profit for the State of &euro;10 million.  Taking account of the coupon paid to the State last year, the taxpayer has earned a total return of over 15% in the space of 18 months.<\/p><p>  My officials had full visibility during the book build and pricing phases and were also provided with some valuation advice from NCB Stockbrokers which helped inform their judgement.  The transaction was well received in the market and indeed the CCN&rsquo;s traded a few points higher in the after-market during their first few days of trading.  This reflects a market recognition of a very successful transaction for Ireland, one in which we have exited this element of support to our banks with a profit. It points to a recognition that Ireland is successfully working to correct the very deep failings that have affected us in the past number of years.  In recognising this, however, we must also acknowledge that this after market price is for a very small volume of stock compared with the &euro;1billion size of the transaction.<\/p><p>  The transaction settled on Tuesday the 15th of January and the State was paid proceeds of just over &euro;1,056 million, comprising the nominal principal amount of &euro;1,000 million, interest accrued of over &euro;46 million covering the period 29th July 2012 to the disposal date, and a profit of &euro;10 million.<\/p><p>  Further details regarding the CCN&rsquo;s can be found in Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s 2011 Annual Report, including information relating to its&rsquo; accounting treatment.

Taken as a whole, these budgets have been progressive in nature over the period and this is reflected in the ESRI&rsquo;s analysis.  While the ESRI report states that the budget had a larger proportional impact on the lowest income group than the higher income groups it should be noted that the difference is quite small at half a per cent. Indeed the report states that for the budget to impose an equal burden on high and low income groups the adjustment on the higher group would have to be 5 times that of the lower income group.  In addition, some of the measures which their methodology was unable to take into account would have had a progressive impact on incomes.  Changes to the USC, DIRT and capital gains tax are considered by the ESRI to be of a progressive nature. In addition, increasing capital gains tax limits the benefit accruing to those who have the capacity to translate labour income into capital income and thereby contributes towards a fairer tax system.  The ESRI have also regarded the property tax liability that can be deferred by low income individuals or couples as reducing their disposable income in 2013.  I disagree with this approach and as such I believe that the outcome for individuals in the lower deciles is likely to be better than reported by the ESRI in its analysis.<\/p><p>  Finally, the yearly budgetary adjustments must be seen in the context of the overall Irish taxation system. Using tax unit data from the Revenue Commissioners it should be noted that the top 23% of income earners paid 77% of the total income tax take for 2011.  In addition, our entry point to income tax is &euro;16,500, which at 51% of the average wage is the highest entry point in the OECD. The next closest is Italy at 28%.  This shows that despite the fiscal consolidation that has taken place over the last five years Ireland has maintained a highly progressive system of taxation.  In its 2012 report &lsquo;Taxing Wages&rsquo;, the OECD acknowledged that the Irish tax system is one of the most progressive in the OECD for both single and married couples (with two children).

This comparative report looked at 183 countries and calculated the effective rate based on the tax obligations of a standardised company operating in each country, using standard assumptions regarding exemptions, deductions and allowances.  I also referred to a study by the European Commission (<i>Taxation Trends in the EU 2011<\/i>), which indicates Ireland has an effective corporate tax rate which is close to or indeed higher than the statutory 12.5% rate (this is likely because of the 25% rate that applies generally to non-trading income).<\/p><p><br \/>  I have been clear that my Department does not take ownership of these figures, but rather I have quoted them to give an example of the differences that exist in comparative studies on effective tax rates, depending on how the rate is calculated or who carries out the calculation.<\/p><p><br \/>  The issue relates to the absence of an international standard methodology of how to calculate the &#8216;effective rate&#8217;, not to the &#8220;lack of data&#8221; in relation to corporation tax paid.  Detailed data is contained in the Statistical Reports which are published annually by the Revenue Commissioners on their website &#8211; <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.revenue.ie<\/font><\/i>.  In addition I would refer the Deputies to the tables contained in the response to Parliamentary Question 1739, which will shortly be published in the 2011 report on the website of the Revenue Commissioners and which set out the corporation tax figures for 2010 in full.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am aware of recent media reports which refer to the ways that some companies structure their international tax affairs to minimise their tax costs, and the fact that some of these reports make reference to Irish companies being part of these structures.  I understand that some of these reports have suggested that some companies in multinational groups pay Irish corporation tax at rates that are significantly lower than 12.5%.  <\/p><p><br \/>  It is important to state clearly that such companies are not paying a low rate of Irish tax &#8211; all companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on their profits which are generated in Ireland.  The reports concerned appear to have incorrectly attributed to Ireland profits that represent the return due to assets in other jurisdictions, owned by group companies that are not resident in Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is incorrect to relate the 12.5% corporation tax rate to both the profits of the Irish-resident group companies <i>and<\/i>   the profits of foreign-resident group companies&#8212; which are not profits chargeable to Irish corporation tax.  By mixing up the Irish profits and the foreign profits of multinational groups like this, these reports can produce an average tax rate for the companies concerned that is very significantly lower than 12.5% &#8212; and an incorrect inference that the full Irish profits are not being charged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRE01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Property Construction","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRE01250"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[1784\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason the National Asset Management Agency no longer produces a comprehensive monthly list of foreclosed property in a manner which would allow potential customers to easily see the additions during the month.","asker":"1028","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":116,"content":"<p>NAMA advises that, based on user feedback, the majority of users of its enforced properties website are interested in properties that are available within their own geographical areas for rent or purchase.

One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.  The Economic Management Council meets the banks on a regular basis and discusses the key issues pertaining to this priority.  My officials also meet regularly with key stakeholders at the forum of the SME Funding Consultation Committee. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion this year and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks have reported that they achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to the lending targets imposed on the banks,<b><\/b>the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets.  The banks will shortly be submitting their lending plans for 2013 to my Department. My Department, in conjunction with the CRO, will analyse the plans and meet the banks to discuss any issues of note. The banks also meet with the Department of Finance and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.  The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by the Department.<\/p><p><br \/>  The CRO can review decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities, including applications for restructured credit facilities, from &#8364;1,000 up to &#8364;500,000.  The CRO is currently overturning 55% of the refusal decisions referred to them and anyone who has been refused credit by the banks should avail of the services of the CRO.  I have received a small number of representations from individual SMEs regarding the availability of credit. I have referred some of these SMEs to the Credit Review Office which has been able to provide assistance. <\/p><p><br \/>  I recently sanctioned the appointment of six additional reviewers in the Credit Review Office to ensure that SMEs appealing the banks&#8217; decisions to decline credit receive a considered and timely response to their application.<\/p><p><br \/>  The credit stream available to SMEs now includes the Microenterprise Loan scheme which will facilitate up to &#8364;40million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.  In addition, the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme can facilitate up to &#8364;150m per annum of additional credit.  The Scheme is designed for SME&#8217;s who, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.<\/p><p><br \/>  Last week, the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) announced investment commitments to a suite of three new long-term funds which will provide equity, credit and restructuring\/recovery investment for Irish SMEs and mid-sized corporates.  The NPRF is also currently reviewing additional SME fund opportunities that would complement these commitments, with the objective that the eventual suite of funds would have the capacity to invest across the full spectrum of SME financing needs.<\/p><p><br \/>  Late last year, I published the latest independent report on the demand for credit by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) on my Department&#8217;s website.  This covered the period April to September 2012.  This survey is the most comprehensive survey of SME Credit Demand in Ireland covering over 1,500 respondents.  The contract for the survey contained an option to complete a further survey for the following six month period.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery.  However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":127,"content":"<p>Question No. 48 answered with Question No. 45.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":128,"content":"<p>Question No. 49 answered with Question No. 34.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":130,"content":"<p>Question No. 50 answered with Question No. 36.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Real Estate Investment Trusts","counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRF00250"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[1782\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to his announcement of introducing legislation to give effect to Real Estate Investment Trusts, if he has consulted with the National Asset Management Agency with respect to its planned launch of Qualified Investor Funds; and if NAMA remains committed to launching QIFs in view of his announcement with respect to REITs.","asker":"1080","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>I am advised by NAMA that it is very supportive of the Government&rsquo;s decision to introduce REITs legislation.

The close company surcharges apply to Irish resident companies which are controlled by five or fewer participators (shareholders, directors and their associates) or by participators who are all directors.  The surcharge is designed to discourage the retention and accumulation of investment and rental income in such companies and is effectively an anti-avoidance measure aimed at countering attempts to avoid personal income tax on passive non-trading income retained within a company.  <\/p><p>  Further there are 2 rates of corporation tax, one relating to trading income and the other broadly relating to non-trading (or passive) income.

This opinion is at odds with much of the recent indicators on the Irish housing market.  Data from the CSO's Residential Property Price Index show that national prices have been broadly stable for the last nine months, with prices in Dublin experiencing upward price pressure in the latter part of 2012.  Also, recent statements by both Daft.ie and myHome.ie have pointed to signs of stabilisation in the some areas in the fourth quarter of 2012.  While I cannot presume to forecast the market I do not share Fitch's pessimism.<\/p><p>    As to the possible effects of the Local Property Tax on residential property prices, work completed by researchers in the ESRI before the introduction of the tax concluded that a property tax at a rate of 0.4% would result in a small increase in the user cost of housing, thereby putting some downward pressure on housing demand.  The Local Property Tax rate of 0.18% (for houses up to &euro;1m in value) is less than half the rate used in the ESRI analysis and as such the impact on housing demand is likely to be minimal.<\/p><p>  In addition, the rental market is a competitive market with many suppliers and renters.

The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) does not specifically deal with these, rather it sets out procedures to deal with borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears on a mortgage loan which is secured by their primary residence. All regulated mortgage lenders must comply with the requirements of this Code.  The CCMA can also be accessed on the Central Bank&#8217;s website.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Code provides that mortgage lenders should allow for a flexible approach in the handling of arrears and pre-arrears cases and that they should aim at assisting the borrower who is in genuine difficulty as far as possible having regard to the specific circumstances. In particular, the CCMA provides that a lender&#8217;s Arrears Support Unit (ASU) must base its assessment of the borrower&#8217;s case on the full circumstances of the borrower including:<\/p><p>-  the personal circumstances of the borrower<\/p><p>-  the overall indebtedness of the borrower<\/p><p>-  the information provided in the standard financial statement (SFS)<\/p><p>-  the borrower&#8217;s current repayment capacity, and<\/p><p>-  the borrower&#8217;s previous history<\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, the CCMA requires that &#8216;A lender must have a dedicated section on its website for borrowers in, or concerned about, financial difficulties which must include: <\/p><p>-  the information booklet required under provision 12; <\/p><p>-  information on the level of charges that may be imposed on borrowers that do not co-operate with the lender; and <\/p><p>-  a link to any website operated by the MABS that contains information about mortgage arrears.&#8217; <\/p><p><br \/>  The information on the website must be easily accessible from a prominent link on the lender&#8217;s home page.   Some lenders have developed budgeting tools and videos to help customers complete the SFS and FAQ sections on mortgage arrears and forbearance arrangements on their websites.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The Code also requires that &#8216;A lender must prepare and make available to borrowers, an information booklet providing details of its Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which must include: <\/p><p>-  an explanation of its MARP, including the alternative repayment measures available to borrowers and outline in general terms, the lender&#8217;s criteria for assessing requests for alternative repayment measures; <\/p><p>-  a statement that the borrower will not be required to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type; <\/p><p>-  information about the potential availability of relevant State supports such as mortgage interest relief or Mortgage Interest Supplement; <\/p><p>-  relevant contact points (i.e., the dedicated arrears contact points not the general customer service contact points); and <\/p><p>-  reference to relevant website(s) operated by the Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS)&#8217;. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Central Bank has informed me that it recently wrote to all lenders to remind them of these provisions and that their MARP booklet and websites should be updated to include the longer term options as they are rolled out and to make reference to the Government initiatives in this area.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to overall household indebtedness, the latest Central Bank data show that at the end of the second quarter of last year, total household indebtedness amounted to &#8364;178.5 billion.

The continuum of assessment allows for the identification of pupils with special educational needs, their nature and severity by harnessing the experience of class teachers and support teachers, in consultation with parents, and with the support of the psychologist.  It also provides for the development of immediate responses and interventions designed to ameliorate the particular needs identified at the appropriate level, either in the classroom or with the assistance of the support teacher.  This allows for a response to be put in place at the earliest possible juncture for students before their difficulties can become intractable.  Assessment of needs at this stage of the continuum involves information gathering, testing and observation by the various school personnel involved and support from the NEPS psychologist, as required.<\/p><p>  Where the pupil does not make adequate progress following the interventions, or where the nature of the child's special educational needs are significant, severe and complex, the school may agree with the psychologist that a psycho-educational assessment be conducted to identify the specific nature of the needs and the appropriate response necessary.  Students, so identified, are scheduled for assessment within that school year.  There is therefore no quota applied to schools under the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRJ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Redeployment","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRJ01250"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[2066\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRJ01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding primary teachers panel rights in 2013 (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":220,"content":"<p>The core function of the redeployment arrangements is to facilitate the redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers to other schools that have vacancies.

SNAs are allocated to schools in order to provide for the care needs of children with special educational needs attending such schools.  The policy of my Department in relation to the SNA scheme is set out in Circular 07\/02, which also provides details regarding the role and duties of an SNA.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.<\/p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that SNAs are not allocated to individual pupils. The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children, rather than solely by reference to a pupils' disability categorisation.  SNAs should then be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.<\/p><p>  All schools have been advised by the NCSE of their SNA staffing allocations for the current school year. Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to each school are available at www.ncse.ie, detailed on a County basis.  Where a school considers that they do not have adequate SNA support from within their allocated provision to provide for the care needs of all qualifying pupils, or where schools have enrolled new students with special educational needs, they may apply to the NCSE to have their SNA allocation reviewed and the NCSE has capacity to make additional allocations to schools. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Appeals","counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRK00450"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[2158\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRK00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Mayo has been denied the higher education grant; if he will have Student Universal Support Ireland re-examine their application with a view to awarding the grant as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department have confirmed with Student Universal Support Ireland that the grant application of the student referred to by the Deputy for the 2012\/13 academic year was awarded a postgraduate fee contribution based on the terms and conditions of the scheme.

Such aid must be in accordance with the Regional Aid Map 2007-13 approved by the European Commission.  This Map was drawn up in accordance with the Commission&rsquo;s Regional Aid Guidelines 2007-2013.  The eligible regions and applicable aid rates in Ireland for the 7 year period are set out in the Irish map.  The Commission&rsquo;s Regional Aid Guidelines afford the possibility to Member States to amend the list of regions eligible for Regional Aid or the applicable aid intensities only once during the relevant 7 year period, by way of a mid-term review.  Hence, there is no scope to increase population coverage under the current RAGs.<\/p><p>In selecting the areas within the overall Southern and Eastern (NUTS) Level II Region (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) that could, in addition to the BMW (Border, Midlands and West) Region, be designated for the Regional Aid Map 2007-2013, Ireland had to observe a strict EU requirement that the areas selected be relatively more in need of economic development than the better off regions of the EU.  The Southern &amp; Eastern Regional Assembly was consulted for its views.  The Assembly accepted the findings of an independent report, which it commissioned from the National Institute for Spatial and Regional Analysis at NUI Maynooth.  The Assembly&rsquo;s proposals were included in the proposed Regional Aid Map that the European Commission approved in 2006.<\/p><p>The process of Member States agreeing the 2014-2021 Regional Aid Guidelines is underway and initial multilateral discussions between Member States and the Commission, which has responsibility for the Regional Aid Guidelines, have taken place.

My Department is actively engaged in this process and has consulted relevant stakeholders including various Government Departments, the industrial development agencies, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Forf&aacute;s, the Central Statistics Office, the Border Midland and Western Regional Assembly, the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly, and the eight Regional Authorities.<\/p><p>The Commission issued a non paper setting out its initial orientations in December 2011, which was followed by a multilateral meeting in March 2012.  The Commission subsequently forwarded further proposals to Member States on 14 January 2013, documenting the structure and provisions that will form the basis of the revised Guidelines.

Access to cancel a fixed charge notice through PULSE is restricted to users with the rank of inspector or higher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Penalty Point System","counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRR00150"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[2104\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRR00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason he has not requested the Garda Ombudsman to conduct an inquiry, under the direction of a judge, as provided in the 2005 Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, into allegations of the writing off of tens of thousand of fixed charge penalty notices.","asker":"1015","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":392,"content":"<p>The only circumstances in which I may, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, request the Garda Ombudsman Commission to investigate a matter is where it appears to me that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings.<\/p><p>  As I have informed the Deputy previously, documentation containing allegations concerning the enforcement of traffic legislation were forwarded by my Department to the Garda Commissioner.

It is important to remember that while some Garda stations are listed for revised opening hours from 24 hour stations, they will remain as functioning Garda stations on a 24 hour basis.  The full list of these details is available in the Policing Plan which is available in the Oireachtas Library. <\/p><p>  The Commissioner has concluded that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front-line if particular stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained or if the public opening hours of other stations could be reduced at off-peak times.  In making that decision he has reiterated the commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to providing a professional and effective service to all communities, including those in rural areas.  Specifically regarding Kanturk, while the station there will remain as a working Garda station, the District will be apportioned between the Mallow District in the Cork North Division and the Macroom District in the Cork West Division.  The local Divisional Officers have been tasked with developing a comprehensive consultation strategy together with a tailored implementation plan that will meet the particular needs of their Divisions. <\/p><p>  The intention is that at all times optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established as a priority.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.  Due to its particular relevance, it has also been decided to include domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services within the Agency's responsibilities.  The Government has further decided that the new Agency will assume responsibility for the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  These two organisations currently operate under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The draft legislation will also provide for the provision of community-based psychology services to children and families by the Agency.  It is envisaged that this will involve the transfer of certain psychology staff currently employed by the HSE who are operating within a community setting.  <\/p><p>  The Government's consideration of these matters was informed, inter alia, by the content and recommendations of the Report of the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency which I published in July 2012.  I share the view of the Task Force that in order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency must have a broader focus than child protection.  It is my intention that the Agency will be as broadly based as possible and that it should include those services that (i) may prevent problems arising for a family in the first instance (ii) identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and (iii) assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  <\/p><p>  Arising from the Government's consideration and decision with regard to the functions of the new Agency, it has been agreed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health that an impact analysis will be jointly developed regarding the proposed future arrangements for the provision of the community psychology service as it relates to children and family services covered by the Child and Family Support Agency and to services provided by the HSE.  This work will be undertaken as a priority.<\/p><p>  I recently met with representatives from the Heads of the Psychology Services Ireland and with a delegation from the IMPACT trade union to discuss issues relating to the future governance and organisational arrangements for the provision of community based psychology services.

The issue of illegal registrations of births is a matter for the General Registrations Office (GRO) under the remit of the Department of Social Protection.  The GRO have advised that historically birth registration was based on a presumption of honesty and that cases of illegal registrations are referred to the Gardai S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p>  I am informed by the Adoption Authority of Ireland that in mid-2010 the then Adoption Board conducted a review of information it retained of contact received from persons seeking to trace their natural parents where no adoption records existed.  This exercise indicated that 99 people who had identified themselves to the Board as adopted, did not have a corresponding adoption file.  Around 45 of these cases related to people born after 1953 and the balance related to persons born pre-1953.<\/p><p>  A further 20 applications have since been made.  The AAI have advised that approximately 50% of those who register are natural mothers seeking to trace their child while the other 50% are adults seeking to trace their natural parent(s).  Many adults seeking to trace their natural parent(s) have 'Birth Certificates' which state that persons other than their natural parents were their natural parents.  In many cases they are aware that the details contained in the Register of Births are false and that their birth was registered incorrectly.<\/p><p>  As no adoption took place there would be no adoption file and the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) can be of limited assistance.  While the AAI has no statutory role in instances of illegal registrations of births it does facilitate the information and tracing process for such illegal registrations to the extent open to it, in particular through the National Contact Preference Register.  When the former Adoption Board launched the National Adoption Contact Preference Register  in 2005, provision was made for persons, who were party to the illegal registration of a child, to register an interest in the Register for possible future contact contact with another party sometime in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Redeployment","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRV01350"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[2744\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRV01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide by Department\/Agency basis the number of persons who are seeking transfers to other locations; the number of transfers that took place in 2012 on a county basis on the number of transfers that took place in 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":528,"content":"<p>The  mechanisms currently available to staff in my Department seeking a voluntary transfer to another location is directly  through the Central Applications facility run by Public Applications Services (for remaining decentralisation locations) or to source a \"Head to Head\" transfer by directly contacting  a person willing to transfer with them.

The programme has been introduced on a phased basis to men and women between the ages of 60-69 years.  When fully implemented the programme will offer free screening to men and women aged 55-74 every two years.  As 50% of cancers within this age group are found in people aged 60-69 the programme has begun with this latter age cohort (a population of approximately 500,000).  It is anticipated that the first screening round will take up to three years to complete.  Over time the phasing of the programme will allow development of colonoscopy capacity to cater for the full 55-74 year age group.  The estimated cost of the programme in 2013, based on an uptake rate of 60% among the target population, is &euro;4.3m with further costs in subsequent years as the programme expands.  The programme has been shown through a Health Technology Assessment to be cost effective as it will very quickly reduce mortality among the screened population.  While a multi-annual budget has not been set aside for the Programme, it will continue to be prioritised into the future.

The Minister for Health is working to ensure that protection is afforded to the disability sector, and the Social Care area as a whole.  In 2013 the HSE is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintaining a consistent level to that provided in 2012 by providing the following specialist disability services:<\/p><p>- residential services to over 9,000 people with a disability;<\/p><p>- day services to over 22,000 people with intellectual and physical disabilities;<\/p><p>- respite residential support for over 7,500 people with intellectual and physical disabilities;<\/p><p>- 1.68m hours of Personal Assistant \/ Home Support Hours;<\/p><p>  With regards to staffing levels the Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets. The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction.  This policy requires that by the end of 2013, the health service achieves a workforce of 98,955 whole time equivalents (WTEs).  This is a very challenging target given the level of staff reductions that have been achieved in recent years.  In order to mitigate the impact on frontline services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  Therefore, the HSE is using the provisions of the Public Service Agreement to bring about greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters, redeployment and other changes to achieve more efficient delivery of services.<\/p><p>  Staff reductions will be pursued throughout 2013 through natural turnover (retirements and resignations) and such other targeted measures or initiatives as may be determined by Government in relation to the health sector or the wider public service.  The HSE National Service Plan provides for investment of an additional 1,025 WTEs in a number of key prioritised areas, as well as the completion of the 2012 mental health investment programme (400+) posts.  Also, a graduate nurse employment programme will be implemented, involving the recruitment of up to 1,000 nurses on two-year contracts.  This will provide additional nursing capacity at service level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRY00400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drugs Payment Scheme","counter":597,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRY00450"},{"type":"question","counter":598,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[2255\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRY00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way he will reduce the State's drug bill; the savings that will be made over the next three years; the legislation and agreements that will be necessary to deliver these savings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":599,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[2256\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRY00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the State's drug bill for 2012, broken down by scheme, Health Service Executive area, drug type, generic, branded on-patent, branded off-patent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":600,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 and 221 together.<\/p><p>  Regarding the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits including:<\/p><p>- significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs;<\/p><p>- a lowering of the drugs bill to the State;<\/p><p>- timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and;<\/p><p>- reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.<\/p><p>  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years.  &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years.  Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.  The Department of Health and the HSE have also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  The Bill provides that when the HSE is setting a reference price for, or reviewing a reference price set for, a relevant group of interchangeable medicinal products it shall take into account the following criteria:<\/p><p>- the ability of suppliers to meet patient demand for the relevant item;<\/p><p>- the value for money afforded by the relevant item;<\/p><p>- the equivalent prices of the relevant item in all other Member States where the product is marketed;<\/p><p>- the prices of therapeutically similar items; and<\/p><p>- the resources available to the HSE.<\/p><p>  It is important to balance achieving best value for money for the taxpayer with assuring continuity of supply for critical medical products, particularly in a small market like Ireland.  Consequently, the Bill aims to achieve value for money while avoiding disruption in the availability of medicines on the Irish market.  In relation to the State's drug bill, I wish to advise that the information is being collated by the HSE and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Psychological Service","counter":601,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[2257\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700050#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his proposals to transfer clinical psychologist post from the Health Service Executive to the new Child and Family Support Agency; the consultation and engagements with professional bodies and unions that have taken place in advance of this move; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":603,"content":"<p>No final decision has been made on the proposed transfer of community psychologists from the Health Service Executive to the new Child and Family Support Agency which is due to be established later this year.

Employment was in decline while unemployment was still rising. This Government immediately set out about putting the economy on the path to recovery and outlined a number of priorities aimed at fixing our broken banking system, restoring order to our public finances, regaining and enhancing our international competitiveness, supporting the protection and creation of jobs, reforming our system of public administration, and rebuilding Ireland&rsquo;s reputation on the international stage. These priorities have been to the centre of Government policies introduced including the Jobs Initiative in May 2011, the first budget of this Government, Budget 2012 on 6th December 2011, the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs in February 2012 and our second budget last month. <\/p><p>  Since taking office, the economy returned to growth for the first time in three years in 2011 and a second successive year of positive growth was recorded last year. Encouragingly there are signs of a stabilisation of domestic demand in the second half of last year, and there is some evidence that confidence appears to be improving. <\/p><p>  Looking to this year, it is fair to say that the external environment in which the Irish economy operates remains challenging. Despite this, the outlook for 2013 is for a further modest expansion of economic activity, with GDP currently expected to increase by 1.5 per cent in real terms.<\/p><p>  In terms of the public finances, 2012 was a successful year. We continued to meet our targets under the EU\/IMF programme and successfully re-engaged with the international bond markets, where the yields on Irish Government bonds have fallen sharply.<\/p><p>  A return to sustainable growth will require continued efforts to restore order to the public finances and for this year we are targeting a further improvement in the fiscal deficit, which is on course to be below 3 per cent of GDP by 2015. We will also need further improvements in our competitiveness and a banking sector capable of supporting real economic activity.

NAMA advises that it has identified 3,879 residential properties controlled by its debtors and receivers as being available for social housing provision.  This represents a very substantial contribution by NAMA in the context of the limited number of available residential properties in Ireland controlled by its debtors and receivers and the range of policy measures being adopted by this Government to meet demand for social housing provision.  <\/p><p>  The onus for determining the suitability for social housing of the units identified by NAMA rests, in the first instance, with the local authorities, which assess, in conjunction with the Housing Agency, the demand for identified houses and apartments by reference to criteria including the avoidance of undue segregation in housing within specific developments and areas.  Once local authorities have confirmed demand for units, the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) are, through the Housing Agency, asked to confirm and progress their interest in leasing or purchasing the units.<\/p><p>  I am advised that to date demand has been confirmed by the local authorities for 1,517 of the properties that NAMA has made available. Another 799 properties are being evaluated bringing the overall total that may be deemed suitable to 2,316 potentially.   The local authorities have confirmed that there is no demand in respect of 982 of the properties. I am advised by NAMA that, in the time required by local authorities to assess and confirm demand for units, 652 properties have been sold or privately let by their owners or duly appointed receivers. <\/p><p>  Of the properties for which demand has been confirmed, 203 units have been delivered for social housing to date under the initiative, contract terms have been signed or agreed in respect of a further 65 properties and negotiations are at an advanced stage in relation to the majority of the remaining units. <\/p><p>  I am advised by NAMA that once demand has been confirmed for units and contracts signed there is no impediment to the early delivery of properties by its debtors and receivers for social housing.  I am further advised by NAMA that it has established a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to acquire units from its debtors and receivers where necessary to speed up their direct leasing to housing authorities.  NAMA advises that once the AHBs have confirmed their demand for and contracted to lease properties it will be in a position to make them available through the SPV.<\/p><p>  NAMA is working very closely with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State for Housing and Planning in relation to this very important initiative and all parties are committed to the maximum possible delivery of residential units in 2013.  The Deputy will appreciate that the housing authorities have a key role in this regard and the Housing Agency is working very closely with these bodies to facilitate delivery of units.

The Agency&rsquo;s role is, like a bank, that of a secured lender.  Other than properties that have been enforced, all of which are listed on NAMA&rsquo;s website and which are managed by the appointed receivers\/administrators, properties continue to be managed by their existing owners or their professional managers\/agents. NAMA takes a very close interest in their efficient management and sale with a view to maximum loan repayment in order to protect the position of the taxpayer.  In this respect, the existing legal owners or, in the case of enforcement, the duly appointed receivers\/administrators are responsible for the efficient management of properties.  NAMA requires that its debtors and receivers comply with highest standards in the management of properties, including compliance with all statutory and planning obligations. Queries relating to individual properties should, in this context, be addressed to the existing legal owners or appointed insolvency practitioners.  However, NAMA, through its email address, info@nama.ie, facilitates members of the public who wish to notify purchaser interest or raise issues of concern in respect of properties that form security for its loans.  It should be noted that, while NAMA is prohibited from disclosing the identity of debtors and details of their properties, the Agency advises that it ensures that debtors are aware of any potential purchaser interest or other issues that have been raised in respect to their properties.       <\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that NAMA has established a dedicated email address to facilitate members of the Oireachtas in raising issues of concern to their constituents and that it has addressed a large number of such queries from TDs and Senators.   <\/p><p>  On the general issue, the Deputy may be aware that NAMA is fully engaged in both the formulation and implementation of public policy aimed at addressing the issue of unfinished housing estates.

The pace of employment growth is projected to pick-up thereafter, with the result that unemployment is expected to fall to just over 13 per cent by the end of 2015. These forecasts are broadly in line with those of other institutions, with the IMF forecasting an unemployment rate of 13.4 per cent in 2015, while the consensus of the private sector, published in December, is for an unemployment rate of 12.5 per cent by end-2015.<\/p><p>  The Nevin Institute&rsquo;s forecasts are predicated on the assumption of average GDP growth of 0.9 per cent between 2012 and 2015, which is significantly lower than the growth forecasted by both the Department (2.0 per cent) and other forecasters. For instance, the IMF is projecting annual average growth of 1.6 per cent over the period, while the private sector consensus is forcasting average growth of 2.0 per cent over the period.<\/p><p>  While unemployment remains stubbornly high, recent trends seem to suggest that some stabilisation has now taken place, with the seasonally adjusted standardised rate at 14.6 per cent in December, having fallen from a peak of 15.0 per cent in February. The Government remains committed to tackling the unacceptably high level of unemployment persisting in Ireland today and creating and sustaining jobs continues to be our main priority. A number of measures were introduced in Budget 2013 to assist in this regard, including several initiative designed to lend support to Ireland&rsquo;s job-rich SMEs.<\/p><p>  However, efforts to address the current employment levels do not stop at Budget 2013. As the Deputy will be aware, I attended the Cabinet Meeting for Jobs today, in which my fellow Ministers and I set forth our respective Department&rsquo;s proposals to improve the climate for employment growth as part of the Action Plan for Jobs.

This package was agreed in the context of the statement by Euro Area Heads of State or Government that the scale of the Greek problem is so large that it requires special attention. <\/p><p>  In this regard, on November 26th euro zone finance ministers agreed to partly reschedule Greece's debt, and offer several other measures to alleviate the country&rsquo;s financial burden. Taken together, these actions are expected to cut Greece's debt by up to 20 percentage points of GDP by 2020. This will bring its debt to GDP level to 124% in 2020, and a debt to GDP level of below 110% is targeted for 2022.<\/p><p>  The measures agreed include:<\/p><p>  - a debt buyback of  bonds held by private investors;<\/p><p>  - a reduction of 100 basis points (bp) in the interest rate on the Greek loan facility. Other program countries, such as Ireland, are not required to participate while they are in programs;<\/p><p>  - the guarantee commitment fee on EFSF loans, amounting to 10 basis points per annum, is to be cancelled;<\/p><p>  - maturities will be extended to 30 years, an increase of 15 years;<\/p><p>  - interest payments on EFSF loans will be deferred for 10 years; and,<\/p><p>  - the SMP measure: Member States will pass on to Greece's segregated account, an amount equivalent to the income on the Securities Market Programme (SMP) portfolio accruing to their national central bank as from budget year 2013.  Again Member States under a full financial assistance programme are not required to participate in this scheme for the period in which they \treceive financial assistance. <\/p><p>  The last of these, the SMP measure, involves a transfer of an accounting profit, but does not involve any retirement of debt by Greece.  <\/p><p>  It is important to note that the concessions that have been agreed are specific to Greece and are accompanied by significant additional conditionality. In Ireland on the other hand we have entered the final year of our programme. As such our focus is on making a successful exit from the programme.<\/p><p>  Ireland is meeting its programme targets, our economy is growing, unemployment is stabilising, yields on our government bonds have fallen considerably, confidence is returning and we have successfully re-entered the international financial markets.<\/p><p>  In line with the EU Heads of State or Government commitments in June, discussions are also underway to further improve the sustainability Ireland&rsquo;s programme. These discussions include our continuing interaction with the EU, the ECB and the IMF (the Troika) on exiting the programme and issues related to our banking debt, including the restructuring of the promissory note.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s needs, as a country exiting a programme, are very different to those of Greece. We are however examining the Greek package to see if aspects of it offer any possible benefit to Ireland, particularly in the context of our programme exit.  <\/p><p>  My officials, along with those of the NTMA and the Central Bank, are continuing to work to improve our success in terms of sustainable market financing. In this context the overall burden and the cost of servicing the outstanding stock of debt is closely monitored, particularly so by the National Treasury Management Agency, and they regularly advise me on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700051#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":660,"content":"<p>Question No. 37 answered with Question No. 18.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":661,"content":"<p>Question No. 38 answered with Question No. 17.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":662,"content":"<p>Question No. 39 answered with Question No. 26.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Operations","counter":664,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700052#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":665,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[1797\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700052#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if, further to the announcement of his Department on 9 January 2013 that negotiations to sell &euro;500m - &euro;1bn of Bank of Ireland Contingent Capital Notes had concluded, he will confirm the amount of interest receivable by the State on the CCNs in respect of 2012 and to the date of sale in 2013; and the period to which that interest receivable relates; and when that interest will be received by the State.","asker":"1083","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":666,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[1798\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700052#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if, further to the announcement of his Department on 9 January 2013 that negotiations to sell &euro;500m - &euro;1bn of Bank of Ireland Contingent Capital Notes had concluded, he will set out the means by which the CCNs were sold; when and how were they offered to the market, and the information that was provided to the market.","asker":"1102","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":667,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[1796\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700052#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if, further to the announcement of his Department on 9 January 2013 that negotiations to sell &euro;500m - &euro;1bn of Bank of Ireland Contingent Capital Notes had concluded, he will confirm the nominal value of the CCNs sold and the book value of the CCNs sold.","asker":"1083","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":668,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 55 and 61 together.<\/p><p>  As announced by my Department last week the State was successful in disposing of its entire &euro;1 billion holding of Contingent Capital Notes (CCN&rsquo;s) in Bank of Ireland.  The transaction followed an initial approach by a number of investment banks to the Department late last year which indicated that there was sizeable investor interest in the State&rsquo;s CCN instruments and particularly the holding in Bank of Ireland.  The Sale was managed by officials in the Department&rsquo;s Shareholder Management Unit, with many years&rsquo; experience working in financial markets and was not only timed to take advantage of the improving sentiment towards Ireland and its banks but the huge rally seen in international debt markets which has continued into 2013.<\/p><p>  The transaction when announced saw the State presented with the opportunity to dispose of a minimum of &euro;500 million of its position at a price of par. This stemmed from an underwriting commitment provided by the consortium of banks &ndash; UBS, Deutsche Bank and Davy &ndash; having done a preliminary assessment of market appetite for the notes.  In the end the book build process generated significant excess demand to enable the State to dispose of its entire holding in the CCN&rsquo;s at a price of 101% of their par value plus accrued interest. This generated a profit for the State of &euro;10 million.  Taking account of the coupon paid to the State last year, the taxpayer has earned a total return of over 15% in the space of 18 months.<\/p><p>  My officials had full visibility during the book build and pricing phases and were also provided with some valuation advice from NCB Stockbrokers which helped inform their judgement.  The transaction was well received in the market and indeed the CCN&rsquo;s traded a few points higher in the after-market during their first few days of trading.  This reflects a market recognition of a very successful transaction for Ireland, one in which we have exited this element of support to our banks with a profit. It points to a recognition that Ireland is successfully working to correct the very deep failings that have affected us in the past number of years.  In recognising this, however, we must also acknowledge that this after market price is for a very small volume of stock compared with the &euro;1billion size of the transaction.<\/p><p>  The transaction settled on Tuesday the 15th of January and the State was paid proceeds of just over &euro;1,056 million, comprising the nominal principal amount of &euro;1,000 million, interest accrued of over &euro;46 million covering the period 29th July 2012 to the disposal date, and a profit of &euro;10 million.<\/p><p>  Further details regarding the CCN&rsquo;s can be found in Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s 2011 Annual Report, including information relating to its&rsquo; accounting treatment.  At the end of 2011, the bank recorded the CCN&rsquo;s in its accounts at a fair (or book) value of &euro;926m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700052#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Policy","counter":669,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700052#WRE00550"},{"type":"question","counter":670,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[1773\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700052#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the initial assessment of Budget 2013 published by the ESRI in December 2012 and in particular on the ESRI's assessment that, like Budget 2012, Budget 2013 will take more from lower income groups than from higher income groups.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":671,"content":"<p>The process of fiscal consolidation has seen approximately &euro;28 billion of budgetary measures put in place between 2008 and 2013.  Taken as a whole, these budgets have been progressive in nature over the period and this is reflected in the ESRI&rsquo;s analysis.  While the ESRI report states that the budget had a larger proportional impact on the lowest income group than the higher income groups it should be noted that the difference is quite small at half a per cent. Indeed the report states that for the budget to impose an equal burden on high and low income groups the adjustment on the higher group would have to be 5 times that of the lower income group.  In addition, some of the measures which their methodology was unable to take into account would have had a progressive impact on incomes.  Changes to the USC, DIRT and capital gains tax are considered by the ESRI to be of a progressive nature. In addition, increasing capital gains tax limits the benefit accruing to those who have the capacity to translate labour income into capital income and thereby contributes towards a fairer tax system.  The ESRI have also regarded the property tax liability that can be deferred by low income individuals or couples as reducing their disposable income in 2013.  I disagree with this approach and as such I believe that the outcome for individuals in the lower deciles is likely to be better than reported by the ESRI in its analysis.<\/p><p>  Finally, the yearly budgetary adjustments must be seen in the context of the overall Irish taxation system. Using tax unit data from the Revenue Commissioners it should be noted that the top 23% of income earners paid 77% of the total income tax take for 2011.  In addition, our entry point to income tax is &euro;16,500, which at 51% of the average wage is the highest entry point in the OECD. The next closest is Italy at 28%.  This shows that despite the fiscal consolidation that has taken place over the last five years Ireland has maintained a highly progressive system of taxation.  In its 2012 report &lsquo;Taxing Wages&rsquo;, the OECD acknowledged that the Irish tax system is one of the most progressive in the OECD for both single and married couples (with two children).  This is commented on extensively in a paper published as Annex F to the Budget to which I would refer the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700052#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Operations","counter":672,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700052#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":673,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[1999\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700052#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the engagement his Department and National Treasury Management Agency officials have had with ratings agencies with a view to seeking an upgrade of Ireland&rsquo;s sovereign debt rating; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":674,"content":"<p>The NTMA has responsibility for maintaining a relationship with each of the rating agencies, in connection with the sovereign credit rating.

This comparative report looked at 183 countries and calculated the effective rate based on the tax obligations of a standardised company operating in each country, using standard assumptions regarding exemptions, deductions and allowances.  I also referred to a study by the European Commission (<i>Taxation Trends in the EU 2011<\/i>), which indicates Ireland has an effective corporate tax rate which is close to or indeed higher than the statutory 12.5% rate (this is likely because of the 25% rate that applies generally to non-trading income).<\/p><p><br \/>  I have been clear that my Department does not take ownership of these figures, but rather I have quoted them to give an example of the differences that exist in comparative studies on effective tax rates, depending on how the rate is calculated or who carries out the calculation.<\/p><p><br \/>  The issue relates to the absence of an international standard methodology of how to calculate the &#8216;effective rate&#8217;, not to the &#8220;lack of data&#8221; in relation to corporation tax paid.  Detailed data is contained in the Statistical Reports which are published annually by the Revenue Commissioners on their website &#8211; <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.revenue.ie<\/font><\/i>.

The reports concerned appear to have incorrectly attributed to Ireland profits that represent the return due to assets in other jurisdictions, owned by group companies that are not resident in Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is incorrect to relate the 12.5% corporation tax rate to both the profits of the Irish-resident group companies <i>and<\/i>   the profits of foreign-resident group companies&#8212; which are not profits chargeable to Irish corporation tax.  By mixing up the Irish profits and the foreign profits of multinational groups like this, these reports can produce an average tax rate for the companies concerned that is very significantly lower than 12.5% &#8212; and an incorrect inference that the full Irish profits are not being charged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700052#WRE01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Property Construction","counter":679,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700052#WRE01250"},{"type":"question","counter":680,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[1784\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700052#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason the National Asset Management Agency no longer produces a comprehensive monthly list of foreclosed property in a manner which would allow potential customers to easily see the additions during the month.","asker":"1028","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":681,"content":"<p>NAMA advises that, based on user feedback, the majority of users of its enforced properties website are interested in properties that are available within their own geographical areas for rent or purchase.

One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.  The Economic Management Council meets the banks on a regular basis and discusses the key issues pertaining to this priority.  My officials also meet regularly with key stakeholders at the forum of the SME Funding Consultation Committee. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion this year and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks have reported that they achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to the lending targets imposed on the banks,<b><\/b>the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets.  The banks will shortly be submitting their lending plans for 2013 to my Department. My Department, in conjunction with the CRO, will analyse the plans and meet the banks to discuss any issues of note. The banks also meet with the Department of Finance and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.  The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by the Department.<\/p><p><br \/>  The CRO can review decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities, including applications for restructured credit facilities, from &#8364;1,000 up to &#8364;500,000.  The CRO is currently overturning 55% of the refusal decisions referred to them and anyone who has been refused credit by the banks should avail of the services of the CRO.  I have received a small number of representations from individual SMEs regarding the availability of credit. I have referred some of these SMEs to the Credit Review Office which has been able to provide assistance. <\/p><p><br \/>  I recently sanctioned the appointment of six additional reviewers in the Credit Review Office to ensure that SMEs appealing the banks&#8217; decisions to decline credit receive a considered and timely response to their application.<\/p><p><br \/>  The credit stream available to SMEs now includes the Microenterprise Loan scheme which will facilitate up to &#8364;40million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.  In addition, the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme can facilitate up to &#8364;150m per annum of additional credit.  The Scheme is designed for SME&#8217;s who, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.<\/p><p><br \/>  Last week, the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) announced investment commitments to a suite of three new long-term funds which will provide equity, credit and restructuring\/recovery investment for Irish SMEs and mid-sized corporates.  The NPRF is also currently reviewing additional SME fund opportunities that would complement these commitments, with the objective that the eventual suite of funds would have the capacity to invest across the full spectrum of SME financing needs.<\/p><p><br \/>  Late last year, I published the latest independent report on the demand for credit by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) on my Department&#8217;s website.  This covered the period April to September 2012.  This survey is the most comprehensive survey of SME Credit Demand in Ireland covering over 1,500 respondents.  The contract for the survey contained an option to complete a further survey for the following six month period.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery.  However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700052#WRE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":692,"content":"<p>Question No. 48 answered with Question No. 45.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":693,"content":"<p>Question No. 49 answered with Question No. 34.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":695,"content":"<p>Question No. 50 answered with Question No. 36.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Real Estate Investment Trusts","counter":696,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700053#WRF00250"},{"type":"question","counter":697,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[1782\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700053#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to his announcement of introducing legislation to give effect to Real Estate Investment Trusts, if he has consulted with the National Asset Management Agency with respect to its planned launch of Qualified Investor Funds; and if NAMA remains committed to launching QIFs in view of his announcement with respect to REITs.","asker":"1080","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":698,"content":"<p>I am advised by NAMA that it is very supportive of the Government&rsquo;s decision to introduce REITs legislation.

This opinion is at odds with much of the recent indicators on the Irish housing market.  Data from the CSO's Residential Property Price Index show that national prices have been broadly stable for the last nine months, with prices in Dublin experiencing upward price pressure in the latter part of 2012.  Also, recent statements by both Daft.ie and myHome.ie have pointed to signs of stabilisation in the some areas in the fourth quarter of 2012.  While I cannot presume to forecast the market I do not share Fitch's pessimism.<\/p><p>    As to the possible effects of the Local Property Tax on residential property prices, work completed by researchers in the ESRI before the introduction of the tax concluded that a property tax at a rate of 0.4% would result in a small increase in the user cost of housing, thereby putting some downward pressure on housing demand.  The Local Property Tax rate of 0.18% (for houses up to &euro;1m in value) is less than half the rate used in the ESRI analysis and as such the impact on housing demand is likely to be minimal.<\/p><p>  In addition, the rental market is a competitive market with many suppliers and renters.  Upstream costs such as the Local Property Tax are likely to be passed through in the rental market and as such will not create a disincentive to purchase houses relative to renting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700054#WRG00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":728,"content":"<p>Question No. 64 answered with Question No. 24.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":730,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700054#WRG00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"St&aacute;das na Gaeilge san Eoraip","counter":729,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700054#WRG00750"},{"type":"question","counter":730,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[2116\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700054#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"c&eacute;n pl&eacute; a bh&iacute; aige n&oacute; ag a Roinn leis an Roinn Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta maidir lena chinnti&uacute; go mbeidh eolas ag daoine maidir leis na poist at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il san AE d&rsquo;aistritheoir&iacute; agus d'ateangair&iacute; Gaeilge, agus go mbeidh an d&oacute;thain daoine c&aacute;ilithe ann leis na poist a ghlacadh; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":731,"content":"<p>Is saincheist &iacute; seo do mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an tAire Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta.

Notwithstanding the strengths\/weaknesses of the methodologies used to produce the technical forecast, judgement\/prudence plays an important role in deciding on a forecast. To this end, the Department liaises closely with the Revenue Commissioners to ensure any emerging trends are identified and all relevant data is taken on board.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is important to clarify that the income tax forecast for 2013 was based on a projected outturn for 2012 of &#8364;15,040 million, representing an estimated increase of approximately &#8364;820 million (5.4%) at the time of the <i>Budget 2013<\/i> publication.

These are forecast using projected growth in non-agricultural earnings together with an earnings elasticity factor and forecast growth in non-agricultural employment together with an employment elasticity factor.

The Central Bank compiles and publishes quarterly mortgage arrears and repossession statistics for both primary domestic homes (PDH) and buy-to-let (BTL) mortgages and my Department monitors these statistics closely.

The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) does not specifically deal with these, rather it sets out procedures to deal with borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears on a mortgage loan which is secured by their primary residence. All regulated mortgage lenders must comply with the requirements of this Code.  The CCMA can also be accessed on the Central Bank&#8217;s website.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Code provides that mortgage lenders should allow for a flexible approach in the handling of arrears and pre-arrears cases and that they should aim at assisting the borrower who is in genuine difficulty as far as possible having regard to the specific circumstances. In particular, the CCMA provides that a lender&#8217;s Arrears Support Unit (ASU) must base its assessment of the borrower&#8217;s case on the full circumstances of the borrower including:<\/p><p>-  the personal circumstances of the borrower<\/p><p>-  the overall indebtedness of the borrower<\/p><p>-  the information provided in the standard financial statement (SFS)<\/p><p>-  the borrower&#8217;s current repayment capacity, and<\/p><p>-  the borrower&#8217;s previous history<\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, the CCMA requires that &#8216;A lender must have a dedicated section on its website for borrowers in, or concerned about, financial difficulties which must include: <\/p><p>-  the information booklet required under provision 12; <\/p><p>-  information on the level of charges that may be imposed on borrowers that do not co-operate with the lender; and <\/p><p>-  a link to any website operated by the MABS that contains information about mortgage arrears.&#8217; <\/p><p><br \/>  The information on the website must be easily accessible from a prominent link on the lender&#8217;s home page.   Some lenders have developed budgeting tools and videos to help customers complete the SFS and FAQ sections on mortgage arrears and forbearance arrangements on their websites.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The Code also requires that &#8216;A lender must prepare and make available to borrowers, an information booklet providing details of its Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which must include: <\/p><p>-  an explanation of its MARP, including the alternative repayment measures available to borrowers and outline in general terms, the lender&#8217;s criteria for assessing requests for alternative repayment measures; <\/p><p>-  a statement that the borrower will not be required to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type; <\/p><p>-  information about the potential availability of relevant State supports such as mortgage interest relief or Mortgage Interest Supplement; <\/p><p>-  relevant contact points (i.e., the dedicated arrears contact points not the general customer service contact points); and <\/p><p>-  reference to relevant website(s) operated by the Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS)&#8217;. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Central Bank has informed me that it recently wrote to all lenders to remind them of these provisions and that their MARP booklet and websites should be updated to include the longer term options as they are rolled out and to make reference to the Government initiatives in this area.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to overall household indebtedness, the latest Central Bank data show that at the end of the second quarter of last year, total household indebtedness amounted to &#8364;178.5 billion.

The continuum of assessment allows for the identification of pupils with special educational needs, their nature and severity by harnessing the experience of class teachers and support teachers, in consultation with parents, and with the support of the psychologist.  It also provides for the development of immediate responses and interventions designed to ameliorate the particular needs identified at the appropriate level, either in the classroom or with the assistance of the support teacher.  This allows for a response to be put in place at the earliest possible juncture for students before their difficulties can become intractable.  Assessment of needs at this stage of the continuum involves information gathering, testing and observation by the various school personnel involved and support from the NEPS psychologist, as required.<\/p><p>  Where the pupil does not make adequate progress following the interventions, or where the nature of the child's special educational needs are significant, severe and complex, the school may agree with the psychologist that a psycho-educational assessment be conducted to identify the specific nature of the needs and the appropriate response necessary.  Students, so identified, are scheduled for assessment within that school year.

SNAs are allocated to schools in order to provide for the care needs of children with special educational needs attending such schools.  The policy of my Department in relation to the SNA scheme is set out in Circular 07\/02, which also provides details regarding the role and duties of an SNA.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.<\/p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that SNAs are not allocated to individual pupils. The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children, rather than solely by reference to a pupils' disability categorisation.  SNAs should then be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.<\/p><p>  All schools have been advised by the NCSE of their SNA staffing allocations for the current school year. Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to each school are available at www.ncse.ie, detailed on a County basis.  Where a school considers that they do not have adequate SNA support from within their allocated provision to provide for the care needs of all qualifying pupils, or where schools have enrolled new students with special educational needs, they may apply to the NCSE to have their SNA allocation reviewed and the NCSE has capacity to make additional allocations to schools. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700057#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Appeals","counter":800,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700057#WRK00450"},{"type":"question","counter":801,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[2158\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700057#WRK00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Mayo has been denied the higher education grant; if he will have Student Universal Support Ireland re-examine their application with a view to awarding the grant as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":802,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department have confirmed with Student Universal Support Ireland that the grant application of the student referred to by the Deputy for the 2012\/13 academic year was awarded a postgraduate fee contribution based on the terms and conditions of the scheme.

Such aid must be in accordance with the Regional Aid Map 2007-13 approved by the European Commission.  This Map was drawn up in accordance with the Commission&rsquo;s Regional Aid Guidelines 2007-2013.  The eligible regions and applicable aid rates in Ireland for the 7 year period are set out in the Irish map.  The Commission&rsquo;s Regional Aid Guidelines afford the possibility to Member States to amend the list of regions eligible for Regional Aid or the applicable aid intensities only once during the relevant 7 year period, by way of a mid-term review.  Hence, there is no scope to increase population coverage under the current RAGs.<\/p><p>In selecting the areas within the overall Southern and Eastern (NUTS) Level II Region (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) that could, in addition to the BMW (Border, Midlands and West) Region, be designated for the Regional Aid Map 2007-2013, Ireland had to observe a strict EU requirement that the areas selected be relatively more in need of economic development than the better off regions of the EU.  The Southern &amp; Eastern Regional Assembly was consulted for its views.  The Assembly accepted the findings of an independent report, which it commissioned from the National Institute for Spatial and Regional Analysis at NUI Maynooth.  The Assembly&rsquo;s proposals were included in the proposed Regional Aid Map that the European Commission approved in 2006.<\/p><p>The process of Member States agreeing the 2014-2021 Regional Aid Guidelines is underway and initial multilateral discussions between Member States and the Commission, which has responsibility for the Regional Aid Guidelines, have taken place.  For the 2014-2021 Regional Aid Map, economic data for all counties will once again be analysed afresh.  My Department is actively engaged in this process and has consulted relevant stakeholders including various Government Departments, the industrial development agencies, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Forf&aacute;s, the Central Statistics Office, the Border Midland and Western Regional Assembly, the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly, and the eight Regional Authorities.<\/p><p>The Commission issued a non paper setting out its initial orientations in December 2011, which was followed by a multilateral meeting in March 2012.  The Commission subsequently forwarded further proposals to Member States on 14 January 2013, documenting the structure and provisions that will form the basis of the revised Guidelines. Details of these proposals can be accessed at the following weblink; <i>http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/competition\/consultations\/2013&under;regional&under;aid&under;guidelines\/index&under;en.html<\/i>.  Further discussions are due to take place on 11 and 12 of February.<\/p><p>The details of the support in terms of aid intensity currently available for each county are available on my Departments website, and are also listed in the chart.  It is important to note that all of the Country, including those areas not entitled to Regional Aid, can qualify for other forms of aid e.g. Research, Development &amp; Innovation Aid, SME Investment Aid, Training Aid, and Aid for Environmental protection etc.<\/p><p><b>Regional Aid Map 2007-2013 &ndash; IRELAND<\/b>  <b> (as reviewed by Commission Decision<\/b><\/p><p><b>N130\/2010 &ndash; Official Journal c 226\/5 21.8.2010)<\/b><\/p><p><b> <\/b>  <bu>BORDER, MIDLANDS and WEST REGION<\/bu><\/p><p><bu><\/bu><\/p><p><table><tr><td><b>FIRMS<\/b><\/td><td><b>LARGE FIRMS<\/b><\/td><td><b>MEDIUM FIRMS<\/b><\/td><td><b>SMALL<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><bu><\/bu><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Period<\/th><th><div>2007-2010<\/div><\/th><th><div>2011-2013<\/div><\/th><th><div>2007-2010<\/div><\/th><th><div>2011-&#8216;13<\/div><\/th><th><div>2007-&#8216;10<\/div><\/th><th><div>2011-&#8216;13<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Aid Rate (Gross Grant Equivalent)<\/td><td><div>30%<\/div><\/td><td><div>15%<\/div><\/td><td><div>40%<\/div><\/td><td><div>25%<\/div><\/td><td><div>50%<\/div><\/td><td><div>35%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><bu>SOUTHERN &amp; EASTERN REGION<\/bu><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Designated Areas<\/th><th colspan=\"2\"><div>LARGE FIRMS<\/div><\/th><th colspan=\"2\"><div>MEDIUM FIRMS<\/div><\/th><th colspan=\"2\"><div>SMALL FIRMS<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">South East<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>sub region<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>(Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Waterford, South Tipperary) and designated islands1<\/td><td colspan=\"2\"><div>2007-2013<\/div><\/td><td colspan=\"2\"><div>2007-2013<\/div><\/td><td colspan=\"2\"><div>2007-2013<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><div><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>10%<\/div><\/td><td colspan=\"2\"><div><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>20%<\/div><\/td><td colspan=\"2\"><div><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>30%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><div>2007-2008<\/div><\/td><td><div>2009-2013<\/div><\/td><td colspan=\"2\"><div>2007-2013<\/div><\/td><td colspan=\"2\"><div>2007-2013<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Mid West<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>(Clare, Limerick, North Tipperary2)<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>Kerry, Cork Urban Regeneration Area<\/td><td colspan=\"2\"><div>10%<\/div><\/td><td colspan=\"2\"><div>20%<\/div><\/td><td colspan=\"2\"><div>30%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>10%<\/div><\/td><td><div>0%<\/div><\/td><td colspan=\"2\"><div>20%3<\/div><\/td><td colspan=\"2\"><div>30%3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>Cork (apart from Urban Regeneration Area)<\/td><td rowspan=\"2\"><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>10%<br \/><br \/><\/td><td rowspan=\"2\"><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>0%<br \/><br \/><\/td><td><div>2007-2008<\/div><\/td><td><div>2009-2013<\/div><\/td><td><div>2007-2008<\/div><\/td><td><div>2009-2013<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>20%<\/div><\/td><td><div>0%<\/div><\/td><td><div>30%<\/div><\/td><td><div>0%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>Lower aid rates apply to Large Investment Projects (i.e. &gt; &euro;50 million)<\/p><p>Bear, Cleire, Dursey, Heir, Long, Sherkin, Whiddy<\/p><p>2  As a result of Commission Decision N 130\/2010, large investment aid and aid for investment projects with eligible expenditure exceeding EUR 25 million is once again permitted for these three counties.

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established as a priority.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.  Due to its particular relevance, it has also been decided to include domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services within the Agency's responsibilities.  The Government has further decided that the new Agency will assume responsibility for the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  These two organisations currently operate under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The draft legislation will also provide for the provision of community-based psychology services to children and families by the Agency.  It is envisaged that this will involve the transfer of certain psychology staff currently employed by the HSE who are operating within a community setting.  <\/p><p>  The Government's consideration of these matters was informed, inter alia, by the content and recommendations of the Report of the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency which I published in July 2012.  I share the view of the Task Force that in order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency must have a broader focus than child protection.  It is my intention that the Agency will be as broadly based as possible and that it should include those services that (i) may prevent problems arising for a family in the first instance (ii) identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and (iii) assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  <\/p><p>  Arising from the Government's consideration and decision with regard to the functions of the new Agency, it has been agreed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health that an impact analysis will be jointly developed regarding the proposed future arrangements for the provision of the community psychology service as it relates to children and family services covered by the Child and Family Support Agency and to services provided by the HSE.  This work will be undertaken as a priority.<\/p><p>  I recently met with representatives from the Heads of the Psychology Services Ireland and with a delegation from the IMPACT trade union to discuss issues relating to the future governance and organisational arrangements for the provision of community based psychology services.

Around 45 of these cases related to people born after 1953 and the balance related to persons born pre-1953.<\/p><p>  A further 20 applications have since been made.  The AAI have advised that approximately 50% of those who register are natural mothers seeking to trace their child while the other 50% are adults seeking to trace their natural parent(s).  Many adults seeking to trace their natural parent(s) have 'Birth Certificates' which state that persons other than their natural parents were their natural parents.  In many cases they are aware that the details contained in the Register of Births are false and that their birth was registered incorrectly.<\/p><p>  As no adoption took place there would be no adoption file and the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) can be of limited assistance.  While the AAI has no statutory role in instances of illegal registrations of births it does facilitate the information and tracing process for such illegal registrations to the extent open to it, in particular through the National Contact Preference Register.  When the former Adoption Board launched the National Adoption Contact Preference Register  in 2005, provision was made for persons, who were party to the illegal registration of a child, to register an interest in the Register for possible future contact contact with another party sometime in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700058#WRV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Redeployment","counter":1091,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700058#WRV01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1092,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[2744\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700058#WRV01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide by Department\/Agency basis the number of persons who are seeking transfers to other locations; the number of transfers that took place in 2012 on a county basis on the number of transfers that took place in 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1093,"content":"<p>The  mechanisms currently available to staff in my Department seeking a voluntary transfer to another location is directly  through the Central Applications facility run by Public Applications Services (for remaining decentralisation locations) or to source a \"Head to Head\" transfer by directly contacting  a person willing to transfer with them.

The programme has been introduced on a phased basis to men and women between the ages of 60-69 years.  When fully implemented the programme will offer free screening to men and women aged 55-74 every two years.  As 50% of cancers within this age group are found in people aged 60-69 the programme has begun with this latter age cohort (a population of approximately 500,000).  It is anticipated that the first screening round will take up to three years to complete.  Over time the phasing of the programme will allow development of colonoscopy capacity to cater for the full 55-74 year age group.  The estimated cost of the programme in 2013, based on an uptake rate of 60% among the target population, is &euro;4.3m with further costs in subsequent years as the programme expands.  The programme has been shown through a Health Technology Assessment to be cost effective as it will very quickly reduce mortality among the screened population.  While a multi-annual budget has not been set aside for the Programme, it will continue to be prioritised into the future.

This is a very challenging target given the level of staff reductions that have been achieved in recent years.  In order to mitigate the impact on frontline services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.

Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.  The Department of Health and the HSE have also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established as a priority.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.  Due to its particular relevance, it has also been decided to include domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services within the Agency's responsibilities.  The Government has further decided that the new Agency will assume responsibility for the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  These two organisations currently operate under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The draft legislation will also provide for the provision of community-based psychology services to children and families by the Agency.  It is envisaged that this will involve the transfer of certain psychology staff currently employed by the HSE who are operating within a community setting.  <\/p><p>  The Government's consideration of these matters was informed, inter alia, by the content and recommendations of the Report of the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency which I published in July 2012.  I share the view of the Task Force that in order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency must have a broader focus than child protection.  It is my intention that the Agency will be as broadly based as possible and that it should include those services that (i) may prevent problems arising for a family in the first instance (ii) identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and (iii) assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  <\/p><p>  Arising from the Government's consideration and decision with regard to the functions of the new Agency, it has been agreed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health that an impact analysis will be jointly developed regarding the proposed future arrangements for the provision of the community psychology service as it relates to children and family services covered by the Child and Family Support Agency and to services provided by the HSE.

The issue of illegal registrations of births is a matter for the General Registrations Office (GRO) under the remit of the Department of Social Protection.  The GRO have advised that historically birth registration was based on a presumption of honesty and that cases of illegal registrations are referred to the Gardai S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p>  I am informed by the Adoption Authority of Ireland that in mid-2010 the then Adoption Board conducted a review of information it retained of contact received from persons seeking to trace their natural parents where no adoption records existed.  This exercise indicated that 99 people who had identified themselves to the Board as adopted, did not have a corresponding adoption file.  Around 45 of these cases related to people born after 1953 and the balance related to persons born pre-1953.<\/p><p>  A further 20 applications have since been made.  The AAI have advised that approximately 50% of those who register are natural mothers seeking to trace their child while the other 50% are adults seeking to trace their natural parent(s).  Many adults seeking to trace their natural parent(s) have 'Birth Certificates' which state that persons other than their natural parents were their natural parents.  In many cases they are aware that the details contained in the Register of Births are false and that their birth was registered incorrectly.<\/p><p>  As no adoption took place there would be no adoption file and the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) can be of limited assistance.  While the AAI has no statutory role in instances of illegal registrations of births it does facilitate the information and tracing process for such illegal registrations to the extent open to it, in particular through the National Contact Preference Register.  When the former Adoption Board launched the National Adoption Contact Preference Register  in 2005, provision was made for persons, who were party to the illegal registration of a child, to register an interest in the Register for possible future contact contact with another party sometime in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700068#WRV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Redeployment","counter":1443,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700068#WRV01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1444,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[2744\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013011700068#WRV01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide by Department\/Agency basis the number of persons who are seeking transfers to other locations; the number of transfers that took place in 2012 on a county basis on the number of transfers that took place in 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1445,"content":"<p>The  mechanisms currently available to staff in my Department seeking a voluntary transfer to another location is directly  through the Central Applications facility run by Public Applications Services (for remaining decentralisation locations) or to source a \"Head to Head\" transfer by directly contacting  a person willing to transfer with them.

The programme has been introduced on a phased basis to men and women between the ages of 60-69 years.  When fully implemented the programme will offer free screening to men and women aged 55-74 every two years.  As 50% of cancers within this age group are found in people aged 60-69 the programme has begun with this latter age cohort (a population of approximately 500,000).  It is anticipated that the first screening round will take up to three years to complete.  Over time the phasing of the programme will allow development of colonoscopy capacity to cater for the full 55-74 year age group.  The estimated cost of the programme in 2013, based on an uptake rate of 60% among the target population, is &euro;4.3m with further costs in subsequent years as the programme expands.  The programme has been shown through a Health Technology Assessment to be cost effective as it will very quickly reduce mortality among the screened population.  While a multi-annual budget has not been set aside for the Programme, it will continue to be prioritised into the future.

This is a very challenging target given the level of staff reductions that have been achieved in recent years.  In order to mitigate the impact on frontline services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  Therefore, the HSE is using the provisions of the Public Service Agreement to bring about greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters, redeployment and other changes to achieve more efficient delivery of services.<\/p><p>  Staff reductions will be pursued throughout 2013 through natural turnover (retirements and resignations) and such other targeted measures or initiatives as may be determined by Government in relation to the health sector or the wider public service.

Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.  The Department of Health and the HSE have also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  The Bill provides that when the HSE is setting a reference price for, or reviewing a reference price set for, a relevant group of interchangeable medicinal products it shall take into account the following criteria:<\/p><p>- the ability of suppliers to meet patient demand for the relevant item;<\/p><p>- the value for money afforded by the relevant item;<\/p><p>- the equivalent prices of the relevant item in all other Member States where the product is marketed;<\/p><p>- the prices of therapeutically similar items; and<\/p><p>- the resources available to the HSE.<\/p><p>  It is important to balance achieving best value for money for the taxpayer with assuring continuity of supply for critical medical products, particularly in a small market like Ireland.  Consequently, the Bill aims to achieve value for money while avoiding disruption in the availability of medicines on the Irish market.
