It is apt that we are here on the UN international day of older people.  I wish everybody a happy UN international day.  Age Action is a charity which promotes positive ageing and better policies and services for older people.  We work with and on behalf of older people with the aim of making Ireland the best place in the world in which to grow older.  In this context, the reality and lived experience of older people in Ireland is a foundation of our policy and advocacy work and we frame our analysis of policy very much from this perspective.<br\/>With this in mind, earlier this year, we consulted a nationwide consultation with our members.  This included four regional meetings and a survey of our members through our monthly newsletter, <i>Ageing Matters<\/i>.  The aim of the consultation was not to set out Age Action&rsquo;s position on policy issues but to listen and understand the impact recent budgets have had on older people and what services, benefits and payments were most important to them and what aspect of their daily lives would benefit most from additional funding, should it be available.  Our information service also provides a valuable insight into the lived experience of ageing.  In 2013, our information officers responded to over 2,000 queries.  The service works closely with the policy team to highlight the impact that policy changes have on older people.  We also receive correspondence, both in writing and by telephone, regarding specific policy issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100004#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamon Timmins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412165100,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I will speak about what we found out when we consulted with our members.  It is evident from this interaction that the notion that older people have been unaffected by austerity is not borne out in reality.  The opposite is the case for many older people.  While the core rate of the pension has remained unchanged since January 2009, price increases, the decimation of the household benefits package and other secondary income supports, the introduction of charges such as the property tax and prescription charge, and the forthcoming water charges have caused many older people to struggle to make ends meet.  Cuts to medical cards and health service budgets have had a disproportionate effect on the sickest and frailest older people.  More than 18,000 older people have lost their medical cards in the past 12 months.  The HSE aims to provide 1.7 million fewer hours of home help this year than in 2010, despite our ageing population and the 4% per annum increase in the population aged over 65.<\/p><p>  The choices older people are making in order to keep their heads above water are unacceptable and paint a stark picture of what it is like to grow old in Ireland.  During our consultation, members told us they were reducing their home heating.  One member said, \"Home heating has had to be reduced to save fuel so my wife who is ill now stays in her bed most of the time\".  A second member said, \"I have had to cut back big time on grocery shopping.  We need to adapt the house now to our needs as we are both over 70 years of age ... that has to wait\".  Another member said, \"We only turn on lighting in some rooms and do everything we can to save on heat.  I put on extra clothing and stay in bed late and go to bed early.  We rarely use the phone\".  While supports such as the housing adaptation grant provide funding to help older people remain in their homes for longer, changes in the criteria earlier this year have meant for many dipping into their savings in order to live more comfortably.  One member told us, \"I had to use money put aside for my funeral, to pay for replacement of bathroom fittings\".<\/p><p>  Those living alone in particular struggle to heat homes that were once occupied by more than one person and were supported by more than one State pension.<\/p> <p>The contribution of the living-alone allowance to tackle the disparity in expenditure is grossly inadequate.  One member explained: &quot;Since my husband died it is much harder to live on your own and more expensive&quot;. <br\/>Even those who have been able to save or put money aside have been penalised.  For instance, consideration of savings in the criteria for medical cards has meant that many older people have lost access to vital services and can only now access a GP-visit card.  One member told us:<blockquote>I have lost my medical card.  I now have a doctor only card.  My pension has not changed but I have some interest on money I saved for a rainy day and this brought my income over the rate.  I realise now I was foolish to save any money.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100004#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Naomi Feely","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412165700,"counter":11,"content":"<p>It is clear from our interaction with older people that budget 2015 must address the difficulties encountered by older people in making ends meet.  Given continued media and political speculation regarding cuts to income tax, we asked our members, many of whom would not benefit from such a measure, if the Government was to provide additional funding in one area, the area that would have the most impact in their lives.  In their response our members most frequently mentioned additional resources for income and health supports.<\/p><p>  In recent budget submissions we have not sought increases in key income supports.  Given the state of the country's finances, we had sought to protect existing payment rates.  However, having asked people about the reality of their lives, and knowing what we know of the reality of growing older in Ireland, it would be morally wrong of us not to demand increases in key support payments in budget 2015.  Therefore we are calling for the following: an increase the weekly rate of the State pension by &euro;5 per week; restoration of the Christmas bonus which was lost in 2009; an increase the living alone allowance by &euro;3.80 per week in order to restore some value to its purchasing power - that has not been increased since 1996; and reversal of the fuel payment cuts and changes made in recent budgets to the household benefits package.<\/p><p>  These are among the 36 recommendations in our pre-budget submission, which we have sent to all members.

I thank all the members of committee for their interest in this.<\/p><p>  Disability is a societal, it is not an issue for people with disabilities and their families.  That is a core thing we want to say.  Almost 600,000 Irish citizens have a disability and if that is doubled to reflect the other people who are also deeply affected, that is 25% of the population.  People out of work due to illness or disability are five times more likely to be at risk of poverty.  Families where the head of the household is not at work due to illness or disability experienced an 11.3% drop in their disposable income in the period 2010 to 2012. Therefore there is a need for the Government and the Departments involved here today to use this budget to deliver on their pre-election commitment to protect people with disabilities from the worst effects of this recession.  Both the education and social protection sides can play a key role in protecting people and improving their situation.  <\/p><p>  When we talk about the disabled we should be clear.  They are in some cases ourselves, our parents, children, partners and neighbours.  Disability is very much bound up in everything that goes on in the community.  The odds are stacked against a person with an illness or disability in Ireland.  People not at work due to illness or disability have the highest levels of consistent poverty at almost 18%, as against a national rate of just under 8%.  Some 48% are at risk of deprivation, whereas the national rate is still too high at 27%.  A third of young adults between 25 and 29 with a disability left school before completing second level compared with one in six of young people with no disability.  Some 21% of people with disabilities aged 15 and over are in employment compared with 50% of the general population in the same age.<\/p><p>  We are stating very clearly and boldly that to date the Government has failed to protect people with disabilities from the worst effects of the recession.<\/p> <p>While this coming budget may not necessarily be the last budget of this Administration, it will be the last budget for which there will be a full year in which actions can be implemented that will stand to improve the lives of people with disabilities.<\/p><p> I will make a few points in respect of the income side.  In 2011, 45% of people with disabilities experienced income poverty and 36% of people with a disability experienced basic deprivation.  The protection of basic payments, which the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, acknowledges has been done, does not equate with the protection of the basic and necessary income people need when one takes it in the round.  Recent work by the ESRI has estimated that approximately &euro;1,000 per annum is needed to deal with the additional cost that people with a disability face.  That is an average figure, which could be higher or lower.  Even if this estimate exceeds the true figure by a further 100%, it is still massive and this is a major issue.  There has been a chipping away at disability-specific and mainstreaming supports and we suggest there is a strong lack of understanding of the challenges faced every day by people with disabilities and their families.  Many things have happened that are specifically outside the remit of these two Departments.  While the details are included in the submission and I will not go into them, they all add to the load people must carry.  The point is that it adds to increased costs of living and a reduction in autonomy and of opportunity.  As an emergency or interim measure, the federation is calling for an increase of &euro;20 to the disability allowance to try specifically to do something tangible about the real risk of and issue about poverty.  There are other issues, including the household benefits package, the domiciliary care allowance, the free travel scheme, and so forth.<\/p><p> I will move on briefly to education and to the subject of education as a gateway to participation in employment.  Disability is one of the least visible but most potent factors in educational disadvantage.  The ESRI commissioned a report, entitled A Social Portrait of People with Disabilities in Ireland, which shows that a reciprocal relationship exists between disability and educational disadvantage.  In a nutshell, one is talking about young people in the main and what that means is if one goes off the tracks at that stage, one will be off the tracks for the next 50 to 60 years.  Consequently, the fallout from not having it right early on is massive.  Access to education at all levels is critical to ensuring people's full participation.  While there are issues regarding special needs assistants and the National Educational Psychological Service, I will not go into them in detail here and members can come back to them if they wish.  The forthcoming budget must attack the educational marginalisation of people with disabilities in order that they can participate.  While one could put that in fancy language about their human rights and all the rest of it, it is just to enable them to get on and have the chance of having a life.<\/p><p> As for access for people with disabilities who wish to seek employment services, there are issues with regard to how the Intreo offices are operating, on the Youth Guarantee as well as on access to JobBridge and Momentum.  These are all issues, and in some cases, people with disabilities are debarred from participating in these programmes, which means one never gets to the starting line.  I will state clearly that people with disabilities are not going back into special schools.  They and their families believe and expect that they will have a good education to prepare them for work.  This is what is up for grabs in this regard and this is why people are and will be quite tenacious, bothered and upset about the present position.<\/p> <p>In May of this year, the current T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, stated: \"We have concentrated on economic repair up to now.  Now is time for an equal emphasis on social repair.\"  I believe that is key.  Two thirds of the heavy lifting in terms of the adjustment was money taken out of services of all kinds with one third on the tax side.  This side needs building back up.  The demographics are rising; thankfully people are living longer.  Patching up responses - without disrespect to the people trying to do it - have left huge pent-up and unmet needs.  That will come back to haunt us if we do not address it, putting it straight up to the Oireachtas.  In the past two weeks, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has said that there have been pressure points that have built up, which is true.  I do not see a better area than the area covering disability, mental health and chronic illness to focus on, and this goes right across the life cycle from children to older people.  We could have an impact with the little bit of spare money that will be available next year.  If that is not done, it will be more of a squandering rather than having a strong impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100005#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412166300,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting us here.  The Irish Senior Citizens Parliament is a representative umbrella organisation of older people in Ireland.  It is an open, democratic organisation where all officers are elected by the members.  It is a non-party political and not for profit, and it works to improve the quality of life of older people and to ensure that the views of older people in policy development and decision-making are made known to Government and the wider civic society.  It has over 330 affiliated organisations and has a genuine mandate to be the voice of older people.<\/p><p>  We are pleased to note that at last there appears to be a light at the end of a very long period of austerity.  Hopefully sometime soon we can decently bury austerity and we look forward to that.  Older people are tired, weary and miserable living under its tyranny in so many areas of their lives.  As we prepare for our ninth budget since austerity, older people are ever hopeful that some of their concerns will be listened to, heeded and followed by appropriate actions in budget 2015.  I could continue about the suffering but I might skip some of that.<\/p><p>  We welcome that the level of State pension was maintained during austerity.  However, the myth that older people have not been affected by the recession and the austerity measures is just not true.  All our citizens and families have felt the brunt of ongoing austerity.  In response to our meetings and questionnaires, older people have told us they cannot take any more cuts, additional charges, taxes, levies or any measure to further reduce their income or cut their services.<\/p><p>  An examination of the position shows very clearly that while the basic rates have been maintained, the value and buying power of the older person, and in particular older people living alone, have been very much reduced.  In this budget, we are again making a plea for their position to be considered as well as those of the older old.  That is very clear through all of what we are requesting.<\/p><p>  Older people provide vital services to their families and others through their roles as volunteers, carers, grandparents and childminders.  In addition, older people continue to assist adult children and grandchildren by sharing what assets they have with them and in many cases providing a home to adult children and grandchildren who otherwise might be homeless. <\/p><p>  During their working lives, pensioners were encouraged to save and provide for old age through investments, property and private pensions.  For those who could not afford or were not given the opportunity to do this, they placed their faith and trust in the PRSI system to provide them with a pension when they came to need it.  Most of them had the expectation that they would get a State pension at age 65.<\/p> <p>Increasingly, we note a concern that the prices of goods, services and houses in some areas are getting out of control, and unless there is close and vigilant monitoring by the Government, this could be a problem in the future.  We have done some monitoring with some of our groups and we see increases in prices of some hotels, restaurants and food of approximately 8%.  We hope the Government will monitor this and it is very important that one Government Department examines it closely.<\/p><p> We look forward to the day when we can finally find out what happened in Ireland because we are discovering from courts abroad how people transferred huge sums of money out of Ireland.  We eagerly await the results and verdicts from those jurisdictions to tell us what happened here because it is too slow.  Regarding the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill (No 2) 2013, pensioners were amazed and aghast at the speed with which scheme trustees moved to reduce the amounts paid to pensioners.  There are many examples of groups that are going through section 50 in this regard.<\/p><p> Income and access to services are the two most important areas for older people as they age.  In our survey, older people told us the loss of the household benefits package was a priority issue, particularly the loss of the telephone allowance.  We were astonished at the number of people who marked this as their No. 1 issue.  While we recognise that it cannot all happen immediately, we ask that in this budget a start be made on the restoration of a number of these benefits.  Giving people money is not the best way to go.  Instead services should be provided.  We are afraid that money does not provide the service and it can leave older people open to financial abuse, which we are concerned about.  Electricity charges in Ireland are higher than in most European countries.  One of the reasons the household benefits package was abolished in some of its formats was that the Government was not able to bulk buy and this should be examined in more detail.<\/p><p> In the budget we seek the restoration of the telephone allowance, the return to a system of utilities payments based on units rather than cash payment and discussions to commence to frame an agreed timetable for the return of the remaining benefits.  We are also concerned about the loss of the transition pension and in respect of this we ask that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, push the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to put in place the necessary legislation to allow older people who so wish to continue to work until they are aged 66, so they can work until they get the State pension.  This is very important.  In view of the special position of some workers, their jobseeker's benefit should be increased by &euro;5 per week to &euro;193 for the year during which they wait.  Similarly, we ask that an additional &euro;5 per week be given to unemployed people aged 65 because they receive only &euro;188.  The universal pensions for all and the women in pensions position is covered in our submission.<\/p><p> We are making a special plea for people living alone.  We receive many calls from survivors who find that two can live nearly as cheaply as one.  Examples of this are the prescription charges cap which is per household irrespective of whether it is for one or two people, making a difference between &euro;25 and &euro;12.50, and the drug refund scheme, for which the difference is between &euro;144 and &euro;72.<\/p> <p>That is the difference between &euro;25 and &euro;12.50 and &euro;1.44 and 72 cent.<\/p><p> There should be a &euro;5 increase in the living alone allowance.  We also wish to have the prescription charge limit and the drugs refund limit examined.  Similarly, on the age allowance, many people are living longer. Any savings they might have are spent and gone by the time they are 80 years of age.  The fuel allowance - which is a life saver for many older people - should be extended for two weeks and there should be a commitment to examining the possibility of restoring its duration to 32 weeks and to agreeing a payment based on a particular drop in temperature in a particular year.  At the moment, the weather is not severe and that is to be welcomed.  We welcome the Minister's assurance that the travel scheme is going to be maintained in its current format. We are very pleased to hear that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100007#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms M&aacute;iread Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412166900,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I ask Ms Hayes to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100009#P00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412166900,"counter":19,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100009#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms M&aacute;iread Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1412166900,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the various groups for coming in and for their submissions.  I apologise on behalf of the committee for the fact that they were kept waiting.  It was not intentional.<\/p><p>  I have read the submissions and it would be very difficult to argue against any of the requirements.  We can be sure they will all not be granted in this budget.  I can ascertain the priorities from reading the submissions and the Opposition will do its very best to have as many as possible met.  As Mr. Dolan has stated, it is time to redress the balance.  There has been a very traumatic adjustment over the last number of years and many very respected organisations - some of which are State organisations - have concluded that the adjustment has been borne very disproportionately by the poorer sections of society which include, of course, the elderly poor and people with disabilities.<\/p><p> Turning to a few specific aspects of the submissions, we all know the effect of the medical card rule changes.  In the AV room at a meeting with some senior officials from the HSE about four months ago we were told that any outstanding discretionary medical cards would be returned to people within three weeks.  I do not know what is happening elsewhere but I do know that in my own area there are still a number of people waiting for a decision on their discretionary medical cards to be returned to them.<\/p><p>  The free telephone rental allowance is very high on the priority list.  Is there any evidence of how many people - what proportion of people - have abandoned their security system because they could no longer afford the telephone rental charges?  We were also assured at the time of the removal of the free telephone rental allowance that technology was available to make this system work with mobile telephones.  I do not think that is the case and if so are there any examples of it?<\/p><p>  On water charges, there will, as I understand it from the information we have so far, be a waiver of approximately &euro;100 per annum for eligible people.  It will be confined to those receiving the household benefits package, as far as I can see.  Elderly people who are in receipt of social welfare, who might for instance have a son, daughter or grandchild living with them, will not qualify.  It means a person on Jobseeker's Allowance under the age of 66 will not qualify.<\/p><p>  The request for a fortnight's extension on the fuel allowance is very reasonable.  I also agree that there should be some flexibility when the weather is particularly harsh.  On the bereavement grant, are there any examples of how the abolition of the grant is working out in practice?  We were told when the grant was abolished that people could apply for the burial grant.  This continues to be available.  Unfortunately, the budget out of which the burial grant is paid has also been reduced.   In this regard how has the circle has been squared?<\/p> <p> On allowances for people with disabilities, we must also ascertain when the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant, which have ceased to operate since the decision of the Ombudsman some time ago, will be reinstated.  The delay has been quite extraordinary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100009#P00400","speaker":"1059","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412167200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I will not go over the ground Deputy O'Dea has already covered.  On the last point about the motorised transport grant and the mobility allowance, we are as much in the dark about when the new scheme will appear as the witnesses and we have raised it both at this committee and at the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, which I sit on.  It has also been raised in the Joint Committee on Health and Children, so hopefully we will see some movement on that soon.<\/p><p>   I have come across the issue of the adaptation grant quite often recently.  This seems to be having a very severe effect on the elderly and those with disabilities in that they must find someone in the family who can foot some of the bill because if they do not apply early enough in the year, the local authority will not be able to give them the full amount as their budget will have run out.  It is hard luck if one ends up with a disability in the middle of a year.  One's house will not be adapted in many ways unless the council can juggle budgets.  I wanted to find out whether these reductions in the money available in the adaptation grants from the local authority happen in areas other than my own, as I am in the city.<\/p><p>  I was interested in what Mr. Dolan said about the Intreo offices.  The Minister has come before this committee and if Mr. Dolan lets us know about other similar issues, we will raise them with the Minister directly because there has been much fanfare about these offices.  I have welcomed them, I have attended the openings of them and if there are problems with access, etc., as was presented in Mr. Dolan's statement, let us know and the committee will put it to the officials and to the Ministers.  <\/p><p>  I wish to thank the organisations, most of whose representatives I have met on and off over the last few years, for their forbearance and for presenting well the harshness of the cuts and their effects on those the witnesses represent because I do not think it can be easy to do that dispassionately.  I know the witnesses are not dispassionate, but it can sometimes be difficult to put across the scale of the hurt in many ways.  We can probably all give examples of constituents who have suffered the effects of cuts, particularly the elderly and those with disabilities, who are on a fixed income and do not have the ability to increase their funding in any way.  They are limited in mobility, which means that they are often more greatly affected if there is a cold spell and that is why the issue of fuel poverty among these groups, which is thankfully being looked at by various organisations, is very significant.  I endorse Ms Hayes's call for a two week extension, but I would have asked for a full reversal.  I would also ask for the more rapid roll-out of the retrofitting of people's houses to ensure that the insulation that is now available relatively cheaply in comparison with the past is rolled out for people who are living alone or living in houses which are not suitable for this day and age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100010#Q00300","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1412167200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their reports and congratulate them on the campaign in defence of the travel pass, which was very effective.  We are getting conflicting reports; on one hand we hear that austerity may be over and that there will be tax cuts and then, on the other, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and others say that we must continue with austerity, mentioning the troika, the European Commission and the rest.<\/p> <p> It is very hard to know exactly what is going to come down the tracks on budget day.  At a minimum services have to be protected and built on because they are the crucial areas where people can access a small amount of money.  They have to be put back into place.  There are other small things that could be highlighted.  Particularly with the income reduction from &euro;700 to &euro;500 for over 70s, we have found a huge swathe of people who are having their medical cards docked.  These are mainly people who have a contributory pension, a small work pension for example, that is just bringing them over the threshold.  We had a man who got an increase of &euro;10 when he turned 80, and that brought him over the income threshold for the medical card.  He lost out hugely from that, and that is an example of a bureaucracy being an incredible morass.  Agencies cannot be flexible.  This man was requesting that the &euro;10 be taken back off him so that they could give him back his medical card.  He was given a GP card.  We are also dealing with a 92 year-old woman in a nursing home at the moment, who has Alzheimer's disease.  She is &euro;20 over and her medical card has been stopped.  I do not understand this.<\/p><p> This madness should be the first thing to be stopped and then we can look where we can build.  As was stated earlier, undoing the cuts in disability allowance, household packages, home helps, SNAs and so on has to be prioritised. We should be looking for the Government to set out a plan for what we are going to do this time, what we are going to do next time if we have any more money, and allocate that money to try and protect those services and build on them.<\/p><p> Another issue that was raised with me is that the local property tax is not levied on hospitals or nursing homes.  Surely the homes of people who are carers are considered as a medical type area or safe place that should not be included for the local property tax, because they are specifically medical places of care.<\/p><p> Have the witnesses found that many people are not getting that next step from the domiciliary care allowance to the disability allowance when they reach 16 years of age?  Is there feedback of instances where people are having difficulty with this?<\/p><p> A large number of elderly people have used up all their savings now because they have been supporting their families.  Many of them went guarantor for mortgages that were way above what they should have been, leading to mortgage arrears.  There are also many elderly people who support family members who are in mortgage arrears, paying that as well.  My own mother does it.  All those savings are being eaten away.  The vulnerability that leaves people in is terrible.  They have always been told to be frugal and to put their money aside and save.  That has to be part of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100010#Q00500","speaker":"1193","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412167500,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I could not disagree with most of what has been said here today because we all know that every man, woman and child has been affected over the last few years, people with disabilities and people without them.  I appreciate that Mr. Dolan and Dr. McCarthy have done a huge amount of work for people with disabilities.  At every opportunity Mr. Dolan is advocating for people with disabilities.  We spoke about the mobility allowance and the transport grant.  I made a detailed submission into the working group.  I do not know if any other members did so.<\/p> <p>My concern is that the payment will be taken away and a transport scheme put in its place.  While that might sound well to someone living in the heart of Dublin, Galway or Cork city, it is no good for someone coming from a rural area like I do in Kerry or from the Iveragh Peninsula.  For a young person there, transport might not be available to take them home.  If they have a few bob in their pocket, because of the grant, then they can hire a taxi.  While the payment is still in place, new applicants cannot apply.  I would like to have more changes to the payment but, unfortunately, the Ombudsman, has ruled on it.<\/p><p> Mr. John Dolan and Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to problems with access to Intreo offices for those with disabilities, which is very serious.  There is the supported employment service in place for people with disabilities through the Intreo offices.  There should be no reason why people with disabilities would not be helped in the Intreo offices to get back into employment, as well as grants and assistance for employers to take on people with disabilities.  If Mr. John Dolan&rsquo;s members are encountering problems, he should bring them to the fore and highlight them so they can be rectified.<\/p><p> Ms Hayes said there were increases in prices of some hotels, restaurants and food outlets of approximately 8%.  There should be a decrease of 8% as the Government has reduced the VAT rate to 9% in the hospitality trade.  I found prices in my area on menus went down once the reduced VAT rate was introduced.<\/p><p> The requests made by the delegations are reasonable.  However, we know that in the real world everything cannot be restored in one budget.  There are several issues which have been raised that I will bring to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Education and Skills.  Mr. John Dolan was in the Seanad Chamber last week when we moved a motion on access to education for people with disabilities.  I am seeking to have the age cap on special schools abolished.  As it stands, children with special needs cannot continue their education in special schools when they reach a certain age but have to go into the Health Service Executive, HSE, which does not have the same structured education programmes.<\/p><p> I must point out to the delegations that these cuts were not introduced by this Government alone but by successive Governments.  I have to take up the point made on cuts to special needs assistants, SNAs.  There have been no cuts to SNAs.  Between 2010 and 2011, there were 10,328 SNAs; between 2011 and 2012, 10,487; and between 2013 and 2013, 10,656.  So far this year, 10,900 SNAs are in place.  Their numbers have increased every year.  I accept there may be growing demand for SNAs which means some children may not get access to them.  However, there have been no cuts to the numbers.  It is the same with resource and learning supports.  They now stand at the highest level they have even been.  People with disabilities, thankfully, are living longer due to better care.  This means demands on disability services are increasing.<\/p><p> I will put the issues raised to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  However, not everything can be delivered in one go and there is no point in pretending they can.  I will ask her to prioritise some of these requests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100011#R00200","speaker":"1132","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412168100,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the three groups for their powerful presentations which made strong cases for those they represent and their hopes for the forthcoming budget.  Hopefully, a start can be made to rectify previous cuts with this budget.  Backbench Deputies will make the case for this but, ultimately, decisions are made at Cabinet.<\/p><p>  Mr. John Dolan referred to the ratio of the adjustment being two thirds cuts versus one third taxation.  The two parties in Government have different perspectives on how this can be done.  Before the last election, the Labour Party presented a case for a 50:50 ratio while Fine Gael presented a 75:25 ratio.  It ended up at a 60:40 ratio.  This is the agreement which drives the series of bugets but we will continue to make the case for fewer cuts, along with the restoration of some services and grants that were previously cut.<\/p><p>  The delegations have presented a long list of requests, particularly regarding senior citizens.  It might be helpful if these were prioritised for us to present to the relevant Ministers later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100013#T00100","speaker":"1013"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412168100,"counter":28,"content":"<p>We have not come across too many cases of older people abandoning their landline telephones but there is the occasional case of people no longer using them.

I have spoken to the company running this service and it assures me it will check the mobile telephone signal at a person&rsquo;s home three times.  Our concern, however, is that part of a person's property could have signal shadows.  If that is where someone has a fall, then the pendant alarm might not work.  It is not such a straightforward switch to a mobile system.<\/p><p>  Before the change to the home adaptation grant in January, our problem was the scheme was never sufficiently funded.  As the waiting lists were so long, several local authorities stopped taking applications as there was no point allowing people continue to join a queue which was not moving.  In our pre-budget submission, we call for substantial investment in the home adaptation scheme.  If we cannot allow people to live independently in their homes by simply adapting them to meet their changing needs through lack of funding, the problem then is the knock-on effect this has with increased and more costly demands on the health services in areas such as home help, nursing homes and acute bed use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100013#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamon Timmins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412168100,"counter":29,"content":"<p>We are finding that many older people agonise over continuing with their landline but when they come to cancel it, some providers give them better deals with reductions from &euro;90 for two months to &euro;58.<\/p> <p>That is what we are getting.  <\/p><p> I shall address the question of our list of priorities.  It is a bit like the points made by the Deputies because if I identify a priority then some of our constituent members will say it is not the biggest one.  Our priority is the people who we have identified as being worse off - the older old and so on.  As my colleague mentioned, the Christmas bonus might be a way of helping everybody because everybody would know they are getting it.  I am reluctant to say it will arrive before the water bills in January but at least people would know it was coming and could do something.  <\/p><p> Let me return to Deputy O'Dea's questions.  There are a lot of questions about medical cards but we keep being told there is no such thing as a discretionary medical card.  I would very much like it if one of the members would sort the matter out for us.  We keep being told that there is no such thing as a discretionary medical card and there are two types, means tested or an over-70s card.  I have read all about the matter.  All of the members have referred to medical cards and I have outlined what we have been told.<\/p><p> Mr. Timmins has answered the question on mobile telephones.  Let me answer the question on household benefits and who can be deemed to be in a household.  The issue has come to our attention and did so again yesterday.  <\/p><p> In terms of the bereavement grant, we understand people are going to the community welfare officer but, unfortunately, we have not been able to get a figure.  I have only had one case.  A family was unable to provide the full cost to cover the burial of their loved one and so went to the CWO.  The family is also pursuing whether the UK will pay some of the money because the deceased had a UK pension.  The issue is a bit involved and we would appreciate if members could give us some answers.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about six weeks provision.  We would love to get the six weeks provision back for people because it is one of the big areas of concern.

It has been an issue for a long time and well before the onset of the recession.  I know and remember, anecdotally, one area being told, before it even got the allocation for the following year, that funding had been totally eaten up by waiting lists.  The problem has been prevalent for some time and I am sure research is available.  If anybody is interested in the research please let me know and I will get it as I do not have it to hand. <\/p><p>  A number of Members raised an issue about Intreo offices.  It is an issue and is not confined to one particular area.  There is a sense that when people present with a disability they are referred to just two disability employment specialists.  People with disabilities come from different groups.  Some people are more job ready than others and, therefore, it is more appropriate for them to go to Intreo offices.  However, we have been told that Intreo offices are saying they do not feel they have the specialism to respond to people with disabilities.  There are teething problems that we are trying to address.  We sought funding to carry out research and begin to look at how one could upskill or work with Intreo offices thus leaving them feeling they have the skills to work with people who are more job ready, and then work with specialist organisations to support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100014#U00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1412168400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Intreo was put in place to help people and refer them on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100014#U00500","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412168400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>This has become an issue and is blocking people.  However, the extent of it is anecdotal at the moment.  We have sought funding to do some work to uncover the real situation but we will look into the matter.  We would appreciate any member using any avenue to raise the issue and shed some more light on the matter.<\/p><p>  In terms of special needs, the Deputy was right that we do refer to it in one area.  As was said, the big issue is the availability of special needs assistants and the increase in need.  Mainstreaming has taken hold.  It happens more successfully in education where people more frequently enter into mainstream education either through mainstream school or in a supported environment in a mainstream school. <\/p> <p>This increased rate of entrance is not being balanced with the number of special needs assistants.  In our submission, the Disability Federation of Ireland states that in light of this development, it is time to review the purpose of the SNA and we are asking for a dual approach.<\/p><p> To revert to Deputy Joan Collins, while listening to her, a concept the DFI has been seeking for a while came into my head, namely, that of having a commitment in which we begin to look at developing a comprehensive plan for redeveloping social infrastructure.  I think members are hearing different bits of it from everyone in attendance today.  We need a commitment in this budget or we need to see that this budget offers us the beginning of a commitment to the redevelopment of a comprehensive social infrastructure.  In this regard, Mr. John Dolan has uncovered some interesting statistics recently.  For example, one in eight people will acquire a disability, 120 babies will be born next year with Down's syndrome, and a further 120 will be born with a significant need.  Similarly, 250 of us will develop multiple sclerosis next year, 4,000 will develop Alzheimer's, and the list goes on.  Disability will hit us all as we all are getting older.  We need to know that services are in place and are being planned for.  It is known that our demographics will help us and we seek budgets to use this information to begin to plan for much more responsive services that will lessen the impact on individuals and families.  This is what our submission and I am sure those of others are trying to do here today.  I do not know whether I have answered everyone's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100014#U00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412169000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>In a nutshell, and picking up on themes that came from members, whom I thank for the attention they gave to the submissions, people with disabilities and their families seek a real sign of hope.  It is clear that all the members on both sides of the House are making the point that it cannot all be done next year.  Each one of us knows that, but I refer to clarity about a sign that something tangible is happening and that, on the economic side, we have pulled more out of the services than the tax side or whatever but we are now reversing engines in some way.  That is what people need: a boost to their morale.  Deputy Collins made the point about families and people having used up all their slack.  We all do that.  We grin and bear it and get on with it.  The slack is used up, however, and it is not there any more.<\/p><p>  On the more particular issues, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh spoke of our forbearance and I should tell him that as far as I am concerned, I have almost run out of it at this point, although I will do my best to be respectful.  When I listen to people and families, however, and I acknowledge members also do this and that we are not the only ones, it is difficult to keep going.  The point is there must be a clear signal and while it cannot be huge, it must be real and meaningful.  Members should remember that no one negotiated with any of the people in this room about what was going to happen.  Negotiations were held with public service workers.  I do not suggest there should not have been but there was no negotiation with the people at the sharp end of the services.  It was the chemistry of a coalition Government that came up with a figure that split the calf in some way or other, so to speak.

We are talking maybe less than a euro - 50 cent - or one euro extra a week to pay, which coming out of a tight pension is enough.  For a couple, it will be about &euro;3.50 per week.  When we say to the committee we are looking for a &euro;5 increase in the State pension, &euro;3.50 of that is gone already.  The State will tell us it cannot afford it and ask from where the money is to come.  Another &euro;3.50 for couples who have not had an increase in their pensions since 2009 is gone.  We welcome the measures put in place, including the 30,000 litre allowance every household will get and the sum of &euro;100, which equates to about 20,000 litres based on the prices we saw yesterday.  That will protect pensioners living alone.  It will not be enough for a couple, if we are working off an average figure of &euro;278, minus &euro;100, making &euro;178 for a couple.

Last week, after threatening to go to the Ombudsman, I got the office to issue a discretionary card to a person who had been waiting since last February.  The minute I said I thought he was being unfairly treated and I was reporting the matter to the Ombudsman, the card was issued with a validity until June of next year, which is a very short time.

One of the contributory factors was that both Governments had maintained social welfare payments at a fairly high level.  That was not the policy in Spain, Britain or Greece.<br\/>Patrick Honohan, Governor of the Central Bank, said in a speech that the group most detrimentally affected by the recession was people aged between 30 and mid to late 40s who bought houses with high mortgages at the top of the market.  The Central Statistics Office has found that the people most at risk of poverty are families with young children and lone parents.  The main group hit by social welfare cuts in recent years were jobseekers.  One cannot get jobseeker's benefit for as long as previously.  A jobseeker, like one in my constituency, getting &euro;188 a week, with a mortgage, might live next door to a pensioner on &euro;230 a week who has no mortgage.  This is a sensitive issue but it needs to be said.<br\/>There was an op-ed in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>on 15 September &ndash; I remember the date because it was when the Labour Party had its think-in &ndash; by an economist who said that the elderly are among the most vocal groups about cuts in recent years but they have been the least hit.  What is Mr. Timmins&rsquo; view of that?<br\/>Age Action has asked for an extra bit in the pension, restoration of the fuel allowance, increased living allowance, and so on.  Is that not just the shopping list for ways to put money into people&rsquo;s pockets at the expense of services?

If I am on a low income and in poor health, if I could be guaranteed another hour of home help it would make a huge difference to my life, but am I going to get that?  Certainly from an older person's perspective, what we hear about is the anxiety of what is going to be lost next.  People who have reached a stage of their life where they are dependent on the State for certain services and income supports find they are in doubt and in question.  That is the big issue - this constant anxiety as to what is going to go next.

We have managed not to fracture it.  That is a credit to older and younger people and is something we should all give ourselves a clap on the back for.  What I am seeing are the social transfers that older people are giving.  One of the people in the Visitors Gallery was telling me about what he was giving last week.  He left a meeting that we had because he had to take somebody some place as part of the family.  While he was doing that, he got a telephone call to say one grandchild had cracked her head at school and had to be collected.  Believe it or not, he was only just telling me this, I did not know the issue would come up today.  He then got a call to say another grandchild had fainted at school and he had to go again.  I do not know how one would value that or what price one would put on it.  That is what older people have stepped up to do in the crisis.<\/p><p>  Mr. Timmins has handled the anxiety factor.  One of the difficulties is that people cannot be assured that a service is available for them.  We are more in touch with the pulse of what is happening now in 2014.  A lot of the research and statistics are from 2012.  We have members who are 55 years of age and are on jobseeker's payments.  They cannot get work.  We were selling tickets to raise funds in D&uacute;n Laoghaire shopping centre, because we are all experiencing no funds into our organisations.  A lady told me that she was made redundant eight years ago at age 55.  She said she had an option to take a pension but she decided she would get another job but eight years later she has not got a job.  She lives in an apartment where she has to pay &euro;1,500 for charges and the local property tax.  She has &euro;20 for left for food every week.  I asked her if she had fuel allowance and she said she would not like to claim it.  I told her she was entitled to it and should claim it.  I mentioned to her about the community welfare officer but she did not know what that was.<\/p><p>  We are very conscious that there are people who are classed in the UN and EU as being older, over 50, who are unemployed and who are getting &euro;188.  That is why we have asked for the older people who are not on the State pension to get an extra &euro;5.  When the question was raised by the newly-appointed Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar about whether it was better to have &euro;5 or better services, a large number of people told us they would like the &euro;5.  Age Action and ourselves were at a session in the Aviva stadium where the new Minister for Health was speaking to the public when this issue was raised.  <\/p><p>  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability, older people, equality and mental health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch said that a new scheme was adapted in Cork where people were assured that when they needed the service they would get it, rather than booking for the service.<\/p> <p>They now know that they will get the service when they want it, but what is currently happening is that everybody fears that they will not get the service.  <\/p><p>  I also want to say, in answer to some of the questions that were raised earlier, that we do not want to continue doing things the same way.  We see situations affecting how older people are living now due to bad planning and we would be very upset if some of the new legislation that is to be introduced does not take account of aging and increasing frailty and disabilities.  We do not want to see any places for older people, or for younger people, being built that do not take account of accessibility for showering, etc.  Many people do not have to adapt their house if they can use a chair lift, as one of my colleagues in the audience does.  I asked her whether she had to adapt the ground floor of her house and she said that she did not because she had a toilet downstairs already and she could use a chair lift.  The measures taken do not, therefore, have to be expensive, but we must agree as a society what they are.  When the Government talks to us seriously about that, we can look at the options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014100100018#Y00600","nonspeaker":"Ms M&aacute;iread Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412170800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Ms Hayes raised an important issue, but there are very difficult choices to be made.  I will not say that the need of a young jobseeker for experience and money is not a big deal.  It is a big deal.  However, the jobseeker has a hope.  Although it is the ambition of Government to be back to full employment by 2020, that is never-never land for someone who is currently unemployed.  The disabled person is, leaving aside the payments for younger jobseekers, on the same contingency level of payment as a jobseeker.  However, their situation is not a contingency, it is permanent.  That is a problem.  We have issues with Intreo and others, where young people with disabilities cannot get into programmes to start doing their training and development. This contrasts with other jobseekers, who do hopefully get those opportunities in general, so it is quite complex.<\/p><p>  Middle-aged heads of households do not know which way to turn.  They have children on one hand and ageing parents at the other end of the spectrum, so they are under pressure.  Some of them might also have disability in the family; Dr. McCarthy gave some statistics there.  Some of those people will have a child born to them next year with a disability, some will hear that their mum or dad has Alzheimer's disease.  All these pressures come in on top of each other.  It is complex because they are not separate issues.  Mr. Timmins referred to older people and disability and while not every older person is disabled there is a lot of it around.  <\/p><p>  This question of funding services versus having a few bob in your pocket is very tempting and colleagues have been very clear about that.  People with disabilities cannot bypass the fact that they need certain services.  One cannot buy the services of a personal assistant for an hour or half an hour with a fiver a week.  The reality is that the public services are in poor shape although people are doing their best to keep them going.  People do not have confidence in them either.  That is why we need to give a practical sign that we are trying to turn that around.<\/p><p>  I very much appreciate the attendance at this meeting.

Ms Hayes responded to the issue.  I live in a rural area and I have seen the effects of the cuts.  I have seen cuts people have had to make personally because of the non-availability of money.  People depend solely on their State pension.  The Christmas bonus would be of enormous value to those people.  In a lot of cases it would mean they would have proper meals over Christmas.  This year is an example in that from January onwards people did not feed themselves as they should.  That is a cut people made.<\/p><p> At a meeting with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, I indicated that a neighbour had hidden a lot of things from us.  He was given a loan by the bank to buy a house at an age where he should not have bought a house but the banks were throwing money at him.  He bought a house but it was badly in need of repair.  The storms early in the year caused further damage to his house and he had to borrow again from a credit union to fix the roof.  He is in constant fear as he cannot afford to pay the mortgage and for the damage to the roof.  He only confided in us after we put pressure on him.  We asked what had happened to his dog.  He had put the dog down because he could not afford to keep him.  The dog was in need of medical attention and he could not afford to pay for that either.  That was unfortunate.  The same person has additional problems in his old age.  He was recently diagnosed with diabetes.  He confided in me that he would be better off gone.  We have to keep a constant eye on him.  He is not the only one in a similar situation.  Anyone depending on the State pension would find himself or herself in that position.  If those people could have a meal over Christmas it might be some sort of a happy Christmas for them.

The purpose of the meeting is to meet representatives of Crosscare Migrant Project.  Members will be aware that Crosscare is a non-governmental organisation which receives funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to provide information and advocacy service to intending Irish emigrants and returning Irish emigrants.  That is an important service for people going out and returning home also.<br\/>The committee is well aware both of the positive contribution that Irish emigrants have made to events worldwide but also of the problems that some of our emigrants have experienced.  We have heard of those problems recently in certain countries.  Earlier this year we specifically referred to the role of the diaspora in our contribution to the Department's review on foreign policy and external relations.  We had a very good session in the D&aacute;il for which most members turned up.  Part of the report stated that the joint committee approves the programme operated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in support of organisations working on behalf of emigrants, including those who help people whose experience of emigration has not been as successful as others.  These programmes should continue.  It considers, nevertheless, that further means might be explored by the Department and the Government to ensure that the diaspora feels itself engaged not simply as a resource to be exploited, but as a cherished part of the Irish community overall.<br\/>Today we will meet Crosscare Migrant Project.  In the previous correspondence from Crosscare, we note its proposal for an Irish emigrant register.  It will form the centrepiece of today's presentation.<br\/>Before I invite Crosscare to make its presentation I remind members, witnesses and those in the public gallery to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference even on silent mode with the recording equipment.  <br\/>I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment, criticise or make charges against any person or body outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l) <\/i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br\/>I welcome Mr. Joe O'Brien from Crosscare Migrant Project who is accompanied by his colleagues, Ms Sarah Owen and Mr. Richard King.  The format of the meeting is that we invite a presentation from the witnesses and proceed to a question and answer session.  I invite Mr. O'Brien to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100100002#A01200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412170200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I might pass directly to my colleague, Mr. Richard King, who will introduce it briefly and I will take over from there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100100002#A01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1412170200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100100002#A01400","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412170200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it today.  We are happy to make this presentation.<\/p><p>  Crosscare Migrant Project is funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's emigrant support programme, the HSE and Crosscare to provide an information, support and advocacy service to Irish emigrants and returning emigrants.  Crosscare is a social support agency of the Dublin Archdiocese and works with people across a wide spectrum in the areas of homeless services, young people's services and older people's supports and community services.<\/p><p>  Since the 1940s, Crosscare has worked with Irish emigrants.  In 1987, our predecessor, Emigrant Advice, was established which worked with people leaving Ireland in the 1980s.  In the 1990s we started to work with the people returning home and, more recently, we have broadened our remit to include all Irish emigrants wherever they may be.  We have a long history of providing support to individuals and families.  We work closely with organisations such as the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas, homeless services in Dublin and the other emigrant support programme-funded groups.<\/p><p>  In addition to our face-to-face and information provision work, which is a huge part of our work, we have conducted much research on policy related issues in the past six years, including presenting to another joint committee on the issue of access to social welfare for returning emigrants.  In 2012, 2013 and 2014 we conducted research into new emigration, including people accessing welfare and homeless services in the UK, recent emigrants to Canada and the mental health needs of recent emigrants through a global online survey promoted through social media.<\/p> <p>We would like to welcome the review of the diaspora policy initiated earlier this year by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I very much look forward to the outcome.  We would also like to acknowledge the very significant development of the appointment of the first dedicated Minister for the Diaspora, Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan in July 2014.<\/p><p> I will hand over to my colleague Mr. Joe O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100100002#A01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard King","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412170200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Emigration has been with us for hundreds of years and for the foreseeable future it is likely to remain an aspect of Irish life.  It is important to remember that even in years of growth, thousands of Irish people have emigrated.  Emigration and recent emigration, in particular, has been problematic.  One of the persistent challenges over the centuries has been the legacy of disconnection.<\/p><p>  Emigration creates disconnected lives, disconnected families and communities and yet we are led to believe that as a society and globally we are more interconnected than ever before.  Since April 2008, some 250,000 Irish people have left the State, the equivalent of the populations of Ennis, Tallaght, New Ross, Limerick city, Cavan town, Kenmare, Drogheda and Ballinasloe being emptied out.  Most worrying, the recent CSO statistics show that in the year up to April 2014, we have the lowest rate of return immigration of Irish people since records began in 1996.  It could well be that those who have left are deciding increasingly to stay away.<\/p><p>  As a pre-departure information service for emigrants we have seen that the recent wave of emigration has been substantially different from previous times.  It has been the first wave of Irish emigration in the Internet age.  This has transformed the emigration experience significantly and has allowed for a far higher degree of pre-departure preparation.  For example, it is now possible to search for, view and finalise accommodation online before departure.  Successful job interviews are often held via web based video link for jobs on the other side of the world and communication options with home have improved dramatically with e-mail, social networking, photosharing and live video linking via Skype, all available at extremely low cost.<\/p><p>  Last year's UCC Emigre report, Irish Emigration in an Age of Austerity, found that 75% of Irish emigrants use Skype regularly to maintain contact with family and friends in Ireland with 90% using Facebook and other social networking sites.  In particular from the point of view of what the State can do, the Internet has not been maximised in terms of its capacity to minimise the damage, the loss and the disconnection caused by emigration.  This view is echoed in a more recent report by UCD Clinton Institute on supporting the next generation of the Irish Diaspora.<\/p><p>  From the UCC Emigre report, it is very significant that more than 70% of emigrants frequently read Irish newspapers online and another 16% read them sometimes.  At the same time Irish emigrants abroad continue to feel forgotten about by the Irish State.  Some 48% of emigrants disagreed with the statement that the Government provided adequate support for them.<\/p><p>  In short we believe there is a lack of reciprocity of interest.  Once people have left the State, it will have little if any interaction with them unless they return home.  What we are proposing is a remarkably simple idea, the creation of a State managed e-mail based database, whereby emigrants would simply log minimal information such as e-mail address, name, country of residence and periodically they would receive an e-mail or a newsletter from the Irish State.  The Irish emigrant register, as we are calling it, could be used in a number of ways to improve the connection between the State and our ever growing diaspora.  A very practical initial purpose of the emigrant register would be to facilitate return migration by connecting Irish emigrants abroad and a developing labour market in Ireland.  The State could, for example, contact emigrants directly with a list of job vacancies and emerging skills needs in the Irish labour market as part of a regular update or newsletter.  The Department of Social Protection has sent welfare recipients in Ireland notifications of job advertisements for countries as far away as Canada.  Today I found a total of 68 advertisements for jobs abroad on INTREO Jobsearch database.  We say that the Irish State should be also notifying Irish emigrants abroad about jobs in Ireland.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, in particular the expert group on future skills, needs could feed into such updates by providing information on current and emerging skills needs.  The following skills deficits were identified in a recent report by them in the areas of ICT, science, engineering, sales, marketing, business, finance and health care.<\/p><p>  This is information that our emigrants should have as soon as it becomes available.  I attended a national youth council conference on return migration two weeks ago, where a representative from the Construction Industry Federation expressed concern that the industry was unable to fill emerging technical posts.  In the context of unemployment and austerity measures, some people feel there is an implied invitation to leave the country by the State.  Whatever amount of truth is in this, many would agree that there should be an explicit invitation to return.<\/p><p>  The availability of jobs is one of the most common factors cited by emigrants abroad that would influence the chances of an emigrant returning home according to the aforementioned UCC report.  The establishment of the Irish emigrant register would be a very clear way of saying \"we want you back\".  However, it could also be used for other purposes such as informing citizens about relevant embassy and consular services, and passport and travel advice issues.  It could also be used as the basis of a consultation tool in the development of various relevant Government policy.  In the Internet age, our citizens abroad can be as connected with and invested in the political, economic and social issues in Ireland as those of us living here.  Their views could and should be elicited and invited in a more direct manner that the Irish emigrant register could facilitate.  In essence it would act as a connecting mechanism between the Irish State and its citizens abroad.  <\/p><p>  We propose that the register might be best managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with inputs from the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, INTREO and the Department of Social Protection.  While the proposal is relatively simple, we have identified some issues that need to be overcome.  We have broken them down into three.  The first challenge would be populating the register, followed by keeping it updated.  Second, like any database or register resources will need to be dedicated to its maintenance and expansion.  Third, data protection, the usage parameters of the register should be very clearly defined and communicated up-front.<\/p><p>  In respect of the first challenge, populating the register, we have a few suggestions on how that might best be done.  We believe the Irish emigrant register would need to be marketed by Government at a very high level and globally, for example, St. Patrick's Day 2015 could offer an ideal platform for the register to be launched and promoted in a global manner.  It also offers a reasonable yet swift timeframe to get the register up and running.  Irish embassies, consulates, NGOs businesses and media globally should be engaged in the promotion of the register.  At another level the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade could negotiate with the Australian and Canadian emigration services with whom we have reciprocal visa agreements to amend their working holiday visa application forms for Irish people to include a mechanism whereby they would agree to their name and e-mail address to be sent to the Irish State for direct inclusion on the register.  This measure alone could potentially add 20,000 to 30,000 people automatically to the register every year, at current rates of emigration.  For this to work, it is important that requested data is kept to a minimum and evidence is shown on a regular basis that it is working and people are actually benefiting from it.<\/p><p>  Our ask is simple, although there are a couple of aspects to it.  We ask the committee to champion this proposal.  We ask members to write to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan and the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, requesting them to progress the proposals by four specific actions, setting up of a cross-departmental working group between the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Social Protections; ensuring that funding is available to do this in budget 2015; marking 17 March 2015 as a possible launch date for the actual register; and asking the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to open negotiations with Australia and Canada in terms of the option to give information to Ireland on the e-mail addresses of people emigrating by working holiday visas.<\/p><p>  The Irish emigrant register will not transform emigration into something easy.  It will not make forced emigration more acceptable, but what it does have the capacity to do is to serve as a link between the State and its citizens abroad, many of whom still feel poorly supported and forgotten about.  Ultimately, we believe it can help to improve our relationship with our diaspora, not in an ethereal way but in a very practical and tangible sense by, for example, making the Irish labour market more connected to Irish emigrants abroad.  The proposal will need a modest amount of funding compared to its potential gain, it will need focused co-operation between a number of Departments and it requires dedicated responsibility being assigned and persisted with.  Many of our emigrants abroad are only waiting to get the call home and are only waiting to feel more connected with their country.  In a globalised world, we suggest that we should take the lead in showing other global nations how to stay connected and prove how much our diaspora means to us, by establishing the Irish emigrant register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100100003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1412170800,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien and Mr. King for their presentations.  Before I hand over to Deputy Smith I wish to ask a few questions.  How much funding is needed to set up the register?  At this time of year budgets are prepared and the Department seeks extra funding.  The committee could write to the Department requesting it provide funding for the register because, in theory, it is a very good idea.  At present many embassies have a voluntary register.  The suggested date of St. Patrick's Day 2015 is a good one because it is the day when all the Irish tend to gather and go to Irish functions and events taking place all over the world.

I presume minimal funding would establish the project.  Often as a State we are reluctant to use universities, institutes of technology, business schools and research units in colleges to carry out specific work on behalf of Departments.  The project could be delegated, within reason, to a college, institute of technology, business school or whatever.  Minimal costs would be involved, as Mr. O'Brien said.  I am sure, as a committee, we would support the proposal being made to the Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The delegation welcomed the appointment of the first Minister of Strate with responsibility for the diaspora, Deputy Deenihan.  There is no better man to do a good job and I wish him every success in that role.<\/p><p>  One of the things we want to ensure, and hoping the proposal can be progressed, is that we reach as many people as possible.  Many of the people that Crosscare deals with, whether emigrants abroad or returned emigrants, are the more vulnerable.  Unfortunately, many of the more vulnerable people will not have access to the Internet.  We must ensure that it is not just the people who are most literate, technology friendly and can access all modern means of communication, who can access the service.  <\/p><p>  Over the years many of us have worked in different continents, in Britain, the States and elsewhere.  I have noticed in more recent years when I interacted with county associations from my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, as others will have done so with their own counties, the age profile of the county associations, who have done marvellous work over the years, has risen considerably.  When one attends one of their functions one finds the older emigrant attends.  In general, the younger emigrant gravitates towards Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael, the GAA, and probably Comhaltas as well.  We have also discussed the Irish in Britain and the huge amount of valuable work done by the two organisations with H.E. Dan Mulhall, the Irish ambassador to Britain.   From the point of view of maximising the potential of this very good proposal, we must ensure Crosscare has every support from those particular organisations because they have huge databases.  We also want to ensure that the most vulnerable - the people who live a very lonely and isolated existence - can be reached as far as is possible which I know is not always easy to do.<\/p><p>  In my county of Cavan, some years ago, a time when there was no pressure on public housing, we initiated a programme to provide housing to emigrants who wanted to return home.  Unfortunately, there was not a big take-up and I do not know if the scheme was rolled out in other counties.  Some people did come back and the small number of people that I knew who returned, under the initiative, enjoyed a new lease of life.  <\/p><p>  With regard to social welfare and giving assistance to people who return here, a constant obstacle that I have encountered, which I am sure has been experienced by all of my colleagues in the Oireachtas, is the habitual residency clause.  I have seen instances of adults returning home to care for an elderly parent or sibling having given up their jobs in Britain or wherever but who could not get social welfare payments here.  Those people cared for their family member at home instead of leaving them in a nursing home.  The habitual residency clause does not seem to be as big an obstacle today as it was a number of years ago.  I do not know if it still is.  Perhaps Crosscare has some suggestions we could pursue that would solve the issue and ease that particular difficulty for returning emigrants.  I am sure we would be glad to support worthwhile proposals.  <\/p><p>  Like the Chairman, I compliment Crosscare on its work that it does on an ongoing basis.  I am well acquainted with its work which is very welcome.  The proposal has great potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100100004#C00300","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1412170800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>The Deputy raised an important point about the habitual residency clause.

We share the same position in that we all see the positive elements in the proposal.<br\/>Crosscare has two jobs to do.  First, it must sell the register to us and to the Department.  I presume the only difficulty the Department will have with it is the cost.  There are positives regarding the proposal.<br\/>Second, a body of work must be done to sell it to emigrants.  As the delegation said, 48% of emigrants felt there was not adequate support for them.  There is also an element who feel they were forced to emigrate and, therefore, are resentful.  Crosscare must reconnect with them, if nothing else.  We  must maintain contact and re-enforce the idea that emigrants are not seen as a cash cow or having failed Ireland in some way.  These are big issues in the discussion.  All of that must be part of the register.<br\/>The register must be relevant.  People will not register if it is just a standard one and not kept up to date.  The issue is how to make it relevant and attractive.<br\/>A positive point was made about jobs.  The initiative will provide news from home and all those other elements.  People will say they can get news online from <i>The Irish Times <\/i>or other websites but there is other information that is relevant.<br\/>The delegation answered the queries about costs.  Does it know of any other country that has a similar register?  Ireland is unique in that it has a long history of its people leaving.  Can we study other registers and seek out best practice?<br\/>Voting is an issue that crops up all the time and is about the feeling of disconnection.  The issue arose at the Constitutional Convention and it will be discussed in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  Will the delegation consider such debates and information?  As shown by the groups involved, there is a huge amount of interest in votes.  Is it a good idea to factor votes into the register? <br\/>Deputy Smith mentioned the forgotten Irish.  The groups who deal with the Irish in Britain and so on can attest to the fact that there is a disconnect.  A lot of the groups have mentioned that part of the problem for housing, for example, was that one had to approach four or five different Departments and there was no person to co-ordinate things.  Now we have an individual to do the work and I hope progress will be made.  Does Crosscare have a proposal that will run in tandem with the register to reach out to elderly emigrants?  Many of them may not be familiar with computers.  Perhaps I am being dismissive and they are more up to date than the younger element.<br\/>The latest figures on emigration claim people who are much younger are going abroad.  <\/p> <p>Figures released in recent days also show that young graduates are emigrating.  Those young emigrants as well as the older emigrants will find it difficult abroad.  The young people almost expected the days of emigration were over although those who are a little older might have a different view on that.  Those are some of my ideas.<\/p><p> This area presents huge potential.  We would all be singing from the same hymn sheet in agreeing that there is great deal of positivity in what our guests have suggested.  The difficulty will be to sell it to the Minister.  In monetary terms, the cost involved would be buttons having regard to the potential in this area.  We are using the ConnectIreland initiative and other such initiatives.  We are starting to outreach to people who are travelling  to and from this country and to those who have left this country, and this proposal is another part of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100100004#C00500","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412171400,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I will bring in our three guests to get their reaction to those comments before I call the three speakers who have indicated they wish to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100100005#D00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412171400,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I will try to address some of the issues raised.  On the costs involved, there would probably be a higher up-front cost because much of this could be done automatically by people who could register themselves online and that would mean that somebody in the Department would not have to do that work.  It could be easily done through the use of various types of software.<\/p><p>  Both Deputies raised the issue of engaging with people who are on the more vulnerable side.  This is the reason we specifically mentioned that Irish NGOs abroad need to be engaged in the process as well and we need to get the involvement of the people working there and to ensure that they would be aware of it to some degree.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Smith mentioned getting a college to do some of the initial work and we would not be averse to that idea.  It is very important that the message that goes out from the register is from the State and that it is a direct message from the State.  That is what people find is missing and what they are still feeling a little bit burned about, which is a point Deputy Crowe mentioned.  This register will not solve people's dissatisfaction with their situation but it is the start of a long-term process in making the relationship a better one.  <\/p><p>  On the habitual residence condition, we lobbied and pushed for change on that issue, probably in this committee room, several years ago and things have improved since then.  Now there is specific mention of returning emigrants in the habitual residence guidelines.  If an emigrant is clearly returning home, he or she should not be refused based on the habitual residence condition.  We still deal with cases like that and if the members come across cases like that where there is a difficulty they should feel free to contact us and we can advise them on what generally works and what does not.<\/p><p>  The connection with this register with respect to the possible extension of voting rights to emigrants was raised.  We would be at pains to separate the two to some extent because we are aware that while there are moves to extend voting rights to emigrants, it is progressing slowly, but we believe this register could be put in place and up and running within a few months if there was the will to do it.  It could be used to inform people of developments and get their input on how extending voting rights to emigrants should be developed and, as an information tool, it could and should be used in that respect.

We expect they would be involved and would play a large role in promoting this proposal.  We work closely with those emigrants who return home and we understand the issues they have.  The register would be designed for everyone but a much broader group of people who have emigrated more recently may not be connecting in with Irish groups to the same extent.

There is huge potential for linking in with many issues to promote any type of matter, be it news, voting rights or whatever, as a starting point and in that respect to meet people through the jobs medium would be very useful.

In a previous incarnation I interacted with emigrant groups when I visited them in Boston, New York, London, Manchester, Birmingham and all the other places.  I discovered at the time that there are two types of emigrants.  The first group comprises those who have been forced to emigrate where they had no option but to do so in dramatic circumstances, often very dramatic for those who emigrated and for their parents and friends who they left at home.  There second group comprises those who are better educated, who voluntarily emigrated and those for whom new opportunities have opened up.   They are better at using electronic media for communicating, on a daily basis if necessary.<\/p><p>  In canvassing recently in the Roscommon by-election I spoke to the mother of someone who had recently emigrated.  She told me she could not use Skype because she found the experience traumatic.  I found that interesting.<\/p><p>  The register is a good idea and it should be put in place as a means of communication, recognition and to facilitate developing a sense of togetherness and being part of the Irish State.  At the same time we must plan ahead.  With the ups and downs in our economy during the past 50 years, this country should have enough experience to be able to do that.  We must learn from that experience and ensure that we expand economically in such a way that will allow us plan for a time when the areas of the country more seriously affected by emigration are focused on in a meaningful way that will ensure investment takes place to stop that emigration.  It is ironic that Irish emigrants end up in far-flung regions of the world in areas where, if they were at home, they might object to the technology all around them.  It should not be that way, and it is sad.<\/p><p>  To adequately plan for the future we need an economic plan different from any plan we have proposed previously to identify those sensitive areas and provide the necessary infrastructure to encourage investment.<\/p> <p>The day when we could encourage investment in a green field, with nothing added on to it, has gone.  Investors now look for major infrastructure like water, energy, telecommunications and sanitary services, all of which are absolutely necessary.  Local and international investors will go to sites where those infrastructural investments have already taken place.  That is something we can do.  We can relate it to the work of the witnesses with regard to the register by looking at the areas where people with various capacities and qualifications are coming from and at how they have fared in their new countries.  When I visited them, I found that some of them have integrated in their adopted country to a huge extent but others have not.  Some of those who emigrated in the 1950s are harking back to the old days as if nothing had ever changed.  Unfortunately, everything changes.  As we know, everything moves on.  It is sad and harsh, but that is the way it is.<\/p><p> In a previous incarnation, I supported the valuable work of the witnesses in acknowledging and interacting with our emigrants.  Supports are particularly essential for those who have been forced to emigrate.  They need a shoulder to lean on.  Perhaps they need a shoulder to cry on sometimes.  It is important that there is something there for them.  The witnesses are right to separate these issues from the campaign for voting rights, etc.  This is something that can be done regardless of anything else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100100005#D00900","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412172000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I would like to give a slightly upbeat contribution on the merits of emigrating for a set period of time.  I recently attended a celebration in the RDS that was organised by the United States Embassy.  I gather the Chairman was there too.  If my memory is right, we were celebrating the fact that J1 visas have been taken up by 150,000 students over the years.  The figure may have been 250,000.  I am open to correction.  It was one of those two figures.  The consensus view is that it is an outstanding scheme.  Young kids love to move away from this country for various reasons.<\/p><p>  I suppose I can speak personally because I married an immigrant into Ireland.  She was not an economic immigrant.  I left Ireland - I never saw myself as emigrating - to travel extensively in Africa.  I lived in Africa for four years.  Neither I nor my travelling companions ever thought of ourselves as emigrating.  I have two daughters, one who lives in New York while the other lives in London.  I would like to put it on the record that the days of the Liverpool bar on the docks, and the Munster ship with all the cattle and building workers travelling to Holyhead or Liverpool, are dead.  They are not the people we are talking about today.  My uncles were all construction workers - plasterers, builders and plumbers.  They went as the construction industry was in peak and boom.  They stayed in digs and had their food served up to them.  That is so old-fashioned now that I do not fully understand how it worked.<\/p><p>  I applaud the work the witnesses have produced.  I read the report and the recommendations with fascination and interest.  The statistics that have been produced are mind-boggling.  If I understand it correctly, it appears that 47%, or almost half, of those who are emigrating have full-time employment in this country.  I do not know whether the word \"emigrating\" should be applied to these highly qualified men and women, who have been to third level education.  We should consider that cohort of people in the context of the development of the world today.  There are 28 countries in the EU.  We have a common currency.  We are Europeans.  We are not just Irish anymore.  We live in a global world.  There is a contrast between the period of mass emigration of construction and agriculture workers to England, where they built the roads and railways, etc., and the current era.  When we are talking about those who leave now, we are really not talking about the same people.  The witnesses mentioned some huge technological advances.  My first grandchild was born in America.  I speak to my daughter on Skype regularly.  We are always clicking and talking on our mobile telephones.  It is as if they were across the road.  It should be borne in mind when we are talking about emigration to England that it is an hour away.  It would nearly take one the same amount of time to travel up to Donegal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100100006#E00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1412172000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100100006#E00300","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1412172000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>We need to put it in that context.

There is a contrast between the global world of today and the world that people were living in when they were emigrating many years ago.  When I was growing up, Ireland was a white, Roman Catholic country.  It was essentially run by the bishops, who always used to throw in the ball at GAA matches.  Certain powerful organisations were running the political establishment.  That was the society in which I grew up.

It has brought about a marvellous cultural diversity.  This Government has given citizenship to between 30,000 and 60,000 members of new communities from 120 countries.  We are a phenomenal country.  These people are moving.  The amount of movement in the world today is phenomenal.  Many of those who are staying here are happy to become Irish citizens and work here.  Everything has changed, and I applaud this because it highlights effectively some of my views about emigration.  When the American Embassy recently held an event at the RDS to celebrate the issuing of 150,000 J1 visas, which is a fantastic figure, it made me think.  Who would not want to go?  Would any person who has the ability to do so not want to leave, spread their wings, grow, learn and travel?<br\/>Of course there is a role for support agencies like the Crosscare Migrant Project.  Not everyone will be a happy returnee like I was.  I have some pointed questions in that context.  I am worried about certain aspects of the campaign.  The witnesses might provide an explanation with regard to Canadian visas that are restricted to two or two and a half years.  I do not know whether they have them in Australia too.  The report tells us that just 10% of people intend to obey the laws of these countries by returning after the cessation of their visas.  The same approach left us with 50,000 or 60,000 illegals in America.  I do not think the people in the American or Australian embassies would like to hear that just 10% of people will return when their visas expire.  It is there in the report.<br\/>The witnesses mentioned that 69% of people would like emigrants to have the right to vote.  They will be aware that we are undertaking an in-depth examination of the diaspora question.  We now have a Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora.  This complicated issue has been debated at this forum and at the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  It is hard to decide who should be given the right to vote.  Nevertheless, I welcome the reference to this issue in the report.<br\/>I wish our education system could recognise that we are Europeans as much as we are Irish and therefore teach European languages.  Even though kids might feel isolation in far-flung locations like Australia, or parts of America like New York, they go there because English is spoken.  If we could change the education system, they might be able to work out of Germany, Belgium and Spain.  Anyone who travels regularly will know it is nearly impossible to get a seat on an aircraft.  The Chairman does a great deal of travelling, so he will have seen for himself the huge movement of people from Ireland to Europe and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  It could be said that those who are based here but working in Europe are bilocating.<br\/>I support the register.  I am not joking or playing cheap politics.

I compliment them on the significant report they have provided to us.<\/p> <p>I agree with much of what my colleague, Deputy Eric Byrne, said in regard to the changing nature of emigration.  A figure I plucked out of the report was that emigrants gave an average rating of 5.5 out of ten for their quality of life while at home but that figure increased to 7.9 out of ten when they moved abroad, which is quite significant.  <\/p><p> Deputy Bernard Durkan made some very significant points on how we should organise our efforts in regard to job creation and investment in order to ensure we reduce the significant emigration numbers.  We talked about the 250,000 people who left in recent years and the impact that has had on our towns and villages.  Irrespective of whether people are doing exceptionally well or are not doing so well, we should have a connection with them.  That is why I strongly support the idea of the emigrant register.  We now have a Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora.  Knowing him, he is a man who will see the bigger picture in this regard and I certainly hope the witnesses make significant progress in their discussion with him on this.<\/p><p> It is true technology has made it much easier for us all to remain connected but the State should have a connection with people.  Many families say they speak more frequently to family members who are now abroad than they did when those same family members were at home.  I would have to concur with that.  I have a number of nieces and nephews and I tend to make more contact with those who are out of the country than with the ones who are still at home.  <\/p><p> It is appropriate that as more job opportunities become available at home, our emigrants should be aware of those possibilities and opportunities.  We have skills shortages and it certainly would be an opportunity to highlight some of the hi-tech opportunities at home.  Now that the construction sector is beginning to recover, I hope many people who have skills and who are dispersed throughout the world will find opportunities at home over the next number of years.  <\/p><p> I hope the organisations working with people who might not be users of technology or who might be in more disadvantaged situations will take responsibility for registering them, or will help them to register, so that we are aware of them.  It is important that people who might like to return home in their later years know about the availability and cost of housing at home and that they are kept informed.  if people were thinking of moving back now, there is real value to be had in parts of the country.  If we had a national register which provided that kind of information to people and kept people up-to-date on news from at home in the jobs area, it would be very useful.  <\/p><p> The concept is good and would be made easier now that technology is much more advanced.  I do not think it would require a large budget to achieve what the witnesses spoke about.  I look forward to supporting the concept in my future discussions with the Minister of State.

In the mental health survey we are conducting at the moment, many people abroad are suffering in a very personal way.  It is heartbreaking to read some of the accounts people give about the difficulties of being away.  One does not necessarily have to have visa issues not to be able to return home.  People have repeatedly cited not being able to attend family events - births of children, marriages and funerals - and visits to people who are sick.   It is very hard for people to deal with this.  Certainly, social media can take the edge off sometimes but the majority of people who left over the past five years did not want to go and they might dispute some of the points made in terms of the positive aspects for them.<\/p><p>   I thank and acknowledge the members' support for us.

As requested, I have made a written submission in advance.  I apologise for not being in a position to attend the committee's meeting on 25 June, as it clashed with the IBF main council meeting and I was unable to reschedule with that notice.  I am pleased to be in attendance today to answer whatever questions the committee may wish to ask.<\/p><p>  The BPFI is a new organisation created following the merger of the IBF and the Irish Payment Services Organisation, IPSO, in September 2014.  It is a membership organisation representing more than 70 members in the banking and payments industry.  I will open by definitively stating that member banks are fully committed to the introduction of e-conveyancing.  My members will make the necessary investment in internal bank systems, work flows and staffing to enable lenders to participate fully in e-conveyancing.  I want to be unequivocal about their preparedness, willingness and desire to be involved.<\/p><p>  Until recently, a key sticking point was the issue of mandated use by all parties.  Banks are keen for there to be a mandatory transition date to the new e-conveyancing system and for the paper-based system to be phased out.  It is not feasible to introduce e-conveyancing while retaining the old paper-based system with both running in tandem.  When e-conveyancing goes live at a given date following a transition period, there should be mandatory participation in the process by everyone.  The committee may wish to consider whether there is any potential benefit in legislation for the mandatory use of e-conveyancing by all parties.<\/p><p>  A number of issues can be addressed bilaterally by my organisation and the Law Society of Ireland under a recently agreed memorandum of understanding.  These include the holding of funds and the security of same, service levels and the integrity and resilience of the ICT systems that underpin e-conveyancing.<\/p> <p>With the Law Society, we can progress these matters.<\/p><p> We note that the Government has included e-conveyancing in its Construction 2020 strategy.  It is my understanding that the Government has tasked the Department of Justice and Equality with reviewing and reporting on the steps required to deliver a system of e-conveyancing, including the resource implications and the timelines for delivery.  The BPFI will engage proactively in support of this action.  In parallel, we will work with the Law Society of Ireland to ensure that processes and operational issues from a lender's perspective are addressed in a timely manner.<\/p><p> As outlined in my submission, the introduction of e-conveyancing is timely and will deliver better services to the public, enhance security and reduce risk and deficiencies for all stakeholders, both public and private.  BPFI members are committed to participating and will engage proactively with all stakeholders and parties.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for affording me the opportunity to attend this meeting and I am happy to answer whatever questions it wishes to put to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014100100003#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Brett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412169000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brett.

I do so as the chief executive-designate of Tailte &Eacute;ireann, the new organisation to be established through the merger of the Property Registration Authority, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Valuation Office.  I am accompanied by Mr. Frank Treacy, Mr. Greg McDermott and Mr. Peter McHugh of the Property Registration Authority.  We look forward to assisting the committee in its consideration of the subject.<\/p><p>  As I outlined in June, it is envisaged that Tailte &Eacute;ireann will, when established, be responsible for providing the authoritative national property registration system, national mapping and surveying infrastructure and State property valuation service.  In that capacity, it will be the primary source of property information and location-based data in the State and will assume a lead role in the development and delivery of land information services.<\/p><p>  One of the roles envisaged for Tailte is in developing and leading the implementation of a national spatial data infrastructure, NSDI.  This will result in Tailte co-ordinating the use of such information across government and establishing and managing the standards behind such information.  The NSDI will thus facilitate better use of location-based information to support evidence-based decision making across the relevant government sectors.  Accordingly, the development and implementation of an NSDI by Tailte &Eacute;ireann is potentially a significant and welcome development for e-conveyancing.<\/p><p>  I note the commitment to e-conveyancing in the Government's Construction 2020 report, which concluded that \"a system of eConveyancing which harnesses modern technology to assist in the timely transfer of property ownership would provide a more modern, efficient, cost effective and secure system to support transactions in the property market in the future\".  However, Construction 2020 also acknowledges that \"moving to a full eConveyancing system will require a number of further elements over and above existing and planned developments to be put in place\".  It identifies, in particular, the need to provide for the secure transmission of communications, the management and disbursement of funds between parties and the creation and management of digital signatures.<\/p><p>  Measure No. 73 in the Construction 2020 report deals specifically with e-conveyancing.  It states: \"In collaboration with key stakeholders (the legal profession and the banking sector) the Strategy will review and report on the steps required to deliver a system of eConveyancing in Ireland, including the resource implications and timeframes for delivery.\"  I am advised by the Department of Justice and Equality that, in order to advance this matter, it intends to convene a working group to conduct the proposed review of e-conveyancing and to report to the Government thereafter.  It is anticipated that the working group will be convened during the final quarter of 2014.<\/p><p>  Developments towards e-conveyancing are well aligned with the mission and vision that have been articulated for Tailte &Eacute;ireann and the new organisation will be keen to play a central role in the project.  In my submission, I included some briefing material in appendices for the attention of committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014100100004#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1412169000,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014100100004#K00400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412169000,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I did not understand that the Chairman was seeking an opening statement from us a few minutes ago.

I think I said that to the committee.  I am glad to say that in the interval between the last meeting and today there has been engagement between the Law Society and the banks at the highest level about this project and we are delighted to hear Mr. Brett&rsquo;s comments today to the effect that the banks are fully committed to the project.

In answer to the second question to deal with the citizens who would not perhaps have access to technology, nothing in the proposed system would require that citizens as such would have that access.  The software and computers involved would be in the solicitor's office.  There would certainly be a point at which the citizen would be required to interface that system in terms of signing a document and that falls into the space of a digital signature which, I understand, is a separate Government process which will have to be tackled as such.  However, there should not be any reason for a citizen who, for one reason or another, does not have the facility to access technology not to be able to participate fully in this system.<\/p><p>  On security, on the last occasion I was taken by a phrase of Senator Bacik who identified that what we are proposing is a change in process rather than substance.  Effectively, we will do the same as we do today, but electronically.  The back end of this, from the citizens' point of view, is knowing that their ownership is registered safe and secure, and from the lenders' point of view, that their mortgage is registered safe and secure.  Nothing in this system will alter the current position which is that we will eventually get to the point where the PRA element of Tailte will do what it already does, which is safeguarding the State guarantee on property title.  We will merely feed up to the front door of Tailte but, after that, it will be its responsibility, as it is currently.  There is nothing in this that will create a potential for citizens to be compromised by our system.  Our system will merely bring them to the door of the Land Registry and after that, Mr. O'Sullivan's organisation will take over, as it currently does very well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014100100006#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Dorgan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412169600,"counter":167,"content":"<p>From a lender's point of view, there are typically four points of contact, namely, at the point of mortgage approval, approval of the contract for sale and title, the release of funds in closing and the registration of the charge.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

This is a valuable and timely initiative and I welcome the opportunity to contribute to it.<\/p><p>  The Ombudsman is ultimately the top point of the complaints system.  It is the point that a complainant reaches before going to the courts.  The service that we provide is free and independent.  It is not an advocacy service; it provides a balanced review of complaints.  Where a complaint is judged to be justified and where there has been a failing by a public service provider, we seek to put the individual concerned back into the position he or she would have occupied if the injustice had not occurred, or achieve some other form of justice where the situation has gone beyond that kind of redress.<\/p><p>  The defining point of the Ombudsman as a scheme for providing administrative justice is that the Ombudsman will not only seek to put things right for the individual, but also aggregate complaints, whether by looking at a series of complaints on the same topic or by finding systemic causes in individual complaints, in order to use the information drawn from complaints to improve public services.  There is, therefore, a unique balance between putting things right for individuals and addressing any difficulties in public services that may lead to complaints.  The Ombudsman's casebook, which I have discussed previously with the committee, issued for the first time this week.  It is available on our website and it is the first of a quarterly series of reports.  There has always been some focus on learning from the bigger cases and in the annual reports but otherwise they have been confined to the body and the person who made the complaint.  The casebook makes the learning more widely available and we hope it will play an important contribution to improving public services in Ireland.<\/p><p>  I have examined some of the issues arising in respect of the legislation in Ireland.  The legislation was amended as recently as 2012 and in many respects it represents good international practice.  As I do not wish to be too negative in this regard, I will focus on ways in which the legislation might be enhanced or extended.  The committee has asked me to address the issue of recommendations.  From my perspective, the democratic process is the correct way of dealing with Ombudsman recommendations in the public domain but the implied suggestion in the committee's questions about whether the current arrangements are sufficient deserves debate.  For example, it was suggested that a certain level of majority might be needed in deciding whether recommendations should be implemented.<\/p><p>  I have also examined other issues raised.  Independence is important.  It is also important that people can believe that their complaints will be adjudicated by an organisation that is independent of the body about which they are complaining.  If they have not been able to get satisfaction, they need to be confident that the body to which they are complaining is not simply going to take the same line as the body to which the complaint pertains.  It is also important that the bodies in respect of which complaints are made can believe that the office is independent and objective in its consideration.<\/p><p>  My predecessors have spoken about the need to provide a constitutional status for the office.  I believe that is important.  The appointment of the Ombudsman by the President on the recommendation of the Oireachtas following a vote is a good way of securing independence but constitutional status would give the office a better standing than underpinning it by statute.  However, real independence requires more than a legal status; it requires that the office has the resources needed to do its job.  We all know what happened in the past when one of my predecessors, Mr. Michael Mills, was deemed by the Government to be too critical and an attempt was made to cripple the office by cutting its funding sharply.  Although ultimately that was undone, given the importance of having sufficient resources to do the job properly, this should be a matter for the Oireachtas rather than the Government of the day because the decisions of the Government of the day are often within the jurisdiction of the office and while, as members will see from the casebook, as often as not we do not uphold cases, on occasions there will inevitably be tension.  It is the Ombudsman's job to hold public service providers to account and this will generate tension on occasions.  It is important, therefore, to separate the funding and accountability mechanisms.  I have emphasised how much I value reporting to this committee.  We saw the relevance of this in recent times, both with the annual report and the report, A Good Death, in respect of which the committee was able to take on board recommendations from the office and provide a route to the Oireachtas rather than just to the Government.<\/p><p>  The committee will be aware of my concerns about the changing way in which public services are delivered and the fact that over time certain public services have gone out of the remit of the office.  Interestingly, I need to update the committee on my written report because a voluntary agreement has been reached between the energy regulator and Irish Water which, curiously, went live on its website just before I arrived here.  I am pleased to see that I continue to have some impact on pronouncements.  As members will know, however, I do not believe a voluntary arrangement is the way to provide statutory access to redress.  I do not doubt that Irish Water will face many complaints and I think it was wholly wrong to take water services out of the jurisdiction of my office at the point when complaints were going to be made about Irish Water and when there should have been access to independent redress.  Other aspects of our public service, which we have discussed previously, are also out of redress.  I mention two in particular, prisons and direct provision.  These are areas which give rise to considerable public concern and many vulnerable individuals are caught up in those systems.  Access to independent redress is required.  These are oversights in our jurisdiction which I would like to be addressed.<\/p><p>  I also have a personal concern about the fact that clinical judgments are not in my jurisdiction.  People complaining about the health service believe they should not have to make two separate complaints about the same issues.<\/p> <p>The professional bodies are not the correct ones to consider complaints about health services.  They properly have a high threshold for dealing with complaints, as they consider whether someone is fit to practice.  What I handle are complaints from people about the treatment they or their family members have received.  They want joined-up answers.  This should also be within the jurisdiction of the HSE, as it is not just the case that my office cannot provide independent redress.  The HSE cannot consider complaints about clinical judgment either.  This lacuna needs to be addressed.  These are the issues concerning clinical judgment and jurisdiction and I have discussed the issues of accountability to the Oireachtas and funding.<\/p><p> I have a couple of issues with where services are privately provided.  Democratic accountability in that respect does not work in the same way, as the providers are outside the direct control of the Oireachtas and Government.  It would be better if bodies in receipt of substantial State funding, for example, nursing homes, came under the State's jurisdiction, which I hope will happen soon because the legislative provision exists to enable such, because I would then be able to make binding recommendations in those instances.  It presents a difficulty that such bodies are not accountable to the Oireachtas like the HSE or a contracted service provider is.  I would like to see a change in that respect.<\/p><p> I have encountered a difficulty that I have not seen in other jurisdictions, namely, the bodies in my jurisdiction must get permission to comply with my recommendations.  The Ombudsman legislation should give them the explicit ability to comply without needing to ask for permission.<\/p><p> In the course of my work, I have been unable to gain access to the materials I need to see.  The 2012 amendment Act provided a way forward in this regard, but it could be improved upon by making it absolutely clear that bodies are required to comply with my request for access to information.  In no way would the information be put into the public domain.  I am referring to situations in which, for example, a body states its legal advice asserts the body is right and I am wrong, but when I ask to see that advice, I am told that I cannot because it is covered by legal privilege.  This type of situation is not conducive to the delivery of effective public services and redress.<\/p><p> I have discussed with the committee issues like having a standard approach to making complaints.  At the heart of all this are the questions of how to ensure people using our public services have unhindered access to independent redress when something goes wrong and how to ensure our public services are improving and learning from their mistakes.  The kind of changes I am seeking are designed to do this, namely, to give people an opportunity to have matters put right when they go wrong and to ensure our public services are learning from the mistakes identified following complaints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014100100003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412176200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I went through the casebook last night.

It relates to the standard approach to making complaints.  From time to time, we as Oireachtas Members work with constituents who have had their applications to Departments rejected.  Those rejections might refer to an appeals process, but they do not mention the option to apply to the Ombudsman.  Mr. Tyndall has raised this issue with the committee several times.  Is he in negotiations?  He indicated that he had circulated recommendations on how to address this matter.  Has there been a change?  I have not seen a dramatic one, nor an inclination in any public body to give people the right to take their cases to the Ombudsman following refusals.  The situation is changing, but people often do not realise that this is an option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014100100004#C00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412176200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>This matter concerns me and is one of the issues that prompted the health complaints so-called own initiative inquiry that is under way and due to report early in the new year.

There are other reasons.  For example, people can be worn down by the lengthy and convoluted complaints processes they must go through.  With a standardised approach to complaints handling, one can make it a requirement to include a standard phrase in all correspondence concerning complaints.  It is a matter of concern and I will examine it.  Whenever we receive a complaint where the individual has not been notified of his or her entitlement to apply to the Ombudsman, we raise it with the body concerned.  With so many different bodies dealing with public service complaints and so many different approaches to complaints, it is inevitable that, unless some element of standardisation is introduced, we will not get the notification as smoothly and comprehensively as we should.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014100100004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412176200,"counter":191,"content":"<p>To add to what the Ombudsman has stated, our 2012 legislation introduced a new feature requiring public bodies to signpost our office.

In general, because an ombudsman is the final court of appeal, so to speak, for the administrative complaints process, one would expect a significant number of complaints not to be upheld.<\/p> <p>In general, our figures in Ireland have been broadly similar to those for public service ombudsmen elsewhere when we have benchmarked against them.  We tend to have higher uphold rates with private ombudsmen schemes because many commercial bodies will take a view that it is cheaper to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; and hope a proportion of complainants do not go to the ombudsman.  Our uphold rate is on a par with most of the other public service ombudsmen with which we have compared our figures.<\/p><p> The reason not to uphold is often the constraints of particular legislation.  If a Senator or Deputy takes a view that something is unjust but the way to change it would be to change the legislation, I would comment if I think the legislation is producing unjust outcomes and make it known to the relevant Department.  On other occasions, changes are made at short notice, for example, changes to legislation governing agricultural compensation schemes.  In such a case, when the Department implements the changes, while many farmers may feel they have been unjustly treated, it may be the effect of the legislation rather than anything administrative that happened.<\/p><p> In the past, I have advertised as an Ombudsman on the backs of buses.  It can be done and nothing prevents advertising.  I have taken the view that the most effective way of getting the message across is to take the opportunities presented by reports and we find, for instance, that when a report is published, as with A Good Death, and there is publicity about the Office of the Ombudsman, which we take advantage of, we see an increase in the number of complaints.  With no particular trends, there has been a substantial increase in the number of complaints in the current year.  There was considerable publicity associated with the annual report and A Good Death, which has helped get the message across to the public that they can complain.  Senator and Deputies are also active in encouraging people to complain when they receive requests from constituents, and this is helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014100100004#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412176800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>My last query was whether Mr. Tyndall was asking for an ombudsman for the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014100100005#D00200","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412176800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I was not, and I should be very clear on it.  When the HSE investigates complaints, there should be a two-stage complaint process.  If the nurse or doctor who receives a complaint is unable to resolve it on the spot, there should be a single investigation conducted within the health service, or wherever else it is in the public service.  If this does not resolve the matter, it should come to my office.  Given that the HSE or hospital investigating a complaint cannot examine matters of clinical judgment, there is a gap in the legislation which does not exist elsewhere.  The problems that it is postulated would arise should that jurisdiction change do not arise elsewhere; it does not cause the problems it is said to cause.  We can examine, say, issues about nurses failing to implement a programme of medication, but the decision to put the programme in place might be a clinical judgment.  This is not the kind of complaint that should go to a professional body but should be dealt with by the hospital concerned and the Ombudsman.

I am trying to sort out Mr. Tyndall&rsquo;s statement on the need for the expansion of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s function to adjudicate on clinical judgments and how it would work.  If he were to examine the clinical judgment exercised by a doctor in a given case, would he have access to some sort of medical expertise or would his judgment be based purely on what the doctor has to say?

It seems to be suspended.  I presume it is out of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s hands, he has done his part and it is for the Minister.

All the other ombudsmen on these islands who deal with health matters are able to examine matters of clinical judgment.  They do so through the use of a panel of medical experts who are leading experts in their fields.  There is a standing panel and in the case of a very specialist area, somebody is sought to give a judgment.  I have access to this panel and use it from time to time in the course of the work here, although to a lesser extent than colleagues elsewhere would.  Alongside this, each office would have more generalist practitioners coming in from time to time, for example, a practising GP or clinical nursing specialist who would come to the office once a month to examine particular complaints.  The panel includes people such as leading oncologists and cardiac surgeons who would be available to examine particular cases and more generalist people to advise on how best to handle a complaint, for example, which specialist advice one needs to seek.<\/p> <p>In my previous job, complaints about health care were principally about care and treatment in hospitals but here many of them are about funding issues and they have comprised the largest single proportion of complaints.  I do not believe that health care here is so much better than elsewhere as to account for the lower level of complaints.  I think it has to do with issues around how the health complaints system works and issues around the lack of capability to get individual redress on issues around clinical judgment.  There is a nervousness because of the very litigious nature of some of these issues.  There is a nervousness about moving forward.  Many people want an explanation and want to know if something went wrong and, if so, why.  They are not necessarily looking for financial compensation.  They are very concerned about what has happened to themselves or their loved ones.  The issues around health care are very close, very emotive for individuals and very significant in their life events.  It seems to me that is a gap.  There is nothing there at the moment and there should be something short of going to court.  Independent redress needs to be available.  That is why it is significant.  It has not proved difficult to implement in other jurisdictions.  There must be a mechanism around it and we should not have to invent something from scratch.

I am conscious that, for example, there is a federal correction ombudsman in Canada and ombudsman offices across central and eastern Europe have prisons and immigration issues within their jurisdiction.  We are out of step on those areas.  There probably was a fear at the time that an ombudsman might try to put himself or herself into the position of acting as an appeal body, but that is not the role of an ombudsman; it is to look at complaints.  Legitimate complaints do arise.  If decisions are not taken properly, we can comment on that, but it would not be the job of an ombudsman to substitute a decision.  If someone is charged with making a decision on whether someone is entitled to Irish citizenship, it is not for an ombudsman to second-guess that person, but if someone, for instance, was facing extensive delays in the process or if there were administrative failings in the way decisions were reached, those people should properly have recourse to an ombudsman, as they would in any other field.  I hope those are things on which we will see a positive response from Government.  In response to the committee&rsquo;s questions, I have put forward some of the areas where I think there is scope for development.  I hope the Government will also share the view that there is scope for development and we will see proposals coming forward to address some of the deficiencies.<\/p><p>  In a sense I believe the position with Irish Water was an oversight in that there was not a conscious plan to change the arrangements for making complaints about the organisation.  There was no plan.  The reason we saw the changes made on the websites today to say one cannot complain to the energy regulator is an attempt to put in place administratively something that should have been included in the legislation.  The office was not consulted about the decision to take water related complaints away from us.  When water services were provided by local authorities, if somebody wanted to complain about the water service and he or she did not get a satisfactory response, he or she could have gone to the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office.  One day a person could complain to the Ombudsman and the next day he or she could not.  I do not think anyone set out to do that but when it did happen, people thought the arrangements could be made the same way as for electricity and gas, which is that one can complain to the regulator.  I strongly believe that the role of regulators is to regulate, that they have a particular relationship with the bodies they regulate, which includes such issues as price setting and looking at competition.  That means there is some conflict in terms of individual redress.<\/p><p>  Typically, in other jurisdictions there is either a specialist ombudsman to deal with the specific areas or one can complain to the public services ombudsman about them.  There is an opportunity with the alternative dispute resolution, ADR, directive in Ireland to make redress for people using services, both public and private.  At a seminar yesterday, a leading academic in the field, Christopher Hodges, from Oxford University made it very clear that he thought Ireland should respond to the directive by having a public service ombudsman to deal with public services and a consumer ombudsman to deal with matters other than public services.  We have the opportunity to do that.  We can introduce it over time.  It would cost nothing to the State to introduce a consumer ombudsman because, typically, it would be paid for by a levy on the industry.  Making sure that I could cover public services that have been privatised would work in the same way in the sense that it could be dealt with by levy or charge per case, but it need not necessarily be a cost to the State or to the consumer because it would be free to the consumer.  The Ombudsman service does not charge for dealing with complaints.<\/p><p>  We have an opportunity to address the issues.  The Government sent the matter out for consultation and we have responded in that vein.  I hope we grasp the nettle.  It could be done over time; it does not all have to be done overnight.  One could set up a consumer ombudsman and gradually bring bodies into its jurisdiction.  To give an example that was given yesterday, in Germany it was decided to bring complaints about airlines together in a statutory system and an airline ombudsman was created.  Rather surprisingly, at the front of the queue to sign up was Ryanair.  What the airlines have found is that customers who get an explanation, even if their complaint is not upheld, are five times more likely to use the same airline again, and that they are saving money on litigation because complaints are being dealt with in a much more efficient and cheaper fashion.  The European Union has said that if one introduces consumer ombudsman services, there are considerable savings to be made by reducing the amount of litigation and the time that companies spend dealing with dissatisfied customers.  The situation presents opportunities.  For my office, the sensible thing would be to put complaints on Irish Water back into the Ombudsman system and to bring in the other utilities in order that if people want to complain about a public service, they would just go to the Ombudsman.  Such a system would be straightforward.  I have put the case to Government and I hope it will respond positively.  The opportunity is there for it to do so.<\/p><p>  I think Irish Water is subject to the data protection regime so there is an avenue for people to complain about how their data are held.  That system is in place and I hope it will provide the protection people need.  In terms of getting information, my comment was more about the fact that it is not about problems that have occurred but that as private bodies come into my jurisdiction through the major funding route, I believe there will not be the same pressure on them to comply and, therefore, as with, for instance, the Financial Services Ombudsman in dealing with the banks, it has binding powers.  That is the precedent that should be adopted in this instance.<\/p> <p> The powers to obtain information could be clearer in the legislation.  The 2012 Act sought to give me access to the Circuit Court.  There are simpler ways of dealing with it, namely, to simply require bodies to provide information when I request it and for legal privilege not to apply so it would be possible for me to see advice that people have received.  That is not the same thing as me releasing that information into the public domain because quite often in the course of investigations, I see a lot of very confidential information, for instance on health records, but would never release that into the public domain.  So I think there is confusion about allowing access and the belief that allowing access would be the same as publishing which, of course it is not.  I quite often have to respect the confidentiality of, for example, records on adoption or child care that I would see.  I do not suggest any change to that, just that I should have access to records.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014100100007#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412178600,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tyndall for his response.

We will have a number of hearings on that issue about extending the remit of the Ombudsman and I hope they will have it sooner rather than later.  It is something we have been pushing for quite a while here.  The prisons and the other sectors Mr. Tyndall mentioned should be looked at after that.<\/p><p>  I have a question in regard to Irish Water, prisons and direct provision.  Obviously the Office of the Ombudsman keeps a log of all the complaints it gets.  However, does it keep a log of the ones it must turn down because they do not come under its jurisdiction and do particular themes occur there?  For example, are there X number of complaints about direct provision where the Office of the Ombudsman has had to write back to people stating, \"We note your complaint, but we cannot deal with it because it does not come under our remit.\"  Is there any indication as to how many were received, etc.?  The same would apply to Irish Water and the prison system.  If that information was available, it might be useful.<\/p><p>  The issue of clinical judgment was highlighted on a recent \"Prime Time\" special programme.  I am subject to correction on this.  It was about a young child, Ava Conroy, from Connemara.  I think it related to the Medical Council.  It was the timing of an issue and the way it was being dealt with prior to a court case being heard.  That highlighted the issue of clinical judgment Mr. Tyndall mentioned.<\/p> <p>The question also arises of these professional organisations adjudicating on themselves.  I have heard of cases involving the Law Society adjudicating on its own members and complaints about the way matters were handled.  That is another area in which an Ombudsman might play a role.  In respect of the Medical Council it was felt, rightly or wrongly, that medical professionals were adjudicating on themselves and closing ranks when they did not want cases to proceed.  That was highlighted in the \"Prime Time\" programme.<\/p><p> In respect of private institutions, Mr. Tyndall referred to nursing homes in particular.  Is there any access to his office for people who want to complain about a nursing home?  A number of cases have arisen involving difficulties with private nursing homes.  HIQA plays a clinical role in this regard but does any of the ombudsman offices have remit over complaints brought by individuals or citizens?<\/p><p> Mr. Tyndall suggested that permission to comply be sought.  In his view, how exactly should that change?

I have referred people to the outreach service when it came to Galway and they have enjoyed good engagement with the office.  Does he have any thought on how outreach could be further developed?  In regard to this committee and the fact that we hear petitions, does he see any crossover between our respective roles and is there anything we need to clarify in the way we do our work so that there is no grey area in what we are trying to do and that the individuals seeking redress are put first?  I do not want them to be required to go to the Ombudsman and then to this committee, or sent from Billy to Jack, which is what people fear might happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014100100008#G00900","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412179200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Ms McNally will respond to the questions on signposting complaints which we cannot handle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014100100009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412179200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Traditionally over the years we have monitored people who have come to us and to whom we were unable to provide a service.

Most complaints about professionals such as doctors, solicitors and nurses do not speak to their ability to continue to practice.  The sanctions available to the professional bodies are the nuclear option.  Somebody could be suspended or struck off.  That needs to exist because occasionally somebody will be a danger to others or a solicitor may use clients' resources inappropriately.  It is necessary to have a body which can determine whether an individual continues to be fit to practise and, if he or she does something badly wrong, investigates that.  However, that is the wrong option for most complaints.  An ombudsman is the better place to bring most complaints about doctors, nurses or solicitors going about their work.<\/p><p>  In recent years, reforms have been made to professional bodies to ensure that the majority of people on boards are independent.  This is a useful safeguard.  Changes were contemplated to the way in which the legal profession was to be regulated but they have not been implemented.  In regard to whether we could establish a legal ombudsman, such roles exist elsewhere or some other means could be provided to allow people to get redress.  People want redress that falls short of a professional standards issue.  It might simply be a complaint about a solicitor who made a mistake which cost the client money or deprived him or her of an advantage.  An ombudsman is well placed to deal with those matters outside of the courts and to get a resolution or explanation for people.  That is a possible route forward.
