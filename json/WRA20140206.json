I am advised by the military authorities that there are 18 Doctors currently serving with the Defence Forces.  Against this backdrop, during 2013, a total of 42 medical practices, including those of 9 retired military medical officers, provided general practitioner medical services, as required, for military personnel on a contract for services basis.

While a competition for the appointment of doctors to the Defence Forces Medical Corps remains open, with applications being accepted on an ongoing basis, it has not proved possible to date to fill all of these positions. Due to the difficulty experienced in recruiting doctors to the Defence Forces it has been necessary to identify alternative options for the provision of medical services, including consideration of the outsourcing of Defence Forces domestic medical services.  In this connection, a joint civilian\/ military Standing Committee has been set up with a view to advancing the development of a sustainable integrated medical service and to address the appropriate means of delivery of key medical capabilities for the Defence Forces.  An integrated model for the provision of the required medical services, involving both the Medical Corps and outsourced service provision is currently being progressed. <\/p><p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the House that Defence Forces personnel requiring medical treatment are getting the care they need and that I am committed to providing a sustainable medical service to meet the needs of the Defence Forces both at home and abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600053#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Missions","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600053#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[5570\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600053#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will provide an update on the current overseas missions in which the Defence Forces are involved; if any of these missions will conclude in 2014; if there are plans for any new deployments; if any requests have been received for such; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[5559\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600053#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of overseas missions that currently involve military personnel; the number of these under the auspices of the UN; the location of each mission; the number of these that involve the EU or NATO; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[5975\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600053#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the total number of members of the Defence Forces that have served overseas over the years; the extent to which such service is planned for the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[5981\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600053#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the degree to which further overseas, EU or UN associated troop deployments are likely to emerge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 34, 150 and 156 together. <\/p><p>  As of 01 February 2014, Ireland is contributing approximately 409 Defence Forces personnel to 14 different missions throughout the world. Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement attached. Details of the average monthly deployments overseas in the past five years are contained in the attached schedule.<\/p><p>  The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 206 personnel, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) with 117 Defence Forces personnel.  Other missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the EU Training Mission (EUTM) Somalia with seven (7) personnel; the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) with eight (8) personnel; the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina with seven (7) personnel; the NATO-led international security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with twelve (12) personnel; and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan with seven (7) personnel. Four (4) personnel were deployed in August 2013 for service with the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) in South Sudan. Ireland also contributes 26 observers and staff to various United Nations and OSCE missions and 15 other personnel to staff appointments at UN, EU and OSCE headquarters.<\/p><p>  Defence Forces participation in all overseas missions is reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The overall drawdown of ISAF personnel is currently underway and the withdrawal of the Defence Forces personnel will be coordinated in this context. It is anticipated that Irish personnel will complete their service with the mission in September 2014.<\/p><p>  As regards future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered.  Apart from the recent deployment of personnel to the UNDOF mission, no new deployments are envisaged at this time.   The current contribution of some 409 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.<\/p><p><b><i>MEMBERS OF THE PERMANENT DEFENCE FORCE SERVING OVERSEAS AS OF 01 February 2014<\/i><\/b><table><tr><th>1.<\/th><th><b><i>UN MISSIONS<\/i><\/b><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><b>UNIFIL<\/b> (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) HQ<\/td><td><div>16<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><b>UNIFIL<\/b> 42nd Infantry Group<\/td><td><div>186<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><b>UNIFIL<\/b> Sector West HQ<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><b>UNTSO <\/b>(United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation ) Israel &amp;amp;

By its latest resolution 2131 of 18 December 2013, the Security Council stressed the obligation of both Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic to scrupulously observe the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement and abide by its terms. It underscored that there should be no military forces in the area of separation other than those of UNDOF.

The Department and the Defence Forces, similar to all other Government Departments, must take into account the current difficult economic environment we are now operating in.  The budgetary situation and the operational requirements of the Defence Forces are the primary factors in determining the individual projects which can be completed, including those within the Curragh Camp. The Department does not have the funds to develop assets for other than to meet core, essential, military requirements. As part of the process for the allocation of funding for individual capital projects an assessment of requirements, which includes a cost benefit analysis, is undertaken.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the Curragh Camp it is understood from the military authorities that of the married quarters properties in question, 47 properties are unoccupied due to their condition, 56 properties are currently occupied, 26 by existing military personnel and a further 30 are occupied by non-military personnel.  It should be noted that currently nearly 50% of the 103 properties concerned are uninhabitable and many others are in need of substantial refurbishment.<\/p><p>  As I have said earlier I have asked that a technical assessment of the pool of properties, be undertaken so as to inform a decision on whether it is economically viable to restore and use any of the properties in a cost effective manner.  Any development of property from the public purse at this key location which encompasses the Defence Forces Training Centre must in the first instance be considered for use for military purposes. <\/p><p>  Further, any such initiative must support and complement the current policy positions of withdrawing from the provision of Married Quarters and resolving the issue of overholding.  I must repeat as I have said earlier, I cannot support the illegal occupation of military property by those who have no entitlement.

On the first day of my visit to the Middle East, I met with Fayez Ghosen, the Lebanese Minister for Defence, who highlighted the enormous burden placed on the Lebanese Government by the Syrian crisis.  Minister Ghosen stressed that particular problems had arisen in health, education and security and also highlighted the importance of support and financial assistance from the International community.  We also discussed the important role of United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and its contribution to the cause of maintaining peace, security and stability in the region.  Minister Ghosen expressed his gratitude for the Irish contribution to UNIFIL and mentioned, in particular, the warm relationship between the Irish troops and the local Lebanese community.<\/p><p>  While in Lebanon I also met with representatives from UN Refugee Agency, United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA) and the European Union External Action Service, at which the significant impact of the tragedy unfolding in Syria for the wider region and for Lebanon in particular was also discussed. The discussions also focused on the appalling toll of the crisis in Syria in which 120,000 people have lost their lives and some 7 million people have been displaced. <\/p><p>  I also had an opportunity to visit Irish troops in the UNIFIL UN Post based in South Lebanon.  Here I attended a Transfer of Authority ceremony to mark the handover of Command of the joint Irish\/Finnish Battalion to Finland. In Jerusalem I was briefed by Irish Commanders deployed with United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and by the Head of Mission of United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO), Ireland's Major General Michael Finn.   <\/p><p>  During the course of several other meetings, I met with the Israeli Minister for Defence Mr. Moshe Ya&rsquo;alon, the Israeli Justice Minister Ms. Tzipi Livni, Dr. Nabil Sha&rsquo;ath, the Commissioner for International Relations of Fateh and Mr. Bob Turner Gaza Field Director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.These meetings proved a valuable update and perspective on the difficulties in the region, their impact on those affected and possible future outcomes. Discussions centred on a broad range of issues affecting the Middle East and in respect of areas in which Ireland has a direct interest. These discussions included the role of our troops in supporting peacekeeping in the Golan Heights and Southern Lebanon, and Ireland's support for a Two State solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict. <\/p><p>  During my meetings in Israel, I took the opportunity to hear about the developments in the Middle East Peace Process, which is of course a subject of general interest in which Ireland has had a consistent interest. I also visited Ramallah specifically to hear the Palestinian perspective. My conversations with both sides underlined the considerable difficulties, which we all know need to be overcome, if an agreement is to be reached. For my part, I stressed the Government&rsquo;s firm support for a Two State solution, the importance of seizing the present opportunity to reach agreement, and the need for visionary and courageous leadership on all sides if that is to be achieved. <\/p><p>  I am pleased to note that the direct negotiations between the two sides, despite difficulties, are still continuing.

Significant progress has been made by the Military Authorities in addressing gaps between male and female participation in the Defence Forces, with an increase of 23% of female participation in the PDF since 2002.  However, it is recognised that more work needs to be done to meet the gender target for recruitment of females of 20% which was set by the Military Authorities in 2007.  <\/p><p>  As of 31 December 2013, there are 546 women out of a total strength of 9,236 serving in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).  This represents 6% of the overall strength of the Defence Forces and a 23% increase of female representation in the PDF since 2002.  A key impediment in achieving the target gender balance is the lack of female applicants relative to males. A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase female participation in the Defence Forces including:<\/p><p>  -  the introduction of best practices in recruitment, such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants,<\/p><p>  -  special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment,<\/p><p>  -  there is balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards,<\/p><p>  -  all promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit,<\/p><p>  -  a Gender Advisor has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces. <\/p><p>  Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties.  Women, therefore, play a full and meaningful role in all aspects of Defence Forces operations at home and overseas.  The Defence Forces also prides itself on providing a gender neutral working environment. Policies on equality are being constantly communicated to all ranks. The Military Authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing this matter in a continuing and proactive manner when it arises.<i><\/i> However, a key issue in recruiting and retaining female personnel lies in societal perception and attitudes to female soldiers and officers and much of the solution to this lies outside the control and influence of the Defence Forces.  <\/p><p>  That said, I believe that there is a need to continue to develop and promote strategies that not alone support increased female participation in the Defence Forces but also support increased diversity such that the personnel profile of the Defence Forces better reflects the changing demographic and multicultural nature of Irish Society.

In addition, Memorandums of Understanding and Service Level Agreements are in place between my Department and other Government Departments to formalise the provision of such support.<\/p><p>  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is available for deployments in response to emergencies and crises.  Costs are currently met by the Defence Vote for this type of support.  Following the severe weather experienced last weekend, the Defence Forces were requested and provided support to Limerick City Council to assist with the delivery of supplies and the evacuation of civilians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600055#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Strength","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600055#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[5573\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600055#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which the strength of the Defence Forces remains adequate throughout the country notwithstanding the restrictions arising from the economic situation; the extent to which the required operational strength and command structures of the Army, Navy and Air Corps remain adequate at all installations throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, at 31 December 2013, the latest date for which details are available, was 9,236, comprising 7,434 Army, 779 Air Corps and 1,023 Naval Service personnel.

The Judge decided to do this due to the time that had passed since the named person&rsquo;s disappearance and the lack of information or leads.  This is not unusual and the case can be re-opened (judicially) at any stage if there are further developments. <\/p><p>  The Guardia Civil investigation into the named person&rsquo;s disappearance has included the following steps:<\/p><p>  Extensive physical search of the area where the named person disappeared (helicopters, specialist tracking teams etc)<\/p><p>  CCTV cameras from petrol stations on motorways were checked<\/p><p>  Any traffic offences which occurred in the area in the hours following the named person&rsquo;s disappearance were thoroughly checked for any link<\/p><p>  Interviews with the named person&rsquo;s family &amp;amp; friends<\/p><p>  Examination of personal effects &amp;amp; forensic analysis of any clothing found in area <\/p><p>  Retention of call &amp;amp; credit card logs <\/p><p>  Tracing any possible vehicle which may be connected to the disappearance of the named person  <\/p><p>  Disseminating the description of the named person, photo etc to all police agencies in Spain, Europe &amp;amp; through Interpol<\/p><p>  Disseminating same to missing person websites (information currently on at least 12 specialised sites) <\/p><p>  The DNA of the named was person checked against the database of unclaimed bodies in all of Spain (will remain flagged on this system, should a future match be made)<\/p><p>  Interviews with people in bars, taxi ranks and bus\/train stations in the area<\/p><p>  Consultation with psychological experts<\/p><p>  Following up &amp;amp; monitoring of the named person&rsquo;s MSN messenger contacts &ndash; very difficult as permission has to be obtained from Microsoft in relation to specific contacts [the mother of the named person has said that they had approximately 11 email accounts and over 3,000 contacts.]  <\/p><p>  Investigation of reported sightings of the named person<\/p><p>  Garda&iacute; interviewed several members of the family of the named person in Ireland (at request of Guardia Civil) with a view to ascertaining the last contact made with the named person and creating a background profile.  <\/p><p>  Request by the Guardia Civil for assistance in accessing UK phone records was facilitated by the Garda Liaison Officer in Madrid via UK colleagues as soon as received.  This was on foot of a statement made by a person known to the named person that the named person had contacted her from a UK mobile number (months after her disappearance) &ndash; unfortunately, after investigation by police, this turned out not to be the case.   <\/p><p>  The Embassy remains in contact with the senior officer leading the investigation.  The police investigation remains open and has not been closed from an operational point of view. The police continue to follow up every possible lead, and to cross-check new cases for any potential links with the disappearance of they named person. They advise that family members should continue to pass on any information to them through official Police channels. The Guardia Civil also continue to follow up on any reported sightings of the named person.  They remain at the service of the family and of the Embassy. Any substantive information received is passed on to the family of the named person.  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department and our Embassy in Madrid will continue to monitor developments in this case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600055#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600055#WRC01900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Renovation Incentive Scheme Eligibility","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600055#WRC01850"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[5957\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600055#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding the home renovation incentive scheme for the installation of a new conservatory; if the cost of a conservatory can be included in overall renovation and building costs when calculating a tax rebate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Where transactions are entered into for the purposes of avoiding tax and are detected by the Revenue they are challenged by Revenue under the relevant anti avoidance rules.  In the case of direct taxes, there is a general anti avoidance rule (GAAR) contained in section 811 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and, in the case of Value-Added Tax, there is an Abuse of Practice principle under EU law to counter avoidance transactions.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that over the course of 2011, 2012 and 2013 some 77 transactions (36 in 2013) were challenged under section 811 as tax avoidance transactions that should be unwound so that the proper tax due was paid. The tax in dispute in these cases is circa &euro;134.5 million.  If Revenue s view of the transaction as a tax avoidance transaction is upheld, in the majority of cases, interest and a surcharge of 20% of the tax will become payable in addition to the tax in dispute.  73 of the 77 cases have appealed the Revenue s challenge on the basis that the transactions concerned are not tax avoidance transactions within the meaning of section 811.  In addition, Judicial Review proceedings in the High Court have been initiated by 21 of the cases concerned challenging Revenue procedures in connection with the use of section 811.<\/p><p>  It should be noted, that there are currently about 449 cases actively being pursued where Section 811 Notices of Opinions have issued and the tax at risk is about &euro;200 million.  Currently, some 6 VAT cases are being challenged by Revenue under the ECJ Abuse of Practice  principle.  These cases involve circa &euro;32 million in VAT.  All of these cases are at various stages of appeal in the courts up to and including the Supreme Court.  In addition, Revenue is also active in countering tax avoidance transactions under specific tax provisions.  There are currently 225 of these cases which are being dealt with in Revenue's Anti Avoidance Branch in Large Cases Division, where assessments have been made and appealed by the taxpayers. Cases, in excess of 700, are also being investigated but no assessments have been made as of yet.  These cases are generally challenged on their merits and under specific sections of the Taxes Acts.  It is difficult to put a figure on the tax amounts involved in these cases as some are at an early stage of being investigated at this point.  These type of avoidance cases are also being tackled in Revenue districts around the country.<\/p><p>  I know challenging tax avoidance transactions is a priority for the Revenue Commissioners as set out in their Annual Corporate Plan and current Statement of Strategy.  I fully support them in this work and will move to legislate against aggressive tax avoidance schemes that the Revenue Commissioners identify and bring forward proposals to have such schemes shut down.  In addition, the review of the tax appeal process currently under way may result in reform proposals on tax appeals that may assist in an earlier finalisation of avoidance cases.  The Revenue Commissioners further inform me that they are not in a position to estimate the number of tax avoidance transactions that may be challenged in 2014 but they can confirm that the Anti Avoidance Branch in Large Cases Divisions, supported by a nationwide Anti Avoidance Network staffed by officials from each Revenue Region, will continue to progress ongoing investigations and prepare new cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600056#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Industry Issues","counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600056#WRD00750"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[6006\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600056#WRD00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the progress that has been made regarding the possibility of introducing a car swappage scheme in order to stimulate the motor industry, create employment and keep the sector strong and vibrant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":110,"content":"<p>SIMI in its 2014 pre-Budget submissions called for\u00a0the introduction of a \"swappage scheme\" to support the industry.

There is a specific provision included in those main features, which states that &quot;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&quot;  Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it.  The DRI will come into effect when the Single Supervisory Mechanism is in place and operational.  This is not expected to take place until late 2014.  The Eurogroup has agreed that there will be strict eligibility criteria as well as a clear pecking order for the ESM DRI, so any possible application for a DRI will be determined on its own merits within the rules established for the DRI.  The overall framework agreed in summer 2013 builds upon the earlier Euro area Heads of State or Government agreement secured on the 29 of June 2012, and is an important step in the Eurozone's efforts in this regard.<\/p><p>  I would also point to a number of other positive developments during the lifetime of this Government to date that will serve to alleviate our debt burden including the reduction of the interest rates on our EU programme borrowings, the extension of the maximum average maturities of our EFSF and EFSM loans by seven years and the replacement of the Promissory Notes issued to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds.<\/p><p>  Finally, we will ensure that our case for retrospective direct recapitalisation is made at all levels as appropriate.  I remain confident that the commitment made by the Euro-area Heads of State or Government in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns will be respected.  It is very clear that there is still a lot of negotiation to be done on this aspect of the facility but the agreement now in place keeps the possibility to apply to the ESM for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks open for us, should we wish to avail of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600056#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Yield","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600056#WRD01450"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[6072\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600056#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the total sum of local property tax collected in the year 2013; and if he will provide a county breakdown of same.","asker":"969","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that compliance data in relation to the Local Property Tax (LPT) for 2013 are available broken down by city and county councils nationally and the most up to date figures are published on the Commissioners website at:<i><\/i>.

This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme.  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years. Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.<\/p><p>  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim.  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget. Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents.  The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.<\/p><p>  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.  The Department is contacting primary schools that do not currently operate a book rental scheme to advise them of the application process.  The school referred to by the Deputy indicated in the Primary School Census 2013 that they currently operate a book rental\/loan scheme and will not therefore qualify for funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600057#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staffing","counter":146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600057#WRE01025"},{"type":"question","counter":147,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[5898\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600057#WRE01050","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"in relation to resource teachers who, as a direct consequence of reduction in funding, find that the schools in which they are employed are no longer in a position to continue their employment and are let go, if such persons may qualify and apply for redundancy payments as they have been forced out of employment through no fault of their own; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":148,"content":"<p>There are standard redeployment arrangements in operation to deal with the redeployment of any surplus permanent and CID holding teachers.

Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full\/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.

This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme.  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years.  Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.<\/p><p>  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.   Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.<\/p><p>  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim.  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget.  Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents.  The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved. The Department is contacting primary schools that do not currently operate a book rental scheme to advise them of the application process.  The school referred to by the Deputy indicated in the Primary School Census 2013 that they currently operate a book rental\/loan scheme and will not therefore qualify for funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600058#WRF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600058#WRF00950"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[6109\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600058#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding a building project in respect of a school (details supplied) in County Dublin.

The Office of Public Works (OPW) wrote on 10 January, 2014 to City and County Managers in coastal counties indicating it will accept applications under its Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme for funding to assist Local Authorities with the cost of repairs to built flood defences and coastal protection structures which have been damaged by the recent storms. This is a once-off measure to reinstate built coastal defences to their pre-storm condition. The specific application form for this is entitled 'Coastal Storm Flooding Damage Questionnaire 2014' and is available on the OPW website.   <\/p><p>  The OPW allocated funding of &euro;100,000 to Kerry County Council under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme in 2012 for embankment strengthening works at Lower Cromane.

The analysis will enable the identification of flood risk management options for this area.

In this context my Department has introduced a number of reforms to the Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) since 2011 and is focused on ongoing and continuous improvement of the system. <\/p><p>  As part of these reforms my Department has developed a framework and guidelines for managers across the civil service on how to address underperformance.

The main issue raised about these fees is the level of the fee. The fee for tickets purchased online or by telephone from the main provider of ticketing services, Ticketmaster Ireland, is typically 12.5 cent of the price of the ticket up to a maximum charge of &euro;6.10 to &euro;6.35 per ticket. The fee for tickets purchased through retail agents of Ticketmaster Ireland is typically &euro;2.15 per ticket, with an additional fee commonly applied to payments made by credit card.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy will understand that, in a market economy, it is not my function either to fix prices or to rule on whether prices are too high. In response to complaints from consumers, the Competition Authority undertook an investigation in 2005 into alleged excessive booking fees by Ticketmaster Ireland and its exclusive contractual relationships with two leading promoters. After an extensive investigation, the Authority concluded that Ticketmaster Ireland&rsquo;s conduct did not constitute an abuse contrary to section 5 of the Competition Act 2002, nor did its agreements with the promoters prevent, restrict or distort competition contrary to section 4 of the Act. Though the company accounted for 100 per cent of the market for outsourced ticketing services for events of national or international appeal, it was constrained from exploiting this position by the countervailing power of the event promoters vis-&agrave;-vis their ticketing service provider and by the incentive for those promoters to minimise the booking fee charged to the end consumer.  <\/p><p>  A second issue commonly raised about booking fees concerns the manner in which these are applied and advertised, specifically the fact that they apply as an additional charge to the price of the ticket. This is in accordance with the Consumer Information (Advertisements for Concerts or Theatre Performances) Order 1997 which provides that, in every written advertisement for a public concert or theatre performance, the admission price must be indicated together, where applicable and separately, with the amount in monetary or percentage terms of any additional charge. My Department undertook a review of the 1997 Order in 2007-2008 in order, among other things, to establish whether it should be amended to require such advertisements to indicate ticket prices inclusive of booking fees or other charges. While the majority of respondents were in favour of such a change, others, including the Consumers&rsquo; Association of Ireland and the Competition Authority, considered that the requirement to indicate booking fees separately could serve a pro-competitive and pro-consumer purpose.<\/p><p>  A survey of a nationally representative sample of 1,000 respondents undertaken as part of the review found that most respondents reported that they found it very or quite easy to understand the total price they had to pay for tickets. When asked to express a preference for the inclusive or separate advertising of ticket prices and booking fees, more respondents favoured a requirement to indicate the prices and fees separately. In the light of these findings and the responses to the public consultation, it was decided accordingly not to proceed with the amendment of the 1997 Order. Legal advice obtained on a separate issue established, furthermore, that the scope for any such amendment was heavily constrained by the maximum harmonisation status of Directive 2005\/29\/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices.<\/p><p>  The advertising of tickets for entertainment and other events, and of the booking fees which apply to those tickets, is regulated by the legislation that gives effect to the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive in Ireland, the Consumer Protection Act 2007. The Act provides, among other things, that a commercial practice is misleading if it includes the provision of false information about the price of a good or service and the manner in which that price is calculated, and that information would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing decision that he or she would not otherwise make. The Act further provides that a commercial practice is misleading if the trader omits or conceals material information that the average consumer would need in order to make an informed purchasing decision.  <\/p><p>  A &lsquo;sweep&rsquo; investigation of online sales of tickets for cultural and sporting events co-ordinated by the European Commission and undertaken by national enforcement authorities in 2010 and 2011 checked sixteen ticket service websites in Ireland. While eight of the sixteen websites surveyed were found to be in breach of provisions of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive or other applicable European Union consumer protection legislation in the first phase of the sweep, all were found to be complaint in the subsequent follow-up phase. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600059#WRG02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600059#WRG02150"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[5938\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600059#WRG02200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will respond to correspondence (details supplied) regarding the establishment of an economic task force; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"975","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>I consider that it is neither practicable nor effective to establish jobs task forces or specific jobs plans around the country as a general mechanism to address unemployment.

Accordingly, it was not necessary for me to make Orders in these instances.<\/p><p>  Since the Orders were signed, the Labour Relations Commission has been asked to nominate Industrial Relations Officers to fill the vacant chairperson and deputy chairperson positions on each JLC<i>. <\/i> I expect that those nominees will be appointed in the coming weeks.  It will then be a matter for the Labour Court, under the Industrial Relations Act 1946, to ensure that equal number of representatives of workers and employers in the relevant sectors are on each of the JLCs.<\/p><p>  It is important to remember that the JLC Establishment Orders will provide only a framework within which employers and employee representatives can come together voluntarily and negotiate terms and conditions of workers in their respective sector. For vulnerable workers, the advantage of JLCs is that they see fair terms and conditions such as wage rates, sick pay etc. agreed and given effect by Employment Regulation Order, while for some employers, the advantage of the JLC system, based as it is on the principle of self-governance, means that they can agree and set minimum pay and conditions, agree on work practices which are custom-made to their industry &ndash; a flexibility which cannot be achieved by primary legislation. Where both parties to a JLC see commonality of purpose and outcome then an agreement may emerge.  This process sits very much within the context of Ireland's voluntarist system of industrial relations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600060#WRH00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600060#WRH00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":236,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600060#WRH00650"},{"type":"question","counter":237,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[5894\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600060#WRH00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a carer's allowance application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":238,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 20 August 2013.

There are over 14,000 registered boat owners on the seven waterways managed by Waterways Ireland. These seven waterways make a vital contribution to tourism, attracting visitors from around Ireland and from abroad.<\/p><p>  The proposed bye-laws are intended to support the investment already made by Waterways Ireland in new infrastructure and facilities along the canals. That investment has made the waterways more attractive for boat owners and is helping to develop them as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity for all waterway users  . Given that background, it is now necessary to update the bye-laws to ensure that the rules governing use of the waterways are fit for purpose and best meet the needs of all waterway users. <\/p><p>  The proposed new bye-laws provide for the management of house boats, defined as a boat on the canals which is being used as the sole or principal residence of the owner or an occupant with the owner&rsquo;s permission, as well as for extended moorings and residential moorings. An Annual Houseboat Mooring Permit will be required for a houseboat not navigating or continuously cruising the canals.  The permit will allow the use of a mooring identified by Waterways Ireland on the canals where the houseboat may moor for more than five days and up to one year. It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the total number of boat owners who will be required to take out an Annual Houseboat Mooring Permit in the event of the draft bye-laws coming into force. However, I am advised that Waterways Ireland issued 276 Combined Mooring and Passage permits in 2013 for boats to navigate on the Grand and Royal Canals. In addition, 151 Extended Mooring Permits have been issued to boat owners wishing to occupy dedicated berths on these navigations. <\/p><p>  The proposed bye-laws will also modernise the charging regime. There will also be further provision for the care, management, maintenance and control and the regulation of the use of the canals, moorings on the canals, and their use by the public for recreation and navigation purposes.<\/p><p>  I am aware of and appreciate that concerns have been raised regarding the proposed by-laws.  Waterways Ireland has undertaken a public consultation on the proposed bye laws.  This commenced on 6 January 2014 and closed this week, at 3 p.m. Monday, 3 February.  The consultation timeframe provided the opportunity to anyone with concerns to submit views.  Following its completion, Waterways Ireland will consider all written responses and will then finalise its proposed approach.<\/p><p>  The amendments to the canal bye-laws will have no implications on the fisheries industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600061#WRJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Sites","counter":285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600062#WRK00150"},{"type":"question","counter":286,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[5949\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600062#WRK00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if the State will consider purchasing an historic building (details supplied) in Dublin 5; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":287,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 373 of 4 February, 2014. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600062#WRK00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Projects","counter":288,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600062#WRK00350"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[5959\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600062#WRK00400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the reason Castlepollard was left out of the new Lakelands Treasures app (details supplied).

However, the economic downturn has had a negative impact on those plans.<\/p><p>  I am continuing to explore all possible options to advance this project within the current fiscal constraints. In this regard, I established an Inter-Agency Group on the Ulster Canal to explore ways to advance the project and to examine possible funding options for it, including existing funding streams and the leveraging of funding from other sources.

In addition, the Regulations prohibit such application at any time of the year when the ground is frozen, waterlogged or when heavy rain is forecast.  The closed periods in Ireland were decided following extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission when Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme was being introduced. They extend from 15 October to 12, 15 or 31 January depending on location in the country.<\/p><p>  These provisions are underpinned by scientific advice and good agricultural practice.

The local government funding model has changed considerably in 2014.

In addition, under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, the Minister for Finance, from 2014 onwards, is to pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this will contribute to a range of financial supports being provided to local authorities, including General Purpose Grants and funding, on the basis of Service Level Agreements, for water services which local authorities will be providing on behalf of Irish Water.<\/p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised.  Given the significant changes to local government financing already taking place in 2014, as outlined above, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015.

The CDT and NHCC comprise a range of government and non-government bodies working towards better joined up services on homelessness and the implementation of the National Homeless Strategy.  The Irish Prison Service is also represented on seven of the Regional Homeless Consultative Fora established under the provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act, 2009.  Through these fora, the Irish Prison Service, in partnership with the Probation Service, has been working to ensure that the unique circumstances of homeless offenders are taken into account in the development and provision of preventative and other supporting actions for persons who are vulnerable to homelessness.  <\/p><p>  With regard to women prisoners specifically, in recent years, in addition to the direct work of probation officers on accommodation issues, a weekly clinic service has been provided in the D&oacute;chas Centre by the Department of Social Protection Community Welfare Service through the Homeless Person's Unit (HPU).  This service is co-funded by the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service, the Department of Social Protection and four local authorities.  Referrals to this service generally are at the pre-release stage and emergency and other accommodation options, supplementary benefits and fast tracked medical cards are arranged by the Community Welfare Officers (CWOs) who provide the information and clinic services.  There were 241 female prisoners assisted by the HPU in-reach (CWOs) in D&oacute;chas Centre in 2012.  These 241 prisoners account for 1,138 interactions with this service.  The HPU service is invaluable for the successful resettlement of offenders and a vital component of pre-release planning.  Focus Ireland operates a homeless in-reach service in Limerick Prison, which also accommodates female prisoners.  The Focus Ireland service provides a case management and pre-settlement service for prisoners.  The service supports participants in accessing appropriate services and accommodation on the pathway to independent living.  <\/p><p>  In addition I would like to inform the Deputy that as part of the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Strategic Plan, 2012-2015, the Service has committed itself to work in partnership with the Probation Service and other stakeholders in the statutory, community and voluntary sectors which include Dublin City Council, the Office of Public Works, the Health Service Executive and City of Dublin Education &amp;amp; Training Board in order to develop a strategy for dealing with women offenders and to put in place a targeted response in relation to homelessness for these women.  The engagement between the Irish Prison Service and these agencies to date, has in part, concentrated on the provision of a Centre in the greater Dublin area which would target women with specific needs and would provide:- <\/p><p>- Supported accommodation,<\/p><p>- Intensive case management (temporary and long term),<\/p><p>- Specialist addiction and mental health support, with primary care teams, and<\/p><p>- Day services with drop in and structured programmes, including training and educational programmes.<\/p><p>  Priority access will be given for women from the D&oacute;chas Centre.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the development of a centre for women, the Irish Prison Service are working with the following:<\/p><p><br \/><i>Strategic Partners<\/i>:<\/p><p>Dublin Region Homeless Executive<\/p><p>Health Service Executive<\/p><p>The Probation Service<\/p><p>CDETB<\/p><p><br \/><i>Operational Group<\/i>:<\/p><p>The Probation Service<\/p><p>Dublin City Council<\/p><p>CDETB<\/p><p>Novas Initiatives<\/p><p>Depaul Ireland<\/p><p>Heath Service Executive<\/p><p>Department of Social Protection<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600064#WRM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commencement of Legislation","counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600064#WRM00950"},{"type":"question","counter":362,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[6040\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600064#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the technical and administrative arrangements required to bring section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 into effect are now at an advanced stage; and if the working group established under the aegis of the Courts Service to examine various operational aspects of the penalty points system has reported recently on the way section 44 can be commenced without any further delay.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":363,"content":"<p>The working group established under the aegis of the Courts Service has reported recently and has highlighted that substantial technical and administrative arrangements are required to be put in place to facilitate the commencement of the provision in question.

","asker":"1177","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":385,"content":"<p>Contrary to some recent media reports, I can confirm that there is no intention to amend the law on personal insolvency.  The enactment of the Personal Insolvency Act in December 2012, the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) in March 2013, and the reforms to the bankruptcy regime which took effect from 3 December 2013 already constitute a far-reaching, substantial and comprehensive reform of our insolvency and bankruptcy law.<\/p><p>  It is now time to allow the new legislation to take effect.  Operational issues which may arise will be addressed by the ISI.  The ISI has rapidly established the necessary infrastructure of trained and accredited insolvency practitioners and intermediaries, and began accepting applications for personal insolvency solutions last September.  A number of these cases have already been referred to the Courts for protection orders or final approval, and the ISI expects the volume of such cases to increase significantly in the coming weeks and months.  So while huge progress has been made, we are still in the early stages of implementation, and the legislation should be allowed time to bed down.  There have also been media references to a proposed insolvency protocol.  I can clarify that this is purely an operational matter and does not require any amendment to the existing legislation.  Such a protocol is simply a working template for an insolvency or debt agreement, agreed with stakeholder consultation, to facilitate and streamline insolvency applications.  Developing such a protocol is an initiative of the ISI, based on best practice in other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  With regard to costs, in the case of a Debt Relief Notice, there are no significant costs for an eligible insolvent debtor associated with its operation as the approved intermediary provides the supports necessary to make an application at no charge.  It should be noted that in the case of both a Debt Settlement Arrangement and a Personal Insolvency Arrangement, these solutions are predicated on a voluntary agreement being arranged by a personal insolvency practitioner between debtor and creditor(s).  The practitioner's fees will be paid from contributions made during the term of the agreement.  In a case where a debtor is not in a position to make some level of payment to his or her creditor(s), whether by way of income payments or the disposal of assets, it is difficult to see how an arrangement could be put in place.  Bankruptcy, the term of which has recently been reduced from twelve to three years, may be the most appropriate option in such cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600065#WRN00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Services Regulation","counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600065#WRN00350"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[6124\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600065#WRN00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos 27 and 37 of 1 December 2011, where he stated work on a regulatory impact assessment for the Bill is near completion and that it will be made available in the near future, the reason it took a full two years for him to subsequently publish the regulatory impact assessment on the Legal Services Bill; his views on whether best practice provides that an RIA should be carried out before any decisions are taken regarding regulatory changes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1186","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":388,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[6125\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600065#WRN00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason there was no analysis of multidisciplinary practices, MDPs, in the regulatory impact assessment, RIA, relating to the Legal Services Regulation Bill; his views that in advance of attempting to introduce multidisciplinary practices it would be preferable to make the new regulator to investigate whether or not multidisciplinary practices should be permitted and allow it to review the experience in those countries which have permitted MDPs and to consider examples of countries that have chosen not to go this route and the reasons they have done so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Bill and its structural reforms are also a key deliverable under the Government&rsquo;s <i>Medium Term Economic Strategy 2014-2020<\/i>.  The published Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) of the Bill, in keeping with the relevant Guidelines of 2009, focuses on how best to implement these pressing Government commitments.  The remaining amendments for Committee Stage, which cover Parts 7 to 9 of the Bill, have been circulated for consideration in advance of the resumption of that Stage on 12 February 2014.<\/p><p>  As I have previously stated in Replies to the House, although a preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) had been in preparation for the Bill, because of the urgently prescribed time-frame under the EU\/IMF\/ECB Programme, it did not prove possible to complete it for issue when the Bill was published.  Deputies will be aware that the relevant Guidelines specifically allow for a Regulatory Impact Analysis to follow a Bill in such exceptional circumstances as applied in this instance.  Moreover, in the subsequent period priority also had to be given by the Government to the enactment of the Personal Insolvency Bill as a competing legislative priority under the EU\/IMF\/ECB Troika programme.  This overlap provided a convenient opportunity to further develop the RIA for the Legal Services Regulation Bill while taking account of intervening developments and the consideration of submissions from stake-holders.  It also allowed me to publicly anticipate, including at the closing of Second Stage, a series of enhancing amendments to the Bill which were duly outlined in the RIA - I have already introduced several of these amendments in the course of the Bill's ongoing Committee Stage.<\/p><p>  I have previously outlined the situation in relation to the introduction of multidisciplinary practices to the Deputy in my detailed Written Reply to Question 441 of 17 December 2013 tabled in her name.  As I pointed out on that occasion, the then Fair Trade Commission, in its 'Report of Study into Restrictive Practices in the Legal Profession' published in March of 1990, recommended that there should be the greatest possible freedom allowed to individual solicitors and barristers in offering their services to clients.  The Solicitors (Amendment) Act of 1994 took account of this by making respective provision in sections 70 and 71 for the possible establishment of incorporated practices and for the sharing of fees by solicitors with non-solicitor partners arising from either a partnership or an agency agreement in what amounts to a  multidisciplinary practice.  I am at a loss, therefore, to understand why a Deputy and member of a reform alliance would wish to turn the clock back twenty years in relation to this earlier reform initiative.<\/p><p>  The Report of the Competition Authority of December 2006 entitled, 'Competition in Professional Services: Solicitors and Barristers', put forward detailed findings and recommendations in relation to the more competitive and consumer-focussed provision of legal services in the State.  Indeed, the Report provides a series of substantial observations that clearly identify and respond to the market concentration of legal services resulting from the delivery of those services within the confines of narrow historical models that could not be adequately responsive to the needs of current markets, business technologies and consumer behaviour.  I cannot accept, therefore, the import of the Deputy's Question, again on this occasion, that the interests of consumers and our international competitiveness would be better served by ignoring or reversing the clearly identified need for structural reform.  That is to say, by the retention of anti-competitive or restrictive business models in a sheltered legal services sector that would remain immune to the kind of structural reform that, in every other services sector, has proven essential to sustainable economic recovery.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will similarly be aware, as detailed in my Written Reply of 17 December 2013, that numerous jurisdictions including England and Wales, Canada and Australia, have introduced new and more customer-focussed legal business models in the intervening period since the Competition Authority's Report of 2006.  These &quot;alternative business structures&quot; (ABS) can involve the traditional legal services provided by barristers and\/or solicitors or combine them, in what  are known as &quot;multidisciplinary practices&quot;, with those of accountants, insurance brokers, conveyancers or other service providers to serve clients on a more cost-effective basis.  To ignore these changes would leave legal practitioners and the consumers of their services in this jurisdiction at a growing competitive disadvantage and would continue to disregard almost a quarter of a century of recommendations from public bodies going right back to the Fair Trade Commission in 1990.  Consequently, in looking to the future, the Legal Services Regulation Bill includes several measures aimed at opening up the provision of legal services in a way that takes account of the emergent legal business models and provides for their effective, independent regulation.  I would remind the Deputy that the RIA, in underscoring remaining obstacles to competition and the global transformation of legal services, does in fact address multidisciplinary practices including in terms of their provenance, rationale and recognised advantages for legal practitioners.  The precise nature of the provisions enabling alternative business structures, the relevant powers required by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority and the modalities of operation and management of legal partnerships and multidisciplinary practices are matters I have been actively reviewing and considering in detail with officials of my Department.  In so doing, I have been able to take account of the regulated roll-out of new legal business structures in comparable economies and jurisdictions, the relevant reviews of their implementation and the related submissions received.  The outcome of these deliberations is reflected in the enhanced provisions for  Part 7 of the Bill which I have circulated, with Cabinet approval, for the coming session of Committee Stage.<\/p><p>  As I have previously outlined to the Deputy, the proposed alternative business structures include new opportunities for legal practitioners to establish the types of multidisciplinary practices mentioned; for solicitors and barristers to participate in legal partnerships; for legal practitioners working for private or State entities to be allowed to act as advocates in court proceedings for their employers; for practising barristers who share premises and costs as a group to be allowed to advertise themselves as such; for solicitors to employ barristers in a practice and for direct access to barristers in non-contentious matters that do not involve the holding of clients monies.  These are precisely the areas of structural reform that would, as stated in paragraph 84(g) of the RIA, remain prohibited were the option of taking &quot;no policy action&quot; to be adopted by the Government.  As far as paragraphs 25 and 26 are concerned, the actual contradiction that the RIA highlights, in a very balanced way, is that the willingness of the legal professions to participate on a highly selective basis in global networks or niche ventures merely highlights the policy inconsistencies of those remaining barriers to the more open provision of legal services that remain in place, including in several instances under their professional codes, and run contrary to the interests of consumers and the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600065#WRN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service","counter":391,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600065#WRN00750"},{"type":"question","counter":392,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[6157\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600065#WRN00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps he is taking to improve the efficiency of the family law courts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":393,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for Government commits the Government to significant reform of the courts, including the establishment of a separate family law court structure that is streamlined, more efficient, and less costly.  I initiated a consultation process with interested parties in relation to the establishment of family law courts and in that regard hosted a seminar in July 2013 to discuss how such courts might operate.  An eminent judge from the Australian Family Court attended the seminar and shared experiences of their system.  The outcome of the seminar will feed into the process of designing the most appropriate model of family law courts for Ireland and this is currently under consideration in my Department, including the question of holding a Constitutional referendum in that regard.<\/p><p>  I am pleased that Part 2 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 was commenced on 11 January 2014, allowing <i>bona fide<\/i>  representatives of the press to attend family law and child care court proceedings subject to strict conditions.  Enabling the media to have access to, and to report on, these cases will provide valuable information to the public, judiciary and the legal profession on the administration of the law by the courts in these important areas.<\/p><p>  I also look forward to the enactment, in the coming year, of the Mediation Bill which will promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings.  The aim of the Bill is to increase the use of mediation in civil disputes which will have the effect of reducing legal costs and speeding up the resolution of disputes.  The Bill will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings.  It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider mediation and suspend the proceedings to facilitate the mediation process.  The Bill will also set out in clear terms the role of the mediator in the resolution of a dispute and will provide for the publication of codes of practice for mediators designed to set standards in relation to the practice of mediation.<\/p><p>  This measure will further enhance a successful initiative between the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Family Mediation Service which has been operating in the Dublin District Family Law Courts in Dolphin House since March 2011.

In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.<\/p><p>  There are, of course, a small number of situations where statute has created exceptions to this approach, most notably by providing for mandatory sentences for murder and presumptive minimum sentences in the case of certain firearms and drug trafficking offences.  Except for exceptional circumstances, I am of the view that the Oireachtas should be cautious in prescribing mandatory sentences.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.<\/p><p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  ISIS is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much welcomed the initiative led by the Judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information via the website.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is also aware that I established a Penal Policy Review Group to carry out a review incorporating an examination and analysis of all aspects of penal policy including sentencing policies and the group is expected to report within the next few months.<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b> In addition, the Law Reform Commission published a report last year on Mandatory Sentencing and the recommendations contained in the report will be fully considered in my Department together with the report of the Penal Policy Review Group when it has been finalised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600065#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600065#WRN01350"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Strength","counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600065#WRN01325"},{"type":"question","counter":401,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[5974\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600065#WRN01350","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the total strength of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps by gender and rank at present; the extent to which the numbers have fluctuated in each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Prices for prime steers and heifers have remained relatively stable but the young bull trade is challenging at present as age and weight issues continue to affect demand. <\/p><p>  Aggregate cattle supplies at Department-approved meat plants to the end of January 2014 are up almost 10% on the corresponding period in 2012 with strong increases recorded in the steer, heifer and cull cow categories. This higher throughput is partly a result of cattle becoming fit for slaughter earlier than in previous years leading to a situation whereby factories are giving preference to certain types of stock that are better suited to the trade specifications demanded by their retail customers.  Delays in young bull slaughtering undoubtedly put pressure on producer profit margins but the cattle trade is cyclical in nature and short-term fluctuations in some cattle prices will not necessarily impact on the long-term strategy for the beef sector as set out in Food Harvest 2020. <\/p><p>  Cattle prices are determined by the dynamics of supply and demand in the marketplace and I have no function in relation to commercial transactions between the meat factories and their suppliers. Rather, it is the responsibility of the industry &ndash; in this instance, processors and farmers working together &ndash; to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market such that the supply chain operates for the benefit of both parties and does not undermine the viability of bull beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers. The current situation underlines the need for the industry to improve communication on market trends and signals along the supply chain. I understand that producer and meat processor representatives have recently engaged in constructive discussions with a view to resolving the short-term oversupply of young bulls. An industry-led solution to clear the backlog of bull beef is essential to restoring confidence in the sector and will hopefully resolve the current difficulties for farmers.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Food Harvest 2020 targets, I fully recognise the importance the importance of maintaining confidence in a sector that has benefitted from historically high price levels in recent years. Earlier this week, I announced the operational details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014. This package will include a &euro;23m for Beef Genomics Scheme, &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme, &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme and &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. <\/p><p>  The Genomic Scheme is a particularly important innovation that utilises cutting-edge science developed by the Teagasc research facility at Moorepark in collaboration with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF). The use of genomics in dairy animals has helped transform cattle breeding in that sector as well as delivering tangible gains for efficient farmers. Introducing this technology for the suckler sector will help to improve the genetic quality of the national beef herd and to increase productivity and profitability at farm level.<\/p><p>  The scheme will provide a payment of &euro;40 per calf to participants in return for genotyping a selection of their animals specified by ICBF.  Genomic selection involves taking an animal&rsquo;s DNA sample and sending it to a laboratory to assess its performance traits.

This is done in a number of ways such as by providing grant-aid to support pre-school provision in community pre-schools and by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some cases at local level disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible.  <\/p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s role in supporting children with disabilities involves it working in close co-operation with the disability service providers that it funds, with the education sector, with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and with the parents and families of the children in question.

Of the additional 264.5 posts allocated, 47 whole-time equivalent Speech and Language Therapy posts were approved.

The therapist, in conjunction with the parent(s) or carer, will determine the severity of the individual&rsquo;s difficulties and prioritise for therapy accordingly.  The level of intervention is in line with clinic policy, age and severity of the diagnosis.  The waiting period for intervention is dependent on the nature and severity of the disorder following assessment.  In an effort to address the issue of waiting lists and ensure that services are delivered in as equitable a manner as possible within available resources, the HSE has introduced a number of initiatives such as therapists increasing clinic based work instead of domiciliary work and providing family centred interventions in a group as opposed to a one-to-one setting, whenever possible.<\/p><p>  In the longer term, the reconfiguration of children&rsquo;s disability services into geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme will ensure an equitable delivery of services.

Both I and my Department welcome the publication of HIQA's reports and note the concerns raised in them about hand hygiene practices particularly among medical staff.  <\/p><p>  HIQA carried out an unannounced inspection on Kerry General Hospital on 22nd August, 2013.

I have also asked the HSE to reply directly in relation to the data sought on consultant posts advertised in 2013. <\/p><p>  I do not accept that there is a crisis in the recruitment of consultants or in the recruitment of NCHDs. There has been a significant increase in the number of consultants (Whole Time Equivalents) over the past 5 years. The number increased from 2,260 in December 2008 to 2,555 in December 2013. The great majority of almost 5,000 NCHD posts in the system are filled at present and were last year. I recognise, however, that recruitment of consultants and NCHDS is a significant challenge at the present time and needs to be facilitated.<\/p><p>  It is appreciated that the 30% reduction decided in September 2012 for future &lsquo;new entrant&rsquo; appointments represented a substantial reduction in the rate of pay for consultants. However, it was a necessary measure, given the challenging economic circumstances. If the health services are to continue to provide consultant-level opportunities for doctors to replace consultants who retire and eventually to expand overall capacity, this can only happen on the basis of a lower-cost model. I have asked the HSE and my Department to examine the application of the 30% reduction to serving consultants who move posts and to highly qualified consultants with considerable experience in Ireland or elsewhere taking up new posts.<\/p><p>  I have emphasised on a number of occasions that there are a number of factors that need to be addressed to support NCHD recruitment and more importantly retention. NCHDs must be respected, be treated with dignity and have a clear training and career path.  Given the need to address NCHDs working conditions, intensive work is underway in all hospitals, involving hospital management and the IMO, to pursue compliance with the European Working Time Directive on junior doctors&rsquo; working-hours.<\/p><p>  In July last year, I set up a working group chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, President of DCU, to carry out a strategic review of the medical training and career structure of NCHDs. I received the interim report of the Group in December which dealt primarily with training issues. The Group is now focusing on career structures and pathways following training and is due to report by the end of March on these issues. The final report of the Group is to be submitted to me by end June 2014. I am confident that this strategic review will, in future years, support the retention of sufficient numbers of doctors trained in Ireland within the system. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that there are some specialties, at consultant and NCHD level in which there are international shortages and which have been traditionally difficult to fill. Filling these posts represents a significant challenge given that there is a competitive market. There are also some hospitals to which it has historically been difficult to attract applicants, in particular smaller hospitals that have onerous rosters. The planned establishment of hospital groups should help to address this issue, as this will allow doctors to be appointed as group resources - instead of to just one hospital. Where posts are vacant and suitable candidates cannot be sourced, locums are retained or alternative arrangements are made to ensure service delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600071#WRT02800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":606,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600072#WRU00150"},{"type":"question","counter":607,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[6012\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020600072#WRU00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason he has not upgraded Letterkenny General Hospital, the seventh largest hospital in the State, from the status of general hospital up to regional hospital.

To achieve this, existing resources need to be re-shaped at local level, in line with similar mental health service initiatives already undertaken or planned for other areas of the country.<\/p><p>  At present, there are 35 acute psychiatric beds in Galway city, and 22 acute psychiatric beds in both Ballinasloe and Roscommon. This gives a total of 79 beds, serving a population of some 315,000. <i>A Vision for Change<\/i> recommends 50 beds for a catchment population of 300,000.  It is clear therefore, in line with policy and operational norms nationally, that the provision of 22 beds in both Ballinasloe and Roscommon means that the current overall stock of 79 in HSE West is too high in relative terms, allied to a corresponding under-development of community based mental health services.<\/p><p>    In the context of the service improvements now underway, a purpose built 50 bed acute mental health unit will be completed in Galway University Hospital in 2015, to replace the existing smaller unit. This Unit will consist of 35 general adult mental health beds, with the remaining 15 beds relating to psychiatry of later life, eating disorders, and mental health and intellectual disability. The acute unit in Roscommon will continue to provide 22 general adult mental health beds.<\/p><p>    The proposed re-organisation of services, following a detailed assessment by HSE West, will provide for a total of 57 general adult mental health beds. This will be a sufficient number of acute psychiatric beds in line with<i> A Vision for Change, <\/i>and will also allow the Executive to enhance community based services through re-deployment of some staff from acute services. Arising from an appropriate consultation process, staff from St. Brigid&rsquo;s will be redeployed on a phased basis to both community mental health teams in Ballinasloe, and to acute services in Galway and Roscommon. There will be no impact for current in-patients in Ballinasloe.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the decision taken by the HSE, based on expert recommendations, to enhance future mental health provision in the area is the best option, taking account of overall service needs and competing resource priorities.
