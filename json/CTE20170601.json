He is accompanied by Ms Georgina O'Mahony, deputy director of audit.  No apologies have been received.<\/p> <p>  The first business on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 25 May 2017.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  Matters arising from the minutes will be covered in what we will discuss shortly.<\/p> <p>  The next business is correspondence.  Nos. 525A and 545A are a Revenue briefing document and an opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish them.<\/p> <p>  Category B relates to correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-ups from previous meetings.  First in that group is No. 526B, correspondence dated 22 May from Bord na gCon providing a copy of its market strategy as requested during our engagement with it two weeks ago.  We will note and publish it.<\/p> <p>  Next is category C correspondence from an individual dated 19 May, which includes an excerpt from a transcript of the 13 April committee meeting inquiring whether it referred to him.  The clerk has already written to him confirming that it does.  The individual states that there were three breaches of the Data Protection Acts when the secretariat forwarded three unredacted pieces of correspondence from the individual concerned to the Arts Council, he does not accept that the matter is closed as stated by myself at the last meeting when this matter was dealt with and he has no record of receiving an apology from the clerk, the committee or me for the breach.<\/p> <p>  To clarify the matter, the committee wrote once to the Arts Council on 18 November 2016 and attached three items from the individual that were unredacted.  This was an oversight and the secretariat has tightened its systems to try to ensure that this does not happen again.  It has also provided an explanation to the Data Protection Commissioner regarding the error as part of her examination of the matter.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate that the reason we forwarded the individual's correspondence was to ensure that the issues as raised by the correspondence to us were put to the Arts Council.  However, we fully accept that the same objective could have been achieved by redacting the individual's name and personal details and that not doing so was regrettable.<\/p><p>Is it agreed that we write to the individual and apologise to him for the oversight in not redacting his personal details?  Agreed.<\/p><p> No. 519C is correspondence dated 19 May from John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, updating the committee on land purchases by Galway County Council.  He states he has requested the director of audit of the local government audit service to consider the matter and expects to hear from her in early Autumn on this issue.  Is it agreed to note this?  Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017060100002#A00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496304000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>We might also say that when it is done we would love to see it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017060100002#B00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1496304000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>We will write back, acknowledge it and ask for the outcome to be forwarded to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017060100002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1496304000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>This is a specific request on a specific issue.

The focus of the review is on cases where medical consultants set up companies through which they provided medical services.  Some consultants set up more than one company.  Revenue had concerns about the nature of the transactions between the consultants and the companies, and about the level of evidence available to support the commercial nature of those transactions.  By 30 June 2016, Revenue had initiated reviews of 763 cases and had closed 403.  Arising from the closed cases, Revenue had identified additional financial yields totalling &euro;48.7 million inclusive of tax due, interest and penalties.  A total of 70% of the closed audit cases had resulted in financial yield, at an average of &euro;173,000 per case.  A total of 29 of the closed cases had been published in the Revenue defaulters list up to mid 2016.<\/p><p> My examination looked at 37 of the closed cases in some detail.  In general, we found that Revenue had used a consistent approach while carrying out the reviews.  We recalculated the interest and penalty amounts charged by Revenue in ten of the 37 cases.  While the correct interest and penalties had been applied in eight of the cases, we found that there had been undercharging in two cases - the estimated undercharge amount was just over &euro;45,000.  This suggests that Revenue&rsquo;s process for ensuring the correct calculation of interest and penalties could be improved.<\/p><p> In 30 of the 37 cases we reviewed, the taxpayer involved had made a disclosure to Revenue indicating an amount of tax and interest due.  We would have expected to see that the Revenue auditor had calculated the liability due in the remaining seven cases, where no taxpayer disclosure had been made.  In four cases, the settlements agreed were based on calculations submitted by the taxpayer&rsquo;s advisers.  In the remaining three cases, calculations on the file were not signed or dated, so it was difficult to identify who had prepared them.  Surprisingly, the Revenue code of practice for audit did not require Revenue auditors to quantify the liability due in an audit case.  In two of the cases examined, negotiated settlements were agreed.  The terms of the settlements required adjustments to the subsequent company financial statements, but Revenue did not formally communicate the required adjustments to the taxpayers.  Revenue has agreed that, in future, where adjustments to subsequent financial statements are required, this will be communicated formally in the audit closure letter.  Revenue has also committed to following up on a sample of such cases to ensure that the relevant adjustments have been made.<\/p><p> Chapter 14 examines the operation of the research and development tax credit which was introduced to incentivise private company expenditure on in-house research and development undertaken in Ireland.  The credit can be claimed at a rate of 25% of qualifying expenditure, in addition to the standard 12.5% corporation tax deduction, that is, a total tax benefit of 37.5% offset against corporation tax liability.  Since 2009, Revenue has been paying out rebates in respect of the credit.  The cost of the credit has risen substantially since its inception, as shown in the diagram that members can see on the screen.  The cost was &euro;553 million in 2014, which was equivalent to 26% of the estimated business expenditure on research and development for that year.  The diagram illustrates that the offset of corporation tax receipts is part of the cost of the scheme, but also that the payable credits is quite a significant amount in 2014.<\/p><p> Our examination found that Revenue did not have readily available information relating to the cost and number of beneficiaries of the scheme, or about compliance interventions or case reviews it had carried out in respect of research and development tax credit.  As a result, information in these areas had to be extracted from individual files by Revenue for the purposes of the examination.  Revenue has stated that the introduction of its electronic case management system from July 2015 will allow it to more easily identify research and development credit cases.  Given the high cost of the scheme, however, Revenue needs to also develop the capacity to monitor the effectiveness of its compliance work in this area.<\/p><p> A Revenue intervention in respect of a research and development claim involves the application of two tests: a science test to ensure that the activities included in the claim are eligible for credit; and an accounting test to ensure that the associated costs have been properly tracked and accounted for.  The examination reviewed a sample of 17 intervention cases closed by Revenue in 2015 that involved an element of disallowed research and development tax credit.  The total research and development tax credit claims in those cases was &euro;46.4 million.  Following intervention review, Revenue identified a total of &euro;8.4 million for recovery, including tax, interest and penalties.  This was equivalent to 18% of the tax credit claimed.<\/p><p> A condition of obtaining any public service contract with a value of &euro;10,000 or more within any 12-month period is that the contractor is required to produce a tax clearance certificate.  Revenue uses experts to assist its own caseworkers when checking the scientific aspects of research and development tax credit cases.  In 2015, Revenue had paid five experts more than &euro;10,000 each but was unable to provide evidence that the tax status of the experts had been confirmed prior to processing payments.  In addition, Revenue had not requested copies of qualifications from individuals applying to be included on the panel of experts.  Revenue has agreed to incorporate this step as part of its procedures.<\/p><p> Chapter 16 deals with a specific issue that arose in 2015 in respect of the collection of tobacco excise, which yields revenue of approximately &euro;1 billion a year from a small number of tobacco producers.  The excise is collected through the application of stamps to tobacco packaging.  In October 2015, the Revenue Commissioners agreed to allow one tobacco manufacturer to defer part of its payment of tobacco stamp liability due in December 2015 until January 2016.  The amount deferred was equivalent to 11% of the company&rsquo;s liability for the year.  Members may wish to note that the cash amount is not disclosed in the report as it could lead to identification of the company.<\/p><p> The legislation underpinning tobacco excise has, since 1996, allowed Revenue, in exceptional circumstances, to permit a tobacco producer to defer payment for up to one month after the liability arises.  Revenue exercised this power for the first time in 2015, in the context of uncertainty around the introduction of new cigarette packaging legislation.  The examination found that Revenue had not established a written procedure for granting such a deferral nor was the deferral in 2015 formally documented.  I recommended that Revenue improve its documenting of high-value decisions and exceptional cases, and Revenue has agreed to implement the recommendations.<\/p><p> As part of the standard arrangements for the purchase of tobacco stamps, tobacco companies are required to have in place a bank guarantee or bond which can be called on by Revenue in the event of a default.  The company availing of the tobacco stamp liability deferral had an adequate guarantee in place at end of 2015 and so no tax was at risk when the payment was deferred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017060100002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496304000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I now call on Mr. Niall Cody to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017060100002#K00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496304000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to make a short opening statement.  As time is limited, I will focus on providing a brief overview of the three relevant chapters from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report of 2015.  At the outset, I should state my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality as provided for in section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported on Revenue&rsquo;s review of the tax affairs of medical consultants.  This is a good example of how compliance issues identified locally are extended nationally when necessary.  During a routine audit of a medical consultant as a high-wealth individual, certain risks were identified which led to an examination of transactions that took place at the time when the medical consultant incorporated.  A focus on the substance of these arrangements revealed no evidence of commercial reality in the structure and transactions involved.  The issues that Revenue challenged centred on the incorporation of a private practice with a view to securing an overall reduction of tax payable, through tax arbitrage between personal and corporate rates of tax.  This identified significant tax risk and, therefore, a targeted sectoral compliance programme was implemented nationally.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report provides some detail on how cases were selected.  As with any Revenue compliance programme, we used analytics to identify and select cases and then conducted the appropriate intervention in each case.<\/p><p>The tax risks that were identified included the purported disposal of goodwill by medical consultants to their controlled companies, cross-charges made between medical consultants and their controlled companies that lack any commercial basis, claiming personal expenses against professional income, insufficient or no supporting documentation to support large expenses claimed as tax deductions, excessive incorrect tax deductions claimed in relation to salaries-pensions of spouses and children, and deferring professional income to later tax periods, thus delaying taxation.  The project has not yet concluded.  As at March 2017, there were 279 open cases, 84 of which are under appeal.<\/p><p> By way of update to the figures from paragraph 13.9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, as at 30 April 2017 Revenue has initiated 825 cases, 552 of which were closed by that date, yielding &euro;61 million in tax, including future uplift, interest and penalties.  This yield relates to 276 consultants, 36 of whom have been published in the quarterly list of tax defaulters.<\/p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General made seven recommendations arising from his examination of this compliance programme.  Revenue has agreed to six of these, either in full or in part, and the committee has been provided with updates on their implementation.  Progress has also been made in relation to the recommendation which was not agreed and this is being considered again, as part of a review that is currently under way.<\/p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General also reviewed the operation by Revenue of the research and development tax credit.  The cost of this tax credit scheme is significant and in the period from 2004 to 2014 has increased from &euro;71 million to &euro;553 million.  In 2013, the economic and fiscal division of the Department of Finance reviewed the scheme, concluding that since inception the tax credit was a significant driver for increasing research and development spend and an overhaul of the research and development tax regime was not required.  Revenue interventions in respect of the research and development credit have increased in proportion to the risks associated with the increasing cost of the credit.  In 2011, there were 26 such interventions, yielding &euro;2.6 million.  In 2015, this rose to 178 interventions yielding &euro;13.5 million.<\/p><p> During his examination, the Comptroller and Auditor General sought detail on the number of research and development cases selected for intervention and the element of yield directly applicable to research and development.  This information was not readily available because Revenue records yield from interventions by reference to tax head, rather than by reference to the tax credit or relief giving rise to the yield.  In order to provide the detail requested, it was necessary to examine each individual case.  The Comptroller and Auditor General considered that the cost of the research and development scheme justified collating information on the compliance work carried out specifically on research and development and made a recommendation to that effect, which Revenue accepted.  In implementing this recommendation, Revenue has adopted a two-pronged approach.  First, the Revenue case management system provides better labelling functions to enable research and development interventions to be identified; and, second, changes to the corporation tax return will allow case workers to raise assessments in respect of research and development adjustments to claims, enabling identification of cases where research and development yield has been established.  This will facilitate compiling accurate statistics on clawback amounts in respect of research and development activities.  By way of an update, the research and development intervention figures for 2016 are a total 271 interventions, 93 of which yielded over &euro;13.3 million.<\/p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General made two additional recommendations in relation to the engagement of experts by Revenue.  Revenue agreed with both recommendations, and we have recently strengthened our procedures to ensure that tax clearance is confirmed before any expert is accepted for work and we have also taken the opportunity to improve our processes concerning the verification of experts' qualifications.<\/p><p> Since 20 May 2016, tobacco companies are only permitted to manufacture tobacco packs that conform to the second tobacco products directive as implemented in Ireland under Department of Health regulations.  In March 2016, the Department of Health published measures to implement the directive in Ireland.  Under the new regulations, any stock manufactured before 20 May 2016 could be released for sale up to and including 20 May 2017.<\/p><p> In late 2015, it was not clear when or how the new directive would be transposed into Irish law, and neither was it clear as to the format in which tobacco packs could be produced after 20 May 2016.  As a consequence, one tobacco company decided to build up sufficient stocks of stamped tobacco packs in the old format and hold the product in warehouses for release onto the market in 2016.  In discussions with the tobacco companies on transitional arrangements, Revenue agreed with one tobacco company that the deferral element of the additional-stock element of the tax stamp charge due for payment on 21 December 2015 could be extended to 28 January 2016.  Tobacco products tax legislation provides that in exceptional circumstances a longer period of deferment can be applied.  A deferral of one month was granted on the basis that the uncertainty around the introduction of the new directive represented a set of exceptional circumstances.  The tobacco company in question had a guarantee in place covering the amount of the tax stamp charge that was deferred and no tax was at risk as a result of the deferral.<\/p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General has made two recommendations arising from his examination of the deferral and Revenue has agreed with both.  We now have in place a robust procedure which sets out the various authorisations required for the use of powers relevant to tobacco products tax legislation and which ensures that approval decisions in that regard are fully documented.<\/p><p> I am happy to discuss any issues and answer any questions raised by the committee, subject of course, to taxpayer confidentiality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017060100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496304000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I call on the committee's lead speaker, Deputy Marc MacSharry, who will be followed by Deputy Peter Burke.

In the course of that audit, which was not setting out to uncover a strategy that was being applied across medical consultants, the auditor looked at the set of arrangements and then started to raise questions.  In the context of the Dublin region, generally what we do, if we come across an example of a set of arrangements, is to see if there are other examples of it.  That is the way we work.<\/p> <p>  The Dublin region became aware that a number of consultants were incorporating and setting up this type of structure, and from that we established the facts in certain cases.  We then had to get legal opinion because there were certain arrangements, even to the extent of whether a medical consultant could incorporate.  We sought a whole series of legal advice.  We got our legal advice, we got expert accounting advice on the treatment of goodwill and then, in the context of the Dublin region where most of the consultants who have significant private practice are based, the Dublin region started to expand the project.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Philip Brennan is head of the Dublin region and he wrote to the IMO and the IHCA about our concerns in this area.

The challenge we have is schemes range from implementation of the law and reliefs provided for as intended by the Oireachtas to moving somewhere along the continuum to look at the interaction of reliefs in a way that was probably never thought through when they were being implemented but is still legal.  A taxpayer is entitled to plan affairs to minimise that in accordance with law.  We also have what we would see as aggressive avoidance, which is legal, but we will challenge it.  There is a move from avoidance to deliberate default; that is moving out of legal schemes to what we consider as illegal schemes.  We cannot apply penalties unless there is deliberate default.  We cannot apply the penalty set out in the code of practice when we challenge avoidance; there are special rules around avoidance.

We can look at the facts of the case.  To date we have yields in 276 cases and published 36 cases.  One cannot be published on the tax defaulter list if engaged in legal tax planning.  What tends to happen in schemes like this is interaction between corporate tax rates, capital gains tax rates and income tax rates.  It is perfectly permissible to plan one's way through that scheme.  The problem in this project is the legitimate boundaries were forgotten about.  There is an idea of goodwill in the context of these cases.  In all the cases we have settled, the goodwill has been completely undone.  It is not a question of valuation and the use of expenses.  In the previous years we have reported a review of the contractors project.  One example of the cases we deal with are wages for children, or under age people, as there was in one of the cases I saw relating to work on a website as the child was proficient in information technology and the consultant was not.  That is what we must deal with.  When we deal with a scheme like this, it is constructed by professionals and part of the challenge comes from everybody lumping in everything, to use an agricultural term, in minimising the amount of tax paid.  The average settlement in these cases is considerably higher than the settlements we have in our risk-based project.  These are high-wealth individuals with significant income and significant underpayment of tax.  I know tax professionals are involved with this but there are also professional people involved.

This means it will take a further 20 or 25 days to clarify a response.  For example, someone applying for a tax clearance certificate will be under pressure.  Heretofore, if someone marginally missed a VAT or PAYE deadline or an issue arose that he or she was not aware of, he or she was able to contact a local tax office by telephone and have the matter resolved instantly.

The electronic relevant contract tax, eRCT, system, is obviously exceptional in ensuring compliance but has caused concerns among small businesses.  I will cite the example of person who does manual labour and office administration and, for argument's stake, it transpires when he is doing a VAT return for the period from January to April that he missed a payment notification for an administrative reason.  This may be because he paid someone on a Friday night and made a genuine administrative mistake.  This generally arises when the person is doing their VAT returns for a four month VAT period.  In such cases, the person will be subject to penalties for missing the deadline.  These penalties are onerous for small businesses.  Larger companies have large numbers of staff, departments and resources to ensure procedures are followed correctly.  Is it possible to provide some leeway, possibly until 23 May, for those who are doing the January to April VAT return?  The critical issue is that if the business self-corrects within the period in which the VAT return is live and due, this should be acknowledged in some form.  I know this will be difficult for the system but the current system is very onerous for small businesses paying small amounts of tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017060100002#P01800","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496304000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>The RCT system is a really important tool to ensure compliance in the construction sector.

All of these cases a couple of times a year are risk-ranked based on all the information we have on our system, third party information and the rest.<\/p><p>We are also actively engaged in segmenting our case base.  We are trying to focus on cases below our large cases division because these people are high-wealth individuals who have opportunities.  Deputy Peter Burke spoke of smaller businesses which have relatively limited scope for sophisticated tax arbitrage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017060100002#R03800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496304000,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Can Mr. Cody explain the word \"arbitrage\" for our viewers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017060100002#S00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496304000,"counter":244,"content":"<p>It is about looking at the different tax rates on income versus capital gains and corporation tax and engaging in tax planning to minimise the tax paid while maximising the benefits.  We have identified the national case base below the level of large cases division.  A dedicated resource is involved in profiling the cases because the challenge is to focus on the non-compliant while not disrupting the compliant taxpayer.  Two years ago, I was asked why we were not on top of things and I explained that we were like the people working against doping in sport.  If we come across something that is serious we can go back to it  We can go back four years in an ordinary case but longer where there are serious evasions.  It is a bit like the information on offshore accounts.  We will find people, even if we do not do so immediately, because our data matching will improve.<\/p> <p>  We are trying to improve our knowledge of the sectors which can do this type of stuff.  Anybody who moves beyond planning and becomes engaged in abusive practice is better off coming to us before we come to them.  In the chapter of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on medical consultants it shows how, in the original cases at which we looked, the taxpayers did not avail of the opportunity for a disclosure.  They and their advisers had felt that what they were doing was unchallengeable.  I was in Philip Brennan's office at an early stage when it was not clear that we would win these cases.  He happened to have a letter from one of the agents on his desk, with a comprehensive rebuttal of everything we were trying to do.  There was an element in the letter of a tone which meant \"the cheek of ye, challenging the schemes we have set out\" but we follow these things through to the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017060100002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1496304000,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Tax planning must have started somewhere.

Every year, we get Ipsos MRBI to carry out an independent survey of illegal tobacco products.  We have been doing this since 2009.  We publish the report and I have it here.  I can give the Deputy a copy of it.  The methodology has been the same since it started.  It gives us a view of the position.  In 2016, the estimated level of illegal tobacco trade in the State was 10% of the market.  The level of legal, non-Irish duty paid packs which people get abroad and bring back legally is 8%.  That means 18% of the market is not going through the tobacco stamp process.  To put it in context, in 2015, the illegal market was 12%; in 2014, it was 11%; in 2013, it was 12%; and in 2009, the estimate is that it was 16%.  We get this done independently every year.  It is one of the few areas where we take that type of tax gap approach to try to look at it independently.  Other bodies engage in and publish research and they tend to have a higher figure.  Those research areas are supported by the tobacco industry.  I have no doubt that in some cases it is in the tobacco industry's interest to have a higher figure than a lower one to deal with the argument about whether excise rates should be increased.  In this committee I have been asked about our satisfaction with the estimates on the tobacco market and the increase.  I said that a 50 cent increase now is equivalent to previous 10 cent increases.

All members and witnesses can understand and appreciate how important the R&amp;D tax credit is in terms of supporting small businesses across Ireland, be they in manufacturing, wholesale or communications, and how the 37.5% tax relief helps fund innovation.  The witness also referred to the 2013 review which said the tax credit plays an important role in assisting Ireland in meeting its 2020 target for R&amp;D expenditure.  The significant importance of R&amp;D investment decisions was mentioned.  The tax credit is an important element of Ireland's corporation tax regime in terms of attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland.  The success of the scheme is evident.  As Mr. Cody said, it has grown from &euro;71 million to &euro;500 million in over a decade.<\/p> <p>  In terms of statistics, the Revenue report, An Analysis of 2015 Corporation Tax Returns and 2016 Payments, published in April 2017, shows that the number of companies claiming the R&amp;D tax credit fell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017060100002#W01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496304000,"counter":350,"content":"<p>There is a slight reduction in-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017060100002#W01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1496304000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Deputy Connolly asked the witness about that issue.

The number of companies claiming the credit grew steadily through to 2013, when 1,576 companies did so at a cost of &euro;421 million.

When I look at the figure for 2014, the only year for which we have information available, in recent years, 2013 and 2014, the balance of this scheme has changed substantially in that I would estimate, looking at that chart, 60% of that &euro;553 million is now through repayments and only 40% is by way of tax forgone.  I would have said that in the past two years, that is a dramatic shift in the operation of this scheme and the nature of the claimants.<\/p> <p>  To give an example, with the 1,600 cases in 2014 worth &euro;553 million, the average was &euro;345,000 per case.  Some 40% of that was dealt with by way of tax forgone, an average of &euro;138,000.  The tax repayments are &euro;207,000.  Mr. Cody has just given us figures for 2015.  He said there were only 1,534 cases.  It has now gone up &euro;150 million to &euro;708 million in that year, so the average amount is &euro;461,000.  I am assuming it is still around 60%.

In light of Brexit and homegrown industries needing to increase their tax credits, the officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should ask the Department of Finance whenever it is looking at this scheme to give at least equal consideration to homegrown industry.<\/p> <p>  Paragraph 14.9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report places the emphasis on foreign multinational companies.  Foreign multinational companies account for a substantial amount of the income we covered earlier.  Can they get the value of the 25% and can they get the value of the 12.5% on top of that, notwithstanding their effective tax rate might be 2%, 3% or 4%?  Can they get the 37.5% value of this?  An Irish company paying 12.5% gets a write-off of that tax forgone at 12.5% and gets 25% on top of that, which is 37.5%.  We all know the effective rate.  I am not talking about the marginal rate.

There are published figures that suggest that.  I think it is set out at the start of our corporation tax review.  The main statutory CT rate in Ireland is 12.5% with the effective tax rate for 2015 provisionally calculated at 9.8%.  This represents a marginal increase on the rate of 9.7% estimated for 2014.  Due to the nature of various tax reliefs and credits, an effective rate of tax will always be lower than a statutory rate.  The paper that is based on is a technical paper published by the Department of Finance in 2014 which looks at the effective tax rate for multinationals and the rest of the corporations.

I will also touch on the work being done in phase 2 to tackle the rising cost of employers' and public liability insurance.  I also propose to say a few words about the Setanta judgment issued last week.  <\/p> <p>  I am very conscious of the need to implement the recommendations made in the report of the cost of insurance working group on motor insurance in line with the deadlines set in the action plan.  I recognise the importance of this issue for society as a whole as there is virtually nobody who has been left unaffected by the surge in insurance premiums in the past two years.  I also accept that while CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, the figures only represent a broad average and there are many who are still seeing increases in the cost of their policies.  I take the view that while the greater stability in pricing is good, premiums are still at a very high level and insurance cover continues to be prohibitively expensive for many.  That said, both the report on the cost of motor insurance and the committee's report recognise that, unfortunately, there is no single policy or legislative silver bullet to immediately stem or reverse rises in premium costs.  However, I firmly believe implementation of the report on the cost of motor insurance will make a difference in the pricing of insurance policies in the next 18 months.  I also believe the Setanta judgment, in finding that the Motors Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, is not liable to meet the cost of third party claims, removes a major cause of uncertainty for the industry which I expect to be reflected in pricing in the short to medium term.<\/p> <p>  Since I was last before the committee in February, a lot of work has taken place to implement the report of the working group on the cost of motor insurance.  It includes the production of its first quarterly report on the progress of implementation of the action plan.  The report provides a comprehensive update on progress made to date and reasons for the delays in the few instances where they have occurred.  Since publication of the report the advisory committee on small public service vehicles has met Insurance Ireland and I have been informed that a protocol for the insurance industry to promote compliance with road safety legislation should be finalised in the next few weeks.  Establishing a reliable set of data and commencing a review of the impact of legal and other fees on personal injury awards is proving to be a more complex task.  However, work is ongoing and progress is being made.<\/p> <p>  I would like to give the committee a more detailed overview of some of the key achievements in the first quarter.  One of the key findings made in the report concerns the need to enhance transparency and facilitate the use of data sharing and collection to the level seen in other jurisdictions.  The Department of Finance established a subgroup at the beginning of the year to implement the recommendations surrounding data issues.  The group has met ten times to date and in the first quarter issued an initial data template to the insurance industry for completion.  The returns are expected in the coming days.  Once received, they will be analysed by the Department and published before the end of June.  The Department will continue to build on and publish a similar update each quarter until the establishment of the national claims information database.  The group is also working on the development of legislation to provide for the database, while the Central Bank has led a number of workshop sessions to develop the precise specifications for it.  The Department has begun drafting the heads of a Bill to provide for the establishment of the database.  Detailed and considered work is already well under way.<\/p> <p>  Another core recommendation concerns the establishment of a personal injuries commission to investigate and make recommendations based on processes in other jurisdictions which could enhance the claims process in Ireland.  The personal injuries commission was established in January, with the former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, as chairman.  The first meeting of the commission was held on 10 February.  Monthly meetings have since taken place and will continue to take place for the duration of the commission which is on target to deliver by the end of the year its first report in which it will examine the assessment of soft tissue injury having regard to international experience, its diagnosis and treatment, standardised medical reporting and the use of objective tests.  <\/p> <p>  A number of other actions have also been completed.  For example, I recently attended Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s newly established consumer and business forum which will be of benefit in providing for stronger engagement between stakeholders.  Additionally, reviews have commenced of the impact of the changes to court jurisdictional limits and the setting of the discount rate for personal injury lump sum awards.  <\/p> <p>  As the committee can see, some very important work is under way to address the core issues examined by the working group on the cost of insurance.  I will be happy to take questions on any of these issues.<\/p> <p>  A large number of actions are due to be completed by the end of this quarter.  The second quarterly update will be published by the Department in July and provide details of ongoing implementation.  I hope to be in a position to update the committee on the progress on these actions at the appropriate time.<\/p> <p>  Members may be aware that the 2017 report of the National Competitiveness Council on the cost of doing business in Ireland which has just been published acknowledges the role of the working group on the cost of insurance in maintaining and enhancing cost competitiveness for Irish businesses.  In addition to the work on implementation of the report on the cost of motor insurance, the working group has continued to meet to examine ways to tackle the rising cost of insurance for businesses, particularly public and employers' liability insurance.  It has met a range of stakeholders in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  The following broad themes have emerged from our work to date.  The cost of public liability insurance seems to be of greater concern to most of the groups to which we talked.  There is an increasing trend towards taking on a greater excess to keep premiums down.  Related to this is an increase in the number of businesses self-insuring.  There is a lack of competition in the market for particular businesses or parts of their business and frustration with inconsistency in awards.  There are huge legal and business costs associated with challenging claims through the courts process.  Companies not being given sufficient credit for improving health and safety standards and there is suspicion of claims harvesting among businesses. The Statute of Limitations is posing concerns in being able to make an adequate defence of a case.  Insurers are settling without proper notification or consultation with policy holders.  Some are looking for legislative limits in the book of quantum.  Some businesses believe they are victims of fraudulent and exaggerated claims.  There is also the feeling the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board should be developed further.  The working group is considering these matters and will consider what recommendations it can make to address them.  It must be recognised, however, that there are some very complex legal and constitutional issues which need to be addressed if we are to make progress on these points to the satisfaction of the business sector.<\/p> <p>  My current intention is to publish an addendum to the report on the cost motor insurance to cover the cost of employers' and public liability insurance.  However, I am reviewing this, as there might be additional updates we might also want to introduce on the report on the cost of motor insurance where there are strong linkages with issues related to the cost of employers' liability public liability insurance.  A final report may not be ready until September.  However, I hope to be able to provide some clarity in July on potential new measures.  When I am clearer on our planned direction of travel, I will be happy to appear before the committee to explain our thinking.<\/p> <p>  I would like to say a few words about the recent Setanta judgment.  While not completely unexpected, there was still some surprise that the Supreme Court overturned the decision previously upheld by the High Court and the Court of Appeal.  The impact of the Supreme Court's decision is that third party claimants will be compensated by the Insurance Compensation Fund for only 65% of the claim or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lower.  Claimants will also be entitled to a further sum arising from the Setanta liquidation but the current indications are that it is unlikely to be sufficient to cover all of the 35% gap.  <\/p> <p>  As to when payments can be expected to commence, it should be noted that officials of the Department of Finance have had discussions with the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice and the State Claims Agency and indicated that they have plans in place to deal with this issue.  Our understanding is both agencies are working with the liquidator to plan the process of validation and the presentation of claims.  Once the liquidator has the claims ready for examination, the State Claims Agency will step in to commence the validation process.<\/p><p>The State Claims Agency has assured the Department that it will act swiftly so that there will be no unnecessary delay caused by this validation process.  I hope to have greater clarity on the timescale shortly.<\/p><p> While the most recent CSO figures suggest that motor premium levels have stabilised to some degree, the Government is not taking this position for granted and also recognises that motor insurance premiums are still too high.  The implementation of all the report's recommendations between now and the end of 2018 is critical to introducing fairer premiums for consumers and businesses.<\/p><p> There is also a recognition of the need to find appropriate solutions to address the employer liability and public liability issues because of the difficulties they are causing for the business community, particularly SMEs.  I am determined to ensure that this important work progresses at a pace and that the implementation deadlines relating to it are met.  I am happy to take any questions or to provide clarifications on the work of the cost of insurance working group and on Setanta in order to assist the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017060100002#B00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimhe an Aire St&aacute;it roimh an coiste.

Motorists are being hit with large increases every week.  I will give the example of two people in offices on the same corridor as Sinn F&eacute;in Members.  One of those people, who has ten years of no-claims driving, was quoted &euro;2,500 for motor insurance.

The key important measures, including establishment of the personal injuries commission and commencement of work on the national claims information database, which are important in the context of reform the industry, are making good progress.  In regard to the three delayed measures, one has been recently completed and another is due to be completed shortly.  As for the final measure, as already explained, there are difficulties around getting the data because of changes happening in regard to the courts.  This is a complex task.  The update in the quarterly report indicates clearly that it is not a simple task.  In regard to the national claims information database, ten meetings had to take place to get the data set accurate in terms of what we were looking for from the insurance entities.  We needed to ensure the database is as comprehensive as possible.  It is a big piece of work.  These are not simple measures that can be put in place overnight.  It must be recognised that a number of actions are happening and being progressed at the same time.  I would have liked to have seen a green light for all ten actions in the first quarterly report but unfortunately, in respect of three of them the light is yellow.  Nevertheless, they are not the most significant actions.  We are making progress on those measures.<\/p> <p>  The majority of actions under the action plan will be completed this year.  In terms of the second quarter, we are making good progress.  I will be happy to update the committee on that progress when the second quarterly report is published.  In regard to recommendation No. 1, Insurance Ireland has been engaging with the Department of Finance on the putting in place of the protocol to communicate to customers the reasons for large increases in motor premiums.  The output of this work will form the basis of a protocol.  It will then be the responsibility of each insurer to communicate the details contained in the protocol to their customers.  Insurance Ireland has stated that the interaction between the customer-facing systems and the underwriting systems is complex and will require significant IT infrastructural change.  That said, the industry is aware that there is a need to improve communication channels.  Insurance Ireland has informed Department of Finance officials that its implementation committee will have completed a draft protocol for review by the Department of Finance no later than mid-June.  Included in this protocol will be access to a number of channels that will allow customers not only to understand how a premium is calculated but also what may give rise to an increase in a previous policy.  We have previously discussed what percentage increase would give rise to this process.

The Minister of State has refused to say that the Government wants everybody to get 100% of outstanding claims.  I wish to place on record some details from a solicitor's letter which has come into my possession.  The letter was issued to a Setanta claimant following the judgment last week.  The solicitor wrote that he had news concerning the claimant's case and that, unfortunately, that news was not good.  He explains the judgment and says that the consequences would not be good for the claimant, that the ICF would only pay 65% of the compensation or award for the claimant's personal injury, loss or damage and 35% of the legal costs, court duties, medical, expert report and barrister's fees.  The solicitor indicates that the balance of 35% of the claimant's compensation and legal costs will not be paid by the ICF.  It is also indicated that there might be some small payment by the liquidators of Setanta Insurance in Malta but that, in the solicitor's view, this will not be significant.  The solicitor said that it might be possible to pursue the driver-policyholder for the 35% shortfall but that there would be costs involved in doing so and that these would have to be paid by the claimant.  His letter indicates that it might not be cost-efficient to take this course.  The solicitor goes on to say that it is doubtful that all or most of the remaining 35% could be recovered and that there would be cost implications involved.<\/p><p> The solicitor proceeds to state that as there was uncertainty as to who was going to be responsible, his firm had to join the MIBI to the action and that, from the date of the letter, the latter had no responsibility and that its legal costs would have to be paid.  He also states that the MIBI's costs would have to come out of the 65% and that there would be a shortfall in the legal costs and outlay occurred - 35% plus all the solicitor's work completed in joining the MIBI to the proceedings.  He further states that there might be medical expenses and other items of expenditure which might have been incurred on the client's behalf and which would have to be paid and that, therefore, the net compensation the claimant would receive after the deductions outlined would be less than 65% but that it was too soon to say by how much.  The solicitor finally states that the situation was a total mess caused by the insolvency of Setanta, that it would take time for all the issues to be resolved and that it was unclear when the ICF administration scheme would come into play and what would need to be done at that point.<\/p><p> People have been hung out to dry.  That is the reality.  There are over 1,600 claimants who still do not know where they stand and the Minister of State has refused to take the opportunity to give them any comfort to the effect that they will not be out of pocket.  We have people who could be held personally liable in respect of any shortfall that arises from a claim.  Will the Minister of State not sit down with the insurance industry and the liquidator in order to get a proper handle on this?  Will he seek the support of and a commitment from the industry - he may find those involved to be more willing than he might imagine - in the context of ensuring that the shortfall will be met and that people's costs will be fully covered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017060100002#D01600","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":552,"content":"<p>Obviously, I cannot speak to an individual claimant in respect of his or her position with his or her solicitor or comment on the advice he or she is receiving.

We are still in the early stages of working through this.  We have rough numbers as to the first tranches that will come through.  It is not yet clear what the liquidation of Setanta will cover for policyholders in the context of the 35% that needs to be made up and what this will mean for individuals, including the person to whom the Deputy refers.  We do not know.  Even if the Government was to think about stepping in to fill the gap, there is a difficulty regarding how this might affect priority in respect of the liquidation of Setanta.  We have difficulties in terms of what we can do.  In so far as what the insurance industry might be willing to do, again, matters are at a very early stage.  We need to find out exactly what the position might be in terms of how we proceed with realising the funds from the ICF for claimants.

One of the big things we can do is remove the incentive for fraud.  I am referring to the idea that a claimant can get a higher claim paid out more quickly in Ireland in terms of a settlement being made.  A number of measures work across this area.  One is the personal injuries commission to ensure that we are not outliers when it comes to other European jurisdictions in terms of the amounts being given for awards.  The commission will report by the end of the year.  The work the commission is currently doing involves this international benchmarking exercise.<\/p> <p>  Another thing we need to do is reform the book of quantum.  This derives from another action under the report.  The idea is to bring about more granularity to it and to publish it in conjunction with the work of the personal injuries commission.  At present, the book of quantum essentially is just a summation of awards that have been given.  People use it as a target or guide but really they should not do so.  If we can combine a revised book of quantum with more granularity along with the work of the personal injuries commission, then we should have a template for the awards that should be made.<\/p> <p>  Work is already being progressed in discussing with the Judiciary how it could take a more of an active role in the publication of this work, just as does the Judiciary in the UK.  I am in favour of this.  The idea is there might be more buy-in from the Judiciary into the information in the reporting work.<\/p> <p>  Another thing we need to do is to strengthen the funnel into the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  The heads of the Bill to improve the powers of the board will come by the end of this month.  We know the percentages.  Of the claims taken, some 20% get resolved in the PIAB, 10% are settled in the courts and 70% are settled elsewhere.  We do not want to see people fast-tracking through the PIAB to try to get a better deal.  We do not want people intentionally missing medical cases such that they fall out of the PIAB automatically and can then go to court.  Then, when they go to court, they introduce new evidence.  We are looking to change all these things.  We are also looking to bring in pre-action protocols.  This would be another step to reduce the costs and shorten the process.  We are also looking at the possibility of an appeals mechanism for the PIAB.<\/p> <p>  All these things should make the process shorter, thus reducing the costs and, in particular, the need for additional costs to arise in the process.  It should give greater certainty to the types of awards.  It should also remove the inventive for fraudulent behaviour.<\/p> <p>  A number of other initiatives relating to fraud are referenced in the report.  We are trying to build a database around fraudulent behaviour.  This work is under a longer-term time horizon in terms of the action for completion next year.  There are sensitivities around data protection and liability issues as well.  We are looking at a particular recommendation that Deputy Pearse Doherty has raised several times.  It relates to working with the insurance industry and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the creation of a dedicated unit within the Garda to tackle insurance fraud.  The idea is that it could have the potential to be funded by the insurance industry, which is what happens in the UK.  Work on that project is ongoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017060100002#F00900","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister of State on keeping to his word and coming before the committee on a quarterly basis.  It is a useful exercise in terms of evaluating where we are.  However, it does not fill me with confidence.  It appears to me that the tail is wagging the dog in the context of the insurance industry.  The insurance companies continue to laugh at us.  It is obvious that it appears to them that they got away with it.  We had our consultation and examination but things go on with business as usual.  That is the bottom line in evaluating all of this.<\/p> <p>  It concerns me that the Minister of State appears to be congratulating us on the stabilisation of the market.  Prices went to extortionate levels such that saying we have stabilised at that level is an abject failure and it shows a complete market failure.  We need to look at reversal.  In the case of all the people I have talked to who have received insurance premiums of late, the amounts have increased.  I do not know of one person who has had an insurance premium reduced.  In the light of all the work we did last year, I am seriously concerned that we are not having any impact.  I am not referring to stabilisation but reversal.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about the setting up of fora.  I realise what the Minister of State is trying to achieve but it almost amounts to making things more obscure.  Certainly, it is not making things more transparent.  The ethos running through the insurance report we produced was that things should be more transparent and that people could see what was happening.<\/p> <p>  Has the Minister of State given serious consideration to examining properly the different models?  Has he considered running what would almost be a parallel system?  Has he given serious thought into the different models or to introducing a State-backed rival offer of competition?  New Zealand has a no-fault model with a compulsory scheme for personal injuries.  Under the Australian model, compulsory third-party insurance is included in the vehicle registration.  Under the model in Quebec, the public insurer manages the insurance regime for bodily injuries only.  That is my first question.  I believe we have given enough time to the insurance companies to show some kind of gesture in reducing the rates, but they have failed to do that thus far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017060100002#F01000","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Conway-Walsh.  We all have anecdotes.  I have an anecdote of a person whose premium went from &euro;1,500 to &euro;1,060 one month ago.  The anecdotes go in either direction.  It is important to try to work off the data.  It was the data from the Central Statistics Office that gave us a concrete indication of exactly what we were hearing from our constituents last year and the year before.<\/p> <p>  Stabilisation is not failure; stabilisation is progress.  We need to stabilise the market first before we can start to drive down premiums to a fairer level.  We are trying to move away from the super-cycles that we have seen in the past under which people were paying low premiums and getting cheap car insurance but at levels that were unsustainable for those companies and for the industry as a whole.  Now, we have seen levels rocket back in the other direction but we do not want that either.<\/p> <p>  Costs have stabilised.  They are down around 6% since last July.  That is not good enough.  This is only the beginning of our work.  These actions and this work began some time before Christmas.  It is positive that we are starting to see results.  Not all of this progress is because of the cost of insurance working group &ndash; let us be clear.  The increase in rates by the Federal Reserve System in the United States has had an impact on the bottom line for some of these companies in terms of the investment returns they are making.  That is helping in terms of their profitability.  Several factors are contributing to this.<\/p> <p>  Senator Conway-Walsh made the characterisation of the tail wagging the dog.  I want to be clear on this.  To be fair to the insurance industry, there has been a change in attitude since the members of this committee began their work on the costs of insurance and since those of us in government began our work in this area.  The public engagements not only in this committee but in the media too have been helpful.<\/p><p>We are trying to work with the industry, which is now responsible for a number of the actions in the report.  The Department takes the lead ownership but we are working with them to get the actions completed.  As they are completed, it will mean substantial reform of the motor insurance sector.  This is very important.<\/p><p> The Senator spoke of the forum.  We have had our first meeting.  It brought some key actors together into a room for the first time and it was important to do that.  We will expand that forum to more participants.<\/p><p> I must reject the idea about things becoming more opaque and about there being no transparency.  Consider what we are doing with the quarterly reporting.  We update members in regard to the specific actions completed in that quarter and we update on progress under the recommendations.  This is transparency that we really have not seen before.  There is a person responsible for implementing that action and the person for overseeing the implementation of the action.  Those reports come back, on a regular basis, to me and my committee, which I chair.  We then present them to this committee on a quarterly basis.  Even in advance of the first quarterly report, I presented an interim report to the committee to show that work had already commenced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017060100002#F01100","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":573,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is doing good work on this but the bottom line is the actions are not reducing or impacting the higher rates of insurance-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017060100002#G00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":574,"content":"<p>We cannot do that immediately.

The committee report indicates that we are an outlier when it comes to the size of awards being given for whiplash and other soft tissue injury claims.

The work being done by the commission is to establish the typical level of award for different types of claims abroad to help better inform the level of awards granted here.  It will also bring about more granularity, such as with the grading of whiplash.

It is all welcome analysis but we still have the situation where expensive claims are still happening, as Senator Paddy Burke said.  There is an element of fraud in that and equally there is an element of road safety.  When this was discussed in the Seanad previously, it was stated that road safety is not part of the Minister of State's remit but ultimately, the fewer severe crashes there are the fewer payouts there will be.  There will always be accidents but we hope that there will be fewer and fewer.  The numbers in the Garda traffic corps have not been increased or been maintained in the way they had been previously.  One can drive at the speed limit on any motorway in the country and other cars will still be flying past.<\/p> <p>  The use of technology, telemetry and tracking of vehicles exists and is probably very close to being commercially available or operationally viable.  Is there emphasis on, or is there anything the Minister of State can do, to effectively reduce the number of crashes and the type of injuries that are being created?  I am not trying to defend the insurance industry at all but clearly the more incidents and payouts there are, the more the rest of the 92% who are not making claims are paying for it.

The cost of insurance working group is looking at the cost of insurance and it prioritised motor in the first instance.  It is not for want of being able to control all the other aspects around motor driving, but it just does not come under the remit.

Last year, I spoke at a conference on the future of insurance which examined where telematics might be going.  It was suggested that in a future of driverless cars and people having Fitbit indicators on their arms, when two vehicles collide it will be possible to know precisely what speed they were going, what the thread count on their tyres was, whose heart rate was going faster and whose pupils were dilated.  Computers will be able to make decisions on claims and liability on the basis of such information.  The huge changes that are going to happen in many industries, including the automotive industry, will have an effect on insurance and other aspects of this matter.  If that means fewer accidents and fewer people being impacted on the roads, it will benefit everyone.  There is a strong case for the introduction of speed cameras on motorways, as has been done in the Dublin Port tunnel, to make sure people are not driving too fast.  I do not think An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will ever have the resources to watch every piece of road at every point in the day.  Changes can be made in that regard.

I commend the Minister of State and his officials on the work they are doing.  I commend all the groups and stakeholders that are contributing to the analysis of the insurance industry and taking the steps that are necessary to bring about the changes all of us want.  Our ultimate aim is to see a reduction in part of the market, where possible.  We are in a sort of bubble as we discuss that here.  Our understanding of where this is going must relate back to the reality of life for some people.  When I met a group of people recently to discuss this issue, the taxi drivers at the airport pointed out that the general charge from the airport to town is between &euro;20 and &euro;25.  They were measuring that against the massive increases in their insurance premiums they have experienced.<\/p> <p>  I will mention one common denominator.  The monthly cost of insurance, which started at &euro;100 a few years ago, increased to &euro;159 and then to &euro;200.  It is now &euro;239 per month.  That is the way they measured it.  These ongoing increases do not seem to be stopping.  One taxi business at that location recently received a quote of &euro;20,000 for a premium.  Given that the insurance companies and Insurance Ireland have a great deal of knowledge about the work that is being undertaken, one would imagine they would start to understand that the Government, the Minister of State and this committee are serious about this matter.  They should almost be ahead of the Minister of State in delivering the type of response that is required.  One would imagine that when the taxi drivers who have experienced these massive year-on-year increases ask the insurance companies from which they buy insurance products why the price of those products has increased so substantially, it should not be impossible for the companies - even without the Minister of State's work - to give the drivers a breakdown of the relevant data.  Why is it so impossible for them to provide this information?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017060100002#L01000","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I would like to say a couple of things in response to that.  While the Government cannot interfere in the pricing of premiums, it cannot consider it acceptable for Insurance Ireland or anyone in the industry to look to set a signal around pricing because that would feed into the type of price-fixing or price-signalling behaviour about which people have raised fears.  We have to understand that the insurance industry cannot co-operate by providing certain details about how it determines premiums or how it weighs a particular risk into a policy because that might be perceived as untoward behaviour.  As we know, the taxi industry has suffered significantly as a result of the increase in premiums.  Driving a taxi is a riskier form of driving from the point of view of the insurance companies because of the greater frequency of trips being done.  If a taxi is successful, it is constantly in motion on the roads.  As it is carrying passengers for most of that time, it has other liabilities that the average driver would not have.  That would be reflected in the pricing of premiums.<\/p> <p>  A meeting of the body responsible for representing small business vehicles in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was due for completion in the first quarter of this year, but was delayed.  That meeting, which has now taken place, marks the beginning of the progress that is needed in this area to get a better understanding of what can be done to make the situation better for taxi drivers and other people who use small vehicles for business functions.  It is hoped that the general trend towards stabilisation in motor insurance premiums that we have seen over the past five months will lead to lower premiums, which would be of benefit to the taxi industry.<\/p><p>It is to be hoped that lower premiums will be of benefit to the taxi industry.

It states that Ireland remains a relatively high-cost location and that already the return to sustained levels of growth has resulted in a series of upward cost pressures.  It goes on to highlight the importance of prioritising policies and actions that are within Ireland's control to enhance cost competitiveness.  Insurance falls into that category.  It is affecting business.  I know from personal experience that it is causing the amount of the premium to be passed on to the consumer.

I have received numerous complaints from those in the SME sector who find it extremely difficult to bear the cost of the whole procurement process and they also face stiff competition from companies that are much bigger than them.  As a result of that many smaller companies throughout the regions are facing the possibility of losing staff due to having to downsize because they have lost a particular portion of Government business.  In some cases where small businesses have concentrated on getting Government business, they will be put out of business because they failed in some way in the course of the procurement process.  Can the Minister of State bring about appropriate changes in the legislation, or in how the procurement process works, to give some sort of local advantage to the SME sector, whether it be by increasing the threshold or giving some preference, by way of acknowledgement for the services that the sector has given over the years, on a particular tender where that tender is competitive so that those in the sector will not lose out in terms of turnover or performance to the bigger companies?  This issue runs across the cleaning sector.  I discussed it with those who provide Rentokil services and they had the same difficulty.  I also discussed it with a drain cleaning services company in Carlow.  What has been happening is that the bigger turnover of the bigger company was winning the contract and eventually, at a far reduced rate and without much margin, the original contractor was being asked to do the job by the larger company.  There are shortcomings in the way we approach the whole procurement issue.  I would like to see it addressed to give an advantage to the SME sector without the process  losing out and with us still getting value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017060100002#N00100","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":695,"content":"<p>This is a matter that the Chairman has consistently raised during the six years that I have been a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and for the three years I served on the Committee of Public Accounts, when he was Chairman of it, during which time we examined the issue in detail.  Having now had responsibility for a year for the Office of Government Procurement, what we have been trying to do is to refocus the office in a few ways.  Certainly, this item of reform in terms of the &euro;12 billion plus that is spent annually by the Government on procuring goods and services involves a huge budget.  We need to bring together our expertise into a central location and we need to bring transparency and accountability to the way that goods and services are being procured by Government.<\/p><p>That was a big piece of work that has been under way for a number of years.  It happened at the beginning of the recession, and began in 2010.  It led to the new office being set up in the past couple of years.  The focus has always been on saving money for the taxpayer and delivering value for money.  Now we are very much in a space of ensuring that in meeting those objectives we do not undermine the ability of Irish SMEs to win tenders for Government business while recognising that we are in a Single Market.  Whenever we introduce a protocol or bring a regulation into effect we try to ensure we do it in a way that does not undermine Irish companies and does not open us to a legal challenge from other entities in Europe, for example.  In that, the Single Market is of benefit to us because statistics show that Irish companies have won more in other European jurisdictions than other European companies have won in Ireland.  We will discuss this matter a bit later.<\/p><p> In the next couple of weeks I shall announce a couple of initiatives around SMEs in particular.  For the past year I have chaired quarterly meetings of our advisory group on small and medium-sized enterprises on which all of the main bodies are represented, including the Small Firms Association, the Construction Industry Federation and IBEC.  We have tried to improve the process whereby an SME can tender with a view to reducing the red tape involved but also getting better understanding out into the market when the Government is about to go to tender.  If a tender framework is about to be put in place then businesses in the industry will be notified.  They will be asked to submit their views on the criteria to be applied and how they might work.  A number of steps will be taken before a framework is opened up and put in place.<\/p><p> The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, has four regional locations and we have started to take the office into constituencies.  Deputies and Senators are very much in contact with local businesses and small businesses.  We invite them along to open seminars to explain what the OGP seeks to achieve and, likewise, they can give feedback on what we do.  Whenever one reforms something and makes a change one must review to check whether one has achieved one's aim and made an impact or if the initiative needs to be reformed even further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017060100002#N00200","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":697,"content":"<p>Who looks after those information days?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017060100002#O00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":698,"content":"<p>So far we have held them in Cork, Galway, Cavan and Dundalk, and Mayo and Sligo are next on our radar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017060100002#O00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I invite the programme to Kilkenny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017060100002#O00400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":700,"content":"<p>Yes, I would love to go to Kilkenny.

The SME will have spent money on training and committed itself to the tender.  We must examine how an SME can win a greater number of contracts under a certain level, how they can maintain a contract for a period of two years, three years or whatever and give them an opportunity to get into that space and understand it better.  SMEs have found, alongside all of the other complications within the tender process, there is the cost.  Those that invest in the tender process tend to win the contracts.  They may not be the best at doing the job but they are certainly the best at getting the job and that is a difficulty.  I have seen too many SMEs, certainly within my own country but in my region, that have lost out not on price but on some other aspect of the tender process.  There was value for money but the SME loses out because it has not reached a critical mass in terms of turnover, number of staff or whatever.  One of the cases that I saw highlighted was the library service, some of the contracts have gone to the UK based companies.  Many countries in Europe are structured to ensure that companies are within general EU guidelines yet they are well able to look after their own SME sector and get value for money at the same time.

As the Chairman has pointed out, a company's strength may be in winning the tender rather than doing the business.  What has also come back to me from recent engagements is the need for proper oversight after a contract has been awarded to ensure that it is implemented in the way that it was meant to be.  That is another piece that is missing in terms of the scrutiny conducted by the Office of Government Procurement.  Other parts of government are contracting out the service and the OGP is the professional body that ensures that happens in accordance with guidelines.

It permeates a wide range of Government and local authority activities.  It has all gone a bit crazy.  I understand the challenges in implementing the EU directives but something has gone seriously wrong in their implementation.  I will give the Minister of State some examples.  The Cathaoirleach talked about the broader contracts, creating a level playing field, providing equal opportunity to the smaller companies and looking at the value rather than the price.  The value in terms of employment and sustaining rural areas in particular is important.  I am glad the Minister of State is coming to County Mayo.  To confine it to those in Fine Gael would be a missed opportunity.  We will discuss it in more detail then.<\/p> <p>  I will talk about a very small item.  We met with Leader groups recently.  An example is the purchase of biscuits for meetings.  They have to go to three different shops, some of which might be 5 miles away.  It is about the purchasing of things and purchasing power.  It comes down to that and the rules that are set up around the purchase of items for local authorities, for example.  They have to go with the lowest tender.  It is not always necessary.  The biscuits might be cheaper 5 miles away but it does not take into account what has to be spent on travelling the 5 miles.  In terms of Brexit, an example is the delivery of employment supports where a procurement process has been gone through and contracts have been awarded to UK companies such as Seetec which is registered in Essex.  It is just an example.  I cannot see the value in taking functions away from local areas, which have already been delivered efficiently and effectively locally, just to fulfil an EU directive on procurement.  That examination needs to be done.  In terms of local authorities and the purchase of items and minimum values that come under the procurement process, somebody cannot just go into a local shop.  We are talking about smaller businesses being able to compete and tender.  The days of somebody being able to go into a local shop or business to purchase smaller items has been done away with.  It is foolish and has a bearing on the economic viability of rural areas.  It needs to be looked at.  We need a wider session on this in terms of procurement.  It will be interesting to see the information the Minister of State gathers from his consultations around the country to see how we can look at how the procurement process is mitigating against small and medium size businesses and retail businesses right across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017060100002#P00400","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":719,"content":"<p>It would be helpful for the committee to make a site visit to the Office of Government Procurement.

For example, he suggests that the powers of the regulator to separate procurement policy and operational guidelines be put on a statutory footing; that the SME sector and businesses generally be provided with assistance to help them understand the process and to conduct an appeal and understand the appeals system; and that companies that win contracts be supported and trained up by Enterprise Ireland, thus giving them an input into a broader market, although the thresholds then come into question, including as mentioned earlier the &euro;25,000 versus &euro;50,000 threshold.

For a long time, Sinn F&eacute;in has been campaigning for Presidential voting rights to be extended to citizens in the North and the diaspora, and for citizens in the North to be represented in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  The motivation for this Bill was the decision of the Constitutional Convention in September 2013 to endorse the proposal to extend voting rights in Presidential elections to citizens in the North and the diaspora.  A clear majority of those who voted in the Constitutional Convention's ballot were in favour of changing the Constitution to give citizens who are resident outside the State the right to vote in Presidential elections, with 78% in favour of the proposal and 21% against, and one person being decided.  There was also a clear and resounding majority on the issue of allowing citizens who are resident in the North to vote in Presidential elections, with 73% in favour of the proposal and 20% against, and 7% being undecided.<\/p><p> This very focused Bill is about giving effect to the Constitutional Convention's recommendation that the Constitution should be amended to allow the Oireachtas to legislate for the provision of voting rights in Presidential elections without restrictions on residency.  That is the very clear point we want to make.  At the moment, people are limited or blocked because of the issue of residency.  I attended all but one of the sessions of the convention.  It was a very good process and a very good democratic practice.  We would have liked to have seen a more deep-rooted convention.  I have to say that every time I attended one of the convention's events or sessions, I noticed that people were engaged.  The citizen delegates had briefed themselves and were very clued-in.  Some of the more serious constitutional changes, such as that relating to marriage equality, have already been enacted.  The Government accepted the convention's findings in this regard before choosing to ignore them.  Many people from the North who spoke at the convention feel very let down by that.  The members of the diaspora with whom I am in contact, particularly in Britain and the US, also feel very let down, having made detailed and intelligent submissions on this matter.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach's announcement in Philadelphia that there would be a referendum was very welcome.  It has subsequently been proposed that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will initiate a process of consultation on how all of this will work.  I welcome that as well, even though the process has been very slow.  This Bill does not affect any of that.  It does not even pretend to deal with any of it.  This legislation supplements the legislative mechanisms that might arise from the Minister's consultation process.  Those mechanisms will require constitutional underpinning and that is what this Bill sets out to do.  I will restate time and again that this legislation relates to disqualification due to residency.  The new text of Article 12.2.2&deg; of the Constitution, as outlined in the Schedule to this Bill, would enable legislation to be enacted to allow people \"without disqualification due to place of residency\" the right to vote in Presidential elections.  Deputy Crowe will set out our case that citizens who have reached the age of 16 should be allowed to vote in Presidential elections.  We propose that these two fundamental principles, as provided for in this Bill, should be put to the people in a referendum.<\/p><p> Nineteen years ago, the Good Friday Agreement enshrined in law the rights and entitlements of Irish citizens in all of the Thirty-two Counties on this island.  It did not give people in the North partial citizenship, second-class citizenship or a different grade of citizenship.  It gave full citizenship as a birth right to those who want it.  That was endorsed in the North and in the South.  In my opinion, there is no reason for any unnecessary delay in extending to all citizens the right to vote for their President.  On a number of occasions, we have had the anomaly of Northerners being elected to the Presidency even though they would not have had a vote if they had been living in the North.  We recall the wonderful spectacle of Mary McAleese in Croke Park with the members of the Tyrone and Armagh football teams, none of whom had a vote in Presidential elections.<\/p><p> These are emotional issues, to a certain extent, as well as issues of rights.  We are seeking to give this fundamental right to all the Irish citizens scattered throughout the world for reasons associated with nation-building, connecting and bringing people in the North and the South and the members of the diaspora together.  Partition has caused huge psychological and physical hurt for people here.  There is a process of reconciliation.  We are not reinventing something which does not happen elsewhere.  More than 120 other states allow their citizens who live overseas to vote in elections at home.  Ireland is out of kilter with the international trend.  I remind the committee that at times of economic difficulty, we are always quick to ask the diaspora to help by coming home and making a contribution.  We are now saying to members of the diaspora in the North and across the globe that they should be given this fundamental right.  My colleague, Deputy Crowe, will deal with some other aspects of this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017060100002#D00300","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496305800,"counter":789,"content":"<p>As Deputy Adams has outlined, this Bill has two main elements.  First, it proposes to amend the Constitution to extend the voting franchise in Presidential elections to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and to the Irish diaspora.  Second, it proposes that the voting age in Presidential elections should be lowered to 16.  I do not think there should be much confusion about the issues covered in this simple Bill.<\/p> <p>  I would like to concentrate on the proposal to extend the electoral franchise to include citizens who have reached the age of 16.  I believe our society will reap the rewards and profit from the inclusion of young people in the electoral process.  As members of the committee are probably aware, the Seanad has debated the possibility of reducing the voting age.  It was a good debate.  The position that was adopted was that more discussion was needed, but I do not think that discussion has really happened.  It is certainly happening within youth organisations.  I have spoken to people in the National Youth Council of Ireland, which represents a huge body of young people and is very engaged with this issue.  There is certainly an appetite among such organisations for a change of this nature.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Adams has outlined, many people across the globe already have this ability.  We believe this country should follow the example set by Norway, Austria, Scotland and other jurisdictions.  Some 75% of 16 and 17 year olds in Scotland vote when they are afforded an opportunity to do so.  I suppose this has been the pattern.  When young people have got the vote, they have used it.  Interestingly, people of this age who get the vote for the first time are probably more inclined to use it than older people, including people aged 19 or 20.  That is one of the quirks of the system.  The decision to give people aged 16 and 17 the right to vote in all Scottish elections enjoys a high level of support.  We know that many people engaged with the last referendum there.  When the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, addressed the Seanad last year, she reiterated her support for the voting rights of 16 and 17 year olds.<\/p> <p>  In 2011, when the voting age in Norwegian local elections was lowered to 16 as a trial in 21 municipalities, 58% of 16 and 17 year olds voted in the subsequent elections.  There was a far lower turnout among regular first-time voters between the ages of 18 and 21.  There is a pattern of young people using the vote once they are given it.  When Austria lowered its legal voting age in all elections in 2007, turnout among this age group increased to over 65%.<\/p><p>Research in this case study indicates a high level of political maturity when casting a vote for the first time.  I am sure everybody in all parties here is concerned about voter turnout.  Some of the lowest turnout rates are among young people.  Again, it is about engaging them and making them feel part of the process.  A positive step in encouraging them is to develop a pattern of voting when they are young, and that is the way the research has progressed.  It would be a progressive step to lower the voting age in Presidential elections to 16.  Why should it be limited to this election?  I argue that it should apply to all elections but this is a particular element of the Bill before us.  I urge the committee to support the Bill.<\/p><p> I could refer to other countries where there is a pattern of people using their vote.  This is about making politics and democracy available to more people.  The figures indicate this would allow 126,000 people aged between 16 and 17 to vote in local and European elections.  It is the view of most parties that they favour this, and where young people get the vote, it is used.  It is not as clear with the diaspora that when they get a vote, it is used.  There is the possibility of 3 million people getting a vote but who knows what the take-up will be?  Questions might be asked about how the vote could be cast and counted but that is a matter for the Oireachtas.  We can decide on that.  Some countries have a postal or electronic voting system and there is a way around the problem.  There may be concerns about electoral fraud and so on but we can look at the pattern in countries where the system works.  Only recently we saw the French population in Dublin going to the French embassy to use their vote and Polish people also queued recently to use their vote.  It is seen as a positive process.  I am looking forward to hearing some of the questions and debate today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017060100002#E00200","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496305800,"counter":791,"content":"<p>It is absolutely welcome that we could have much more enfranchisement of people in this country.  Straight away I support the concept of 16-year-olds voting and I have always believed that it should be the case.  We all know the arguments for it in that 16-year-olds could be working and one can join the Army at 17.  The idea that a person cannot have a vote until he or she turns 18 is something that must definitely change.  We constantly hear the refrain that young people are not interested but young people are very engaged in politics in general.  One can consider mobilisation around repealing the eighth amendment to the Constitution and many issues that matter to young people.  On International Women's Day we saw a huge number of students out on the streets.<\/p> <p>  I will make a couple of points relating to non-citizens.  From what I can gather, the Bill indicates the Oireachtas can bring in legislation.  I have a Bill relating to people resident in the State - many of these people are here for many years - having a vote, as one has with a local election.  The same idea should apply to the D&aacute;il.  Currently, approximately 12% of people do not have a vote but live in this country.  In constituencies like mine in Dublin West, the rate is twice the average, so approximately one in four people there was born outside Ireland.  It is untenable that in major population centres, one in four people does not have a vote.  Many of these people are here for 15 years and some have citizenship but there is no effort in this country to get people to upgrade their vote from applying to local elections to being able to vote in all elections.  Some people do not become citizens, particularly those from the European Union, such as those from England and France.  They can be very excluded from having any say in referendums, Presidential and Oireachtas elections.  There must be a change in that respect.<\/p> <p>  What is being proposed or will any line be drawn with respect to qualification?  As the law stands, if a person is less than 18 months out of the State, he or she is considered to be ordinarily resident.  We saw with the marriage equality referendum that thousands of people flew home and made sure they cast their vote.  The \"home to vote\" phenomenon was very important, as many people were in Britain and even further afield.  Will this Bill open it to basically anybody who is Irish around the world?  There are more Irish citizens outside the State than in the State due to generations of emigration and so on.  Is the qualification the need for Irish-born grandparents?  Would any additional qualifications be included, such as previous residency in the State?  There could be a case where somebody has not even been in Ireland but could vote, yet many people in Ireland, paying tax and being influenced by decisions would remain without a vote.<\/p> <p>  Would there be a time limit on this?  I have not come to a position on this but I am teasing out the matter.  Perhaps it would apply for a person who is away for up to five years.  The more somebody is away from Ireland, the weaker the connection to the daily life of the society in which he or she may have a vote.  The President plays a very limited role in making laws but there is potential power not to sign a Bill or whatever.  The question could be posed as to why some people have a vote when they do not feel the impact of the decision.<\/p> <p>  Another question relates to the North.  Given the uncertainty over Brexit and the potential of a Border poll, would the movers of the Bill see any potential for this to cause problems, tensions or divisions?  The idea is that everybody would have a vote for the President of the Republic of Ireland.  There are tensions in the North right now.  I know there are practical issues and the movers of the Bill will leave those to the Oireachtas.  There is no electoral register and it would have to be set up.  I will leave those points until later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017060100002#F00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1496305800,"counter":792,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Adams and Crowe for their presentation.  I am very much in favour of this Bill.  I am a founder member of <i>votingrights.ie<\/i>in the United States with Ms Noreen Bowden and Mr. Kevin Sullivan.  We have put much more into this, no more than the witnesses.  It is just wrong that people do not have a vote in these circumstances.  I could not vote for 16 years and when I became an American citizen two years ago, I was like a little child with my first lollipop when I went to vote.  Politics is very strong in my personal agenda.  I was disenfranchised all those years and it was terrible.  I really wanted to make sure that I voted as a result.<\/p><p>I have spoken with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Taoiseach about this.  The graduates of the National University of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin vote in the Seanad elections and there does not seem to be any problem.  The pitfalls put in front of us include how to set up a register, as we are told it would cost a fortune.  The benefit we get from our citizens voting would far outweigh the cost.<\/p><p>I point out to many that the Government makes decisions that affect emigrants.  Many of us emigrants have homes in Ireland and pay whatever taxes we have to pay.  One hears the argument about no representation without taxation.  That goes back to commonisation, or the 1700s and 1800s.  As such, it is not an argument.  The benefits would far outweigh any disadvantage.  One has to get young people involved in politics.  Sinn F&eacute;in is an example of a party that seems to have a very young base.  Young people are interested in politics and were never more so than in the marriage equality referendum.  Who would ever have predicted the number who came back to vote in that referendum?  Many came from Australia, at considerable cost, to vote in it.  It was fantastic and the talk of the world.  This is the only country in the world that has had an open vote on the issue of marriage equality.  Young people will engage and should be engaged.  We heard the debates in recent days on the leadership of Fine Gael.  It was a fantastic example of democracy because members were given a chance to voice their opinions.  If one of the contestants had pulled out, what would have been the point in changing the voting system in that party?  It goes to show what I describe.  Young people are highly motivated when they get involved in politics.<br\/><br\/>When I returned on 3 May, just before the meetings of the civic forum on 4 and 5 May, I organised a press conference on voting rights.  We received all-party support.  Representatives spoke on behalf of all of the parties.<br\/><br\/>The most important thing we must do concerns the options, on which a good point was made.  We have to get it right because we have only one shot at it.  We will not get a second chance.  Our record on referendums is not good.  With the first chance, we may still have to wait until 2025.  I refer to the Presidential election, according to what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, told me.  The options are very important.  I have spoken to many members of my family in Ireland and noted that they are not all in favour of what is proposed.  Therefore, we have to sell it.  It has to be an all-party affair, not half-hearted.  Many of the referendums we have held were half-hearted.  The question was thrown at the people and allowed to run its course, only for the Government to find out that it was in a mess and that it was required to hold a referendum again, which was crazy.  We need to get the option right, whatever it is.  We have to sell our proposal big-time to the people, but I am not sure how open it is.  There is talk about extending the right to passport holders alone on the basis that if one pays money to obtain a passport, one is committed.  It is said we would be swamped, or that one party or the other might be swamped.  That is the parties' fault.  If they are not able to organise, they should not be in the game.  I would not have any fear about this.  It is democracy and we want to strengthen ours.  What better way than what I propose?  <i>Per capita <\/i>we have one of the biggest diasporas in the world.  Even leaving that aside, we have one of the biggest diasporas.  The most important point is that we have to get the option right and ensure all parties are behind us on it.

Despite the very positive word from the Taoiseach in the United States and the publication of the Department's consultation paper, I am concerned that it is the first departmental consultation paper I have seen published that does not have a consultation deadline.  Normally when we get something from the Department, it tells us that it wants to hear views by a certain point in time.  That leads me to be a little suspicious that while the Department is stating all the right things, it is not necessarily treating the matter with the urgency required.  One of the values of our having this Bill come through the committee is that we can send a very clear signal to the Minister and the Department that, just as it was supported across parties in the last D&aacute;il, the view of the committee is that it wants it to be progressed as a matter emergency.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, there is a lot of good content in the consultation paper.  It would be useful for members who have not read it to do so because there are many good data contained in it.  When one considers the question of to whom the right to vote should be extended and reads the document, one notes that the case to extend the right to vote to all citizens is compelling, although I do not believe that is the intention.  First, there is plenty of evidence from other jurisdictions to counter the argument that one would be swamped.  Non-resident voting rights are extended in a range of countries.  The number outside those states who register to vote is small by comparison with the overall number and the number who vote is smaller again.  There is no evidence to suggest the issue of swamping is real.  Some who are just against the idea politically have been putting it out to try to frighten people.  I do not refer to Deputies or other politicians but to media commentators.  I refer to the idea that more people outside the State than inside might vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017060100002#G00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1496305800,"counter":795,"content":"<p>What about the numbers in Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017060100002#G00300","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1496305800,"counter":796,"content":"<p>There is no evidence in the data presented to suggest that is something that happens, even where the diaspora or non-resident population is large.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is that of time limits.  Again, the report is interesting in that regard because it highlights that a number of countries that currently apply time limits are doing away with them.  The argument is that they are discriminatory.  What they have is two-tier citizenship, with some people having the right to vote and others not.  The strongest argument made in the report is probably that there is simply no justification for discriminating, particularly in an election such as a presidential election.  On that basis, that is one of the strengths of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I am worried that the departmental consultation paper seems to be offering many reasons we cannot do this now.  Reference is made to the logistics of putting in place a voter registration system and facilities to enable people to vote, be it in the North or abroad.  It is almost as if it would take many years to put in place such an arrangement.  The committee should be stating this is something that should start to happen now and that we should register whoever can be put on a register in advance of 2018, subject to a referendum being passed.  Even if that were only the start of the process, it would be a better way to start than delaying.  That is all the more reason dealing with the Bill is urgent.<\/p> <p>  Let me raise a point with which the report does not deal.  It is not specifically to do with the Bill, but it is worth the committee considering it.  Obviously, if one extends the right to vote to everybody outside the State who has a right to Irish citizenship, the issue of Unionists arises.  While they have the right to acquire citizenship, as we know, many of them do not want to exercise or vindicate it.  I am wondering whether, in the legislative process, there should be some consideration of allowing Unionists living on the island of Ireland have access to the right to vote without forcing them to take up citizenship.  They have a specific set of circumstances.  Has any thought been given to this suggestion?  Are there suggestions for the committee to consider in that regard?  Legislation will eventually be brought back to us for consideration and I would like to see circumstances in which Unionists living in the North would have the easiest possible route to the right to vote in the election.  Allowing for a right to citizenship as opposed to the acquisition of citizenship might be one means of facilitating what I describe.  <\/p> <p>  Obviously, I support the Bill and would like to see us progress it through Committee Stage as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017060100002#G00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1496305800,"counter":797,"content":"<p>I seek clarification on the same point.

I have been the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on the diaspora for some years and it is a very interesting role.  I concur with most of what has been said and I do not propose to repeat the points made by previous speakers.  However, the notion that people who have lived abroad for some years are disconnected from what is going on at home is balderdash.  When we meet Irish people in Britain, Canada, the United States and other countries, we often find they are more in tune with what is happening at home than many people we know in our localities.  They have access to information via the Internet, apps, etc., and read high-quality news published online.  As Senator Lawless will be aware, one of the first things many emigrants do in the morning is to check the RTE news or <i>thejournal.ie <\/i>to find out what is happening at home.  I often receive texts in the middle of the night from people in the United States asking whether I was aware of this or that issue.  Members of the diaspora are very much in tune with what his happening at home and they feel disenfranchised.  The Bill is important to them for this reason.<br\/><br\/>The Bill also recognises that members of the diaspora are citizens.  Even though they are not physically present in Ireland, they are passionate about their Irishness and do not lose their sense of citizenship.  Having been born and brought up here, many of them believe they have a duty of care to Irish people at home.  Their strong commitment to the island of Ireland is one of the reasons the Bill is important.<br\/><br\/>I share the concerns expressed about the delay in introducing legislation of this nature.  I understand, for example, that when some of the Baltic states joined the European Union, some of them were able to compile an electoral register within one year to allow their citizens living abroad to vote in elections.  I am interested in hearing more about this from the officials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017060100002#G00900","speaker":"1377","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496305800,"counter":803,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Crowe and Adams for their presentations.

I also have two brothers living in San Francisco who have been in the United States for more than 30 years.

We must progress the legislation speedily, while taking into consideration the need to ensure it is done right.<\/p> <p>  I also support the proposal to reduce the voting age to 16 years.  We need to build an awareness campaign and provide for something similar to an apprenticeship.  I have three children who are not much older than 16 years.  Children aged between 16 and 18 years have an excellent opportunity in the school system and in their communities to become informed and politically active.  While they contribute much more from the age of 18 years onwards, 16 years is an appropriate age to acquire the right to vote.<\/p> <p>  This proposal forms part of the modernisation of Ireland, which cannot happen fast enough.

Senator Grace O'Sullivan put it well when she described the proposal as part of the modernisation of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  As I stated, this is a focused Bill.  Other legitimate and important issues arise, some of which Teachta&iacute; have raised.  However, this Bill deals with a proposal made by the Convention on the Constitution by seeking to remove the residency restriction imposed on people who would otherwise have the right to vote in presidential elections.  This is a simple, straightforward and focused proposal.  We also propose to reduce the voting age to 16 years.<\/p> <p>  Most of the issues raised by previous speakers are a matter for other legislation.  There are many examples of good international practice in this area.  Some 120 states already provide voting rights for emigrants in domestic elections.  There is no reason we cannot learn from their experience.  The issue of people who have been resident and paid tax here for a long time being unable to vote in elections is a legitimate one which deserves positive consideration.  It is not, however, the business of this Bill but a matter to be addressed in other legislation.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the North, particularly in regard to unionists, British citizens resident here have the right to vote in elections to the D&aacute;il.  There may be, as part of the consultation process, some way of taking into consideration the broad principle by which unionists wish to claim British status, although it would not be citizenship.  We should be quite flexible in trying to encourage or bring about their right to vote in presidential elections.<\/p> <p>  The issue was raised as to whether the proposed measure would cause tension in the North.  Ten or 15 years ago, at a time when Irish Governments had a focused involvement in the North, we learned a salutary lesson during a crisis in the process that involved loyalists.  Who did the loyalists seek to speak to during that crisis?  It was not the British Prime Minister or Secretary of State but the Taoiseach at the time, Mr. Bertie Ahern, who subsequently met them at Hillsborough.<\/p> <p>  The President is always welcome in the North.  When people from unionist neighbourhoods visit &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;n, it is always a big day out, perhaps because they like big house politics.  A great deal of this type of work is being done on an ongoing basis.<\/p> <p>  Brexit is the big train coming down the tracks and it will affect everyone on the island.  Thinking unionists know this and those who have legitimately and rightly benefited most from the cross-Border work that has been done in recent decades, namely, those in the dairy and agriculture industries and enterprising business, are very nervous about Brexit because they value the all-island approach that is increasingly being taken.  One of the consequences of Brexit is that more and more unionists in the North are applying for Irish passports.  The largest number of applications for Irish passports did not come from a republican stronghold but from a small unionist community whose name I forget.  It may have been Newtownabbey.<\/p><p> I do not want to exaggerate any of this but it will not have any detrimental effect on either community relationships or the ongoing process of trying to reconcile and reach harmony and equality.  To actually vote, one has to make an active decision to do so and then go about doing that.  If one does not want to vote, one simply does not do it.  There was a sizeable campaign in Newry when the issue of rights for Northerners, particularly in presidential elections, was being discussed at the Constitutional Convention.  By complete coincidence, the people of Latvia resident in Newry had a polling station in one of the local supermarkets.  Quite a lot of people remarked on the fact that without even a whisper, these Latvian citizens just went and voted in Newry while people in Newry could not vote in elections just down the road.  <\/p><p> There will be a need for a good, sound legislative process and a need for the Oireachtas to get this right.  I particularly welcome the remarks to the effect that there needs to be more urgency about this.  I am from the North and Dana said, very accurately, during a previous presidential election campaign that people in the North always look South but that people in the South rarely look North.  For someone to come to the Constitutional Convention from Ballymurphy, Ballymoney or Ballymena or for someone to make the case by video or social media link from Chicago, Brisbane, Frankfurt, London or elsewhere and for the convention to agree to it, gave Northerners and emigrants a very positive sense of being part of the nation, the Gaeldom and part of an island people.  However, four or five years later, the fact that it has still not happened has become a source of frustration.  In that context, I particularly welcome the notion that we must deal with this more urgently than we have thus far and that is the purpose of this Bill <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017060100002#H00400","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496305800,"counter":807,"content":"<p>I thank members for their comments and questions.  Deputy Coppinger asked about the Bill itself and whether it applies to people who are resident here but who are not entitled to vote at the moment.  The Bill will change the Constitution.  The Deputy asked if it could be more ambitious and perhaps it could be but what we are trying to do is to get it over the line.  We want to get it agreed.  The questions about who could vote in terms of criteria such as passport holders, number of years living abroad and so on can be argued and agreed but first we need to change the Constitution to enable the diaspora living outside the State to vote.  Some have questioned whether 16 year olds should be included but that is a debate for another day.  The Deputy is correct that we could probably have included other provisions but we did not do so because we want to get this across the line.<\/p> <p>  I do not think it will add to tensions in the North.  Deputy Adams spoke about Presidents of Ireland going North and there was a time when unionists would have protested if an Irish President visited the North but thankfully things have moved on.  It is now seen as a positive rather than a negative.  There has been a huge increase in the number of applicants for Irish passports from the North.  That can be seen as a negative but I see it as a positive development.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Lawless spoke about graduates voting in Seanad elections and so forth, which does not make sense.  That said, it is not a simple issue.  We need to have a serious discussion about how we see this rolling out.  The Bill itself is simple but that is just one part of the work we need to do.  If there is agreement that we push this forward, that is a positive step that opens the door for our people.  I would not like to exclude anyone.  One hears people refer to second or third generation Irish people who still consider themselves to be Irish.  If one goes to Argentina, for example, there are many people there whose ancestors left Ireland hundreds of years ago who still consider themselves to be Irish, part of the Irish nation and the Irish diaspora.  We need to be tapping in to that.  Imagine the potential that exists in terms of the resource of 70 million people who claim an Irish identity and what we could do if we could use that in a positive manner.  I do not mean using it as a cash cow but harnessing the goodwill of that which would be very helpful into the future.  <\/p> <p>  We have had a good discussion this morning.  It is worth remembering that the European Commission was critical of the fact that when Irish citizens leave Ireland they cannot vote in Irish elections.  Other countries have postal voting systems and so on but that is a discussion for a different day.  I am not particularly concerned about the European Commission's criticism but I am concerned to get this Bill over the line.  The first step is to get all of the political blocks within the Oireachtas to agree to this Bill.  The discussion around this issue has already begun and many of those who are engaged in it are far ahead of the political parties.  There will be a genuine welcome across the board for this.  As to whether it would pass in a referendum, that is another discussion.  Senator Lawless is right in that we would need to do some work on that.  There is often a negative reaction to proposals from the Government to change the Constitution, with people using referenda as a way to poke the Government in the eye and so on.  However, it is a welcome development and the discussion this morning has been positive.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee this morning.

We welcome the opportunity to engage with the committee on its scrutiny of the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Presidential Voting) Bill 2014 which proposes to amend the Constitution to extend the franchise in presidential elections to all Irish citizens who have reached the aged of 16 years.  I am accompanied this morning by Ms R&iacute;ona N&iacute; Fhlanghaile, Mr. Paris Beausang and Mr. Michael O'Connor, colleagues from the franchise section within the Department, and by Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Ingoldsby from the so-called Irish abroad unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Our Department has worked closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the Government's proposals to extend the franchise at presidential elections.  This morning's discussions represent a timely opportunity to set out the Government's position on the issue generally and on the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Presidential Voting) Bill 2014 in particular.<\/p> <p>  The Bill was first introduced in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 11 March 2014 in response to the fifth report of the Constitutional Convention which was submitted to the Oireachtas in November 2013.  While the previous Government did not oppose the Bill on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in March 2015, it was made clear that a full and considered analysis of the policy and practical issues which might arise from its implementation should be undertaken before it progressed through further Stages of the legislative process.  In the committee's letter of invitation, the Department was asked to identify the Government's position on the Bill and any constitutional, legal, policy or technical issues of relevance to it.  While these were set out to some extent on Second Stage in 2015, matters have progressed a great deal since then.  In essence, the legal, policy and technical issues arising from the extension of the franchise in presidential elections are set out in the Government's March 2017 options paper on voting in presidential elections by citizens resident outside the State.<\/p> <p>  On 7 March 2017, the Government decided to accept in principle the main recommendation in the fifth report of the Constitutional Convention that Irish citizens resident outside the State, including citizens resident in Northern Ireland, should have the right to vote in presidential elections and that a referendum should be held to amend the Constitution to give effect to this proposal.  The decision was announced by the Taoiseach in Philadelphia on 12 March 2017.  I understand it received a generally positive response from Irish citizens resident outside the State and was broadly welcomed at home.  The options paper prepared by our Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was published on 22 March 2017 to inform public debate on this significant policy change.  The options paper provided a focus for discussions at a dedicated session on voting rights held at the second Global Irish Civic Forum on 5 May this year.<\/p><p>The forum brought together more than 230 representatives of Irish community organisations across the world to discuss a broad range of issues affecting the diaspora over two days in Dublin Castle last month.<\/p><p> The Government's policy statement, Global Irish: Ireland's Diaspora Policy, published in March 2015, acknowledges the unique and important role of the Irish diaspora and recognises that an extension of voting rights to Irish citizens outside the State would allow such citizens to play a more active role in the future shape of Irish society, while also preserving and deepening their engagement with Ireland and Irish affairs.  While accepting that an extension of the franchise would be welcomed by many in the Irish diaspora, the policy statement equally acknowledged that there was a broad range of policy, legal and practical issues that needed analysis before the matter could be considered further by Government.  Against this background, the options paper published in late March of this year sets out seven possible options on the question of which citizens outside the State should be given the right to vote and on how such a change might be implemented if approved in a referendum by the people.<\/p><p> During the debates at the Convention on the Constitution, the question was raised as to whether a referendum would be necessary.  The options paper is quite clear that a constitutional referendum would be required to extend voting rights at presidential elections to citizens resident outside the State.  Sections 1.2 and 5 of the options paper address some of the legal concerns that may arise from proposals to extend the franchise at presidential elections to citizens outside the State.  For example, the text of any amendment would need to be explicit as to which citizens would have the right to vote.  An amendment to Article 12.3.3&deg; of the Constitution, which sets a 60-day timescale for the holding of a presidential election, may be necessary.  Best practice would also suggest that an electoral amendment Bill or at the very least the heads of a Bill should be published before holding a referendum.  Such a Bill would clearly set out for the information of the people the changes that would be made to the electoral Acts to facilitate implementation in the event of a referendum being passed.  Other fundamental issues addressed in the options paper are modernising the register of electors and the establishment of an electoral commission in section 3, the method of voting for an extended franchise in section 4 and the costs arising in section 6, including for the taking of a poll and the counting of votes with an extended franchise.  <\/p><p> A lot has happened since the Thirty-Fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Presidential Voting) Bill was introduced in 2014.  While the Government has no proposals at this point to reduce the voting age at presidential elections to 16 years, it has signalled its commitment to the holding of a referendum to extend the franchise at presidential elections to all Irish citizens outside the State, including citizens in Northern Ireland.  The question of reducing the voting age is considered to be a fundamental question in its own right, which should perhaps be considered separately in the context of all elections rather than for presidential elections only.<\/p><p> I thank members for their attention.

While I appreciate that it is a tight timeframe, could it be done were shoulders put to the wheel and were the Government to make a decision on the options paper?  At present, how long is being allocated for consultation?  What timelines have been put in place?

I will ask my colleague, Ms N&iacute; Fhlanghaile, to discuss some of the issues raised.  In respect of the timeline, the Government decided to accept the recommendation on 7 March 2017 and has said it will hold a referendum on this issue.  Since then, we have published a very detailed options paper, which was the result of quite a lot of research and analysis, as members can imagine.  I welcome the earlier comments about the usefulness of that paper.  As several members have observed, it is a complex issue.  There is a range of options available to us.  It is important to get it right, specifically in respect of the practical methods.  When deciding on the question that ultimately will be put to them, the people will expect us to provide them with some information on the practical implications of what it will mean.  We are dedicating a lot of time to listening to people's views.  This morning's session was very useful in that respect.<\/p> <p>  In response to the Senator's question about the timeframe for the consultation, we have not set one.  It is an options paper and consultation will continue throughout the process.  This is one step and certain decisions will have to be taken at this point.  The paper will continue to be used for further consultation as the matter progresses.  It is not a question of making a decision now and moving on from it.  In respect of the timing of the whole issue, as the Government agrees, the register of electors needs to be modernised.  We have been tasked with progressing that issue in parallel with the wider question.  The committee will know better than us that the modernisation of the register of electors has been discussed for many years.  It is important that we are all able to stand over the integrity and security of that register at national level and, if the people so decide in a referendum, in respect of those outside the State.  As for the timeframe we envisage, that project in itself is very significant and there is no room for error.  It would be very negative if it was rushed and something happened that called the whole project into question.  We will be identifying the risks and trying to minimise and mitigate against them.  For that reason, it is going to take a number of years.<\/p> <p>  Our preference and recommendation is that we move to an online registration process.  That would seem to be the most sensible approach in terms of being workable for people outside the State.  We have looked at what other countries have done.  A paper-based registration process would be very cumbersome both from an administrative perspective and in practical terms for those who are trying to use it.  It would be very difficult to see how it would work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017060100002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1496305800,"counter":824,"content":"<p>As opposed to an online voting system, Ms Quinn is just referring to the voter registration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017060100002#M00100","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496305800,"counter":825,"content":"<p>Yes.  That is one of the most important prerequisites if we are to facilitate this.  Voting would be the next significant issue in terms of timing and practicalities.  We have examined what has happened elsewhere.  Options around the world include in-country voting, which is what we have and where people have been out of the State for less than 18 months and are still deemed ordinarily resident here; voting at embassies and consulates, which some countries allow; postal voting; voting by proxy; electronic voting and a combination of these.  It is a complex question and we need to arrive at the right answer.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Senator's first question in a long-winded way, this will not be possible to deliver before the 2018 presidential election.  We will continue to work on it, though.  The options paper will display the level of analysis and consideration that is being given to this by us and our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We will move forward.  Once a decision is made on the ultimate option to be put to the people, a period of time will be required to make the practical arrangements.  For example, the requirement to pass an electoral amendment Bill will be an important factor for people to consider when the question is put to them.  What changes would result from this Bill?  The constitutional amendment and this Bill comprise a first step.

They all do things differently to suit themselves.  We included a paper from the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, IFES, at the back of the options paper.  It is a succinct and useful reference.  According to it, a country has to do what suits its own circumstances.  As such, while we are examining other countries, we must build on what works for the Irish situation.<\/p> <p>  I have heard many references to how there are 120 countries in the world that do this while we do not.  Actually, we are on that list because of the small amount of outside voting that we allow for the Defence Forces and diplomats.  I make this point to say that each of the 120 countries is not doing everything.  Instead, various countries only do it for certain elections.  A tome from the International IDEA - I have forgotten that organisation's full title - is referenced in the options paper and outlines the situation.  Some countries only allow this type of voting for certain elections whereas others allow it for all elections.  Many countries do not have the large diaspora or, in particular, generous citizenship laws that we have.  There is a general agreement that the number of people who will register, and certainly outside the island of Ireland, may be relatively small.  That is the pattern internationally, but our starting point is different.

It is an opt-in system rather than one in which everyone who is eligible for citizenship is on a register.  To get on the register, one needs to register.  To do that, one needs to be eligible for citizenship.  The thinking is that the numbers will be small.

I do not think Sinn F&eacute;in is trying too hard.  Perhaps we are both looking at things from a different space.  For example, if we were to set a passport requirement, the people Sinn F&eacute;in is concerned about in Northern Ireland would have to obtain passports.  Many of them might not regard that as desirable so we must look at that.  Perhaps it might involve inserting an Article 12.2.4o into the Constitution.  I do not know.

I thank the Chair and the committee for facilitating this early opportunity to discuss the content of the general scheme of this Bill.<\/p> <p>  I am joined today by Mr. Tim Duggan, assistant secretary general and Ms Helen McDonald, principal officer with responsibility for pensions, Ms Kathleen Stack, assistant secretary general with responsibility for fraud and control and Mr. Brian Duff, principal officer with responsibility for legislative and legal affairs.  My colleagues and I will be pleased to address questions that committee members may have with respect to the general scheme of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  My statement has been circulated to the committee members prior to this meeting.  Members will have seen that it includes an attachment that summarises and explains the background to each of the heads contained in the general scheme.  In the interests of time I do not propose to read the detail of this attachment into the record.  My colleagues and I will, with the permission of the Chair, refer as appropriate to the attachment along with the general scheme, in answering questions that committee members may have.<\/p> <p>  I will sketch out the broad parameters of the general scheme as I believe it will prove useful.  The general scheme contains changes to three Acts, the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, the Pensions Act 1990, and the Civil Registration Act 2004.<\/p> <p>  The changes to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act contain provisions that can be categorised as being either broadly administrative or broadly policy focused in nature.  The changes that are largely administrative in nature relate to the following: the clarification of the principle that payments to a guardian should not be conflated with payments to the orphan in guardianship; enabling citizens to voluntarily present their public services card as a means of establishing identity with service providers such as credit unions, banks and utility providers and, if they wish, to include their date of birth on the public services card; clarification of ministerial authority for the setting of reduced fees for the issue of life event certificates; enabling the Department to automate the award of benefits or payments; and the inclusion of supplementary welfare payments in the list of payments that can be recovered in personal injury insurance cases.    <\/p> <p>  The main policy focused changes to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, as provided for in the general scheme, relate to the following: measures to deter and reduce fraud in the social welfare system, including the publication of names of people convicted in a court for social welfare fraud; the reduction, for a limited period, in the personal rate of payment to people so convicted; and the extension of the earnings disregard for people with disabilities to include earnings from all types of employment.<\/p><p>To address the Pensions Act, all of the proposed changes are largely policy focused and are designed to protect the interests of members and beneficiaries of occupational pension schemes.  They provide for restrictions on the ability of employers to trigger the closure of a pension scheme without due notice and proper engagement; new powers for the Pensions Authority to set a schedule of employer contributions in certain circumstances; a deadline  for the submission of funding proposals by trustees; and equal treatment of same sex spouses and civil partners with regard to access to a spouse's pension in certain circumstances.<br\/><br\/>All of the proposed changes to the Civil Registration Act are broadly administrative in nature.  They provide for removal of the prescribed term of office for the Registrar General and deputy Registrar General in recognition of the fact that both positions are general Civil Service positions with the post-holders having the same tenure as other civil servants; bringing the arrangements for the registration of a death in cases where a coroner is involved broadly into line with those which apply when a medical practitioner certifies a death; sharing of the records of births, deaths and marriages with a body under the aegis of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; and recording both the country of birth and the country of citizenship of a deceased person in the register of deaths.<br\/><br\/>In addition to these changes, I refer to two other issues raised recently by Members of the Oireachtas as potential legislative matters.  First, Deputy<b><\/b>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raised the issue of introducing a disregard of foster care payments received from the United Kingdom in the means assessment of claimants who are living in Ireland.  While the Minister supports and wishes to give effect to this proposal, he must have regard not only to people receiving foster payments originating in the UK but also people receiving similar payments originating in other European Union member states.  The Department is examining the issues involved and hopes to be in a position, if legislative change is required and with the indulgence of Members of the Oireachtas, to introduce this proposal as a Committee Stage amendment.<br\/><br\/>Second, it will be recalled that when the Social Welfare Bill 2016 was being debated towards the end of last year, a Committee Stage amendment was introduced by Deputies John Brady and  Denise Mitchell which would have provided that, in cases where an employer was found under the Unfair Dismissals Act to have unfairly dismissed an employee, the employer would, in addition to whatever penalty was imposed by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, also have to refund any social welfare payments paid between the date of the dismissal and the date of the decision by the WRC.  At the time, the Minister indicated that he saw some merit in the proposal and would examine it closely with a view to potentially making the necessary amendments in this Bill.  I understand that the Chairman has circulated a letter from the Minister which outlines the outcomes of a consultation process with the relevant stakeholders.  As it is apparent that there is no support among stakeholders for the proposed change, the Minister has decided not to proceed further with the proposal at this time.<br\/><br\/>I hope this short summary has helped to clarify the content and objectives of the general scheme.  My colleagues and I will be pleased to address any questions members may have and take any input or suggestions for consideration by the Minister in finalising the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":871,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McKeon.

Reading through the general scheme yesterday, I made a few notes on matters that came to my attention in this Part.  On head 3, will it be the position statutorily that a person will be entitled to receive one full social welfare payment, a full guardian's payment and a half-rate carer's allowance?  Will Mr. McKeon confirm that this will be the entitlement?<\/p> <p>  Head 4 deals with fraud, an issue I and others raised in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  I remain mystified as to the reason for this provision.  I am totally opposed to social welfare fraud, which is a particularly despicable form of crime, and I fully agree that a hard line should be taken towards it.  However, the way in which the proposals outlined in head 4 will improve matters escapes me.  We are told that this measure will provide further deterrence.  When someone is convicted of social welfare fraud we read about the case in the newspapers and the details are usually widely disseminated in local media.  What purpose is to be served by publishing, some months after the event, a list of people who have been convicted of social welfare fraud?  People commit other types of fraud and we have armed robbers and all sorts of other criminals who go to court, are convicted and have their cases publicised in the media.  Will lists of such persons be drawn up and published in the hope that this will deter them from committing future crimes of this nature?  The Revenue list of tax defaulters is different because it refers to settlements in cases that do not go to court.  People would never know that Mr. or Mrs X did not pay his or her tax and settled a case if it were not for the publication of this list.  How will this purported increased public awareness deter potential social welfare fraudsters?<\/p> <p>  The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, INOU, and others asked us to raise another issue.  It is intended to publish the list within three months after the end of the quarter in which the conviction occurred.  What is to stop other organisations taking the list and republishing it on a continual basis?  Will it be removed from the Department's search engine, for example?  I ask for clarification on that issue?<\/p> <p>  On head 5, in cases where people who are already paying off an overpayment are convicted, will they receive up to 75% of their full social welfare rate for nine weeks before reverting to the overpayment, in other words, will this be an additional payment which will not in any way impinge on the amount of the overpayment people will ultimately have to pay?<\/p> <p>  I am not sure how the provisions in head 7 will result in lower charges.  Perhaps Mr. McKeon will clarify the position.<\/p> <p>  Head 8 includes a peculiar provision on decisions made by automation.  It provides that persons may receive a benefit from a machine but the machine cannot refuse a person a benefit.  Does this mean that where a person is not granted a benefit, he or she may appeal but only to a human being, rather than a machine?  What I cannot figure it is why anyone would appeal the granting of a benefit.  The Department will certainly not appeal because it will hardly appeal its own decision.  I ask for clarification in this regard.  The only example of a person appealing the granting of a social welfare benefit is in cases where the full benefit to which the claimant believes he or she is entitled is not granted.  I hope the machines will not have any part in making decisions of that nature.<\/p> <p>  Head 9 relates to provisions on the recovery of special damages in court cases and provided that these will be extended to supplementary welfare allowance.  I can understand circumstances in which someone is granted supplementary welfare allowance but does not ultimately qualify for a benefit.  Surely in cases such as those provided for in this head the person will qualify for disability allowance given that he or she will be off work with an injury.  In my experience, and I am sure it is one shared by other members, if someone is granted supplementary welfare allowance during this period, the payment will be clawed back.  Let us say it takes ten weeks for the disability allowance payment to come through, while the claimant will be entitled to ten weeks' arrears, the supplementary welfare payment will be clawed back from the arrears.  The head must be drafted in such a way as to ensure benefits are not clawed back on the double.<\/p><p> I would like head 10 (1b) explained.  What precise income will be taken into account in such a situation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#D00300","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":874,"content":"<p>I call Senator Humphreys and he has five minutes as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#E00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":875,"content":"<p>I will not repeat everything that Senator O'Dea has said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#E00300","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":876,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Dea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#E00400","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":877,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Dea.

I understood that social welfare overpayments are always recouped over a period.  The proposed change in head 5 is to provide the Minister with the power to further punish somebody convicted in our courts of social welfare fraud.  If the change is passed, the provision will allow the Minister to cut a person's weekly social welfare payment by up to 25% for a period of nine weeks.  I am concerned the measure moves the Department into the courts sector.  If somebody is convicted in the courts the judge can hand down a punishment in the form of a fine or whatever.  There is a proposal to add another tier whereby the Minister can add an additional punishment and the nine weeks do not count as a reduction in terms of an overpayment.  I believe the measure means the Minister is moving into very dangerous territory.  This has happened before but the initiative was struck down in the Supreme Court.  Has the Attorney General been consulted about the proposal?  In the Supreme Court case of Cox<i>v.<\/i>Ireland 1992 the proposal was put forward but it was struck down.  We  have a judicial system.<\/p><p>If head 5 is accepted the Minister will be granted a partially judicial role.  In other words, in cases where the punishment handed down by a judge is deemed insufficient the Minister can increase the punishment by reducing social welfare payments by up to 25%.  I believe the development is very dangerous.  In fact, it may be constitutional and I know there are solicitors and lawyers are sitting around.  The judgment of Cox <i>v. <\/i>Ireland 1992 has shown very clearly that the provision is unconstitutional.  Has the Department talked to the Attorney General?  Has the Department considered the Supreme Court judgment?  Has the Minister pushed for the amendment?  He cannot set himself up as a judge and impose a penalty.  If the measure is accepted the Minister can deem a punishment handed down by a judge in the form of a penalty, prison sentence or fine not good enough and impose an additional fine that lasts nine weeks.  I want to hear the logic and theory behind the proposal.  I want to know whether the Attorney General has been consulted about the matter.

I welcome the change made to the payment for guardians.  The change recognises that the payment to the guardian should be for the benefit of the child.  It is a fundamental principle that underpins payments to guardians.  However, there is a contradiction because the same principle does not apply to maintenance payments.  A payment to a lone parent family is regarded as a source of income and is means tested even though it is a payment for the child concerned.  I ask the officials to touch on the matter.<\/p> <p>  I am deeply concerned about the move to tackle fraud.  I share all of the concerns that have been expressed by Senator Humphreys but I have a few additional concerns.  The Department has conducted a high profile campaign.  Many figures and misinformation have been put into the public domain but I do not have the time to go into more detail now.  I will discuss the information that has come out about identity fraud.  Over the past couple of days figures were circulated but yesterday the figures were amended.  Yesterday morning, up to April of this year there was one case of suspected identity fraud.  Subsequently, the figure was amended to 11 cases late yesterday afternoon yet the overall figure has remained static at 155 cases that date back to 2013.  I would like clarity on the matter.<\/p> <p>  I have serious concerns about publishing the names and addresses of people.

How will the Department prevent people from sharing the information?  Will the Department hold on to the information and publish it at a later stage?<\/p> <p>  I read about an interesting case of overpayment in the media yesterday.  The case went all of the way to the Ombudsman.  The Department chased an individual for an alleged overpayment of &euro;20,000.  The Ombudsman wrote to the Department to state that there was no way the overpayment could have happened.  I do not think that the individual concerned received an acknowledgement or correspondence from the Department.  The person took the case to the Ombudsman.  It turned out that the discrepancy had been caused by the Department and, in fact, the person was owed &euro;700 by the Department.  There are more similar cases.  Overpayment is a bigger problem than the focus that the Minister and the Department has put on this type of fraud.  I agree with Deputy O'Dea and do not condone social welfare fraud.  However, overpayment is a bigger problem.  The case that was mentioned in the media yesterday typifies this matter.  What has the Department done about overpayments?<\/p> <p>  Senator Humphreys mentioned that the Minister can cut a person's weekly social welfare payment by up to 25%.  I agree with Senator Humphreys that the provision is dangerous and that the constitutional issues involved will cause serious problems.  I do not understand the rationale behind the provision.  Small amounts of money are involved.  I cannot get my head around the provision and believe it is dangerous territory.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#E01300","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":886,"content":"<p>I wish to talk about head 4, and I raised this fraud issue a couple of weeks ago.  I find it very unsettling and deeply inflammatory that the idea has been flagged.<\/p><p>Who came up with the idea, the officials or the Minister?  This is a 21st century witch hunt of people who find themselves in a very precarious position.  The ethos of social welfare is to protect the dignity of the citizen and it is nauseating to see this humiliation and naming and shaming of people in black and white.  It is equivalent to a hate campaign.  If someone is convicted by a court of committing a fraud to the amount of &euro;1,000, will that person be named and shamed in a publication?  I find it extraordinary that this information could be in newspapers and I am not being flippant when I say it could be on the sides of buses because the way this campaign is being run is pretty horrible.  Who came up with this idea, spent so much money on it and went out with vitriol after certain people?  I do not condone social welfare fraud but I have been in court when people are routinely humiliated to the point where they are left crying and traumatised.  I have seen that at first hand.  At the same time in this country there is corporate fraud but no one is named and shamed.  There is one law for poor people and one for wealthy people.  Who came up with the idea?  What is its purpose?  How far does this go?  If this is allowed to pass into legislation what comes next?

I agree with the point about the naming campaign.  I, too, would like to know who came up with the idea.  It was interesting that Bernadette Gorman asked whether it was a solo run by the Minister or whether the Department came up with this idea.  She described it as a hate campaign because of the way it deals with people, many of them vulnerable.  It is not that they deliberately defrauded the system but that they did not understand it or there were overpayments by the Department.  A few cases have been highlighted by the Ombudsman, for example, when the mother of a woman who was mentally ill died, she was hit with a bill for &euro;105,000.  When it was investigated it turned out to be a mistake by the Department dating from 2010.  The Ombudsman, David Taylor, decided it should not be followed up.  The Department's role is to pay people, to look after them, and if there is fraud, to take the relevant action.  Naming and shaming people in this way is very dangerous.<\/p> <p>  Under head 5, when I went to the Department with people who had been overpaid, the amount deducted could not fall below a certain level to ensure a living income, but 25% goes way beyond that.

This is an issue the committee has been looking into.  In some cases the inability to secure maintenance payments has proved detrimental to the payments that people receive, including jobseeker's payment as well as the one parent family payment.  That needs to be considered if we are to be sure we are consistent in our treatment of all families, including single parent families.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the public services card, while I appreciate this legislation sets out the situations where the public services card can be used, we need to ensure it does not become a mandatory requirement in respect of these areas or access to services.  I would appreciate the witnesses' thoughts on that because in the past we have decided not to have mandatory identity cards and it is important that we do not move indirectly to that position.<\/p> <p>  In respect of decisions by automated information technology systems, that is mainly positive but there are concerns about where the data are held.  It is one thing for that to be an automated system within the Department, but will it be tendered out to private providers like the application for driver licences, for example, which is run by a database in America?  There is a data protection issue there because one has to say what state or country one might be in.  It is quite a wide data set.  It is important to know about the security of the data in that system given the data hacking that has happened recently.  Overpayment is in fact as large if not a larger concern than any hint of fraud.  Where will the liability sit for persons affected by that?  I welcome the fact the system can make only positive and not negative decisions.<\/p> <p>  Senator Humphreys has dealt strongly with head 5.  These are anti-poverty payments.  While they are allowances, they are calibrated to keep people living at a basic level.  It is the business of courts to issue fines and to seek what can be appropriately recovered after due consideration of all related facts.  If we set a precedent whereby we remove payments as an additional punishment, I would be concerned about where that would lead and what other things we would decide we would wish to punish.  These are people's entitlements as citizens of our State.  They are not a privilege granted.<\/p> <p>  The Data Protection Commissioner will have to be consulted in respect of head 4.  It might also be good to see the precedent in other countries.  This is not the same as the publication of the names of tax defaulters by the Revenue Commissioners, not simply because, as one of my colleagues said, in that case the settlements are highlighted but also because on that list information is highlighted for people who may be engaging in business with someone to ensure their payments are accurate.  It has an additional function.  There is no campaign on the side of buses saying that tax cheats cheat us all or that tax avoidance or evasion damages us all.<\/p><p>The Minister has sent the opposite signal.  It is a matter of great concern that he has cautioned against those who want billionaires living abroad to pay for everything.<\/p><p> To my mind, this is a message that not only do we not regard revenue fraud or, if not fraud, at least legitimate tax avoidance as a serious concern but the Minister does not intend to regard it as a concern because we are no longer even using the phrase \"tax exiles\".  The latter is a phrase I always thought was quite mild.  We are now talking about billionaires living abroad.  In terms of revenue settlements, I am very concerned about this matter but I would like consideration to be given to the question of the danger that may exist.  It relates to the publication of even full addresses because there is a concern that if we are publishing the addresses of persons and combining this information with a campaign which indicates that these individuals are cheating others, we are creating potential endangerment.  In such circumstances, I would like consideration to be given not just to the suitability of head 4 but also to the suitability of the specific provision of publication of actual addresses.  My final point, which has been made by others, is how do we know this information will go away after three months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#F00300","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":891,"content":"<p>Before we revert to Mr. McKeon, he has heard a number of issues.  In respect of head 4 and naming and shaming, while nobody is condoning fraud, there is concern that the ultimate sanction should be appropriate to the offence that was committed.  There is a big difference between somebody being convicted in court for a relatively small issue and somebody who has habitually committed very serious fraud, for example, by submitting multiple claims.  The question is whether the sanction and penalty are appropriate to the crime in all cases.  Are there any controls around it or will everybody be treated the same?  There are many questions that I do not want to repeat.<\/p> <p>  In respect of head 5, it was summed up best by Senator Humphreys who asked some very specific and detailed questions.  Could Mr. McKeon respond to them with the level of detail the Senator requested?  In respect of head 3, members do not disagree with what the Department is trying to do in terms of the guardian payment.  What the Department is effectively saying is that the guardian payment is not an income support for the guardian but a payment for the child.  Has the Department looked at the consequences of that for all or any other potential payments?  Maintenance payments were specifically mentioned.  The Department is saying that the payment is the child's payment, not the guardian's payment.  Does it or could it apply to other payments that are being made?  Has the Department examined that and what might be the possible impact?  Mr. McKeon or whoever feels it appropriate to answer can address those questions.  We will deal with pensions later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#G00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496307600,"counter":892,"content":"<p>I will take some of the questions and my colleagues will join in.  In respect of Deputy O'Dea's question about the full guardianship and the half-rate carer's payment, what we are essentially looking to achieve in head 3 is that if somebody already validly in receipt of a payment - be it a widow's pension or a half-rate carer's payment - the receives a guardianship payment, it will not have a negative impact on the amount of money they receive through those payments.  So the short answer to the Deputy's question is \"Yes\".  If the person is validly in receipt of a payment and meets the conditions for that payment, he or she keeps the payment.  In respect of the correlation between that and lone parents - as Senator Higgins noted, it applies to jobseekers as well - there is a difference.  In respect of lone parents, the payment is specifically to provide for maintenance of the children as well as the parent's own living expenses so the payment already includes a payment in respect of the children.  If somebody is receiving a maintenance payment from a former partner which might be quite significant , there is the question of whether we should disregard that maintenance payment.  I do not think we should.<\/p> <p>  The guardianship payment is different.  It is a payment made to somebody to recognise that they have a child who is not their own and to whom they are providing guardianship.  If they are already in receipt of a payment which does not recognise that child and the receipt of the payment, getting the payment should not have an impact.  They are two slightly different things and I do not think the issue raised by the Deputy is necessarily a valid one.  It is something we will consider and return to.  If it is an issue, we will reflect on it in the Bill but I do not think it is an issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":893,"content":"<p>What is the situation with jobseeker's payments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#G00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496307600,"counter":894,"content":"<p>In respect of jobseeker's payment, a person gets an increase for it if they already have a qualified child.  An element of the payment referred to by the Senator in terms of lone parents and jobseekers already reflects the fact that a person is minding a child.  If the person is then getting a payment from elsewhere to cover some of the costs of minding that child, it is appropriate for us to take account of that payment in assessing it for means.  If someone is in receipt of a widow's pension, which does not take account of the fact that they are guarding a child who is not their own, receipt of a payment for that guardian should not affect the person's widow's payment.  They are the two examples.  That is the difference.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea asked a question about the recovery of supplementary welfare allowance and how those people will qualify for disability allowance in any event.  It does not always happen.  In order to be on disability allowance, a person must be pretty much disabled for at least 12 months.  There are people who receive personal injury awards where it might be a six, eight or nine-month period and they would not be eligible for disability allowance in that situation.  That is what it is to provide for.<\/p> <p>  In the context of an appeal on an automated decision, I agree that it is quite strange, particularly when one considers why somebody would appeal a positive decision.  The reason we have that provision is because we are very conscious that the general data protection regulation, which comes into force next year, only allows automated decisions if there is an appeals process and does not distinguish between whether the automated decision is positive or negative.  A public authority can only implement an automated decision process if there is an appeals process against that in legislation, so we are doing it to comply with the general data protection regulation.<\/p> <p>  The issue relating to head 7 is that it will not necessarily result in reduced fees.  At the moment, because the General Register Office was previously the responsibility of the Minister for Health and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Social Protection, there is provision in two different Acts for the setting of reduced fees.  We are just trying to clarify that it is the Minister for Social Protection who has the power to set reduced fees.  The Minister has no intention of increasing fees.  It is just about cleaning up the legislation so that rather than having two Ministers with power to set reduced fees, just one will have that power.  That is the sole purpose of it.

I will do my best to deal with as many of them as possible.  It is important to put on the record that the Department strongly believes that the majority of people who claim social welfare payments do so legitimately.  They get what they are entitled to.  However, there is an element of fraud and the measures set out in heads 4 and 5 are very much directed at those people.<\/p> <p>  People will be familiar with the figure of &euro;41 million which we raised in fraud overpayments last year out of a total of &euro;110 million that we raised in respect of overpayments.  As members are aware, the provisions in head 4 are about publishing the names and addresses of and penalties that have been applied to people who are convicted in court of fraud.  I note that Deputy O'Dea spoke to the Minister about this during parliamentary questions yesterday.  We very much see this as legislation that raises awareness of the consequences of social welfare fraud.  There is no doubt that these cases get covered in the provincial press and the media in other quarters.  What does not happen, however, is the publication of a consolidated list.  The latter is what we are trying to do in the context of this head.  The Data Protection Commissioner offered her views on it.  Her main concern related to the issue of proportionality.  We feel we have addressed that because the list will be published for three months and will then come down.  We will be making sure that there are safeguards in place to ensure that once the list comes down, it can no longer be accessible.  The names will be up for three months and will not be accessible after that.  We will make sure that happens.  This is very much part of our intent regarding the head.<\/p><p>That is where we are.  We see this as an awareness-raising exercise, pulling the names together.  Only offences that are committed after the publication of the Bill will be subject to publication.  Last year we concluded 188 cases in court under our own social welfare legislation, and roughly two thirds of those resulted in a conviction.  The numbers from our own legislation are relatively small, but that is the context.  <\/p><p> I will move on to head 5, which the members have raised a number of issues on.  One of the questions raised was whether we had consulted with the Attorney General.  We did.  The main concern that the Attorney General raised was around the area of discretion, and that there would not be an automatic disqualification but rather a discretion for our deciding officers to make that call depending on the circumstances of the particular case.  The individual circumstances of the individual would be taken into account and that would be part of the proposal.

The proposal under head 5 is to put an additional punishment on top of that.  That is a constitutional issue.  It is also covered by previous Supreme Court cases.  There is a political agenda here rather than a legal agenda, and there is a clear breach in the constitutional rights of citizens.

No other public bodies or private commercial bodies may request the public services card other than those listed in that schedule.

We have always used primary legislation as the means of adding any bodies to that list.  We have done that very deliberately and specifically to allow for debate in the House and to allow for it to be as public as possible.  It is the intention that public bodies would use the public services card as a means of authenticating the identity of its customers.  That has always been the intention since the Government made that specific decision back in 2005.  It is absolutely also the case that private sector bodies would not be allowed to request a public service card for any commercial transactions, and the way that we ensure that that happens is by making sure that only those bodies specified in legislation can seek it.<\/p><p>There is no danger of it going beyond that, unless the Government chooses to allow it to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#H02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":917,"content":"<p>Can we expect new public bodies which will be permitted under legislation to use the public services card may to make it mandatory?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#J00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496307600,"counter":918,"content":"<p>The bodies are not new.

There have been a few added since but, by and large, the bulk of them have been in existence since this process started.  It is important to remember that the public services card is a means of authenticating the identity of an individual seeking a service, which happens anyway.  For example, to apply for or renew a passport, a person must appear in person at a Garda station and present a garda with a great deal of information, including, possibly, documentary information.  The garda records the information in a ledger.  If the Passport Office chooses to require a person to produce a public services card, it will be used instead of that process.  The registration process will be changed such that instead of a person having to appear at a Garda station, he or she will have to produce a public services card.  To get a public services card a person must engage in a face-to-face process with an officer of the Department of Social Protection, who authenticates his or her identity.  It is a once in a lifetime process.  A public services card establishes identity to a far greater extent and hugely conveniences the customer in that to apply for or renew a passport, he or she will never again be required to turn up at a Garda station to have his or her identity authenticated.  The same applies to a driver's licence.  Currently, to apply for or renew a driver's licence, a person must appear at a location operated by the Road Safety Authority and go through a process of proving identity, have his or her photograph taken and produce documents and so on.  The Road Safety Authority is planning to dispense with all of that process in preference of using the public services card because the registration process used for the public services card is better than the one it operates.  Again, it massively conveniences the customer in the sense that he or she will never have to go through that process again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":919,"content":"<p>I appreciate that it is a process that is increasingly being used as more bodies become involved and that the public services card is effectively an identity card.

I read some documentation that confirmed that as of 31 December 2015, 60% of defined benefit schemes were in compliance with the funding standard, while the rest were subject to funding proposals.  In other words, there were only nine schemes outstanding.  Does the Bill provide for only nine schemes?  I imagine that on 31 December 2016 all but nine were in order because they were in compliance with the legislation or had agreed to a funding arrangement.  The number of non-compliant schemes is probably less than nine or close to zero.<\/p> <p>  I refer to head 12 which provides for a notice period of 12 months before there is a triggering.  There are varying periods of notice and different trust instruments.  The time period involved is usually three to six months.  We are providing for extra months.  That is welcome and I support the proposal, but whether it will make a significant difference is another matter.  It has been represented to me that in some cases it could make matters worse, as members might be accruing benefits at a rate greater than the level of contributions.  In other words, the longer things go on, the worst the deficit will ultimately be.  If a scheme is seriously underfunded and an employee has to continue funding it, as he or she would usually have to do if an employer continued to fund it, the benefits will be reduced, which would be a waste of money for the employee.  Surely it would be better, in such a situation, to have the option of putting an employee's money into a defined benefit scheme?  In many cases, one finds that when there is a difficulty, an employer has been contributing at a level below that required by the trustees.  As I read it, 12 seems to preserve that position during the 12 month period involved.  While the provision contained in it requires consultation with members, it does not ensure their views will be implemented.  Typically, pensions legislation involves consultation, but, at the end of the day, others make the decision.  On reading the head, it appears that deferred members are put on the same level as everybody else but lot of commentary on it suggests otherwise.  We, therefore, need clarification in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Head 13 states the Pensions Authority can put a payment system in place.  I may be wrong, but on my reading of it, it seems that all an employer will have to do to prevent the process from being triggered is to enter into discussions.  The Bill does not require an employer to agree to a funding proposal.  In these circumstances the Pensions Authority cannot impose a funding rate as the employer has not failed to enter into negotiations and pay contributions under a funding proposal because there is no such proposal in place.<\/p> <p>  On the head dealing with equality, I have received correspondence, as I am sure everybody else has, from an organisation on pensions equality, to which the Chairman drew my attention yesterday.  I subsequently received a hard copy of the documentation.  The organisation represents a small group of people, mainly retired public servants, and makes a number of points.  On this head, it claims that people are being denied an entitlement to survivor's pension for a same-sex spouse because they were unable to marry the person they wished to marry before they retired.  The group also states the current legislation restricts access to the Circuit Court, unlike other equality claims under equality legislation for which the usual forum is the Workplace Relations Commission.  Why not include a reference to both?  The group raises a legitimate point in that regard.  It also states public servants, following acceptance of the constitutional amendment, have an entitlement to a survivor's pension for a same-sex spouse but that the payment is not being calculated based on the entirety of their service.  <\/p> <p>  I ask the officials to address those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#K01700","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":958,"content":"<p>Deputy Willie O'Dea referred to a specific document from the group Pension Equality.

Consequently, depending on what is happening at any given moment in time, something could disimprove from the time an employer announces it will cease contributions.  The provisions make allowance for the notice period being reduced.  It is a very deliberate provision to facilitate a discussion between the trustees and the employer where they believe the situation the Deputy referred to could arise.  In that case they would allow for a shorter period.  It has to be by agreement between the trustees and the employer rather than being unilaterally imposed by one side.  <\/p> <p>  The issue of the contributions during the period being below that required was raised.  The legislation sets out that the employer must make the proper contributions during the period of dialogue, namely the 12-month notification period.  If they do not do that and stay with a lesser contribution, they will be in breach of the law.  <\/p> <p>  The issue was raised about consultation being meaningless.  The trustees are required under law to act in the best interests of all of the members of the scheme, which means they must engage in dialogue with the members - active, deferred and pensioners - and seek their views.  There will obviously be differences of opinion across those three constituencies.  They will have to try to balance those against what they know to be the position with respect to the employer and their capability for funding.  I fully accept sometimes it is better to have hard and fast imposition through legislation but in this situation it could be as detrimental as it could be beneficial.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy suggested an employer would only have to enter into discussions and that the Pensions Authority piece, if I can call it that, would be unable to kick in because the employer did not fail to enter into a funding proposal.  That is not the case.  Under the head, a funding proposal must be made within a defined period of time.  If it is not made within that period of time, the Pensions Authority will have the power to impose a contribution schedule.  If they do not enter into discussions and therefore the trustee is unable to make an agreed funding proposal the provision will kick in.  If they enter into discussions but are unable to agree a funding proposal with the trustees the provision will kick in.  It is tighter than the Deputy suggested.  The backstop is there regardless of what level of engagement the employer has with the trustees.  <\/p> <p>  I have not seen the pension equality report.  We will do our best to respond to it within the time the Chairman suggested if it is possible.  I am saying it blind.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan"},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":963,"content":"<p>If it is not possible, let us know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#L00400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496307600,"counter":964,"content":"<p>I will.

Last year, I proposed a Report Stage amendment to the Social Welfare Bill in respect to a similar scheme.  This particular approach has been taken because I identified the concerns about solvent firms.  One of the criteria I suggested is such a firm would not be able to close a defined benefit scheme until it had reached 90% of its funding standard.  I appreciate notice is required but I have some concern about the early wind-up of a scheme.  Head 7 says a reduced period can only be agreed where it is in the best interest of members.  It is not very clear how the best interest of members is to be determined.  It mentions a consultation period and that its form will be prescribed.  Where will the ultimate determinant of the best interest of members fit?  Will it be solely with the trustees?  Will there be objective measures?  I am not suggesting my version was perfect because it absolutely was not.  There are many versions.  Will there be objective standards in terms of the best interest of members to ensure a minimal return for example?<\/p> <p>  I share the concerns about the employer entering negotiation.  Is there any limit to the period in which an employer could avoid the impact of head 13, which provides that the Pension Authority could set out a schedule of contributions because there has been a prolonged period of negotiation?  I have those two specific concerns.  Others have addressed the concern about pension equality and whether it will be possible to extend the period in respect of post-retirement spousal benefit so that it would also apply to schemes where persons have retired already but have been adversely impacted.  <\/p> <p>   My final question is on something that will be the subject of an amendment.<\/p><p>We can discuss it in more detail at a later date.<\/p><p> The other major pension inequality in Ireland is pension inequality for women and the acknowledged disparity in the averaging system that is impacting people in two ways.  The refusal to backdate and address what is acknowledged as an unfair system means that people who have made the same amount of contributions as others are disadvantaged by the averaging rules.  The second impact is the embedding of further losses for people affected by that unfair system as a result of the 2012 changes.  I would respectfully suggest that either the 2012 changes are reversed or a measure to address the problems of averaging, pending the move to a total contribution approach, is introduced, or both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017060100002#L02000","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496307600,"counter":981,"content":"<p>Thank you Senator.
