No apologies have been received and we will deal with the business to be transacted by the committee tomorrow in the normal manner.<\/p><p>The topic on the agenda for this meeting is matters related to the submission to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of financial statements for 2017.  This is an issue we have been watching closely since the last general election.  It came to light on a couple of occasions when people were before to discuss accounts that, in some cases, were three years out of date.  We found that to be an unacceptable practice, but it does not apply to any of the organisations represented today.  We took a detailed look at the time organisations were taking to submit their accounts for audit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has produced a couple of reports in the past couple of years on the timeliness of organisations in submitting their financial statements for audit and there has been an improvement.  Last year's report highlighted the education sector as being the worst in the public sector in the submission of accounts and some time ago we decided to meet the organisations concerned.  It was noted that of the 16 or 17 education and training boards, only one had submitted its financial statements for audit by the end of March of the following year.  That was unsatisfactory and we invited four boards to come before us, including the one which had met the deadline to show that it could be done.  We asked for the position to improve across the public service and were pleased to note at the last meeting that every single education and training board had its financial statements for 2017 in before the end of March this year.  That is a fantastic improvement.<\/p><p>As the year progressed, I sent a letter to all of the organisations the accounts of which are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General to remind them of the importance of getting accounts in on time, saying we would follow up in the new year.  We waited until the end of April, when the Comptroller and Auditor General informed the committee that there were 37 organisations which had not submitted their accounts for audit before the end of March.  The committee decided to invite four organisations to explain why.  We picked the four that are represented today based on the fact that they were substantial organisations with a major turnover.  They are the Local Government Fund, the National Training Fund, the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Abbey Theatre.  We are grateful to their representatives for coming.  We wrote separately to the other 33 organisations to ask for a written explanation as to why their accounts had not been submitted on time.<\/p><p>We believe the submission of annual financial statements is an essential element of good corporate governance which in any organisation starts from the top.  When an organisation does not submit its accounts in a timely manner, it raises a number of questions about it, which is why we are here.  We are joined by the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills in respect of the National Training Fund, the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in respect of the Local Government Fund and the directors of the ESRI and the Abbey Theatre.  I do not expect this to be a long meeting, but I am grateful to the witnesses for coming.  Part of the purpose is to demonstrate that the Committee of Public Accounts is taking a proactive role in improving corporate governance in the submission of accounts and financial information because we cannot do our work if we do not have accounts to examine.  We are joined by Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, who is accompanied by Mr. Maurice Coughlan, principal officer; Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, who is accompanied by Mr. Keith Moynes, principal officer; Professor Alan Barrett, director of the ESRI, who is accompanied by Mr. Charles O&rsquo;Regan, company secretary and head of finance; and Mr. Neil Murray, director and chief executive officer, the Abbey Theatre, who is accompanied by Mr. Denis Reeves, interim director of finance and administration.<\/p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.<\/p><p>They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p> Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 indicating that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee members clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol that has been circulated.  <\/p><p> I thank the witnesses for submitting their opening statements and the progress in respect of the matter at hand.  I understand the Department of Education and Skills has submitted the accounts for the National Training Fund for audit on 15 May 2018.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government submitted the accounts of the Local Government Fund for audit on 17 May 2018.  The ESRI has submitted the accounts for audit on 10 May 2018.  The Abbey Theatre submitted its accounts on 4 May 2018.  From the public accounts point of view, mission accomplished.  <\/p><p> We, as the Committee of Public Accounts want to send a signal to all public bodies that we expect accounts to be prepared not for the sake of producing financial statements but as an indication of the level of corporate governance, because as the Secretaries General all know, it is a function of the Secretary General or Accounting Officer or the board of directors to submit their accounts for audit.  Failure to do so in a timely manner does not reflect well on corporate governance.  That is what we are clear about.<\/p><p> We will take the four opening statements in the following sequence.  We will start with Mr. McCarthy from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, to be followed by Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; from the Department of Education and Skills; Professor Barrett from the ESRI and Mr. Murray from the Abbey Theatre. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052300002#B01200","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527091200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before the committee.  The committee is considering the timeliness of submission of annual accounts for audit.  I know this is an issue that is of keen interest to the committee and to the Chairman.  At the outset let me place on record that compliance with our obligations in this regard is also a key priority for my Department and for me as Accounting Officer for the reasons of good governance, as pointed out by the Chairman.<br\/><br\/>The issue which I wish to address specifically relates to the Local Government Fund, LGF.  The LGF, as the fund is known, was established in 1999 under legislative provisions introduced through the Local Government Act 1998.  In terms of the preparation of the annual accounts of the fund, the relevant provision of the Act is section 3(5), which provides as follows: <\/p><blockquote>As soon as may be after the end of each financial year, the Minister shall submit the accounts of the Fund to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit and the Minister shall cause a copy of an abstract of the accounts as so audited together with a copy of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General thereon to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.<\/blockquote> <p>There is therefore no statutory deadline for the preparation and presentation of the draft annual accounts of the LGF to the Comptroller and Auditor General, a position which also applies in relation to a number of other funds, as recognised in last year's special report on financial reporting by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  However, there is a very clear statutory requirement to produce the accounts as soon as may be after the end of the year.  That is a duty that we take very seriously along with all of our other statutory requirements in relation to the preparation of accounts.  <br\/><br\/>In that context, it is important to note that there is a statutory financial reporting requirement to submit the Appropriation Account for the Department's Vote by 31 March each year.  The production of the Appropriation Account and the engagement with the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Vote audit have to take priority for the Accounting Officer in the early part of the year.  This has been a longstanding practice and to my knowledge has never been identified as an issue of concern by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In addition to the Appropriation Account having to take priority, given the statutory deadline that attaches to it, it should also be noted that the LGF is a very detailed and complex account to prepare as the Department has to receive and reconcile annual returns from 26 local authority motor tax offices as part of the process and the turnover involved for 2017 for the fund is in excess of &euro;1.8 billion.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding all of that, the Department is committed to an expeditious and timely submission of the annual accounts.  This is demonstrated by the fact that a preliminary draft excluding the related notes of the 2017 LGF account was submitted to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on 18 April 2018, barely two weeks after the Appropriation Accounts have been completed.  While this did not include all of the notes associated with the account, I understand it did allow significant progress on the audit to be made by the Comptroller's audit team.  As the Chairman mentioned, the final draft of the 2017 account with the associated notes has also now been completed and was submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General on 17 May.<br\/><br\/>Taking account of the range of financial reporting requirements to be met, I am satisfied that we have discharged our responsibility to submit the accounts of the LGF as soon as may be after the end of the year in question with the period of time involved decreasing significantly in the past ten years.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the absence of a specific statutory deadline, we continue to strive to shorten the period for the preparation of the annual accounts of the fund.  In that context with the fund undergoing significant restructuring this year, with motor tax now being remitted directly to the Exchequer rather than to the fund and a number of payments that were previously made from the LGF now being made from voted moneys, we will be looking to again shorten the time period for the preparation of the 2018 accounts for the fund.  Specifically, we will be aiming to have the draft 2018 accounts completed by the end of March 2019, subject, of course, to prioritising the work on the 2018 Appropriation Account and also just to mention it, it needs to take account of any potential implications that may arise from the fact that the Department will be likely to be moving to a new financial management shared service centre in 2019<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address an issue which I know is of keen interest to the Chairman and members and one which is also taken very seriously by me and by the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052300002#C00150","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1527091200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I am attending today at the request of the committee to discuss timing in respect to the presentation of the National Training Fund, NTF, accounts.<\/p> <p>  The NTF was established by the National Training Fund Act 2000 as a dedicated fund to support the training of those in employment and those seeking employment and to provide for the funding of research to provide information on existing and likely future skills requirements of the economy.  It has been the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills since May 2010.<\/p> <p>  I want to highlight at the outset that the Department is acutely conscious of the importance of meeting statutory and other deadlines for presentation of accounts.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has raised concerns in this regard in his special reports on financial reporting in the public sector, and I know, as the Chairman has indicated, that this is an issue on which the committee has put considerable emphasis.<\/p> <p>  Informed by the views of the committee and Comptroller and Auditor General during the past year the Department has prioritised this issue, and has worked with bodies across the education sector to strengthen compliance, particularly where statutory deadlines are in place.  Considerable progress has been made across the Department&rsquo;s aegis bodies and in the ETB and higher education sectors.  I appreciate that this progress has been acknowledged by the committee.<\/p> <p>  In this context, it is important to say that the Department did not regard the NTF accounts as being comprehended by the committee&rsquo;s correspondence of 20 December 2017 which concerned &ldquo;the failure of public bodies to meet obligations, statutory or otherwise, in relation to the timely presentation of annual financial statements&rdquo;.  We did not take the view that we were failing to meet any defined obligations in respect of the NTF.<\/p> <p>  As acknowledged in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report number 95 on Financial Reporting in the Public Sector, no specific deadlines are in place in respect of certain departmental funds.  This includes the National Training Fund, NTF.<\/p> <p>  The NTF accounts are prepared in line with the terms of the National Training Fund Act 2000, and specifically section 2(14) which states, among other things, that &ldquo;Accounts of the Fund shall be prepared on an annual basis, in such form and in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct&rdquo;.  Neither the National Training Fund Act, nor any other legislation, provides for a statutory deadline for production, signature or certification of the NTF accounts.  As regards non-statutory obligations, there are no circulars, codes of practice or other guidance which set out a specific deadline for production of the NTF accounts.<\/p> <p>  In practice, given the imperative of meeting the statutory deadline for production of the Appropriation Accounts by 31 March, it has been the longstanding position that production of the Department&rsquo;s Appropriation Accounts and engagement with the Comptroller and Auditor General audit of the Vote are given priority in the first part of the year.<\/p><p>Since the establishment of the National Training Fund in 2000, finalisation of its accounts has, without exception, always taken place subsequent to the submission of the Appropriation Accounts.  Most recently, I signed the 2017 accounts on 15 May and they were conveyed to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the same day.  This long-standing position has not been flagged as an issue of concern by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in NTF management letters of recent years, nor has it been listed as a discussion item in recent post-audit engagements between the Department and the auditors.  Therefore, I am satisfied that the Department has met its obligations to date in respect of the fund.  However, I can also appreciate that, from the committee&rsquo;s perspective in looking across the entire public sector, it is desirable to have a greater level of consistency in meeting deadlines for the submission of accounts.  To that end, I have set a specific deadline for the submission of the NTF accounts to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of 31 March following the year of account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052300002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527091200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.

We have been asked to appear before the committee to explain why our draft 2017 accounts had not been presented to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General by 31 March.  We are happy to have the opportunity to provide the explanation.  <\/p> <p>  By way of context, I will provide a brief outline of how the ESRI is funded.  It is a company established in the private sector.  However, almost all of its funding comes from public sources.  It receives an annual grant-in-aid from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In 2018 the grant is &euro;2.8 million.  The institute receives additional funding from a range of other Departments and State agencies, for which it agrees to conduct research projects of particular interest to them.  In total, it has an annual income of approximately &euro;10 million.  Given the public funds provided for it, the institute is committed to maintaining the highest standards of governance and financial management.  We have worked closely during the years with our parent Department, originally the Department of Finance and now the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to ensure frameworks and processes whereby the funds provided for the institute are managed to the highest standards.  One element of the overall framework has been the presence of a senior official from the Department of Finance and then the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the board of the institute.  We operate under an oversight agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which was provided for us in March 2017.  We also liaise closely with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  To my knowledge, we have always provided information for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in a timely manner when requested by it.<\/p> <p>  I turn to the specific issue of the timing of the submission of our 2017 accounts.  As the committee knows, in January we received the letter from the Chairman sent to all bodies audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the general requirement to produce annual accounts for audit within three months of the end of the financial year.  Based on our interpretation of our ongoing interactions with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, at the start of the year we expected the timing of the accounts process to run as in previous years.  We planned to submit our accounts to our audit committee for review at its May meeting and subsequently send them to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  At the time we received the Chairman's letter, our accounts department was under some pressure owing to staff absences related to sick leave.  This meant that bringing forward the accounts would be challenging.  Arising from this, we emailed the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on 2 February to seek clarity on the three-month requirement.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in its response to our email did not specify that the ESRI was required to meet the three-month deadline.  As the email went on to discuss the arrangements for the audit of the 2017 accounts without reference to the three-month deadline, we took this to mean that the deadline did not apply.  On that basis, we continued with the previous schedule.  The draft accounts were reviewed by the audit committee at its meeting on 8 May and sent to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on 10 May.<\/p> <p>  On reflection, I regret that I did not seek further clarification from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General around the time of our correspondence related to the Chairman&rsquo;s letter.  I took the absence of a positive statement on our question as implying that the institute was not being asked to comply with the three-month deadline, but that was a mistake on my part.  Looking ahead, the ESRI will, of course, meet the three-month deadline in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Barrett"},{"type":"speech","time":1527091200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Barrett.

The Abbey Theatre acknowledges receipt of the correspondence, dated 12 January 2018, from the Chairman on the requirement for the prompt reporting of annual financial results.  I regret that this letter was not acknowledged, as requested, and that the issues raised in the letter were not the subject of follow-up discussions with representatives of the committee or the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It was, unfortunately, the case that Chairman&rsquo;s letter arrived in the week when the theatre&rsquo;s long-standing director of finance and administration left on 19 January.  Our interim director of finance and administration, Mr. Reeves, took up his post on 28 January.  I express my sincere apologies.<\/p> <p>  It has been the long-standing custom and practice of the Abbey Theatre to present the draft accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s team on its arrival at the theatre to carry out the annual audit.  In previous years the team arrived in February or March.  For example, the audit of the 2016 financial statements began on 27 February 2017.  Subsequently, the audited financial statements were approved by the board of the theatre on 5 May and later published on its website.  In 2018 the starting date of the audit was significantly later.  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s team arrived at the theatre on 4 May to carry out the audit of the 2017 financial statements.  At the time, the team received the draft accounts, on which it is working with the theatre.  In line with the later starting date of the audit this year, it has been planned to submit the financial statements to the board at its meeting scheduled on 30 July, having been reviewed by the audit and risk committee of the theatre at its meeting scheduled to take place on 16 July.  The board was provided with estimates of the provisional outturn for 2017 at its meeting on 31 January.  The plan corresponds approximately to the length of time required for the accounts finalisation process in 2017, albeit, regrettably on our part, with a starting time that is nine weeks later.<\/p> <p>  During the course of 2017 the Abbey Theatre was engaged in discussions with the Arts Council, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Comptroller and Auditor General on the 2016 code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  While the theatre is not required by law to follow the code, I am pleased to advise the committee that the board has decided, in line with best practice, to implement it.  Its current plans are to implement all relevant aspects of the code in the period 2017 to 2019.  This process is well under way.  Implementation of the code, as approved by the board, will see the theatre achieving compliance by 31 December 2019.  This decision was communicated formally to the Comptroller and Auditor General by way of a response contained in the management letter, dated 16 February 2018.<\/p> <p>  I assure the Chairman that the board and the executive of the Abbey Theatre will put in place the appropriate actions to ensure that in future years the requirements set by the committee to have the annual financial statements ready for audit by 31 March of the following year will be met in full.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052300002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1527091200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murray.

In his final points, he made reference to the fact that the fund is undergoing significant restructuring this year with the motor tax receipts now being remitted directly to the Exchequer rather than to the fund and that will shorten the time period for the preparation of the 2018 accounts for the fund.  Can he elaborate, for my benefit and the benefit of other members, and particularly many interested others?  The overall fund was &euro;1.8 billion, which is a significant amount of money.<\/p><p>The motor tax element accounts for &euro;1.1 billion of that, so this is a very significant amount of money.

That was 20 years ago, and we have gone through four, if not five, reconfigurations in the meantime.  I was before this committee in March and made the point - and I believe Deputy Connolly made the same point the year before - that the fund, through those four or five reconfigurations, had outlived its usefulness in terms of the form it took because it had become very complex in terms of money going in and out for a range of functions which are now much more widely distributed across a range of Government Departments.  We put a position to Government last year on this matter and it agreed that we should simplify things.  In 2018 that means that motor tax no longer goes into the Local Government Fund but goes straight to the Exchequer and so will be accounted for in the general finance accounts in the same way as other taxation streams that go straight to the Exchequer are accounted for, and that the Local Government Fund, with effect from this year, will primarily become a fund from which local property tax is taken in and paid out to local authorities.  In quantum terms, the revenue position and the expenditure position of the fund in 2017 would have been about &euro;1.8 billion, as I mentioned in my opening statement.  The effect of the streamlining and the changes that are introduced this year bring that back to about &euro;600 million.

IPRT views gaps in mental health provision as one symptom of wider social exclusion and is intrinsically linked to criminal justice and penal policy.  The committee can refer to the briefing provided for the detailed sources supporting our key points but during this oral hearing, we will highlight those which we consider most pertinent.<\/p> <p>  The level of mental ill-health difficulty in the Irish penal system is overwhelming in both its scale and complexity, and the challenges are growing daily.  Walking through our prisons, that current reality is evident on every landing and every wing and ranges from the severely psychiatrically unwell to those experiencing anxiety and depression.  This should come as no surprise.  The experiences which precede incarceration are often marked by multiple vulnerabilities, including adversity, trauma, abuse, violence, addiction, and experiences of care, poverty and homelessness.  The experience of prison itself such as overcrowding, enforced solitude, lack of privacy, lack of meaningful activity, violence, isolation, insecurity about future prospects and broken family relationships compounds those problems.  It can actively exacerbate existing mental health issues, heighten vulnerability and increase the risk of self-harm and suicide.  Why then does the State continue to warehouse those with the most complex needs in prisons that of themselves both cause and exacerbate existing mental illness?<\/p> <p>  A decade ago, 3% of the prison population had a severe, enduring and disabling mental illness such as schizophrenia.  Since 2015, this has more than doubled to 7% to 8% of the prison population.  A 2005 study on the prevalence of mental illness among prisoners in Ireland showed that for sentenced prisoners taking into account all mental illnesses, the rate for men was 27% and for women almost twice that level, at 60%.  More recently, those working on the ground report to the IPRT that even higher overall levels of need are present and, within that, there are increasing complexities and multiple vulnerabilities.  In addition, our prison population is rising.  After a period of relative stability, more and more of those convicted have been sentenced to prison and our female prisons are consistently overcrowded.  At the same time, both the Central Mental Hospital and the Irish Prison Service face difficulty recruiting sufficient staff to meet the overwhelming need.<\/p> <p>  In 2015 the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, CPT, said: \"Irish prisons continue to detain persons with psychiatric disorders too severe to be properly cared for in a prison setting.\"  The committee recommended that Irish authorities enhance the availability of beds in psychiatric care facilities for acute mentally unwell prisoners.  It particularly queried the level of psychiatric care provided at Castlerea Prison and the long waiting list for the CMH.  Similar concerns were voiced in 2011, yet seven years later there is still a lengthy waiting list for the CMH, there is no psychiatrist at Castlerea Prison and we still have the lowest ratio of psychiatric beds in Europe.  The CPT will return to Ireland next year to inspect our prisons.  After this hearing has concluded and after the Oireachtas committee report is published, will the committee witness the same indefensible state of affairs they saw three years ago?  I ask this committee to consider in the coming years what will have changed.<\/p><p>While the focus of this hearing is on psychiatric care, the terms of reference of this committee is to look at the future of mental health broadly in Ireland.  A properly resourced mental healthcare profession in the community at the earliest point and especially for children will reduce the number of those coming into contact with adult criminal justice system.  Researchers and clinicians agree that early mental health assessment is required in order to prevent escalation of need.<br\/><br\/>On 14 May,<b><\/b>the<b><i><\/i><\/b><i>Irish Examiner <\/i>reported that almost 2,700 children are currently on the list for mental health appointments with 368 having waited over 12 months.  This has been described as a service reaching crisis point.  Failing to resource the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, increases the number who end up in our penal system.  In Oberstown in April of this year, there were concerns for 23 out of 50 young people in respect of their mental health, 13 had a history of self-harm and 32 had been misusing alcohol and-or drugs prior to detention.<br\/><br\/>Mental health care provision in the community is also especially relevant to continuity of care on release.<b><\/b>While prison-based medical personnel make great efforts to create these links, they report there is effectively no adult psychology service available to which to refer in the community.<br\/><br\/>We note that the committee has been specifically tasked with examining the &quot;significant challenges in the recruitment and retention of skilled personnel&quot;.  The current ratio of senior psychologists to prisoners is in the region of 1:260 but should be in the region of approximately 1:150.  A Vision for Change recommended that &quot;[w]here mental health services are delivered in the context of prison, they should be person-centred, recovery-oriented and based on evolved and integrated plans.&rdquo;  It is simply not possible to deliver that level of service to all who need it in a situation where prisons cannot recruit a sufficient number of psychologists.<br\/><br\/>High support units provide expert support to prisoners who are in an acutely disturbed phase of mental illness as a short-term intervention within the prison.  There are currently only two in operation but it has been recommended that one is required in all prisons.<br\/><br\/>The number of secure forensic beds for the mentally ill is currently the lowest in Europe at two per 100,000.  As of April 2018, 26 prisoners were awaiting transfer to the Central Mental Hospital, CMH, from prison.  There is no published data of how long each individual prisoner waits to be transferred but it appears that many lower on the waiting list for a transfer are unlikely to be transferred due to the lack of available spaces.<br\/><br\/>Twelve years ago, A Vision for Change recommended that the CMH &ldquo;be replaced or remodelled to allow it to provide care and treatment in a modern, up to date humane setting&quot; and to maximise capacity.  With the opening of the new facility at Portrane, the psychologist-prisoner ratio of 2:100,000 is likely to only reduce to 3.5:100,000, which is still well below European average.  The alarming growth in the prison population during the past six months makes this situation even more concerning.<br\/><br\/>The Report of the Commission of Investigation into the Death of Gary Douch was published in May 2014 and found at that time there was &quot;reckless disregard for the health and safety&quot; of prisoners and staff alike in a decision taken to transfer a prisoner who had been assessed as &quot;acutely psychotic&quot; to Mountjoy Prison.  At that, I commented that &quot;if there can be any positive legacy at all from this tragedy then it should be that concrete and effective changes will be swiftly introduced&quot;.  That report contained 35 recommendations specifically in the area of mental healthcare and treatment in Irish prisons.  Four years later, while an interdepartmental group was set up in 2012 it is unclear to what extent, if any, those responsible for implementation have taken action. <br\/><br\/>In April 2018, more than 500 prisoners in our prisons were on a restricted regime with the majority of those prisoners held on 21-hour lock up.  This practice is detrimental to any prisoner's mental health.  The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, CPT, has recommended that the maximum period an individual spends in solitary confinement is 15 days and beyond that point the psychological damage may become irreversible.  Similarly, suicides are over-represented among the prison population. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>In brief, the human reality of the combination of failures to provide sufficient mental health services at an early point, coupled with the failure to provide sufficient spaces in our acute and psychiatric facilities along with tough-on-crime rhetoric, results in: mentally unwell women in the D&oacute;chas Centre sharing cells; prison staff trying to cope with high numbers in unsuitable facilities; and Ireland contemplating a bleak future in which nothing has changed and nothing changes.<br\/><br\/>In our view there are many things that can be done to start to improve the situation, which we have set out in our briefing document.  In short, before prison, we propose: more investment and use of prevention and early intervention supports; urgently addressing the current waiting list for children and young people could be urgently addressed; the development of  diversion schemes in courts and police stations; and in respect of Central Mental Hospital to ensure sufficient spaces and provide sufficient deal to deal with those with severe mental illness.  In prison, we propose: solitary confinement should be prohibited and access to justice for those in solitary confinement; implementation of the recommendations of the Report of the Commission of Investigation into the Death of Gary Douch; the provision of  enough prison psychologists to reach an appropriate ratio; ensuring all prisons have a high support unit; ensuring single cell accommodation for every prisoner; and to make mental health training available for every prison staff member.  After prison, we propose the making of links to the community, linking with psychology supports or to make them available if they do not exist. <br\/><br\/>We urge the committee to do everything that is within its power to make an impact on the ground for those who are currently suffering in our prisons and detention schools and those staff and professionals who are trying to cope with an untenable situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018052300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Malone","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527079200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Malone.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Enda Kelly, a national operational nurse manager.  I hope the information we and the other representatives provide will assist in viewing solutions to help prisoners who are suffering from a mental illness.<\/p> <p>  The management of persons committed to prison presenting with severe and enduring mental illness is one of the major challenges to effective healthcare in prisons.  There is evidence from the national forensic mental health service team, which is supported by our healthcare staff, of an increasing number of prisoners requiring treatment for mental health issues within our prisoners.<\/p> <p>  On 18 May, we had just under 4,000 prisoners in custody.  Of that number, 323 were on the caseload of the national forensic team and they were deemed to be suffering from severe mental illness.  Behind that group, there are another several hundred prisoners.  <\/p> <p>  The national forensic mental health team at the CMH provides an in-service to us.  It also provides a court diversion service to the Irish Prison Service.  This includes consultant forensic psychiatrists, non-consultant hospital doctors, community forensic psychiatric nurses, social workers and other staff.  The standards of care for the provision of services to prisoners with mental health difficulties include assessment, prison in-reach and ongoing treatment within the prison setting or escalation to the forensic team at the CMH.  The prison in-reach arrangements provided by the national forensic mental health team are an excellent example of partnership working and provide an invaluable service to a significant body of prisoners who suffer from a severe mental disorder.  The in-reach team to prisons has expanded in recent years with additional consultants, nursing and social work resources.  Approval was granted by the HSE in 2016 to provide consultant-led mental health services to Limerick, Cork and Castlerea prisons, which was a most welcome development.  However, it has not been possible for the HSE to recruit consultant forensic psychiatrists for those three prisons. <\/p> <p>  Significant problems have been experienced in Castlerea Prison specifically as the national forensic mental health service in-reach to that prison was discontinued in April.  Regrettably, that has resulted in the necessity to transfer very ill prisoners from Castlerea to a Dublin prison for assessment, which is not only problematic from a logistical perspective but it is less than ideal for those suffering from a major mental illness.<\/p> <p>  The Irish prison psychology service also plays a key role in helping to deal with mental wellness and prisoners to cope with imprisonment.  The psychology service consists of the head of psychology, eight senior psychologists, 11 staff grades and nine assistant psychologists.  They undertake a range of mental health supports, including interventions matched to the severity of the presentation.  Interventions include self-help, psychoeducational workshops and individual and group-based therapies. <\/p> <p>  There is an increased risk of morbidity and mortality when mentally ill prisoners come to the end of their sentence.  To help manage that increased risk, a pre-release planning programme with HSE social workers was established in Mountjoy Prison.  This pre-release planning intervention has shown that collaboration between the national forensic team, the Prison Service and community based supports greatly improves sentence-planning for mentally ill people and 91% were accepted by community mental health teams on return from Mountjoy Prison.<\/p><p>Some 91% were accepted by the community mental health teams on return from Mountjoy Prison.  It shows something can work.  However, notwithstanding the in-reach and psychology services available, and the positive examples of collaborative working, the fact remains that imprisonment is inappropriate for people with severe and enduring mental illness as prisons are not therapeutic environments.<\/p><p> With regard to admission to the Central Mental Hospital, CMH, a waiting list is operated by the national forensic mental health team and is reviewed weekly.  Over the last ten years, the waiting list has fluctuated from between five and 30 prisoners at any one time.  It should be noted that all prisoners placed on the waiting list have been clinically assessed as warranting admission to the CMH, which is a tertiary care facility.  Today in Cloverhill Prison there are in excess of 15 prisoners deemed to require admission to the Central Mental Hospital.  Overall, there are 30 people on the waiting list for the Central Mental Hospital facility.  The continued detention of these individuals without proper access to the services and inputs of an appropriate clinical team exacerbates and increases the morbidity of the prisoners concerned.  Leaving people untreated increases risk.  The absence of appropriate access to admission beds for all prisoners who have been deemed to require such admission also exacerbates the risk to our staff in managing prisoners with serious mental health issues in a prison setting.<\/p><p> The Irish Prison Service has invested heavily in training and education for staff in dealing with individuals with mental health issues.  Notwithstanding the clinical expertise of Irish Prison Service staff, supported by the in-reach staff, considerable clinical, individual and corporate risks remain.  The disproportionate draw on resources to facilitate, protect and afford the best quality of life for prisoners with severe mental illness in custody means that others' services  are disadvantaged and restricted.  It has to be remarked that the input of prison officers is the mainstay of providing the best quality of life possible for such prisoners in custody, and I wish to specifically acknowledge the work done by our healthcare and discipline staff who are managing this level of difficulty in as humane and compassionate a way as possible.  However, with the best will in the world a prison is not, and should never be, a suitable or appropriate clinical environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018052300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Donnellan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527079200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I was so taken by what you were saying, Mr. Donnellan, that I am almost unprepared for the next person.

I have brought two colleagues with me: Mr. Peter Byrne, who is peer educator from the service reform fund and attached to the national forensic mental health service, and Mrs. Pauline Gill, who is general manager of the national forensic mental health service.  I will talk about problems, causes and solutions taking the headings of the committee's terms of reference.<\/p> <p>  With regard to waiting lists for transfer from prison to the Central Mental Hospital, currently there are 28 on the waiting list and there are 323 on the caseload of the in-reach teams we provide to the Irish Prison Service.  All of the people on the waiting list are urgent.  All of them are severely mentally ill and should not be in prison.  They have been on the waiting list for months and this is entirely unacceptable by any clinical standards.  When we surveyed the numbers with severe mental illnesses in the prison population over ten years ago, we found there was a need then for approximately 350 secure forensic beds for Ireland.  Matters have probably worsened since, although we have taken every alternative strategy as far as possible.  I will list those as we proceed.  We have tried to manage with minimal resources compared to other countries, and I can tell the committee what the averages in other countries are.  Matters are managed only because the Irish Prison Service does not complete certificates for those who should be admitted until we have a bed available.  One of the problems for all of us is that we manage to cope in increasingly difficult situations.  Ultimately, that is not a great thing.<\/p> <p>  As clinical director I have statutory obligations under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act.  I am increasingly unable to meet my statutory obligation to admit those found not guilty by reason of insanity in the courts.  Again, we cope by asking the courts to put off sentencing, for example.  We have published the results of participatory action research showing how a systematic screening of people on reception in prison identifies those in need of psychiatric care.  We have shown that we can identify those who need treatment and individual care and treatment plans.  Most can be diverted back to community mental health services.  We have now set up a model service, which is copied in other countries.  We originally modelled it on the Australian system and now other people come to visit us.  However, there is an irreducible number, those who are on our waiting list and those on our caseload, who cannot be managed in community mental health services or approved centres around the country.  Those who are too dangerous to others because of their severe mental illness require treatment in conditions of therapeutic security.<\/p> <p>  The national forensic mental health service currently has 93 beds for adults in need of treatment in conditions of therapeutic security.  That is two per 100,000 of the population of Ireland.  This has not changed for many years.  Comparable countries have between five and 14 secure forensic beds per 100,000.  The Netherlands is at the upper end of that range.  We will move to 130 adult medium and high secure forensic beds in Portrane in 2020, with an additional 30 intensive care rehabilitation unit, ICRU, beds which will now have to serve the entire country.  That will give us 3.4 adult secure forensic beds per 100,000.  Comparing like with like, most developed countries have between five and 14.  We will also open ten forensic secure child and adolescent mental health beds on the Portrane campus, but obviously not within the adult campus.  The new hospital will not bring Ireland up to international average resource levels.<\/p> <p>  On the need to meet long-term needs, because of the lack of a national plan to meet the needs of those requiring longer-term, slow-stream care, treatment, rehabilitation and quality of life in secure forensic hospital settings, and because of the continuous growth of this group, we think it will be necessary to plan for the introduction of designated centres, as a matter of desperation, in prisons.  I entirely agree with what Mr. Donnellan has said.  Looking at the global situation, this has already happened in the Netherlands, Finland and other progressive European countries even when much better resourced than we are.  The Netherlands has the most forensic beds in the community and it is now opening designated centres in the prisons.  We might discuss the root cause of this if there is time.  There will also be a need for longer-term secure psychiatric beds within five years of the opening of the new Central Mental Hospital in Portrane.  We can already foresee that the new hospital will not be enough and we would like to start planning the next step now.<\/p> <p>  According to the committee's terms of reference there was a consensus that the 2006 policy, A Vision for Change, charts the best way forward for mental health services.  A consensus can be specific to its time or it can fail to address some important areas.  Sometimes it can be wrong.  A Vision for Change is now out of date because it could not take account of modern knowledge regarding, for example, at-risk states in the young and, because of its era, it could not take account of modern evidence for enduring neurocognitive impairment occurring during the prodromal onset stage of schizophrenia and other severe, enduring and disabling mental illnesses.  For a proportion of patients these illnesses are now better conceptualised as developmental disorders and enduring disabilities. <\/p> <p>  A Vision for Change did not address the need for general adult psychiatric admission beds in an epidemiologically appropriate way.  From EUROSTAT we know that, typically, other countries have between 40 and 60 general adult beds per 100,000 while A Vision for Change recommended 17.  We managed to get it down to 20 before a halt was called.  It also did not seek to examine international best practice regarding the use of such resources.  A Vision for Change did not address the need for local psychiatric intensive care units, for example, as part of general adult psychiatry.  Typically, other countries would have three such beds per 100,000.  We have hardly any.  The plan for four intensive care rehabilitation units in A Vision for Change was a compromise between the need for approximately 350 secure forensic beds, including secure slow-stream rehabilitation beds, and the acute general adult psychiatric local intensive care beds, PICUs.<\/p><p>In the event, neither has been prioritised.  A Vision for Change recommended that general adult psychiatry should reduce to 17 beds per 100,000 based on an ideological and frankly faith-based belief that acute, sub-acute and rehabilitation treatment for severe mental illness could be done in the community.  This missed evidence that even countries with well-developed community services still have 40 to 60 beds per 100,000 for general adult psychiatry.  EUROSTAT shows us these data.  Countries such as the Netherlands, Germany and the Scandinavian states, which provide the most progressive community services, provide choice.  They also have inpatient services.  No research has shown that community services work as an exclusive option.  In practice, in many countries, including Ireland, the only way to obtain treatment for more than a week or two and longer-term intensive care packages in the community is to access these through the criminal courts.<\/p><p> Eleven years after its publication, A Vision for Change is not yet fully implemented.  All those aspects of A Vision for Change that removed or diverted resources for mental health services for severe mental health were implemented.  Those that transferred resources into the planned community services were not fully implemented when they cost money - revenue - or manpower.  Resources - revenue and manpower - have been lost to services for people with severe and enduring mental illness.  I suggest that now is the time for an entirely new document, not a revision of an old document.<\/p><p> The joint committee might want to try to achieve agreement on the best rational, scientific and clinical evidence for effective services that achieve human rights, including rights to dignity, rights to health and rights for disabled people, including quality of life, for people with severe mental illnesses, particularly those with enduring impairments of functional mental capacities due to mental illnesses or intellectual and developmental disorders, for people in need of long-term care and treatment in conditions of therapeutic safety and security due to the danger they present to others, and for people who do not present a danger to others.  There should be some effort to engage and develop the health and justice interdepartmental and inter-agency consensus about the relationship between individual freedoms and the protection of others.  My colleagues - psychiatrists and other mental health professionals who work closely within the criminal justice system - and I are continually concerned about the exercise of bail for those who are a danger to themselves.  There is a lot of evidence that suicide rates are high among those bailed - higher, curiously enough, than among those remanded in custody.  There is also a concern about the exercise of bail for those who are a danger to others.<\/p><p> Regarding the current integration of delivery of mental health services in Ireland, there are problems with integration of services due to the emphasis on local delegation of responsibilities without delegation of competencies.  The failure to develop PICU units locally is the most obvious of many examples along with the rejection of those who become homeless, which is a continuing problem for us at the transition between criminal justice and mental health, between custody and the community.  The rejection of those who become homeless is an obvious failure of the catchment area system and the substantial lack of beds and community mental health teams that could be corrected at least in part by empowering central direction and, if necessary, by legislating for central directors of services.<\/p><p> Many other states the size of Ireland have so-called clinical chiefs or heads of psychiatry who are the ultimate line managers of all psychiatrists and can direct colleagues to accept patients who are otherwise unable to obtain services.  Ireland urgently needs an office of chief psychiatrist, comparable to those in states in Australia, with the power to direct that no one is deprived of rights of access to mental health services and, where necessary, to drive resource allocation.  This would include an oversight of evidence-based and effective services of equal quality, accessible equally to all, around the life cycle.  The office of chief psychiatrist would integrate heads of all disciplines and ensure co-ordinated manpower planning and multi-annual planning of service delivery, all things that are missing at the moment.<\/p><p> The office of chief psychiatrist should be independent of the Mental Health Commission and should have the ability to exercise executive power.  It should not be merely an advisory position.  There are such advisory positions, which have a role in their own right.  This would solve the problem of preventing rejection and ensuring provision of mental health and substance misuse services for those leaving prison, an important group among the homeless.  Co-operation with primary care, disability and welfare services would be an added task since this does not work as well as it ought to.<\/p><p> The commissioning of regional and national tier 3 and tier 4 services should also be under the central direction of an office of a chief psychiatrist which should include chiefs of other clinical disciplines and should be supported by managers.  This office of chief psychiatrist should also be responsible for the commissioning of service related research, development, teaching and training, which is a virtuous cycle that is essential for excellent services.  This office should not be vulnerable to being starved of necessary resources.  It could be said that the executive clinical director experiment was starved in that way.<\/p><p> I would suggest that a central office is needed.  To achieve the availability, accessibility and alignment of services and supports to ensure the integration and seamless provision of services to children, adolescents and young adults during life cycle transitions and the transition from working age adults to older adults, the appropriate solution is a national office of chief psychiatrist with the power to direct local service providers, including consultant-led community mental health teams.<\/p><p> Regarding the need to develop prevention and early intervention services further, I must sound a note of caution with regard to prevention.  The evidence is tenuous that severe mental illnesses and mental disabilities such as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, autism and intellectual disabilities can be prevented.  There is little evidence that any programme can prevent schizophrenia, autism or other disabling severe mental illnesses, although these affect about 1% of the population.  There is better evidence that early intervention can reduce long-term disability, although even this requires further research and development specific to an Irish context.  To be effective, this requires a shift to screening models from help-seeking models where a person is expected to present themselves to their GP or where their family might do that and it is hoped the person will escalate through the system to find what they need.  In effect, this is what we do in our in-reach systems in the criminal justice system.  We screen on reception.  We are introducing the same in the youth justice service.  There is also a requirement to set quality standards for \"treatment as usual\" and a rolling programme of randomised controlled trials of how to improve treatment as usual at national level.  There is no consistency in what a person would get as treatment depending on where he or she happens to be.<\/p><p> Regarding at-risk mental states, in St. Patrick's Institution, which is now closed and which provided for those aged 16 to 21, we found through screening that 23% of young people on reception met clinical criteria for an at-risk mental state, which carries about a 15% chance of going on to develop a severe mental illness.  These were strongly associated with poly-substance misuse, which occurred in the great majority of young people detained.  We are now finding much the same in Oberstown Children Detention Campus, allowing for the younger age group.  It is not quite so common in people who are younger.  We have not been able to recommence screening there, however, partly due to difficulties recruiting a full team.  I will talk about the system of recruiting panels compared with bespoke recruitment.<\/p><p> Regarding suicide and unnatural deaths in adult prisons, the suicide rate in prisoners is now lower than it was 20 years ago when it was the main impetus.  We believe this is the direct result of the introduction of screening on committal and psychiatric in-reach and court liaison services, PICLS.  PICLS is, again, picked as a model for other countries.  In our most recent survey of coroners' verdicts, we found that unnatural deaths, including suicides, were strongly associated with the deceased having illicit intoxicants in the blood at the time of death.<\/p><p> We have introduced a pre-release planning programme, about which Mr. Donnellan spoke.  We have now piloted a service for arranging aftercare packages for mentally ill prisoners on release from custody.  The pilot at Mountjoy Prison has shown the value of this scheme.<\/p><p>We have taken what we can do in the prisons and in the community as far as we can.  We have high-support units in Cloverhill and Mountjoy.  We have screening systems on reception in almost all of the prisons.  We have systems to divert through the courts those who can be safely cared for in the community or through local services.  We have 323 people on our prisons case load today.  This includes those who are sentenced and those who are on remand.  We cannot accommodate those who are too ill for prison and we cannot admit them either.<\/p><p> A vital way to improve recruitment is to have a culture of excellence.  The HSE must urgently shift towards a culture of clinical excellence.  Excellence is inseparable from the virtuous circle of research, development, teaching and training.  Only centres of excellence should be empowered to train postgraduate mental healthcare professionals.  Ireland should be self-sufficient in all mental health professions.  Manpower planning to date is difficult to understand.  We struggle to attract the best trainees - or sufficient numbers of trainees - because the mental health services do not enjoy a reputation for excellence, unfortunately.  I say that as someone who is within those services.  The mental health services do not have a positive image as valuing health and welfare outcomes for patients.  A part of the problem is that many trainees go abroad to broaden experience, which is a good thing, and are unwilling to return to work in services that do not provide resources or cultivate excellence.  They are unwilling to return to work in services that do not provide resources to keep up with modern practice and are subject to periodic serious impairments in quality and staffing during economic recessions.  Specialist niche services such as the National Forensic Mental Health Service should be able to conduct bespoke specialist recruitment.  When we were able to do so, we were always oversubscribed.  The HSE's generic panel system has been a disadvantage to us.<\/p><p> I suggest that the joint committee should make explicit recommendations based on current international standards and should support those who are working continuously to keep these standards up to date.  These standards should be grounded in the evidence of clinical science and not merely on good ideas.  Good ideas are never a guarantee of success.  Expertise has a technical definition.  Experts may be contributory, interactive or experts by experience.  All of these are valuable, but they are different.  A Vision for Change put itself forward as the report of an expert panel.  I think it is important to know properly what expertise is.  Only contributory experts can be held responsible for a standard of competence in their evidence.  Interactive experts are people like managers, lawyers and journalists who learn expertise by talking to the contributory experts who are responsible.  There is a complete divorce between responsibility and the exercise of any sort of influence.  There is every chance that the mistakes that have been made in the past will be made again.  The committee should have access to expert advisers who have contributory expertise.  Currently, there are few if any expert advisers in the Department of Health concerning psychiatry or any of the clinical disciplines.  The HSE has advisers on clinical programmes, but no directors.  The committee should have regard to the meaning of expertise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018052300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Harry Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527079200,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Kennedy.

My role as director is to manage the campus and ensure we provide the highest standard of care to young people in a safe environment, thereby fulfilling the requirements of the Children Act 2001.  Oberstown, which is the national detention facility for the care of young people referred to us by the courts on remand or detention orders, is a safe and secure environment for young people.  We place a key focus on addressing offending behaviour and preparing the young people in question for their return to their families and communities.  All of that is part of the process.  The Oberstown campus is a modern facility with new buildings and services.  Our programmes are based on best practice for young people who offend.<\/p> <p>  Young people who come to Oberstown have generally experienced significant adversity and disadvantage across their lives.  They are usually between the ages of 15 and 17, male and have had significant association with the care system.  We undertook a review of the characteristics of young people detained on the campus in early 2017.  We are in the process of completing a similar exercise for 2018, with a particular focus on the challenges.  The outcome of the 2017 exercise affirmed that many of the young people who are placed with us struggle with poor experiences in education, suffer from mental health problems and addiction, and have often experienced trauma or loss.  Our young people have been through many of the State services and supports, often unsuccessfully.  They present to us with challenging behaviours and complex unmet needs.<\/p> <p>  The facility at Oberstown can accommodate 54 young people at any one time.  Oberstown currently has a daily population of 50, which is slightly under capacity.  One third of the young people in Oberstown are on remand orders.  Since April 2017, young people under the age of 18 are no longer sent to adult prisons and instead come to us.  Over the past couple of years, the board of management has approved a strategic plan for Oberstown, the first objective of which is to provide the best possible care for young people.  We have identified a number of key actions, including the development of multi-agency and specialist support to deliver effective assessment, clinical and therapeutic services.  We have developed and are implementing a strategy of participation with young people through ongoing consultation with them about their care and ongoing needs.  This involves hearing the voice of young people.  A range of developments and policies have been approved by the board.  They focus on areas like care, health and well-being, dignity and respect, anti-bullying, complaints, safeguarding, single separation and medication management.  These policies and related ones provide support in the area of behaviour management and inform the procedures to be undertaken by staff in the care of young people.  There are a range of services on site at Oberstown to meet the needs of young people.  The campus has an approved framework based on the Children Act 2001, which sets out the areas we need to address, including care, education, health and well-being, offending behaviour and preparation for release.<\/p> <p>  The assessment consultation and therapy service, which operates as part of the Tusla family agency service, has a team based in Oberstown.  The members of the team, who are professionals in areas like psychology, speech and language, substance misuse and social work, work in conjunction with our residential social care workers and nursing staff to provide an integrated programme for young people.  This service was established in 2013 on foot of the recommendations on the 2009 report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.  Two specific actions set out in the report pertained to young people in special care and detention.  The report called on the HSE, in consultation with the Irish youth justice service, to develop a national multidisciplinary team for children in special care and detention.  It also called on the HSE to review the need for and establish resourced multidisciplinary assessment services for children and young people at risk.  The assessment consultation and therapy service at Oberstown receives referrals and assesses the needs of young people following a multidisciplinary team meeting.  A formal assessment tool is used by our staff in Oberstown as part of a screening process to determine the mental health needs of young people.  Direct assessments are also undertaken by the assessment consultation and therapy service team.  Following consultation with parents, care staff and the other services involved with the young person, it is determined what, if any, interventions are required.  Areas of focus include responding to needs of a young person due to developmental trauma and disruptive care histories, emotional regulation and general mental health and well-being.  The team engages directly with the campus placement planning process, which looks at each young person's individual need in the areas of care, education, health and offending behaviour.<\/p> <p>  The HSE provides psychiatric services through the Central Mental Hospital, which operates the national forensic mental health service.  We share with that service a goal of providing a high standard of care and treatment to young people with a mental disorder.  This team, which is on site each week, works as part of a multidisciplinary team to assess and respond to specific mental health concerns as necessary.  A referral process is in place.  Consideration is given to these referrals weekly or in some circumstances immediately as necessary.  The multidisciplinary team addresses the needs of young people.  The staff in Oberstown provide support to young people on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p> Within the campus, we have 110 trained and experienced residential social care workers and 50 night supervising officers who work directly with our young people.  We have a medical team on site, which consists of three nurses and a social care worker.  We have a visiting GP who attends the campus three days a week and engages with the medical team, the HSE and other clinicians in meeting specific identified needs.  Thirty-one members of our staff have been trained in or are in the process of completing STORM training, a recognised self-harm mitigation model developed at the University of Manchester.  It provides skills-based training in risk assessment and safety planning to our staff.  It also supports staff to determine what to do after a serious incident has occurred.  We operate and provide substance misuse programmes and we access support from ACTS and community programmes.  In June and July of this year, we have organised sixteen substance misuse relapse prevention programmes on the campus, which are based on the adolescent community reinforcement approach.  A community-based service is providing these programmes as part of our summer activities and education schedule.  In September 2017, we appointed a young persons programme manager to support the identification of suitable programmes and the implementation of a programme of training and engagement.  We have been successful in the delivery of many of these in the past year and a half.  <\/p><p> The challenges facing young people detained in Oberstown are complex.  For many young people there are known risks and the approach of Oberstown is to keep young people safe especially during times when young people do not know how to keep themselves safe.  Our engagement and approach with young people is individual based and is informed by professionals on the needs of each young person.  We continue to review and improve our approach to the health and well-being of young people placed in Oberstown.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018052300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Bergin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527079200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I will explain what will happen now.

Professor Kennedy addresses severe mental illness for people who require treatments and conditions of therapeutic security.  He is the expert on that in terms of psychiatric treatment.  In preparation for the hearing I spoke to a number of staff who work in the medical area of the prisons.  They tell me that an issue arises for those who manage to access, for example, an addiction counsellor or psychology services within a prison, for example in the D&oacute;chas Centre or any other centre.  It is particularly an issue for women because women in prison present with enormously complex life histories and experiences.  When those women access services or make progress while they are within the criminal justice system and are lucky enough to have those opportunities the frustration being expressed is that there is not an equivalent service in the community so the person who has been working with that woman or man cannot make the link to a designated person in the community who will continue to provide a similar service for a period of time.  We work in penal policy and criminal justice policy.  We are not mental health experts but we are interested in listening particularly to those who work on the ground with those who are incarcerated and we are interested in considering the problems and barriers they face and what they see is working.  It may assist in answering the Deputy's question.  That is what they are telling me about.  There is a dearth of services within the community for women or men who have made some progress with their mental health difficulty and wish to continue to do so on release but there are not always services there to catch them on release.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018052300002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Malone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527079200,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.

There are interactive experts, people who talk to contributory experts all the time and come to understand the vocabulary and can be quite fluent in that vocabulary.  Examples of this type are journalists, lawyers and pure managers.  Contributory experts are a bit like master craftsmen.  They are not only at the top of their skill and ability through training and long expertise but they can expand their subject a bit.  Senior mental health professionals in all the disciplines are the contributory experts who know how to do something and how to make it better.  Managers talk to them every day and absorb from them but will lose their expertise the minute they stop talking to contributory experts.  The HSE, like many health services, is run by these interactive experts.  It is not run by the contributory experts.

There are admission beds, rehab beds and specialist beds for special things like eating disorders.  Crucial in there is local low secure acute units, psychiatric intensive care units.  There should be one for every 300,000 of the population, which is about 12 beds, or roughly three per 100,000.  Some would say the number is 3.5.

The idea was that they would be familiar with those young people and be able to pass on the intervention each clinician had to a relevant clinician in the relevant area.  When young people were leaving us, the ACTS team could move with the child or young person.  There has been a review of the ACTS service and rather than to have one national team that moves with the children, five teams have been established, including in Cork and Limerick.  The five teams cover the north, south, east and west and there is one in Oberstown.  The idea is that they will continue to work together.  The team in Oberstown will work with young people.  If a young person goes to Cork, the team in Cork will pick up the support services and work with the young person in the Cork area.

We have Le Cheile and YAP working with families so that when young people return home the families will know the clinician or psychologist is available and will call to the house and can support the young person to engage.  It is about changing the model.

We do not do that often enough.  We need to constantly recognise the work of the groups that appear before this committee.<\/p> <p>  In preparation for this meeting, I went through different cases and looked at some of the headlines, including headlines such as court releases man as Central Mental Hospital full, unmedicated and untreated patients at Central Mental Hospital moved to jails because of bed shortage and mentally ill patients being kept in prison due to bed shortages.  That gives a flavour of the difficulties in society.<\/p> <p>  Ms Malone said that services are at crisis levels.  Professor Kennedy described the services as being at the edge of safe levels.  Clearly, there is a crisis in services.  We know the Portrane facility is being built and will be ready in 2020, but will that additional capacity resolve the bed crisis in the system?<\/p> <p>  We know the prison population reflects what is happening in society.  There is a crisis in homelessness.  Increasingly, we see that the young people involved in selling and taking drugs are getting younger and younger.  I know of children as young as seven years of age acting as runners for drug dealers.  That is possibly the profile of young children coming into the prison system.  Many of the families contacting public representatives tell us their son or daughter has a mental health issue and that they believe their child will be safer in the prison system.  Is that the experience of the witnesses?<\/p> <p>  We heard about over-crowding, violence and so on which are part of the system and the fact that some jails are probably more dangerous than others.  We speak of the need for a 24-7 mental health services in the prison service.  Are there times that 24-7 mental health services cannot be delivered?  Are some prisons worse than others in that regard?  Is it worse at the weekend with staff not available and so on?<\/p> <p>  Mental health screening was mentioned.  St. Patrick's Institution was mentioned and the 23%, and I suppose that screening was done a number of years ago.  We do not have the staff in Oberstown.  Is that screening going on anywhere else?  Will it be higher because of the problems on the outside?  <\/p> <p>  Solitary confinement was mentioned in one of the submissions.  Of the 514 prisoners on a restricted regime, 325 had been held on 21 hour lockup.  The duration of the time is not generally published.  Some 51 prisoners were held in solitary confinement in January 2016, of whom nine had spent more than one year in isolation.  Is solitary confinement used as a means of controlling prisoners, many of whom may have mental health issues for which the supports are not available?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018052300002#J00300","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1527079200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I invite Professor Kennedy to answer the first few questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018052300002#J00400","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527079200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Crowe for his questions.  Currently, we have two secure forensic beds per 100,000.  Most other countries have between five and 14 beds per 100,000 of population.  When we move to the new hospital in Portrane in 2020, we will have 3.5 secure forensic beds per 100,000, comparing like with like.  It will give us breathing space, but very short breathing space.  I suggest that we need to start planning what comes next which will be a greater tailoring of services, according to need.  Within the secure hospitals, we will need admission beds, rehabilitation beds and some slow stream beds, recognising long-term needs which are currently not planned for or recognised in the system we have.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether people are safer in prison.  That is a really difficult question to answer.  I think many people access mental health services for the first time when they come into custody.  There are really complicated reasons for that as well as many different reasons, including stigma, but also because general adult services, and I cannot sufficiently emphasise this, are all part of the same service.  While I am obviously explaining to members the problems in the forensic part of the mental health service, we are an integral part of the mental health service and it all hangs together.  If there is a pressure in one part, it invariably passes up the stream until it lands in the criminal justice system and with us.  We are in that sense the canary in the mine, the barometer.  If we are having significant problems, it is because there are not only not enough resources for severe mental illness but not enough tailoring and diversity of the type of services.  One needs admission beds and intensive care beds.  We also need longer term beds and a variety of things within a forensic mental health service and a general adult service.<\/p> <p>  We have taken community and in-reach services in the prisons in our aftercare services about as far as we can.  An endless response to these difficulties is to say that we need to do more in the community but that is not the answer to every question. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018052300002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Harry Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1527079200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Kennedy.

We like to call it a \"restricted regime\" rather than solitary confinement.  On admission to prison, a number of prisoners will say they want to do their sentence behind the door because they feel at risk being out in the general population because of drug debts or money owed by members of their families outside.  Obviously gangland stuff is playing a major issue in the running of our prisons.  There is that threat in prisons from people of that persuasion.  Of course, there are people with mental health problems.  We worked really hard on this in the past number of years to get our number on this restricted regime down, but the Deputy is correct, that on any one day we do a survey of who is behind the door, we will find that there can be eight to 12 people who are only getting two hours out-of-cell time during a 24 hour period.  That is for all sorts of complex reasons, violence being the number one reason.  Coupled with that is the whole threat that goes with it.  It is about trying to manage this disparate group of people in prison and trying to ensure that everybody gets a minimum of two hours out of their cell per day.  Of course, the vast majority have a normal regime.  There are many complex reasons people are in solitary confinement or on a restricted regime.<\/p><p>When one assesses any case, one will find all of those reasons.  There is a prisoner in Cloverhill Remand Prison who will be released in two weeks who will not come out of his cell until the day he is released.  Every night I must sign an order that allows him to stay in his cell, rather than physically force him into a regime.  He has threatened that he will do damage if he is forced to do so.  There are all sorts of reason people want to serve sentences behind a door, but we know how damaging it is.  We know about the isolation and psychological damage caused by being in that kind of environment for a prolonged period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018052300002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Donnellan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527079200,"counter":127,"content":"<p>In February 2018 the Irish Penal Reform Trust published research on the effects of being in solitary confinement and restricted regimes.

There is a very significant structural issue if there is that number of prisoners in they system who fear for their lives or are in fear of an injury.  It is a significant concern.

The new forensic unit planned for 2020 will maintain a breathing space and that is about all.  This week I believe there are 36 people in the approved centres and prisons on the waiting list for treatment, which seems like a small number.  I imagine the average waiting time probably runs into years.<\/p> <p>  I refer to those in prisons who are not receiving treatment or refusing it in any form, whether it be medication, talk therapy or otherwise.  They often complete their sentences and are discharged.  That creates the revolving door through which they return with the same mental health issues.<\/p> <p>  Having involuntary status within prisons or approved centres can sound horrific.  I am not referring to the Central Mental Hospital.  How do the delegates view it?  Perhaps the different individuals might answer for themselves.  <\/p> <p>  Professor Kennedy referred to changing a unit or units in prisons into designated approved centres.  How would that work in practice?  Is it not anathema to all of the work being done on the stigma attached to mental health and the efforts being made not to enforce the receiving of treatment?  To enforce the receiving of treatment during imprisonment seems like a double whammy.  For years there have been rumours, but can the delegates give us an idea of the plan to have different wings in prisons designated as approved centres, whereby they would become psychiatric centres?  The Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 which was related to the Central Mental Hospital provided for something similar.  I expect something like it would have to be done if there was to be such designation in prisons.  I have been hearing about this for years and have a great interest in it.  I remain unconvinced or unsure of its wisdom, but I may need to reflect further on the matter. <\/p> <p>  On Cloverhill Remand Prison and the lack of a specialist forensic psychiatrist and the inability to recruit one, how many forensic psychiatrists are there in Ireland?  Many healthcare services use locums who may last six months or, if one is lucky, a year to fill the gaps, although they are not trained in the specialism.  This is a particular problem in child mental health services.  Representatives from CAMHS have been before the committee and we know that this is happening in that sector.  Has the Irish Prison Service used locums and, if so, how long have they lasted?  Have they been trained in this specialism?  I presume the answer to the last question is \"No.\"  <\/p> <p>  I always advocate for the use of advanced nurse practitioners.  The need to be used in order that we can benefit from their skills, education and critical experience, especially when there are shortages in every area of the public health service.<\/p> <p>  I cannot agree with the delegates on A Vision for Change.  It is incredible that they think we should just bin it.  It was published in 2006.  Some 73% of the recommendations made within it have never been implemented, but I am not going to go through another 12 years of attempts to come up with another document which would sit on a shelf and gather dust.  There is an oversight group which we will have the pleasure of meeting next week at 5.30 p.m.  The delegates should be proactive and actually write to it and take responsibility for changing the oversight group within the mental health service, the prison system and the Central Mental Hospital.  It is not rushing to engage with the delegates, but neither has it rushed to engage with us, with the exception of prods here and there.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the skill mix within the Central Mental Hospital and other prisons.  Nursing staff were brought into some of the other prisons about a decade ago.  How is it working out?  Is the culture between custodial and healthcare staff knitting together and supportive?  There is much talk about the skill mix.  In 2012 the Labour Court recommended a skill mix in the Central Mental Hospital, but capped the figure at 10%, although I think it may have increased in the past six years.  There is increased use of restraints, medication, assessment and special sittings, one to one, two to one and, in some cases, five to one.  They can only be carried out by registered nurses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018052300002#K00300","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1527079200,"counter":129,"content":"<p>The Senator is asking a lot of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018052300002#K00400","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speech","time":1527079200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>How far can we push out the skill mix without losing quality and safety aspects in ensuring the risks are reduced?<\/p> <p>  I have many more questions, but I will just ask one more.  The delegates are seeking to have an overall chief psychiatrist which is probably a good idea.  I imagine Professor Kennedy could write the job description for the post.  Recently, I dealt with a case in which an approved centre had refused to take an individual patient for reasons related to the safety of the rest of the patients in it.  In the United Kingdom under legislation they must take such individuals.  Do the delegates think we should take a similar route? <\/p> <p> Last August I had research carried out into the matter of community treatment orders.

There was a reference to how the culture between the officers and the nurses worked.  It is hugely supportive.  Over the decade I have been with the Prison Service, we have seen great development in joint training between nurses and prison officers.  That is especially the case with mental health.  Nearly 1,800 of our staff are now trained in mental health awareness.  We see that nurses realise that they cannot function without the daily support of the prison officers.  That brings me back to the question of people in isolation. I would like to clarify that it is never done as an easy way to manage somebody with a mental illness.  We have a seclusion policy which is akin to a clinical seclusion policy but it is tightly regulated.  It has to be prescribed by either a registered nurse or a doctor.  The skill mix between the nurses and the prison officers is hugely successful.  It has been the basis for many of our projects in the high-support unit where we have been able to enhance the quality of life for people in prison with major mental health problems.<\/p> <p>  That also touches on the involuntary status of prisoners.  We cannot forcibly treat prisoners against their will.  Anybody with a healthcare issue of that severity - be it a cardiac or mental health issue - deserves to be in a clinical setting.  If a prisoner is that ill, we clearly advocate that he or she should be properly treated and supported by our colleagues in a hospital in the community.

In 1950, there were 7.9 beds per 1,000 of the population and 22,000 citizens were hospitalised in psychiatric hospitals.  According to the Health Research Board, HRB, there were 17,290 admissions in our hospital psychiatric units in 2016.  That is a rate of 376 admissions per 100,000.  The HRB went on to state that the rate of involuntary admission in 2016 was 48.4 per 100,000.  It is 120 in the UK.  That is almost double the rate of involuntary admissions.  In the EU 28, Ireland has the third lowest number of psychiatric beds per 100,000 according to EUROSTAT.  That is a dramatic change over the last 60 years.  The EU average seems to be 72 psychiatric beds per 100,000 and, according to EUROSTAT, in Ireland it 35 per 100,000.  That is again less than half of the EU average.<\/p> <p>  Professor Brendan Kelly has been reported saying, \"These are stark differences and strongly suggest that Ireland has insufficient psychiatric beds to serve our population.\"  He went on to say that the \"movement away from the excessive inpatient care [in the] 1950s ... towards the present situation [when the] rate of involuntary admission is less than half of that in England, and [that] Ireland&rsquo;s availability of psychiatric beds is less than half of the EU average.\"  He continued that \"the key human rights issue in Irish psychiatry today is not [the] disproportionate denial of the right to liberty due to over-custodial care, but, rather, issues concerning the right to access to an appropriate level of care when it is needed, including inpatient care\".  That would seem to chime with what Professor Kennedy said earlier.  Does he think that decongregation - that is the buzzword used - has gone too far?  Has it become either an ideology, or worse, a badge of convenience to effectively shut many units that perhaps, it would have been better to have replaced or done up?  I have heard this reflected elsewhere.<\/p><p>Have we gone too far such that policy is no longer based on the clinical need of the individual but on getting as many people as possible out into the community, irrespective of clinical need and what community supports are in place for them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018052300002#L02100","speaker":"1354","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527079200,"counter":153,"content":"<p>It is interesting to compare my colleague Professor Brendan Kelly's assessment of the situation because he works in the very busy general adult service in Tallaght Hospital and he has previous experience of working in the north inner city as well.  All parts of the service are having the same experience.  All of the contributory experts - those of us who do this - are coming to the same view from different starting points.  I would go a little further.  I think the EUROSTAT figure for Ireland of 35 per 100,000 lumps in community hostels, old age intellectual disability and other things.  The HSE number is 20 per 100,000.  Comparing like with like with the EUROSTAT number, the situation is even worse.<\/p> <p>  The system, following A Vision for Change, was driven by ideology independent of expertise and independent of the research evidence at that time.  A lot of new evidence has emerged since.  For instance, the UK rate of admission under the Mental Health Act has increased in recent years.  It was previously lower than the 120 per 100,000 that it is now.  Forces of nature in the population cannot be blocked by ideology.  There is a certain amount of severe mental illness in the community.  People have genuine needs for levels of care and treatment, which bring us back to this position.  The old asylums were impoverished and negative in every way for all kinds of very interesting reasons.  There was a choice between reforming them or closing them and the choice was to close them.  The obligation on us now is to find something better.  The way to do this is through reawakening the concept of excellence in clinical services.  Excellence is how we keep up with what is happening in the population that we serve.  It will never be the same each decade and so the only way to keep up and ensure we are genuinely meeting the needs of people with severe mental illness and all the range of mental health problems is through the virtuous circle of research, leading to the development of better services; teaching so that we are constantly preparing new professionals in these newly-developed services and training for postgraduate work to provide the people who will do the next round of research, development and teaching.  Other countries have centres of excellence funded continuously to keep up in this area.  The Italians have an excellent centre of excellence in Brescia in northern Italy.  The Dutch have an excellent centre for forensic expertise in Utrecht.  Most other countries have these centres; we have nothing of the sort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018052300002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Harry Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1527079200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>There is evidence of increasing patient violence against staff, the reason for which according to the staff with whom I have raised this issue is that the type of drugs being misused and abused by patients has changed.

We have spent a lot of time with our international colleagues looking on the drugs in prison issue.  The Deputy is correct that there has been a big shift from the drugs of choice in previous years, namely, hashish, marijuana, heroin and so on.  Nowadays, people do not know what they are taking.  They may be told that what they are being given is ecstasy, a benzodiazepine or a roche but that may not be the case.  When people take these drugs the onset of acute psychosis is so rapid it causes a massive management problem for the person in the prison environment or the clinical environment outside of the prison.<\/p> <p>  In terms of how we as clinicians respond to this, all the international evidence is to treat symptomatically.  For example, one should try to keep them cool because they overheat and their temperatures spike and to try to keep them in a safe environment.  We are finding that once the psychosis passes, these people have amnesia.  They often are missing up to a week of their lives where they cannot remember what happened.<\/p> <p>  Responding to the drugs people are taking is a huge challenge.  We work closely with the State Laboratory in terms of trying to analyse what we find when people take these drugs.  The State Laboratory and all laboratories across Europe are having trouble keeping up with the chemical formulations that are being put out there.  We are very much working in the dark, which underlines the need for the dual diagnosis service.  We need to get comorbidity tackled.  There are a lot of people with mental health problems not only in prisons but across the whole country.  There are not silos of mental health on one side and drug addiction on the other, these are married inextricably.  The Irish Prison Service has committed in the national drugs strategy to work with the HSE to take a lead on developing dual diagnosis because we are a service that can initiate that help and treatment as soon as a person presents to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018052300002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1527079200,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I have a few questions for the witnesses.

We have been working with the national Traveller organisations and one of their key points was that if Travellers are not counted in prison, they will not matter.  We have agreed to take a real census of every person who comes into prison and ask them for their ethnic origin.  We did a pilot at the D&oacute;chas centre at Castlerea and 30% of prisoners on a given day last month identified themselves as white Travellers.  We intend to continue that survey and by October have all prisons done.  We will have a scientific fact for how many Travellers occupy prisons, and it seems to be disproportionate.

The academy wishes to offer its heartfelt sympathies to all those affected by the current cervical screening tragedy.  Recent weeks have been an extremely worrying time for many women and their families and has also affected the healthcare professionals providing their care.<\/p> <p>  The academy is the professional body and competent authority representing medical scientists in Ireland.  Medical scientists are a regulated profession.  Since 1996, all medical scientists must hold qualifications accredited or approved by the academy.  We welcome the reviews called for by the Minister and will work with him, the Department of Health, the HSE, CervicalCheck and all other agencies to achieve the best outcomes for women having cervical screening.  The academy is part of the newly established expert advisory group on cervical screening.  The academy will fully participate in, and make submissions to, any Government or statutory inquiry and use its expertise to contribute to initiatives to improve all cancer screening programmes.<\/p> <p>  In 2008, a decision was taken to tender for screening cytology, that is, cervical smear test analysis, which resulted in this service, previously undertaken in laboratories in hospitals in Ireland, being largely delivered by laboratories in the USA.  The academy wishes to clarify that the Irish accredited laboratories that tendered for the cervical screening service in 2007 and 2008 were informed that they had scored highly in all areas - quality and turnaround times - except cost.  The academy is on record as stating that the decision to outsource this screening service was short-sighted.  One consequence of this decision is that the academy does not have access to information from the laboratories in question and, therefore, is not in a position to comment on the quality metrics or standards of individual laboratories at this time.  Should the Scally scoping report identify any suboptimal performance within laboratories currently providing this service, a rigorous approach to remedying these issues will be required to bring them into line with international standards.<\/p> <p>  Cervical screening is a screen, not a diagnostic test.  Involving the pathological analysis of cells from the cervix for pre-cancerous changes, it still remains the most reliable and effective way of preventing and detecting early cancers.  Screening that is done through a national, organised screening service, where regular smears are performed as part of a screening cycle, has helped to reduce the rate of cervical cancer in Ireland.  The cervical smear screen is not 100% sensitive for detection of all cervical abnormalities, but when performed to a high standard as part of a screening programme, it should significantly reduce the number of women diagnosed with cervical cancer.  In the UK, there has been a 50% reduction in cervical cancer since the implementation of its screening programme in the 1960s.<\/p> <p>  Medical scientists examining a smear are required to reach individual \"pick-up\" or detection rates of 95% or greater for high-grade abnormalities and greater than 90% for all abnormalities.  The minimum standard that the academy recommends and would support for cervical screening in Ireland is for each smear to be examined independently by two medical scientists specialising in cervical cytology, under the governance of a clinical pathologist in accordance with CervicalCheck's \"Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Cervical Screening\".  These guidelines are based on those of the British Association for Cytopathology.<\/p> <p>  The professional staff in cytology screening laboratories in Ireland are medical scientists and pathologists with specific qualifications and training.  All cervical screening laboratories in Ireland practise to ISO 15189 quality standards.  These professional and quality standards in cytology and other clinical laboratories ensure that the test method and verification, result interpretation and reporting are controlled, audited and inspected.  This is in keeping with international best practice.<\/p> <p>  The academy fully supports the introduction of the primary HPV test and is available to work with the National Screening Service, NSS, to advise on future pathological service provision for this and other cancer screening programmes.  The system chosen for HPV testing must be selected based on the sensitivity of detection, not cost.<\/p> <p>  The academy advises and recommends that, on the introduction of HPV screening, the entire cervical screening service should be re-established in Ireland to ensure an entirely integrated service for HPV, cytology, colposcopy and histopathology for women in the one health system, ensuring continuity of care and clinical governance.  The academy advises that this laboratory service be configured, led and managed by consultant medical scientists and pathologists, a service configuration that is now emerging as standard practice in the UK.  The academy recommends and advises that the cervical screening programme that is put in place be quality assured and subject to regular independent audit and review against current best practice.  The academy's position, in the interest of public safety, is that all the clinical laboratory services must be fully integrated with clinical services and provided by qualified, registered professionals in a properly resourced and accredited system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Irene Regan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>The MLSA is deeply saddened by the impact of CervicalCheck's system failures on individual women and on public confidence in the cervical screening programme.  The screening programme has saved lives but it is now clear that it did not operate to necessary standards, culminating in the serious failings in the CervicalCheck audit and communication process.<\/p> <p>  Cervical screening was first introduced in Ireland in the 1960s.  Although discussed at the time, a national screening service did not materialise.  By the mid-1980s, there were 15 laboratories providing both a diagnostic and cervical smear screening service, with an estimated 145,000 smears per year throughput and many laboratories experiencing significant backlogs.  In 1987, the then Minister of Health set up a working party whose terms of reference included recommending how to improve arrangements to deal satisfactorily with the workload.  While the final report concluded that no extra Exchequer resources would be made available to the service, it recommended that three regional laboratories be developed to provide a diagnostic cervical cytology service rather than a screening service and that turnaround times should not exceed one month.  However, the continued failure to resource the service appropriately resulted in continuing delays in issuing timely results to patients.<\/p><p> In 1996, the then Minister for Health advised the setting up of the Irish cervical screening programme, ICSP, based in Limerick.  It reported that in 2001, 217,898 smears were received by cytology laboratories and 203,868 were reported.  It noted that double screening was carried out for 17% of all smears, rapid review was performed in 13 of the 14 laboratories, one laboratory reported complete rescreening on all smears, and waiting times ranged from one week to more than three months.<\/p><p> In 2004, the ICSP published a commissioned report by Dr. Euphemia McGoogan, a leading UK expert, who reviewed the first pilot phase of the ICSP, now CervicalCheck under the National Cancer Screening Service, NCSS, in the mid-west and made recommendations for a successful national screening service roll-out within an acceptable timeframe.  Among the recommendations of Dr. McGoogan were the need to develop and redesign the existing laboratory structures into four regional screening centres that would &ldquo;serve a defined population through a network of professionals working in primary care, laboratories and colposcopy&rdquo;, and it was envisaged this would be in line with what was developed for the BreastCheck screening programme.  In addition, a single standard screening should be agreed and a move to liquid based cytology, LBC, should be developed which would greatly increase laboratory capacity by increasing the number of slides screened daily by laboratory staff.  Furthermore, each laboratory should employ a quality manager to assist with obtaining laboratory accreditation.<\/p><p> In June 2006, in response to continuing backlogs, the HSE with the NCSS took a decision to outsource the backlog of cervical smears on an ongoing basis from 1 August 2006 up to 31 July 2008, with an option to extend the service for two years.  On the basis of \"urgent medical need\", the contract was awarded without a tender process to Quest Diagnostics, an American based international company.  During this period, Irish cytology laboratories were undergoing transition from conventional Papanicolaou, Pap, smear tests to LBC preparation in addition to working assiduously through the process of achieving accreditation in preparation for the roll-out of the National Cervical Screening Service programme.  Some laboratories had already achieved accreditation.  At the same time, laboratory workloads were increasing year on year and the HSE staff moratorium from 2006 was also having an effect on staffing levels in laboratories.  Following a tender process in May 2008, the National Cancer Screening Service awarded the full contract for screening to Quest Diagnostics.<\/p><p> The Medical Laboratories Scientists Association, MLSA, warned the HSE and the NCSS in 2007-2008 of the risks of the short-term decision to outsource testing to the USA, due to the different testing and screening protocols in place and the disconnect between the outsourced screening programme and the clinical services in Ireland for women subsequently diagnosed with cervical cancer.  Concern was also expressed about the loss to the State of the skills to provide the service.<\/p><p> As a result of the outsourcing of the testing, more than 60 highly skilled medical scientists performing cytology testing in Ireland were redeployed to other areas in pathology laboratories, with a consequent loss of their skills.  As a result, the overall majority of Irish cytology laboratories were not in a position to tender for subsequent NCSS contracts since 2010.  Following the decision to outsource the testing, the NCSS, the Department of Health and the HSE expressed no interest in the development of a cytology screening service in Ireland, in line with the recommendations of the McGoogan report, advising instead that it was their preference to close existing screening services in Ireland and redeploy staff to other laboratory disciplines.<\/p><p> The MLSA welcomes the upcoming review into the service and calls on the HSE to invest in the retraining and upskilling of medical scientists so that the testing service can be returned to Ireland.  It must be acknowledged also that the recent controversy has also impacted greatly on all the staff who have worked diligently over the past decade to provide the CervicalCheck screening service in Ireland.  Our members hope that lessons have been learned by the HSE and Department of Health about the need to invest in Irish clinical pathology laboratories so that such vital services can be provided within the State in accredited laboratories with essential links to clinical services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terry Casey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Casey.

The witnesses might address the issue of their view of the HSE's decision to outsource.  What were the criteria used?  Was it due to the costs involved, was it the volume in that it thought Ireland did not have the capacity, or was it that the laboratories in Ireland did not reach a certain standard?

I work in the Dublin Institute of Technology as a lecturer.  Dr. Euphemia McGoogan's report was published in 2004 in which she reviewed the ICSP phase 1 and made recommendations for the expansion to the full national programme.  In her report she made a statement about laboratory capacity.  She said that five major laboratories were screening sufficient numbers of smears at the time for quality assurance in practice and that, with appropriate funding and training, there would be sufficient capacity to provide the full service provided they all moved to liquid based cytology, LBC, which was a different way of taking the cervical sample into a liquid so that it could be prepared in a mono layer.  This was much quicker and easier to read than the previous smears and it also reduced many of the repeat smears that were a problem up to that time.<\/p> <p>  There was another ICSP report in 2006 prepared by Dr. Marian O'Reilly which examined the way in which capacity could be expanded through training of further medical scientists in the field of cervical cytology.  When the report was produced, the Dublin Institute of Technology was approached.  We set up a degree, with support and financial input from the ICSP, to train a further 50 medical scientists for cervical cytology.  We took in students in 2006, 2007 and 2008 and we were in the process of completing their training to expand the numbers, approximately ten per year, when we had to discontinue that programme because the outsourcing meant there would be no opportunities for those students either to train or to be employed, so capacity was not an issue.  Those were the matters on which I wanted to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Helen Lambkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Was there any issue regarding standards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#E00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>In terms of standards, in 2004, 2005 and 2006, there was no agreed or funded accreditation of medical testing laboratories in Ireland.  There was some funding and a requirement for accreditation of food laboratories but not for clinical diagnostic laboratories.  Many of the Irish laboratories undertook, of their own volition, to be accredited using the clinical pathology accreditation from the UK.  That was a set of standards, which looked, as all laboratory accreditation does, at the pre-analytical variables, the analytical part, which is what happens in the laboratory, and the post-analytical parts.<\/p> <p>  In 2005, on foot of the EU blood directive, there was a statutory instrument looking for blood transfusion laboratories to be accredited to the ISO 15189 standard, which is the international standard for medical testing laboratories.  That was mandated for blood transfusion laboratories and that was to be achieved by November 2008.  Specific funding was made available in terms of staffing and allocation of resources for the accreditation of blood transfusion laboratories but those alone.  At that time the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, which provides accreditation to the ISO 15189 standards, was not resourced or scoped up to accredit all the laboratories in Ireland and it was working towards the blood transfusion laboratories.  At the same time there was a European co-operation for accreditation, EA, regulation in Europe which provided that accreditation services were not a matter for competition and must be provided by the national accreditation agency.<\/p><p>That stalled the accreditation process for Irish laboratories, as many people who had been preparing to go with the UK CPA accreditation had to realign themselves with the ISO 15189 standard, given that the CPA was, after a certain time, no longer allowed to provide accreditation services in Ireland.<\/p><p> Although the laboratories were not accredited, they were all working in a quality management system and most - the cytology laboratories certainly had - had applied for accreditation in anticipation of this tender.  It was similar to the situation with hospital accreditation, where people were working to a standard and self-assessing but had not been inspected by the hospital accreditation system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Culliton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Were Irish laboratories training cytologists and increasing capacity in anticipation of the national screening programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#F00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Culliton"},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>That was prevented by the HSE outsourcing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#F00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Culliton"},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>The outsourcing led to the abandonment, as it were, of training cytologists because they would not have had any work to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#F00600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>That is right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Culliton"},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>When the contracts were reviewed in 2010, there was not the capacity to apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#F00800","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Correct.

My memory is that it was a highly politicised decision.  The comment that was made by the then Minister related only to price.  As the experts in the field, are the witnesses able to advise us of the clinical drivers of the decision?  We are hearing that the preference should have been for the maintenance of the service.  If memory serves, there was a great drive to outsource at the time, and not just in this area.  It strikes me that the then Government's decision was driven by price and not necessarily by quality.  What are the witnesses' views on this?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the deskilling and redeployment of staff, what shape are we in to insource the outsourced work?  With the introduction of HPV tests, I understand that fewer experts will be needed.<\/p> <p>  In 2006, a tender process - we only got these documents this morning - was undertaken by the HSE.  It was cancelled in September 2007.  The decision was made not to continue with the pilot programme tender and to develop specifications for a national programme from 2008.  Presumably, that was in line with the McGoogan report and would have involved insourcing.  Have the witnesses any insight to give into what drove the outsourcing?<\/p> <p>  People from the HSE and the screening programme appeared before us.  We examined the documentation from the time.  One of the assurances given was that there would be regular teleconferences - it was ten years ago, so we might say \"Skype\" today - between the Irish and US labs.  Will the witnesses give us an idea of the frequency of those teleconferences?  Are they regular, for example, weekly, daily or monthly, or are they scheduled as needed?  A head is being shaken at me, so I suspect that to be the truth.  According to the documentation from the time, there would be regular teleconferences.  We were reassured of it at our previous session.<\/p> <p>  I will be brief with my next question, as I only have ten minutes and want to leave time for answers.  Will the witnesses explain for a layperson like me the differences in how screening is carried out in Ireland?  We adhere to the ISO 15189 standard.  Does the same standard apply in the US or is it a similar one?  Does the US use different or similar accreditation?

They will also complete a clinical laboratory placement training, which would not be in cytology but in all disciplines of the laboratory.  Post graduation, they would have to train, usually for a year or a year and a half, in cervical cytology.  It has that extra training because one must learn to recognise all of the normal cells, abnormal cells, infectious agents and patterns that are seen in smears.  Those elements can be varied depending on the day of a woman's cycle, whether she has a previous smear history of abnormalities, etc.  It takes a long period of learning before a medical scientist can sign out smears.  In generating that capacity, we cannot just say that we will take all of the tests back in a month's time because we do not have the trained personnel in situ.  We would probably have to bring in people from abroad to perform the smears.<\/p><p>However, the Irish Cervical Screening Programme, ICSP, has been looking at the introduction of the human papilloma virus, HPV, test as the primary test on the cervical smear sample.  The reason is Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Italy, the United Kingdom and other European countries are all moving towards the idea that when a woman has a cervical smear taken in this liquid preparation, the primary test will be for high risk HPV.  About 40 HPVs can be found in the anogenital region, but the ones that are high risk are oncogenic which can lead to cervical abnormalities.  The recommendation in many countries is that the first test be for HPV.<\/p><p> HIQA brought out a report last year on the HPV test.  It looks as if it will be tendered for.  That is the future for the next developments in the service.  In itself, it will take some time to implement.  When it is implemented, if it is the primary test, for any positives for the high risk HPVs, smears will be prepared and examined as usual.  The Irish laboratories have capacity to deal with the number when there is a reduction, but that will take several years.

Some of them have Masters degrees and then go on to specialise in this area.  They are not just cytoscreeners which they do not like to be called.  They are highly qualified medical scientists who have specialised in this area.  We know exactly who does the tests here and we can stand over what we do.  However, it is hard for us to comment on what somebody else does.  Fortunately, there is a centre in the Coombe hospital that does this important test.

If there is commitment to change this, there has to be a full and proper commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Naughton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>During the outsourcing in 2007 and 2008 there were continual teleconferences.  They were held either once or twice a week.  They also continued after the laboratories had disappeared off the scene because multidisciplinary team, MDT, meetings had to take place between gynaecologists and the pathologists in the United States who had done the cytology and the smear.  The difference at the time between the screening in the United States and here was in the volume of work we were doing.  In Ireland initially, when we started screening, we were doing about 32 screens per day.  That changed with the introduction in the early 1990s of the rapid review which was the safety net.  We worked on the basis that we would continue with 32 smear screens.  At that stage in the United States they were doing 100 a day.  Many of them said they had moved to using liquid-based cytology, which we accept.  However, we found it difficult.  We were dealing with what could be regarded as the original pap smear.  We were changing to using liquid-based cytology between 2007 and 2008.  In that case, we were hoping we would be able to increase the numbers we would do on a daily basis.  The Americans still continue with a figure of 100, but we had a full rapid review of all negatives.  In America they were doing a review of 10% of all negatives.  That was the difference between the two.<\/p> <p>  Was there a clinical need to outsource?  I do not believe there was.  The service provided here is exactly the same.  In fact, I think there was a better quality service here.  On the question of capacity, the idea behind outsourcing was to achieve a 28-day turnaround time.  One of the statements identified five laboratories that had a turnaround time of 28 days, but the rest of us could not achieve it.  The reason we could not do so was the most essential report on the cytology service, especially the cervical side of it, the negative report.  We were consumed by making sure it was negative.  It had to be negative and that took much time.<\/p> <p>  In 2007 and 2008, when working in a laboratory, I had four people in training.  They were qualified at honours degree level and had trained in the United Kingdom in September 2006.  They had come back to the laboratory where we double-screened their work.  There was a follow-up week in the United Kingdom in July and August 2007.  They made a pre-exam visit to the United Kingdom and in Ireland in December 2007.  We carried out a full review and brought in an international person to deal with all members of staff in April 2008.  In June 2008 they were certified to report on liquid-based cytology.  It took 21 months after completing their degrees and experience in the laboratory to be able to report in the cytology lab.  There was a long lead-in period.  They were essential members of staff.  If one of them got sick or decided to leave the job, we would have been back at square one in trying to get the expertise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for attending.<\/p> <p>  The main concern for women throughout Ireland who have been and continue to be tested is the accuracy of the tests.

The chief medical officer has stated that categorically and the clinical director of the HSE has stated that categorically.  The independent expert I spoke to looked at the data.  He said that while it would be great to have more data, the data the HSE released showed no difference in quality.

In any event, the women of Ireland want to know whether they are being screened by substandard laboratories.  Every expert we have had before the committee has stated categorically that there is no quality issue.  The data provided seem to suggest there is no quality issue.  The academy representatives have said they have no opinion on whether there is a quality issue.  Why do they have no opinion?

We have two independent medical scientists reviewing a smear so the figure will be far higher.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about whatever is on a smear.  We are not talking about the whole screening process.  We are talking about if there are positive cells or abnormal cells on a smear.  The figure for each medical scientist reviewing it by him or herself is 95% or greater.  In reality, it is far better than that because we have two independent medical scientists or trained cytologists reviewing each smear.  The figures are sent back to CervicalCheck quarterly.

The expert said of course the Coombe would show a higher percentage.  Furthermore, he said that the percentage of abnormalities detected is not what experts use to determine the accuracy of the laboratory.  They use positive predictive value because a false negative is so hard to get since it relies on self-reporting and because moving from pre-cancerous to cancerous cells can take ten, 12 or 15 years.  He said, therefore, that the industry standard is positive predictive value, PPV.

My colleague, Mr. Gerard O'Mahony, can go into that with the Deputy in greater detail.  If we look specifically at what has been reported by the investigation team from CervicalCheck, it looked specifically at 1,482 cases and said that in 442 of those one or more elements of their care required review.  Of those, 209 had a variation in their cytology report and, of those, 175 should have had their treatment escalated.  If we take that 175, it is 12% of 1,482 and 39.6% of those whose cytology was reviewed and it was found, based on that review, that there should be an escalation.

I am a very simple man so I go back and look at definitions and give simple examples.  In this particular case I go to CervicalCheck for the definition which is in most of its annual reports.  It says the positive predictive value is reported as the percentage of women referred with high grade cytological abnormality who have a histological diagnosis of CIN2, which is high grade or higher.  A simple example of that is taking three labs, X, Y and Z.  In lab X, we give them 100 abnormal slides, they pick up 20 and 16 are accepted to be high grade.  Lab Y picks up 40 and it is confirmed that 32 of those are of a high grade and lab Z picks up 80 and 64 are confirmed to be of high grade.  That would mean that each of those labs working on the same amount of work has a predictive value, PPV, of 80%.  It does not pick up false negatives.  What it identifies are the individuals working in the lab and the number of positives they picked up which go on to colposcopy or biopsy and the confirmation of that.  Each of those labs has picked up a certain pocket of positivity which is confirmed at 80%.  That is what the PPV is.  That is what it is defined as and it is defined over and over again.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about ten years ago when the outsourcing started.  Gibbons reported at that stage that the norm across Irish laboratories was a percentage of 1.8%.  The outsourced work at the time was giving a figure of 1.2%.  He claimed a difference of 0.6%.

Mr. Casey talks about quality and detection rates, the future ability to tender, the creation of a monopoly, the reduction in mortality rates and the work that was being done on reform.  His statement notes that Ireland stands relatively high on quality of performance.  It is a very good letter and statement.  Perhaps I will put a number of questions and the witnesses can come back on them because I have a range of questions.  Mr. Casey said on quality in detection rates that \"from recently adjusted figures, excluding urgent smear policy, at least 30% of cases with pre-cancerous cells will go undetected based on the data from the previous outsourcing exercise by the NCSS to Quest Diagnostics.\"  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that.

Finally, I also have a letter from Alison Malkin of the school of biological sciences in Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, of 17 April 2007, which was sent to Mr. Drumm and copied to Mary Harney.  Basically, it says that because of the decision to outsource, there would be concerns regarding differences between screening algorithms, reporting systems and quality assurance.<\/p><p> In fairness to all the witnesses, they flagged what transpired to become the main issues, which have left us in a situation where we have a range of problems going forward.

The witnesses referred to 15 laboratories in the mid-1980s.  My understanding is that there are now two laboratories in Ireland that do this work.  Are there other laboratories doing other medical analysis that could take on some of this work if they got the staff?  What is the position relating to laboratories overall in the country if we wanted to retain all of this work?<\/p> <p>  In order to retain the work, we would have to upskill people and ensure that we have an adequate number of individuals who are suitably qualified.   A total of 60 people were redeployed as a result of the outsourcing.  If we started a programme today to ensure that this many people would be sufficiently qualified, how long would it take us to ensure that we reached our target?  Are there people conducting clinical analysis in other areas who could be switched with upskilling or must we start from the very beginning?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses talk about how higher-grade abnormalities should be identified in 95% of cases while all abnormalities should be identified in 90% of cases.  I have seen different reports.  I saw one, a document produced by Professor Brennan, which seems to indicate that his figures would vary somewhat from those of the witnesses.  One of the issues that needs to be identified is the fact that the smear test - and the work done in this area - deals with that specific type of cancer; it does not identify other cancers.  We need to get clarification as well on that because once a person got a clear smear result and even issues arose about which they were concerned, the immediate response was \"Well, it can't be cancer.  I've got a clear smear.\"  Do we need to get an great deal more information out there to the effect that the smear test or even the HPV testing about which we are talking will not produce a finite result of 100%?<\/p> <p>  We are now in the area of litigation.  If we take the figure of 95% of higher-grade abnormalities, what about the 5% where it is not identified?  How do we deal with that from a litigation point of view?

I am not taking from people affected by errors.  Where genuine errors occur, people must be adequately compensated.  All of the screening is not 100%.  How do we now deal with this issue?

We discussed the capacity issue previously.  Senator Colm Burke asked whether there are other clinical laboratories that can take on this workload.  As we mentioned previously, medical scientists are highly qualified.  They spend up to five years in undergraduate education, which includes an obligatory clinical placement.  Cervical screening is very specialised so they need to train in that area so we just cannot take somebody and train them in a day.  It does take up to two years to do that.  They must meet competencies, look at 5,000 cases in order to be declared competent, be signed off and complete various courses.  That is the protocol for that and the academy would definitely support that and expect nothing else in the future for that.  There is a long training process.  We are talking about quality here and training and standards are very important.  This is what the academy is about.  It is about professional standards and recommending.  As a result, we cannot have a sticking plaster.  If we bring it back here, we want it the experts to do it and we want to assure the women of Ireland that they have a quality system operated by highly-trained experts who specialise in cervical cytology.  It will not be a quick fix.  We cannot just move people back and forth to do this.  Clinical diagnostics is a very specialised area.  We train for a long time to do it.  Many decisions are made on the work we do so it is very important to get it right and to be qualified and expert in it.  The academy would support that.<\/p> <p>  I will discuss Professor Brennan's report and my colleague, Dr. Lambkin, will elaborate on HPV testing because the Senator asked about that.  There is a bit of debate and confusion regarding statistics concerning the 65% to 75%.  This is about the screening process.  This is the whole process, this is what the 65% to 75% concerns.  It relates to if the smear is taken at the right time and in the right way, and what it picks up.  There will be adenocarcinomas.  There are different cancers that will not be picked up by a screening process.  When he talks about the screening, it is the process and, of course, the laboratory analysis of that smear is included in that.  He is talking about 60% to 75%.  I think it has got lost and it very confusing for people out there.  Women are thinking that it will pick up their positive result only six out of ten times.  This is a positive result at which we are looking in respect of a smear.  That is not six out of ten times.  It is the whole process involving whether it is taken properly.  The women about whom we are talking had positive results.  The cells were on the slide.  This is a very different thing to whether it was taken at the right time or whether they had pre-cancerous cells that could be picked up by the screening process.  There is confusion out there and it is important to clarify what those statistics mean.<\/p><p>With regard to the 95%, Professor Brennan has said otherwise on the issue because it does not identify other cancers.  When one considers the overall figure it is not 95% of all abnormalities.

There is a widespread misunderstanding among many people as to what has happened.  There are three issues, the first of which relates to the laboratories.  Some people believe that the US laboratories have been less accurate but the data do not back that up.  However, we should wait to see what the future investigation shows.  Perhaps there are areas where there are difficulties, and we need to investigate them thoroughly.  At the moment there is no data to show that the United States laboratories were inferior.<\/p><p>The second issue is the question of who made the decision.  The assertion has been made at this committee has been that this was a political decision.  One or more witnesses have just answered Deputy O'Reilly's query concerning whether clinicians were involved in the decision.  The answer provided, when we look at the transcript, will say that there were none involved. <\/p><p>I would like to quote a speech from the former Minister for Health, Ms Harney, in 2008, because it is important that we understand who made this decision and why:<\/p><blockquote>The tender was examined not by the Minister or any official from the Department of Health and Children, but by a group established by National Cancer Screening Service, [which at the time was independent of the HSE, with an independent board] which included doctors ... who has been running the service in the mid-west, and a doctor from Northern Ireland, who was charged with the responsibility for quality assurance there and who is also involved in the accreditation process in the UK.<\/blockquote> <p>The former Minister went on to say:<\/p><blockquote>The National Cancer Screening Service did not have to go to tender but chose to do so for reasons of transparency, fairness and equity to make sure it got the best quality assured service.<\/blockquote> <p>The Minister, in 2008, explicitly stated that there were no politicians, no officials or civil servants involved, and that an independent body, the NCSS, brought a group of doctors together to make the decision and to run the process.  The witnesses have just said that there no doctors or clinicians involved and that it was a political process.  Was the Minister lying?  Was she completely unaware of the process she had just overseen?  Why do we have such a massive discrepancy?<\/p><p>There is a widespread belief among the public that there is a clinical link between non-disclosure and clinical outcomes for women.  That has been categorically refuted by everyone that I have put that question to at these committee hearings.  Most women I have spoken to believe that the HSE sat on data that it could have provided to doctors, which could have helped them.  That is what most people believe because of deeply irresponsible statements that have been made by Oireachtas Members.<\/p><p> Mr. Casey said the MLSA is \"deeply saddened by the impact of the system failures on individual women.\"   I acknowledge the association is not trying to add to the confusion but that kind of language adds to it.  The phrase suggests a causal link between non-disclosure and clinical outcomes for women.  The majority of women to whom I have spoken believe that to be the case.  I will outline what happened.  In 2008, a national cancer screening service or CervicalCheck was set up, which was great.  In 2014, an audit process was introduced.  We are one of the only countries that carry out such an audit process, and that was a good development.  In 2015, CervicalCheck decided to provide full feedback to the doctors for ongoing communication with the patients.  Ireland was one of only two countries that conducted such an audit and gave feedback.  All of these developments were good.  In 2016, CervicalCheck communicated with doctors on the assumption that they communicate onwards.  The systems failure in all of this is that the doctors did not tell their patients.   The doctors have replied that even if they had told their patients it would have made no difference to their treatment.  I know that I have gone on but it is important that we get clarity on this matter.  I do not believe it was intentional but I believe the association's opening statement unintentionally supports the causality argument, which we have been told by every expert that we have questioned is false.  <\/p><p> I have two questions.  The Minister at the time said that no politician or official were involved and a group of doctors with international group of doctors was brought together.  We were told earlier that a political decision was made without the involvement of clinicians.  Which of those two statement are true?   Is it the witnesses' opinion that there was, or was not, a causal link between non-disclosure and clinical outcomes for the women?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#N00700","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I shall respond regarding our statement.  I accept that the failing was in terms of the communications process that related to the audit.  If there is confusion, then I accept that point.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the decision to award the entire tender to Quest Diagnostics, I assert that I do not genuinely believe that a Government would allow a service of that nature to be outsourced to a different jurisdiction and that it would not have had any input whatsoever.  Ten years ago when we strongly advocated against such a move, we were not aware that the entire service would be shut down.  That was what we were advised would happen.  Subsequently, the Coombe Hospital stated that there was a requirement for the training of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, and, therefore, the retention of quality, which is welcome.  It is a credit to the staff at the Coombe Hospital for insisting that the service would remain.  It is absolutely our view that it was a political decision.  I can back that up because around the same time we were presented with a report that effectively was a proposal to tender for much more of the pathology testing, particularly relating to co-laboratory work and primary care.  At the time we worked hard to show that that would be the wrong thing to do.  We even presented our own report that showed from a cost perspective insourcing would be the right thing to do and we, ultimately, have won that argument.

There were catastrophic differences between P2s and P9s.  Given the witnesses' professional expertise, I ask whether a quality audit should have been carried out by the HSE.  I ask all six witnesses for a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer at the end.  I am not trying to catch anyone out.  I just want the professional opinion of the witnesses, given that we now know about these catastrophic changes.  I have seen a few audit reports, including one where there were four errors in a row and then there was a catastrophic change.  I have it here.  It is redacted but it showed me something. <\/p> <p>  My next question is about Professor Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly.  She  was on \"Morning Ireland\" on 27 April 2018 and the figures have been repeated so I am not going to go through them.  I refer to the figure of 1,482 cases.  It breaks down that 277 were reviewed.  There was no change in 71 and we ended up with the 209 figure.  That shows that 75% of the 277 cases were misread.  In light of that, do the witnesses believe - given the percentages - that there was a need for some random sampling of normal smears to establish whether the level of accuracy underpinning the whole programme was working?  <\/p> <p>  My next question concerns the audit process methodology which we have received.  The witnesses will have seen the Outcomes of audits between 2008 to 2015 document.  There are levels one to six.  Diagnosis after a previous smear that recommended repeat cytology is No. 5 at 11%.  It says to review some cases.  The word \"some\" has been troubling me.  That means that some were reviewed and some were not.  How, scientifically, was that done?  How are some picked and not others?<\/p> <p>  My last question relates to the HPV test into the future.  This is important to me and I raised it in the D&aacute;il weeks ago.  There is no way in hell that the witnesses will be able to do these tests without receiving huge resources quickly.  Human resources are going to take time and the witnesses have explained eloquently why that is.  Laboratories need changes and IT needs upgrading.  I am a big eHealth person.  What needs to be done and what is the quickest timeframe in which it could be done?  I was quick as I could be.  I ask the witnesses to start with the first question.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#P02200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I will take the outcomes of the audit and what we are going to be able to tell from that.

If an error rate is consistent across all laboratories - on a ratio basis because some are doing more tests that other - we would see that one of the outcomes and conclusions could be that this is a limitation of the cervical screening test.  We talked about specificity and sensitivity.  However, if there is a cluster or many of those errors are being found in one place at one particular time, then it would warrant analysis.  It could be seen as a systematic failure.  I am not suggesting it is but we need the heat map and we need to know where the errors are happening.  We do not have that information so we cannot judge it.  Deputy Kelly said it is out there but it is not and it is very important we have it.  We will then be able to see and judge what is happening.

The aim of any screening programme is to reduce the overall rates of cervical cancer, preferably by 100%, over many years.  If one has a very good cervical screening programme, one would hope to reduce it by perhaps 80%.  The UK has had a very effective screening programme since the 1980s over its whole population, where they have reduced the overall rate by at least 50%.  The introduction of HPV testing will not completely cure cervical cancer but it might allow it to be detected more effectively and more quickly than with the cervical smear alone.<\/p> <p>  It should also be borne in mind that it is a period of huge change for all screening programmes.  First, we are moving towards HPV testing as a new way of investigating.  Cervical cytology has been the test for 50 years so this is a significant change for all national programmes to introduce that.  Second, vaccination is now in place.  Now that girls are being vaccinated in most countries, it will have an impact on the number of cases of cervical cance, which should drop and hopefully by a dramatic level.  There is lots of research on change.  Changing programmes is a massive undertaking which takes years.  It is not feasible to follow recommendations such as stopping the sending of samples.  It must be planned very carefully and it would take a three to five year programme review and alteration.  If there were errors in one lab, they might be remedied by introducing additional quality control measures and so on.  Switching to HPV testing is not a panacea.  There continue to be many other considerations, research and tracking of the types in the population, and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#Q00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Helen Lambkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Lambkin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#Q00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Once the HPV testing has been introduced, it will be possible to reduce the screening frequency from three years to five years by using HPV triage, so one will also change the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Culliton"},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":384,"content":"<p>That would obviously have capacity implications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#Q00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Indeed it would.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Culliton"},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I have a short comment.

I have two brief questions, one of which follows from Dr. Regan's remarks.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask about the measures taken by the cervical cancer national cancer screening services quality assurance in cytopathology.  Quality assurance site visits to laboratory providers is listed as one of the things that must be undertaken, however, it does not say how many visits are required.  In a recent parliamentary question, I asked how many site visits had been carried out on all the labs since outsourcing began and was told there had been two, one in 2011 and the other in 2014.  Do the witnesses think that is good enough?  How bad is this State's oversight on outsourcing of the CervicalCheck programme?  <\/p> <p>  My second question is one I keep asking and am told that I will be given the answer.  Before he left, Tony O'Brien was before the health committee where he gave a commitment to me that of the 209 misread tests, he would make me a list of the specific laboratories from which they came.  One of his officials, Mr. John Gleeson, said that they would name them lab A, lab B, and lab C, when Mr. O'Brien interrupted and said, no, he would give me the names of the labs.  I have not received them.  At a private meeting with the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, with representatives of the health spokespersons from each party, I asked the same question.  The Minister said \"We will get that for you Deputy Smith\".  Recently when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, was filling in for the Taoiseach at Leaders Questions, I asked him and he promised he would get it for me.  All this time has passed and we still have not been given this information.  How difficult or how easy would it be to get the information about which labs the misread tests came from?  Was it ten from one,  20 from another and 30 from the other?  It is a simple question that I have asked repeatedly and cannot get an answer.  The last time I raised it I was told that it would be part of the scoping exercise.  I have no problem with that but when what seems to me to be a simple question is asked, an answer should be available.  Is this a hard question to answer or not?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#Q00800","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":389,"content":"<p>We know exactly where the smears go.

I am very pleased to have this opportunity to reassure the elected Members of the quality and safety of our breast screening programme in order that they in turn can reassure women of the quality of our programme.  The past four weeks have been very difficult for Irish women, and it is incumbent on those of us who deliver the breast screening service to provide the reassurance necessary.  I have devoted my professional life to the diagnosis of breast cancer both in the screening and the symptomatic setting.  I established the first breast screening programme in Belfast in 1988.  I was appointed clinical director of the Merrion BreastCheck unit in 1998.<br\/><br\/>BreastCheck is the national breast cancer screening programme.  The screening programme aims to diagnose cancers at the earliest possible stage, when there is a better outcome and the cancer, it is to be hoped, may be treated less aggressively and with less morbidity.  The programme was established following the publication of seminal randomised controlled trials in Sweden and other countries that demonstrated a reduction in breast cancer mortality of up to 30% by mammographic screening.  BreastCheck offers mammograms to women every two years.  Initially, they were offered to those between the ages of 50 and 64, but over the past two years we have been extending the age to 69 on a phased basis.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that since the establishment of the programme in 2000, we have performed more than 1.5 million mammograms, and in that time more than 11,500 women have been diagnosed with breast cancer.  BreastCheck is fortunate to be well funded and to have state-of-the-art equipment.  Every mammogram is read independently in the static unit by two consultant breast radiologists.  The Irish programme mirrors the UK programme in almost every aspect but with two important differences.  Our programme screens at two yearly intervals as opposed to three yearly intervals.  Recognising that diagnosing breast cancer does not save a single life, we have included treatment and, in particular, the surgical management of screen-detected breast cancer in our programme.  We have been fortunate to have the opportunity to train our radiographers and radiological staff to the highest international standard.  I must mention at this stage that we have had wonderful co-operation from our host hospitals.  Even with the pressures on beds and theatre time, we have been greatly facilitated in the treatment of screen-detected cancer in this country.<br\/><br\/>BreastCheck has four static units, two of which are in Dublin.  One of these two units is on the St. Vincent's University Hospital campus and the other is on the Mater Hospital campus.  The other two units are on the Cork University Hospital and University Hospital Galway campuses, respectively.  In spite of this, most screening happens on mobiles.  Our aim is to deliver the service as near as possible to the patient's home.  All patients recalled to assessment who have a mammographic abnormality on their initial mammogram are recalled to the static unit.  Patients recalled to assessment have all further tests, tomomammography, ultrasound, biopsy and clinical examination carried out in the static unit.  Patients who require biopsy are discussed at a multidisciplinary meeting and then return for results.  There is a dedicated team of specialist breast care nurses to support patients through diagnosis and surgical treatment.<br\/><br\/>The programme was established with stringent quality assurance parameters and key performance indicators.  These key performance indicators pertain to every aspect of the programme and are supported by extensive standard operating procedures.  We publish an annual report and we have a multidisciplinary quality assurance committee comprising, <i>inter alia<\/i>, radiologists, radiographers, pathologists, surgeons, epidemiologists, medical physicists, nursing and administration overseeing the quality of our programme.<br\/><br\/>Approximately 2,600 breast cancers are diagnosed every year in Ireland and, unfortunately, 680 women die from the disease.  It was noted in the 2016 annual report that BreastCheck screened more than 145,000 women in the previous year.  Of these, 986 women were diagnosed with screen-detected breast cancer.  The aim of our programme is to reduce mortality by 20%.  To achieve this goal, we need 70% of women to accept their invitation to screening.  This is why it is important for us to enlist the support of our public representatives to maintain acceptance rates.  If we do not maintain our acceptance rates, we will not reduce mortality, which is the ultimate goal.<br\/><br\/>On a happier note, over the past five years, survival from breast cancer in this country has improved from 75% to 83%.  I have no doubt that breast cancer screening has contributed to this improvement in survival together with improved treatment in the symptomatic centres and improved drug management in women with breast cancer.  The programme detects approximately seven cancers in every 1,000 women screened.  It is important for us to keep the recall rate as low as possible, preferably lower than 7%.  The reason for this is that every woman recalled to assessment will experience a diagnosis of breast cancer, and we know from evidence in the literature that it takes women two years to get back to baseline anxiety levels about breast cancer following a recall to assessment.  There is a constant balance to be struck between keeping recall rates low and cancer detection rates high, and this is a challenge to every cancer screening programme.<br\/><br\/>A women's charter is in place to ensure that the service is delivered in a timely manner and in line with promises made to women when the programme was established.  Since the outset of our programme, we have understood the need to produce and publish our data.  We have also understood the necessity of external accreditation.  Since the outset of the programme, we have had three external reviews carried out.  The most recent inspection was by the European Reference Organisation for Quality Assured Breast Screening and Diagnostic Services, EUREF.  Following a very detailed inspection, including protocols, procedures and interval cancer documentation, we were awarded reference status last year, indicating that our policy and practices are an example for other national programmes to follow.  EUREF has only awarded six screening programmes accreditation since 2009, only two of which have been awarded the highest quality of accreditation, which is category 4 reference centre accreditation, and BreastCheck is one of those two.<br\/><br\/>While mammography is the best screening test available for the early detection of breast cancer, it is neither 100% sensitive nor 100% specific and is not an ideal screening test from that point of view.  Not all cancers are detected by screening mammography, and we need to understand that a screening test is not the same as a diagnostic test and has an inherent false negative rate, as publicised in the international literature.  Women attending for screening are informed of this in all our documentation.  In fact, women who attend for screening sign a consent form that includes a statement to the effect that breast cancer screening does not detect all breast cancers.  In addition, when a woman gets a letter advising her that her screening mammogram is normal, it is stated in the result letter that if she develops any symptoms at any time, she must present to her general practitioner and, if deemed necessary, she should be referred to one of the eight symptomatic breast cancer centres in our country.<br\/><br\/>Breast cancer detected in the interval between screenings is deemed an interval cancer.  There is an international standard for interval cancer rates in screening programmes.  The expected rate of interval cancers is two per 1,000 women screened.  It is a very important determinant of the quality of a screening programme.  BreastCheck interval cancer rates are in accordance with the international published literature.  In fact, we ourselves published our interval cancer rates in the <i>Journal of Medical Screening<\/i>in April 2015.  Interval cancers rates are an important parameter of the quality of a programme because, unlike background cancer detection rates, they are independent of the background incidence rate in a country.  We find our interval cancer rate in the following way.  BreastCheck is informed of all cancers by the National Cancer Registry.  BreastCheck then determines if a woman has attended for screening and validates if it was within the past two years and if at the time of diagnosis the cancer was invasive.  If these criteria are fulfilled, it is deemed to be an interval cancer and included in the rates published in our literature.<br\/><br\/>The formal review has been ongoing since the establishment of our programme 20 years ago and in the UK programme for the past 30 years.  It is by necessity a retrospective and complex process.  The current validated data are available up to 2011.  In association with this, and while the review is ongoing, there is a practice performed in exactly the same way as in other European and UK countries.  In conjunction with this, however, any woman diagnosed with an interval breast cancer can request a review of her screening mammogram, or her clinician can do so on her behalf.<\/p><p>That review happens in real time at the earliest possible convenience.  It is performed by two consultant radiologists who were not involved in reporting the screening mammogram.  The information is then communicated to the patient.  While screening aims to reduce the mortality from breast cancers by 20%, there are definite downsides to screening of which we must be aware.  The most important one is interval cancers.  Anxiety associated with recall is a downside of screening.<\/p><p> Another downside is over-diagnosis, which has been prominent in the literature over the past five years.  This is when we commit women to open surgical biopsies for benign disease.  In other words, they have surgery that they would never have needed if they had not come for a screening mammogram because it is for benign disease.  Our aim is to make sure we do not perform any unnecessary surgery.  We may, through breast screening, detect breast cancer that may not affect a woman during her lifetime.  We may diagnose and treat a woman for breast cancer that she may have died with, rather than from.  Unfortunately, we cannot tell when we diagnose breast cancer which cancers will progress.  We do not have that ability at the moment.  With increased and more complex genetic marker testing in breast cancers that may be in our gift in the next decade but at the moment we do not know which cancers will kill women and which will not.  Therefore, we have to treat all breast cancers.  Giving a woman a diagnosis of breast cancer when she may not have died from it is termed lead-time bias and it is an inherent problem associated with breast cancer screening.<\/p><p> It is appropriate and necessary that we outline our plans for open disclosure.  Open disclosure has been a policy for the HSE since 2013 but it is planned to introduce it for breast cancer screening.  However, open disclosure is not a facet of, and does not happen in, other UK screening programmes.  It has, however, happened only in the past year in England.  On foot of the duty of candour legislation published in England in 2014, a detailed process was put in place to introduce open disclosure.  Even while there was a requirement and a wish to introduce it as quickly as possible, it was introduced only in 2017.  Scotland and Northern Ireland have not yet commenced open disclosure.  We are very fortunate in that we have had a lot of discussion with the English programme and it has shared its methodology and training videos which were released in May of this year, following the UK local elections.  It has released all its information on how it did this to us.  We look forward to implementing open disclosure in early 2019 but I emphasise that open disclosure in screening is very complex.  It is not the same as the symptomatic service or other diagnostic areas.

In answer to the first question, the interval cancer reviews are not patient-centred but programme-centred in order to determine the interval cancer rates.  That has been happening since the outset of the programme for 20 years.  We do not contact patients retrospectively when we carry out the review.  We have a very open policy.  If patients want to know about their breast cancer when they present to the treating surgeon, we will do it but we do not trigger it automatically.  We have had the benefit of the UK experience being shared with us.  Only 45% of women have requested open disclosure since the UK brought it in.  It is important that if we are to have open disclosure we make sure the woman wants it and that we have counselling services available.  It has not historically been part of any UK or European programme.  We are not doing anything in this programme that has not been part of established practice and that is not in the published literature.  In every aspect of this programme we have mirrored international best practice.  No other programme contacts women cold.  For many of these women it would have been a long time ago.  Unless they have requested it this takes quite a long time to filter through.  I am not at all reticent about telling women.

Every time we diagnose a patient with breast cancer who has had a mammogram in the previous year, be it in the symptomatic programme or the screening programme, we openly discuss that with the patient.  We ask if she would like to see her previous mammogram and we will have it reviewed.  There is an excellent process in the screening programme whereby if a woman has had a screening mammogram, we contact the service to say that she has been diagnosed.  The service will offer to sit down with her and go through the mammograms.  Frequently, it may not have been seen on the previous mammogram.  That is the nature of this test.  There is real openness there.<\/p> <p>  What I find in my personal practice when I am dealing with a woman who has just been diagnosed with breast cancer and discussing this openly with her is that it is the last thing on her mind.  What she wants to know is the plan of treatment, will she have chemotherapy and how long it will take.  They are the sort of major issues.  There is a policy and all practicing breast surgeons will offer this to women but is very rare for them to take it up.  If they do want to, there is a superb service in BreastCheck whereby two independent people will review the mammogram and the clinical leads will meet the patient.  It is very rare that women want this.  They want to get on with their treatment, be it surgery or chemotherapy.<\/p> <p>  It takes approximately nine months for a patient to undergo all her treatments between chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  We see her in follow up.  We follow her up for five years and we frequently ask if she wants to go through that but she usually wants to move on.  It is not a major issue in clinical practice but there is a very open climate about asking if she wants to look back.  We know this is going to happen because of the limitations of the test.  A mammogram is not a perfect test.  We are familiar with this.  Where we see approximately 400 breast cancers a year, there will be 30 or 40 women each year in the symptomatic service whose previous mammogram did not show it.  We are very familiar with the environment and what to do in that case.

We have engaged proactively with the HSE in this regard because this is a very important issue for us in radiology.  It is important in radiology because it is one of the specialties where this is a most difficult and nuanced issue because radiologists work in a profession where mistakes are made all of the time.  In other words, for a practising radiologist, international best practice would be an error rate of 3% to 5%.  We are working in a profession where we know errors will arise.  It is in our interests and in the patients' interests primarily that we have a good open disclosure process to deal with that.  Historically, it has not been there and we now need to put it in place.<\/p> <p>  When the national document was launched in 2013, we engaged with other jurisdictions, such as The Royal College of Radiologists in London and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists, that have similar methodologies to ours.  We also engaged with patient representatives and the State Claims Agency and we produced a document on open disclosure relatively quickly in 2015.  This document was subsequently updated in 2016 and is available on the faculty website.  It sets out our approach to open disclosure.<\/p> <p>  We are also mindful of the ethical guidelines from the Medical Council on this issue.  We do realise this is an evolving process.  We heard at an Oireachtas committee meeting last week that the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 was enacted in November 2017 but that it is still awaiting implementation and regulations through the Department of Health, which is outside my ambit.  While we need that legislation implemented, we need more than that.  To do open disclosure properly we have to focus on the patient and in this regard, the environment must be such that the patient is counselled and supported through the process.  There are a number of doctors in this room.  We have all made mistakes.  The serious mistakes that I have made in my career are seared into what I do and so I am very conscious of this.  We need to have a process where the people who are involved in the incident, the patients primarily, are dealt with in a supportive way through appropriate counselling and appropriate infrastructure.  As for the infrastructure required for this process, it has been proven internationally that it has to be provided in a learning environment, a non-judgmental environment and an environment where a single issue does not explode into one of national prominence.  Unfortunately, given Ireland is a small country, we suffer a little bit of the fish bowl effect such that a single issue can suddenly explode into one of national prominence.  I worked in California for a number of years, which is supposed to be a highly litigious society.  The background effect of open disclosure and litigation there was seemingly a lot less because it does not suffer the fish bowl effect that we have in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In radiology, when we make an error we are not sure whether that error precisely causes harm.  It has to be looked at in the overall clinical context of the patient and we have to do a systems review of it.  In summary, as radiologists, we are keen to do this but we do need a framework and we need the help of the Oireachtas in creating that framework.  To do this, we need a supportive environment, one where people can learn from their errors without the risk of litigation.  We also need to be honest.  We want to have an open process but we want the whole process to be open on the table.  To be open on the table we need to know the number of errors it is anticipated will happen in our services.  For example, we in radiology, can say that in a model 4 hospital might have approximately 10,000 errors per year.  How is it proposed to legislate to have open disclosure for all of these cases?  If it is proposed to compensate everyone for every error, that then needs to be set out clearly in legislation.  We need to move forward together in this regard because at the end of the day it is the patient who will benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Riste&aacute;rd &Oacute; Laoide"},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.

I started in BreastCheck 18 years ago.  It is something of which this country should be proud.  It is a fantastic service.  It was funded well and was set up in a careful way.  It has been externally validated over 18 years and receives the top mark from European accreditors every time.<\/p> <p>  My concern is that what has come to light about another screening programme over the past month has the potential to force the country to stop screening.  BreastCheck has saved lives from breast cancer.  It has been a fantastic programme.  It is well run and everyone who has been involved is complimentary about it, but I am worried that the current situation will spiral out of control.  We need the committee's support for introducing open disclosure in the balanced, careful and structured way that Professor O'Doherty discussed.  The screening programme costs &euro;40 million.  If the State pays out &euro;100 million in medical legal costs, the taxpayer will have to say \"Stop the screening programme\".  That means women will die from breast cancer who do not need to.  We have a great programme that is saving lives and doing well.  I encourage the committee to try to ensure balance.  BreastCheck is the best part of the Irish health service.  Its quality assurance parameters are fantastic.<\/p> <p>  There is no need for me to tell members all of this.  I work in the symptomatic service.  BreastCheck is something that I am proud of, but I am worried as one of the clinicians involved that it could be destroyed for poor reasons.  We require members to ensure there is a balanced opinion out there, the screening programme continues and women turn up for it.  To make it justifiable, we need 70% of the women invited to turn up.  It is good and will save lives.

What the D&aacute;il and this and other committees have discussed is the apparent paternalistic attitude of people within the health service towards the women who are users of that service.  With respect, that is why Professor Hill is here today.  It is not because of any failing on behalf of this particular screening programme.  However, if there is a lack of confidence in the screening programmes overseen by the HSE, the blame for that does not lie at the door of the politicians or the women themselves.  The blame lies at the door of the HSE.  We are discussing it because we, as elected representatives, have received calls from constituents who are panicking.<\/p> <p>  I am a major supporter of Professor Hill's service.  I can count at least two women in my life who I am reasonably confident owe their lives, and certainly their health, to that service.  I encourage all women to use it.

Where there is a misdiagnosis, whether or not a woman wants to go back on that road, there should be some learning by the organisation.  We fully appreciate that human beings make mistakes but if there is a perception of people trying to cover up those mistakes or withholding information, issues would arise.  I am very happy to join all the witnesses in encouraging all eligible women to respond to that letter and keep their contact information up to date to ensure they get themselves tested.  The responsibility of the witnesses is to ensure that when women present themselves, they can have confidence in the process.<\/p><p> When we ask a question about the look-back and whether it is automatic, it is partly for the woman sitting in front of the doctors who may not want to go back.

Two independent readers look at it.  We look at our misses and our triumphs, as some of the cancers we pick up are at the very edge of perception.  It is an absolute and open learning environment in screening.  The biggest downside is that we do not pick up all the breast cancers.  I work as the lead clinician in symptomatic services at St. Vincent's University Hospital.  I do not go in every morning with an expectation I will miss cancers because I have ultrasound and other tests available.  Unfortunately, screening mammography is an inferior test.  As clinicians we must face it that we will let down women.  Not only are we going to let down women but we are going to let down their families as well.  It is a real downside to what we do.<\/p> <p>  When we see cancers that should have been picked up - let me tell members that there are some cases where we ask ourselves how they were missed - the only way to survive knowing a disservice has been done to the woman in question or her family is to think positively about the pick-ups we have made.  We are the most transparent, quality assured, introspective group of people members will have met.  We are informed by the symptomatic service of an interval cancer.  I can remember at least ten times in my life asking myself how we missed a cancer but when we got the symptomatic mammogram, the cancer may have been in a completely different place.  We are busy and self-critical.  I assure members that we are the most neurotic, self-absorbed group of people running the breast cancer screening service in this country.

We were told by very senior people within the Health Service Executive and the Department, as well as some politicians in here, that we did not need mandatory open disclosure or legal underpinning of the concept because it was being done anyway since 2013.  Now the witnesses are telling us it is not done.  The witnesses may practise it in their everyday work but it is by no means a rule.  While I fully appreciate that the witnesses have come to instill confidence in the system for women, a key tenet must be open disclosure.  Maybe a woman does not want to know and is more concerned about her hair falling out.  I do not know that and the witnesses would have more experience of it than I do.  Perhaps a woman would want to know but she is not being asked.  She could be traumatised and very ill.  Surely it should be the first port of call to share that information.  If the woman does not want it, that is grand.  There is nothing wrong with having too much information when one is sick.  People can always say they do not want to deal with it.  It strikes me as odd that this is not par for the course or part of the daily practice.  It might be encouraged and individuals may do it but to my mind, it is a policy failure if it is not happening universally.

The reason the delegates have been brought before the committee is there are issues with CervicalCheck and we want to get to the facts.  I hope we will not have real concerns.  In our position we know the difference between screening and diagnostics.  We know that programmes have a percentage of issues.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned that Professor O&rsquo;Doherty said she would be happy to implement the open disclosure policy.  She does not have a choice.  I become concerned when I hear people keep talking about best international practice.  It is correct that our screening programmes be mirrored against others.  I hate the phrase &ldquo;best practice&rdquo;.  I do not believe in it.  I believe there is practice and that there are circumstances.  I believe in the Kilmeaden cheese version, namely, take the best and get rid of the rest because no two circumstances are perfect.  Professor O&rsquo;Doherty must adhere to what is in the law and policy.  A policy of open disclosure should have been implemented but it was not.  To be fair, she has been very open about it, but she has no choice.  In the future it will have to be implemented and should have been in the past.  As a result of what has been said today, the committee must move up the food chain and through Mr. McCallion determine why this did not happen.  That is one outcome from the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I was the first to raise the issue of National Cancer Registry Ireland, NCRI, and the sharing of information.  At the Committee of Public Accounts last week its director was open about the four screening programmes and where there was sharing and where there was not.  Will the delegates outline in detail what is being shared?  I do not want to find out that information has not been shared at some level.  We have had ridiculous data protection issues.<\/p> <p>  As clinical director of BreastCheck, does Professor O&rsquo;Doherty have concerns which she would like to express to the committee about how the HSE supports the programme?  Deputy Bernard J. Durkan is coming after me and will probably chase the same question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#X00500","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I will not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018052300002#X00600","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":510,"content":"<p>We know about issues at screening level and that everything is not perfect.

If there was a policy of open disclosure that was delivered the moment an issue arose, then perhaps Professor O'Doherty would not have the flood of 15 cases coming down the line in a two-week period rather than one per year.  If there is open disclosure, patients are accepting of receiving accurate information in a timely way.  The purpose of open disclosure is of course to disclose.  However, a side issue is that once patients are informed, they are satisfied that no negligence was attributed to the miss.  They are happy to accept that and may not go down the litigious route.  If information is kept from them, however, and then they discover it through other means, they become litigious.  The point of open disclosure is to try to prevent litigation and to maintain confidence in the programme.  That is the point that has come out in this committee and other committees in recent weeks.  The view is that open disclosure will prevent litigation and maintain the financing of the service.

It is important that we have that figure for comparison purposes now that we have litigation.  I listened to Professor Hill comments, especially the worry that screening programmes may have to be closed down to reduce the level of litigation, which is clearly not the way forward.  It is important to have figures on the annual cost of BreastCheck and the problems we will face.  The witnesses identified that we are within international standards in terms of the number of cancers missed.  The service is comprehensive and everything is done by all the staff to get the most accurate results possible.  When cancers are missed, if everyone opts for litigation we will end up paying out more in compensation than the entire cost of the service.<\/p> <p>  I had an interesting conversation with a consultant from Ireland who recently attended a conference in the United States at which the level of compensation paid out in Ireland for medical negligence was outlined.  The attendees were surprised that Ireland appears to pay out much more in compensation than is paid out in the United States.  On the one hand, we want open disclosure.  On the other hand, we want to provide a comprehensive screening system.  If money is taken away from the latter to pay the costs of litigation, there will be a problem.  How have other countries dealt with this issue?  A mediation process was mentioned.  Do other countries provide a mediation service?  If so, does it work?<\/p> <p>  We heard that 145,000 people avail of the BreastCheck service each year.  That is a significant number.  On the basis of a an interval cancer rate of two per 1,000 people, approximately 290 cases will be identified each year.  That is a small number, although a missed cancer diagnosis is a big issue for the person concerned.  How can we deal with this complex and difficult issue, particularly in terms of what has occurred in the past four weeks?  As a practising solicitor with a legal background, I share Professor Hill's concern about the level of litigation that will arise as a result of what has happened over the past four weeks.  Litigation will not serve the best interests of the medical service or those who practise medicine on whom it also has a traumatic effect.

We fully understand why we were unable to appear before it on the last occasion.  I am the chief inspector and accompanied by my two deputy chief inspectors, Ms Pauline Shields and Mr. Hugh Hume.<\/p> <p>  The Garda Inspectorate is a statutory body that is independent in its operation and functions.  Our main goal is to try to ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na uses its resources efficiently and effectively.  Representatives of the inspectorate last appeared before the committee in October 2016.  We welcome the recommendation made in the committee's subsequent report that the inspectorate be provided with a statutory power to conduct unannounced visits.  The inspectorate notes that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Bill 2017 contains such a provision.  However, we believe the requirement to obtain the approval of the Minister to exercise this power should not be included.  Following a request from the Policing Authority, the inspectorate is conducting an inspection of the delivery of police services to local communities.  We are also in the final stages of completing an advice paper for the Minister that is looking at opening up entry routes into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  \"Responding to Child Sexual Abuse\" is a follow-up review to a previous report published in 2012.  For the first time, we forensically re-examined a previously inspected area to assess progress in implementing our recommendations.  The review also examined joint working arrangements between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla under Children First.  Since the 2012 report, there has been a considerable increase in the risks posed to children by the Internet and social media and the volume of online child abuse material is growing exponentially.  This area was also examined in the review.<\/p> <p>  Child sexual abuse is one of the most serious types of crime with which garda&iacute; will ever deal.  The review found that 66% of all recorded sexual offences in Ireland involved a child victim.  As part of the inspection, the inspectorate critically examined 211 child abuse cases to assess the quality of Garda investigations.<\/p><p>This analysis identified that the age profile of victims in these cases ranged from as young as three years of age and that only 5% of suspects were described as strangers.  Since the publication of the original report in 2012, only 45% of the recommendations can be considered fully implemented.  Processes in place between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla for managing child protection cases are inefficient.  Despite some progress in joint agency working, many barriers still remain.  Joint agency meetings to discuss serious cases do not always take place and decisions are often made separately.  We found that other jurisdictions have more structured and dynamic processes for making decisions in these types of cases.  While the 2012 report recommended multi-agency specialist child centres to provide medical examination, victim interviewing and therapeutic services, there are no such centres in place.<\/p><p> There are still delays in recording crimes on PULSE.  Some Garda investigations were conducted expeditiously and to a high standard while many others drifted with significant delays in taking victim statements, arresting or interviewing suspects and sending cases to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Inexperienced garda&iacute; are still investigating child sexual abuse.  This is not good practice.  Joint interviewing of a child victim by garda&iacute; and social workers is not in place.  Victim support organisations, however, reported that the relationship between victims and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has improved.<\/p><p> Not all convicted sex offenders who should be monitored by the multi-agency SORAM process are subject to those arrangements.  This review examined 2,000 referrals of child sexual abuse material sent to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We requested an update on these cases.  Despite repeated requests, 12 Garda divisions did not provide updates for some of the cases.  We found significant delays at all stages in processing these cases.  There was an insufficient online Garda presence at the time of the review.  Other jurisdictions have a stronger online presence to target those grooming children and those accessing child abuse material.  There are still very long delays in the forensic examination of computers and other devices.  This is an organisational risk.  Technology that provides real-time intelligence on those accessing child abuse material was available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but was not activated at the time of completing this review.  The inspectorate was recently informed that it is now in use and that additional online Garda resources are in place.  Like other jurisdictions, prosecution and conviction rates for child sexual abuse cases are low and long delays in conducting investigations do not help.<\/p><p> The inspectorate welcomes the creation of a Garda national protective services bureau and the roll-out of divisionally based protective services units that will have specially trained staff.  These units have the potential to professionalise the investigation of child sexual abuse and provide better victim care.  To address the findings on joint agency working, the inspectorate believes that all relevant Departments and agencies need to work together to reduce the risk of child sexual abuse and exploitation and make the physical and virtual worlds safer places for children.  An important part of the review was the engagement with two adult survivors of child sexual abuse.  Their testimonies gave an insight into the difficulties victims sometimes endure once they have reported abuse.  The inspectorate is very grateful for their contributions, and the changes recommended in this report are designed to improve services for all victims.<\/p><p> There are 24 new recommendations in this report.  They include developing a national strategy for child sexual abuse, child sexual exploitation and online risks to child safety; that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla develop a more dynamic and structured approach to managing child protection cases; developing multi-agency specialist child centres and ensuring joint interviewing of a child; urgently addressing the backlog in forensic examination of computers and other devices; adequately resourcing and completing the roll-out of all divisional protective services units by the end of 2018; and ensuring that sufficient Garda resources are in place to provide a strong online Garda presence.<\/p><p> In November 2017, the inspectorate made a submission to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  This is available on our website.  We firmly believe that there is a place in the oversight architecture for an independent inspectorate that is focused on conducting inspections, audits and examinations to ensure that Garda reform is progressed and at pace.  As a new team and having examined most aspects of policing, the inspectorate is in the process of developing a strategy and action plan for future work.  We are proposing to approach this on a risk basis so that we inspect areas of most relevance and impact having regard to any human rights issues that may arise.  In this context, the power to initiate our own work, which was included in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Act of 2015 following a recommendation by this committee, will be most useful.  While our work to date has mainly been large-scale thematic inspections, future work could include post-implementation reviews, compliance audits and cyclical inspections.  The inspectorate has declared an interest to the Department of Justice and Equality in participating in the inspection process that will be required following the ratification of the operational protocol to the Convention against Torture.  This would involve conducting visits to places of detention maintained by garda&iacute;.<\/p><p> The objective of the inspectorate has always been to help make An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a better service - better for the public, for victims of crime, for all the people working in the organisation itself and for the criminal justice system in Ireland.  It has always been the inspectorate's view that implementation of our recommendations is the way forward to reforming An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but we are disappointed with the pace of change.

I want to talk briefly about the inspectorate's review of child sexual abuse.  Obviously, it is a matter of extreme concern not just to this committee but to all of the Oireachtas and all of the public.  Two statistics are particularly worrying.  The report found that 66% of all recorded sexual offences in Ireland involve a child victim, which is particularly worrying.  The report contained a statistical finding that does not surprise me but is something of which we should be aware, namely, that only 5% of suspects were described as strangers.  This reveals that in the vast majority of cases, abusers of children are people who occupy positions of trust.  One of the findings in the report is that not all convicted sex offenders who should be monitored by the multi-agency SORAM process are subject to those arrangements.  Will Mr. Toland tell us whether anything been done about that because that would be an issue of considerable concern to him and this committee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018052300002#E00300","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":589,"content":"<p>We were also shocked by the statistic that two thirds of all victims are children.  It is a crime that is under-reported.  We also found that significant numbers of reports are made much later.  In many cases, they are made a year or sometimes many decades later.  This affects the Garda when it is trying to investigate it because it will have lost corroborating evidence and forensic evidence.  The Deputy is right to acknowledge that the majority of people who abuse children in reported crimes are either within the family or people known to them such as neighbours or people in authority.<\/p> <p>  We looked at sex offender management.  A good multi-agency process is in place.  It has been a pilot for a long time and has not been officially launched.  Agencies are coming together and dealing with some of the most difficult people to manage.  There are some processes in the courts that we think need to be addressed.  One of those is a pre-sanction report.  Once a person is convicted and before sentencing, we think it should be mandatory for every adult to be subject to a pre-sanction report so that the Probation Service can present to the court its suggestions for the best way to monitor that offender in the future.  Some of these people are very high-risk.  We found that out of about 250 people who would go before the court, only about 160 would end up with a post-release supervision order.<\/p><p>If they do not have an order in Ireland, they will not be monitored by the SORAM process, and that is a gap that we think needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018052300002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Toland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Are there many sex offenders in the community today who are not being monitored?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018052300002#F00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":592,"content":"<p>If they are convicted of a sexual offence, they are all subject to notification requirements, so every single sex offender convicted in court is subject to some kind of monitoring.

I would appreciate it if Mr. Toland could address them together insofar as possible and I will try to look back on the transcript for any of the other contributions.  It is about 12 months, I think, since the publication of the section 12 audit carried out by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.  That report was very much of the view that individual garda&iacute; were doing all they could and were very committed and professional but that there were systemic failings that related not just to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but to Tusla as well.  Will Mr. Toland give his view of the progress in this area, generally speaking?  One of the recommendations in the report was the need for co-location in terms of multi-agency work.  Will Mr. Toland comment on that?  In addition, is he satisfied with the functioning of the protection services bureaux to date?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018052300002#F00800","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I will deal with the last question first.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na underwent a sea change in 2016 in respect of specialisation, which we welcome.  The Garda had taken the view that any Garda member had the skills to investigate the rape of a child, which is not a view we hold and is not good practice in any other police service.  We are delighted the Garda is introducing a protective services unit in every Garda division.  There are four in operation.  They will be properly trained, form a specialist unit and be a single point of contact for other agencies, such as the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and Tusla.  We welcome this.  We are a little worried they will not be rolled out quickly enough because there will still be occasions on which inexperienced Garda members are dealing with child sexual abuse investigations, which is not something we would like to see.  We also found a gap in local interaction between senior Garda managers and senior Tusla mangers.  That gap has now been plugged, and the Garda has now introduced a formal process locally in every area across Ireland, where senior managers will come together.  We think this is a good thing.<\/p> <p>  Co-location, in some aspects of this, is very positive but it still should not be a barrier to better inter-agency working.  Some progress has been made between the agencies but they still have a very inefficient process for making notifications.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's notification system is paper-based.  We want to see an electronic version, which would speed things up.  We also found that the two agencies tend to make decisions separately.  We would like to see more of a coming together with the professionals to make decisions about child protection cases so the case proceeds much more quickly.  In other jurisdictions - I know the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla have visited the UK - there are some good models that could be adapted to work very well in Ireland.  We are not prescriptive about the model, just the way in which the Garda would operate and deal with the most serious cases.  It should deal with them much more quickly than it does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018052300002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Toland"},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  It must be incredibly frustrating that so long after the inspectorate's original report, only 45% of the recommendations have been fully implemented.  This kind of carries on from the inspectorate's previous very insightful reports on overall policing needs and targets.  A minority of what it is recommending is being implemented.  Does the inspectorate have the facility to raise this general issue and these concerns with the Minister or the Department?  Frankly, it is just not good enough.  My feeling is that the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is just replicating the job of work that the inspectorate did a number of years ago.  It is completely unnecessary, but here we have it again: work the inspectorate did not being implemented.  Is there a forum for the inspectorate to raise this?

The one that sticks out for me that was not implemented is child centres, specialist centres of excellence, where a child victim can be taken immediately to have medical services, to be interviewed and to have the therapeutic needs of the child dealt with.  That needs more than the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to come together.  We were disappointed to see some of the recommendations that were within the gift of the Garda either took a long time to implement or have not been implemented.<\/p> <p>  What I would say about the conclusion of this report is that for the first time the Minister has brought together an implementation group.  That is different language.  It has an independent chair bringing together those agencies to try to drive not only the recommendations from 2012, but also the new recommendations in this report.  The Policing Authority has filled a gap in ensuring that our recommendations are implemented, and we were delighted that it received a previous report, Changing Policing in Ireland.  There are some matters in this report that could go to the Policing Authority - that decision has not yet been made - but a different language is being spoken at present.  A lot of work is going on to try to address some of these recommendations.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has been looking at children's centres.

We believe there was a gap between the governance of the two at a national level and in the delivery of local services.

We envisaged and recommended in 2012 that two pilot projects be commenced and we were disappointed that not even one pilot scheme has been done.  We are frustrated but there is a great deal of activity to get those centres up and running quickly.  Existing facilities could be used in the interim to at least bring services together so that a child needs to attend only one location.  It is not right that a child or adult victim of sexual assault must travel to different locations for different services.  Parents and guardians from other jurisdictions are happy to travel longer distances to a specialist centre where they know they will get a really good service.  It is not the case that they need to be located all over Ireland.  The minute a child comes forward with his or her family to report child sexual abuse, there should be a dedicated centre to which the child can be brought rather than having to ring around to find a hospital or paediatrician that can see him or her.

That is an occasion where the agencies need to physically come together.  As the Garda member investigating the crime might be on night duty or might not be in a specialist unit, he or she is not always available to go to that meeting.  Sometimes the investigating Garda member is not available and sometimes conversations take place on the phone.  I think it is a commitment to the process that one physically turns up and something is lost if the people are not in the same room.  People might have had a conversation over the phone but it is important that the agencies come together and for each agency to provide information that it has got on its systems about the family and the suspect.<\/p> <p>  We went to look at UK models.  We went to Scotland and to the West Midlands - to Birmingham city centre - in the UK and while they operate slightly different systems, they are all co-located.  A notification comes in that it is a serious case, it goes to a social worker, the social worker carries out an immediate assessment, and then the social worker arranges the meeting.  We sat there and watched the meeting.  The agencies are in the same location, they come together, they share their information and they make what I would call executive decisions.  These are all trained personnel - a paediatrician, a highly trained police officer and a highly trained social worker.  They predetermine what happens next such as whether the child will be medically examined or will be interviewed, the dates of those examinations and the interviews.  This is all done before a police officer has been told that he or she has been told he or she is investigating the crime.  So the police officer investigating is given the crime and already important things have been done.  The process is just much quicker and more dynamic plus highly trained people make those decisions.  That is a model that we really like.  In Scotland, they do a similar thing but information is shared online at the start.  Sharing data is a major barrier in Ireland but it did not seem to be a problem in the UK and Scotland, where they shared the data and willingly gave all of the information they had.  We found reticence here about sharing data in the fear that it would be disclosed to a third party.

Recently attempts have been made to enhance the PULSE system but we feel it should be replaced with a system that is built around case management and crime investigation.<\/p> <p>  PULSE in itself is not the problem with recording; the problem is a Garda member not putting an entry on to the PULSE system.  That is the problem.  Once a crime is recorded on PULSE, one can supervise and monitor it.  If a Garda member makes an arbitrary decision not to record a crime on PULSE then that is a major issue.  We have recommended that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na check its call recording systems so that if someone has rang up to say he or she has been a victim of a sexual assault then the authorities should check to make sure there is a corresponding PULSE record in place.  Let us say someone walks into a Garda station and reports child sexual abuse, if that Garda member does not record it immediately then the only two people who know about the abuse are the victim who went to the station and the Garda member.  That is a weakness in the system.  PULSE relies on a Garda member recording a case immediately.

In a response in Parliament the Minister has said he does not think his approval is required every time we want to make a visit.  It may just be the way it has been written, but to us, it seems impracticable that every time we wanted to make a visit, we would need ministerial approval which might be required if it was an issue of State security.  It might be something that would need to be considered if we were to go into an area to inspect very sensitive material.

Deputy Mick Wallace raised with them the recommendation made in the inspectorate's report on multi-agency specialist child centres.  Mr. Toland referred to two pilot projects to be undertaken on foot of that recommendation.  Was the inspectorate specific about the projects to be undertaken?  Was it just a recommendation that there be two or did the inspectorate have a wider view of the cities that should be involved or whether it should be a rural pilot project?  Were there other elements and dimensions to it other than a recommendation that there be two such projects?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018052300002#M01300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527062400,"counter":697,"content":"<p>Certainly, it was recommended that one of the pilot projects be in Dublin city centre.  I cannot remember if it was recommended that both take place in cities, but it was felt we should start in a city centre because travel would be easier and it would be easier to involve the strategic agencies.  I think it was envisaged that they would probably pilot the project in cities.  It was about bringing agencies together in a single location with all of the services a victim of child sexual abuse needed.  As far as I am concerned, existing facilities could be used while purpose-built facilities were being planned as that will take a period of time and require funding.  Children have to travel to the interview suite looked after by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the place where they can be medically examined.  They are separate locations and it is traumatic for a child to be brought from one location to another.<\/p><p>At the centres that we visited, the children are met immediately by professionals who explain exactly what will happen, which relieves much of the worry of parents.  They explain what the medical examination will involve.  What we found in the other jurisdictions we examined was that parents and guardians are more likely to agree to medical examination and to assist with a police investigation.  In Ireland, we found that parents are often put off by the explanation and quite often refuse to allow a child to be interviewed or medically examined.  As a result, the prosecution cannot proceed or is very unlikely to do so.  We believe the proposed approach would encourage parents to come forward and assist with an investigation, whereas under the current approach parents seem reticent about allowing their child to be examined and do not always allow their child to be interviewed.  That presents serious risks because the abuser is still a risk to other children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018052300002#M01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Toland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527062400,"counter":699,"content":"<p>If I could add to that, a pilot project is most certainly required for a significant population catchment with a city base.
