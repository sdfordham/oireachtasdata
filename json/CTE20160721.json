However, there is also a broader issue in respect of the section 38s and section 39s.  So far, where difficulties, controversies and malpractice have been exposed, in some cases it is almost accidental or it is at least happening in a piecemeal fashion.  Therefore, we need to consider how we can get a global view not just of the controls but also of compliance across section 38s and section 39s.  I am mindful that the Chairman has a smaller cohort of section 38s and quite a large number of section 39s.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General might be able to assist the committee in suggesting a way in which we can be satisfied that there is not only control but also compliance in respect of public pay policy, proper use of public funds and good governance.  I do not know what that model is but I know that we cannot lurch from one episode to another just as and when they come into the public domain.  We need to have a much more comprehensive and reassuring framework through which we can examine this matter in its totality.  Of course, we need the HSE's full co-operation in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if the Chairman or clerk to the committee can do so but we need to come up with something that allows us to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#B01100","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I support Deputy McDonald and will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General for a brief comment.  Essentially, the issue boils down to this - many of the organisations that receive funding through section 38 and section 39 arrangements have other funding in their own right.  All the funding seems to go into the one pot and it is then impossible to distinguish whether public funds went where they should not go or whether people will say it was private funding which went somewhere that is none of our business.  That is a conundrum that we cannot live with forever.  I do not want to be unnecessarily bureaucratic and have a separate set of accounts for public funds, although we might have to do so.  Would Mr. McCarthy have an observation to make concerning that basic conundrum, which is that we lose accountability when funding, including private income, goes into a big pot?  We are then told, in some cases, that we cannot even look at it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#B01200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1469088000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Yes.  I think perhaps the first point is that the grants circular issued at the end of 2013 or 2014 has changed the rules in relation to how grant funding is accounted for by recipients of that funding.  That was the circular that came about after the SIPTU report and this committee reported and made recommendations to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It requires that all funds from public sources are identified in the financial statements of a body.  Therefore, any line of funding that emanates from public bodies to grant-funded agencies should be identified.<\/p> <p>  Second, a more recent development is a system put in place with support from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is harvesting information from the financial statements of all charities and voluntary bodies.  That is a huge database.  It is an exercise which requires reliance on the financial statements that are published and presented.  That is trying to identify for any individual charity or voluntary body where their funding is coming from, so we should be able to get a better handle on who is substantially funded from the public sector or who may be with minority support in the public sector and then charity funds or other donations.  That development will probably yield a better capacity to oversee what is happening.<\/p> <p>  More specifically with the section 38s and section 39s, we have been encouraging the HSE to expand the piece of material it has in the statement on internal financial control.  That, effectively, is the place that one should expect to see the kind of information this committee is talking about.  It is information that would be sufficient for the committee to be satisfied that the oversight regime is not only appropriately designed but is also working. <\/p> <p>  Performance indicators in that area would show what percentage of section 39s had submitted audited financial statements within a year of the end of the year to which they related.  Those kind of statistics would give the committee a handle on it if, let us say, there was 70% or 90% compliance.  The committee could then look at it in terms of numbers and also the value of the spend that was issued.  For instance, one might find that 10% of the section 39s get 80% of the funding and so one would obviously be more concerned about what is happening there. <\/p> <p>  From my recollection of Mr. O'Brien's presentation last week, he was talking about expanding the more demanding governance and reporting regime in place for section 38s and also applying it to section 39s.  Rather than focusing on section 38s and section 39s, one might focus on the ones that are benefiting from large amounts of funding and ones that have a lesser amount of funding.  <\/p> <p>  There is a lot of work to do yet in getting to the position that the Chairman described.  That arrangement should be in place and should be functioning.  I suppose persistence by this committee, myself and my staff in following up on that is the only way we will get to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#B01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>That is right.  We recognise there is an issue here.  The Chairman made a good point that in circumstances where State moneys are provided to an organisation that also receives charitable donations and perhaps private income, the committee has found it almost impossible to disaggregate the figures and demonstrate that public moneys were used for a certain purpose alone.  Financial officers conceded the point that everything went into one pot, which means nobody could credibly argue that public money was not being used for top-ups or whatever the case may be.  This is extremely problematic and needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  My principal concern is that the committee needs to be able to credibly demonstrate to members of the public that we have a handle on and proper oversight of section 38 and 39 organisations.  We should not pick up the newspaper some morning to discover there has been a HSE audit and we are dealing with another car crash scenario because these issues have a debilitating effect.  While I accept that we have the elements described in place, work needs to be done to string them together and ensure the committee and others have controls and oversight over the sector and there is compliance.  Instead of dealing with the section 38 and 39 organisations singly and in a piecemeal fashion, we must find a way to resolve the issues that have presented themselves. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#C00100","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1469088000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>On the issue of the pooling of funding, my view would be that if there is a single fund and public resources go into it, then any application of that funding is an application of public funding, obviously on a pro rata basis.  An alternative would be that where funds are given, the State sector could, if it had a particular concern that money should go to a particular resource, restrict the handling of the funding so that it goes into a particular fund and is accounted for separately and transparently in the financial statements.  This is something different in terms of the inspection rights that I have.  I have power under section 8 of the 1993 Act to carry out an inspection in a publicly funded body to ascertain exactly that the money has been used for the purposes intended but that is restricted to a situation where more than 50% of the income of the entity in the particular year comes from public sources.<\/p> <p>  There is a different model for national audit offices in other jurisdictions, which is that one follows the money and once the grant is given, the auditor has the right to go in and examine and see that the money was applied for the purposes intended.  In terms of the grant agreement and the specification of what money is to be used for, it is possible for the HSE's internal audit - I think this is what the HSE has incorporated into the grant agreements - to follow the money and go into an organisation.  If an organisation is taking the money, it has to let the HSE in to see.  There are, therefore, other responses that might be put in place in the longer term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>We need to get a complete picture of controls in respect of section 38 and 39 organisations and even beyond that.  It was interesting to note in the report that while the focus was on the organisation in question and partially on the Health Service Executive, the report also raises questions for the Companies Registration Office in terms of its processes and also for the Revenue Commissioners.  Clear issues arise in respect of Revenue controls.<\/p> <p>  In all the committee's exchanges wit the director general of the HSE, he stated the controls had not failed.  At the meeting, Mr. McCarthy made the point that controls of themselves are not perfect and have not been designed to be perfect.  While we all accept that point, compliance is as important as controls are and controls are only effective if compliance measures work.  In this case, they clearly did not work as it has been accepted that almost all of them were missed.  Controls may not be the problem but compliance certainly is a problem.<\/p> <p>  This is not only an issue for the HSE.  I tabled a parliamentary question to Revenue on section 38 and 39 organisations.  The response I received indicated that between 2007 and 2016, Revenue conducted 7,500 desk management interventions in relation to section 38 and 39 organisations and 1,690 compliance issues were identified.  These are extraordinary figures, which indicate that there is a problem.  The committee needs to look at the complete picture.  If we are talking about compliance but not controls, we must assess the information provided to us, regroup as a committee and identify how we can look at the complete picture, who we need to invite before us and what controls failed.<\/p> <p>  It would be simplistic to focus on the HSE when we know that different information was provided to the Companies Registration Office, for example, different dates of birth for the same person, maiden names rather than married names and all sorts of other stuff.  A range of issues also arose in Revenue, including unpaid salaries.  Are these matters peculiar to the organisation in question?  Given the response I received from Revenue, that is obviously not the case.  The committee will have to carry out an assessment of this matter, although I am not sure how we would approach it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#C00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1469088000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>The charity regulator is obviously part of that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>While we have an idea of the problem, we do not yet have a solution.

Only some of the recommendations made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other Departments have been implemented.  The committee should revisit the issue of public private partnerships because they involve significant sums of taxpayers' money.  International best practice shows that other countries do things better than we do in this area.  It would be valuable if the committee were to examine examples of international best practice because information is key and without it, we cannot evaluate whether we are obtaining good value for money from public private partnerships.

I want to ensure the spirit of legislation is fully complied with, and that anyone who sends us a protected disclosure can be assured it will be thoroughly examined.

The Minister is adamant that there is a presumption that protected disclosures fall within the Act.  I am concerned that a procedure is being implemented in the House that every disclosure that is sent in by somebody who believes it to be a protected disclosure is, in the first instance, sent to the parliamentary legal advisory section of the House before it is brought to the relevant committee.  I am concerned that the parliamentary legal advisory service is looking for loopholes which will allow it not to include disclosures as protected disclosures, despite the purpose of the legislation.<\/p> <p>  I want the spirit of the legislation implemented, not for people to find legal loopholes.  There is no point in the Oireachtas passing such legislation while the Oireachtas itself is trying to frustrate genuine, bona fide disclosures which citizens believe are protected disclosures.

Its functions were expanded and reorganised under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014.  The revised structure of the NTMA following the amendment is outlined on the screen in front of members, on which they can see the myriad functions of the agency.  A distinction must be drawn to their attention.  The agency provides staffing and services in support of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and the National Asset Management Agency.  These two bodies have separate boards and their chief executives are the accountable persons for the activities of the agencies.  Within the functions that fall under the National Treasury Management Agency there are a number of sets of financial statements which were presented this morning and which the committee noted when it was looking at the accounts and statements presented.<\/p> <p>  The NTMA's primary function is to manage borrowing on behalf of the State.  The results of that borrowing activity are reported in the agency's national debt account each year.  This account is also reproduced as Part 2 of the finance accounts which are published separately by the Department of Finance.  The committee might wish to note that the national debt account does not reflect the total indebtedness of the State.<\/p><p>One of the objectives of chapter 2 of my annual report is to set national debt financial reporting in the context of overall or general Government debt, estimates of which are compiled by the Central Statistics Office.  Other functions and services of the NTMA include management of compensation claims on behalf of certain State authorities through the State Claims Agency, the management of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and the provision of procurement and financial advice on certain public private partnerships and other large capital projects through the National Development Finance Agency.  As I said, the NTMA also assigns staff and provides certain other services, on a reimbursement basis, for two independent bodies, that is, the National Asset Management Agency and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, which are governed by separate boards.  The NTMA is not accountable for the activities of these bodies.  It also provides staff on secondment for the banking unit in the Department of Finance, in which case the costs are carried by it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#E02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. O'Kelly to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#F00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1469088000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thankful for the opportunity to brief the committee.  I do not intend to read my opening statement or go through my presentation.  Members have been provided with a copy of our annual report which competes to be one of the heaviest annual reports in the State sector.  They have also been provided with my presentation in which I seek to address some of the areas that I know are of specific interest to the committee and have been in the past.  We can take questions on them later.<br\/><br\/>I will give a brief overview as events have moved on since 2015 and some things are already out of date, certainly in the case of the market base.  I will start with the original and historical business of the NTMA - debt management.  <br\/><br\/>As members know, we manage <i>circa<\/i>&euro;200 billion of debt on behalf of the State.  In that regard, 2015 was a significant year for a number of reasons.  In that year we raised &euro;13 billion at an average interest rate of 1.5% and with an average maturity of 19 years.  To put the matter in perspective, that was approximately half the yield and about twice the average maturity in the previous year.  The first year we were able to take advantage of the very low interest rate environment was 2015.  We also issued Ireland's first 30-year bond, the bond with the longest maturity the State has issued up to that point, which raised &euro;4 billion.  We have since issued a 100-year bond for a small amount at a yield of 2.35%.  It is interesting that in 2013 it was hard to get investors to lend us money for 100 days, yet today we can borrow money for 100 years.  That says an awful lot about the current extraordinary interest rate environment, as much as it does about Ireland's credit rating, although the improvement in our credit rating has been a big feature in that respect.<br\/><br\/>On the rating agencies, Moody's upgraded us to the A category, meaning that all rating agencies now have Ireland in the A category.  That is significant in the sense that some of the more conservative investors, in particular, can only lend money to sovereigns in the A category across their businesses.<br\/><br\/>While the interest rate environment for new borrowing is benign and very favourable for Ireland, it is worth remembering that our stock of debt has increased very considerably since 2007.  That &euro;200 billion figure was &euro;47 billion in 2007, on which the interest bill which was &euro;7 billion in 2015 was only &euro;2 billion in 2007.  The forecast in 2013 was that the interest bill in 2015 would be &euro;10 billion.  The &euro;7 billion figure must be seen in that context.  It is down from &euro;7.5 billion, but it was on a trajectory to be considerably higher.  We will talk later about the potential trajectory for interest rate savings and improvements.  However, we have a very high stock of debt.  We are still an ndebted nation and vulnerable to shocks and changes in the marketplace.<br\/><br\/>I will move on to our four other mandates.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, formerly the National Pensions Reserve Fund, has completed its first full year of operation.  It has what we call a double bottom line - it must have a commercial return and an economic impact.  The investment committee for oversight of the fund is independent and made up of two non-executives from the board of the NTMA, plus three independent non-executives.  They have oversight of the investment process and approving the investment decisions.  The fund invested &euro;750 million in 2015 and a further &euro;200 million so far this year in a variety of projects which I have outlined and are available on our website.  I will highlight three of them to give members an example of the kinds of investment the fund is making.  The first is a fund called Activate, of which some members may have heard and which is relevant in the housing sector.  It is a &euro;500 million fund.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund has committed &euro;350 million and provides all-in-finance for residential house builders who are struggling to get money from the banks.  The banks will lend probably only about 60% of one's requirements, but the fund is set to lend 90% plus.  It has put &euro;40 million to &euro;50 million into the market in the year to date to allow the building of about 1,000 units in three separate projects, all of which are in the Dublin area.  Ultimately, the objective of the fund is to be capable of building around 8,000 houses in total.<br\/><br\/>The second project is at Dublin City University, DCU, where the fund has invested &euro;50 million in student accommodation.  It is part of a broader campus development worth &euro;230 million.  The significant part of our investment is that it released &euro;70 million of European Investment Bank funding to DCU which required a local institutional investor to be part of the transaction.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, in putting in that &euro;50 million, released &euro;70 million from the EIB and essentially allowed the entire campus development project worth &euro;230 million to take place. <br\/><br\/>The third project involves the Milplex fund, a product produced in co-ordination with Glanbia and Rabobank and a fund directed at dairy farmers.  One of the reasons dairy farmers do not like to borrow money to invest is the unpredictability and volatility of the price of milk.  The fund adjusts the term of a loan to the price of milk, such that if the price of milk is falling, the terms of the loan will extend to make it more palatable for buyers.  It is a unique product which we think could be replicated in a number of ways.  It is something we see as being applicable to other products.<br\/><br\/>Moving on to the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, the matter relates to PPPs in the provision of accommodation.  Any infrastructural transaction over &euro;20 million is subject to financial advisory oversight by the NDFA which is involved in a number of PPPs in delivering court, school and primary care service accommodation.  Fourteen primary care centres closed recently and we might talk about that particular example in more detail later.<br\/><br\/>We have NewERA which, essentially, is the State's in-house corporate finance advisory body.  Its specific mandate centres on commercial semi-State companies where it provides advice for the shareholder on shareholding matters.  In assessing a shareholder expectation framework, the idea is that all of the commercial semi-State companies will have the same template, meet the same standards whether it be a business plan, investment expectations, dividends policy and returns on capital.  They will do this in a consistent, seamless way across the different semi-State companies.  NewERA also advises Ministers on specific projects.  For example, last year it would have advised the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on the sale of the stake in Aer Lingus.<br\/><br\/>The final body is the State Claims Agency, of which Mr. Ciaran Breen is director.  It manages claims on behalf of the State, both clinical and non-clinical.  We are managing about 8,000 claims, for which the provision is around &euro;1.8 billion in total.  We are trying to get more into the business of risk management for all of the entities within our remit.  The agency has grown significantly as a part of the NTMA.  One third of the staff in the NTMA now work for the State Claims Agency.<\/p><p>The number of entries under our remit is now 130, up from about 30 three or four years ago.  Therefore, this has been a significant area of growth.  I know members will have plenty of questions for Mr. Breen.  That is a tour of the businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Kelly.  Before I invite Deputy Rock to contribute, I wish to ask Mr. O&rsquo;Kelly a question on the national interest payment.  I am reading from a schedule on government debt and gross debt in 2015, the source being the European Commission.  It gives for each EU member state the level of gross debt, the interest payable as a percentage of GDP, the interest payable in actual monetary terms, and the implicit interest rate.  I am quoting the European Commission documents supplied to me by the Oireachtas Library.  I can provide copies if those present do not have them already.  What shocked me on reading the documents is that Ireland paid approximately &euro;6.7 billion in interest in 2015.  The implicit interest rate was 3.3%.  Everybody knows Greece has had a very difficult time.  Its implicit interest rate for 2015 was 2.1%.  That means it is borrowing at a rate substantially lower than that at which Ireland is borrowing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#G00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1469088000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I will talk about Greece and the other countries separately because there is a different rationale in each case.  In the case of Greece, while its interest rate is low, I do not believe it is one we would want.  The main reason its interest rate is low is that &euro;130 billion in borrowings are subject to an interest rate moratorium.  Therefore, Greece does not pay any interest at all on the majority of its debt.  It will have to pay interest at the end when it repays.  At present, in the context of its annual refinancing, it does not pay any interest at all.  Its debt-GDP ratio is 170%.  Obviously, the debt is official borrowing and debt, and the covenants in respect of all Greece's affairs are set by the troika.  The Greek example is probably not one on which we should concentrate.<br\/><br\/>I have heard people say the interest rate <i>per capita<\/i>in Greece is lower than in Ireland.  It is, but only because its GDP is about the equivalent of ours, even though it has a population twice the size and unfavourable demographics.  It also has a very high unemployment rate.  It does not have as productive an economy.  It is, therefore, difficult to take one statistic in isolation.  One could often get the wrong impression.  The circumstances in Greece are mainly because it does not pay any interest on the majority of its debt currently.<br\/><br\/>The examples of Spain and Italy are much more relevant for us.  The Chairman is correct to point out that their interest rates are a little lower than ours, on average, despite the fact that one would believe we were a better credit.  Actually, the market does rate us as a better credit.  Therefore, what is occurring is anomalous.  The main reason concerns refinancing, the pace of refinancing and where that comes.  As I said in my opening statement, Ireland really only benefited from the extraordinary low-interest-rate environment in 2015.  That was the first 12-month period and in it we borrowed &euro;13 billion, which is only about 6.5% of our total stock of debt of &euro;200 billion.  It is like moving the average, which is 3.4% on the &euro;200 billion.  Movement is only at a rate of 6% so it takes a while.  It is like moving the <i>Titanic<\/i>; it will take a little while to move.  The movement in Spain and Italy is a bit faster, for a couple of reasons, one being that they have much more of their financing of their debt in short-term bills and securities of less than one year.  Ireland does not do that.  Typically, it does not finance in the short area of the market.  Why not?  One of the main points that concern us, as a borrower - many things concern us - is the question of from whom one is borrowing one's money.  The State is no different from any other borrower.  It is a question of whom one is borrowing the money from.  In our case, we borrow the money from overseas investors.  Some 90% of investors in Irish debt come from overseas.  We are extraordinarily dependent on international markets.  In the cases of Spain and Italy, a huge amount of their borrowing comes from domestic savers, local savers.  In Spain, savers have traditionally been bond investors or fixed-income investors, not equity investors.  That is where most of the savings go.<br\/><br\/>Japan is a good example of a state with an extraordinarily high debt&ndash;GDP ratio.  It is one of the highest in the world, yet people are not concerned about it because it could fund all its debt entirely from domestic savings.  Therefore, with regard to the debt&ndash;GDP ratio, it matters from whom one is borrowing in terms of the risk profile.  The rating agencies would look at a country like Ireland and say it is very dependent on international investors for its borrowing and, therefore, ought not to have too much refinancing risk in the early parts, over the next 12 months, etc.<br\/><br\/>The reality for Ireland is that we will be a little slower than those other countries to enjoy the benefits of the current low-interest-rate environment.  There are significant chimneys, and there are some graphs that show that when the maturities are coming up, &euro;45 billion in debt will mature in the three years from 2018 to 2020.  It will be high-coupon debt that we borrowed historically at higher interest rates.  That will roll off and then we will get the chance to issue new bonds, hopefully in the low-interest-rate environment.  Our prediction, which is obviously difficult to make, is that, based on our current projections and the assumption that the interest-rate environment will be as predicted, the interest bill could head from &euro;7 billion towards &euro;6 billion over the period in question.  That would get our average rate down below 3%.  Could our average rate go towards 2.5% over time?  It is possible but that would be quite extreme.  One would be looking for a very favourable interest-rate environment for that to happen in light of the stock of debt we have, &euro;200 billion, which will probably remain unchanged or even increase a little.  I hope that offers some explanation as to why our average debt figure does not move quite as quickly as it might.  It will move, however, particularly in the big refinancing years of 2018, 2019 and 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I am not convinced.

To pick up from where the Chairman left off on the bailout debt, the NTMA has paid back the majority, or &euro;18 billion, in IMF loans.  These were the most expensive loans from the troika era.  The remaining loans are mostly from European institutions and bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark.  Are the effective costs on all these borrowings equivalent to each other or do any still stand out as being more expensive?  If so, will the NTMA seek approval to redeem the higher interest rate loans first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#H00600","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1469088000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to page 6 of the slides presentation I circulated which includes a table setting out the outstanding debt in official and benchmarked bonds.  The Deputy can see from that the amount outstanding, the average life and the rate we are paying on each.  We cannot borrow at cheaper rates than those of the EFSF or the EFSM.  We paid &euro;18 billion of the IMF loans and &euro;4 billion remains.  The rate on that is approximately 0.5% for an average life of six years.  Depending on where the market is at any one time, there are marginal savings we could opportunistically look at if yields went a little bit lower but it is quite marginal.  To repay the IMF loans requires the approval from all members of the troika, which they gave for the &euro;18 billion on the condition, where we did not have to pay their loan back <i>pro rata<\/i>, that post-programme monitoring would be in place.  The minimum amount of loans that could remain with the IMF was &euro;4 billion, which means that the IMF is obliged to continue to monitor Ireland in the post-programme period.  That was a condition of that.  So there are two things.  It is not straightforward to repay that.  It would require the permission of all of the member states and the savings would be marginal.<br\/><br\/>Respecting that, as the Chairman says, marginal in the context of a &euro;200 billion debt is not the same as marginal in the world the Oireachtas operates in day-to-day, the savings in the market now could be &euro;20 million a year over the lifetime of the loans if we were to get permission.  By the time one did it, markets might have moved, one might not be able to refinance and those savings might not be as clear.  It is quite marginal and all of the other official sector debt is at a maturity and financing rate that the State could not improve on and that is unlikely to change because there are stronger parties than us who are refinancing in the market place.<br\/><br\/>It is the stock available, which goes back to the point about why our average is not and will not come down as fast.  It is the stock of debt in Government bonds, which is the &euro;125 billion.  We cannot necessarily mature it faster than we borrowed it.  They are fixed rate bonds and they are not callable.  It is possible to conduct a reverse auction.  That has been done.  We could announce that we would like to buy back those securities but the issue there is that we would need quite a lot more cash to do it.  Those bonds are all trading at a significant premium because as yields go down, prices go up and as prices go down, yields go up.  For every &euro;100 million we bought back, we would probably have to pay &euro;130 million.  We would have to pay out &euro;30 million in cash, which would affect the economics of the transaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Can Mr. O'Kelly say that slowly again because we are in macroeconomics here?

Historically, from looking at some of the old files in the NTMA, and I have only been there 18 months, there was an attempt to get a benchmark against which we would measure performance, but that was abandoned.  It is extremely difficult because of the daily moves and the volatile moves.  I would make a few points, from which the Deputy can hopefully take some comfort, but I know his  job is to look for more than that.  We are always challenging ourselves in the NTMA to try to find ways to do things better.  We have interactions with other European debt offices with which we are very close.  We are very close to the UK debt office and we talk to them about what they are doing, what they are looking at and what new products there might be.  In terms of oversight, some of the non-executives on our board have very significant financial market experience and they put us under quite a degree of scrutiny.  I can assure the Deputy of that.  Notwithstanding that, and if that was not a comfort, if I was seated where the Deputy is, I might ask what might happen if the debt office was not doing a good job and what might be the signals that I would look for.  If we issued at an incorrect yield or at an inappropriate price, or too low a price or two high a yield, in an action, we would probably get a headline in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>that day and the financial press would report it.  That would the first signal to look for - a failed auction of some description.<br\/><br\/>The second signal would be if we were taking risk or not financing efficiently, our credit spread investors would start to move our credit spreads to reflect the fact that we were not efficiently managing the debt because that would affect them.  The third signal is that the rating agencies would start to comment on the debt management agency's profile, refinancing risk, financing capability and activities in the marketplace.  That is where one should look to see whether a debt office like the NTMA, or any other debt office, is potentially optimising the financial conditions and taking advantage of those.  For now, the rating agencies do not talk about financing risk.  They are comfortable that the average maturity, profile and refinancing risk are appropriate.  I believe that is the case.  For the moment that is confirmed.  If I was looking at the debt management agency as a citizen and a taxpayer, I would be looking at that and to see whether they could be doing a better job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":95,"content":"<p>On the NTMA's other external functions, of which there is an increasing number, and as Mr. O'Kelly acknowledged there is a great many, is the NTMA satisfied with the pace at which the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, is investing since its establishment?

From our narrower point of view on Brexit, obviously the implications of Brexit are all encompassing, and much more so for many of members than for me, there are the political and geopolitical implications and then there is the economic impact.  Nobody is saying it will be a positive for Ireland.<\/p><p>It will be a drag but the question is what will be the impact ultimately.  Our own team probably feels that the correlation is a bit higher between UK GDP falls and our GDP.  They are saying that for a 1% fall in UK GDP, Ireland would expect the GDP fall to be 0.8% or 0.9%, which is at the higher end of most of the economists' figures.  It will be a negative impact and it will have a drag.  We will have to wait and see how much it is.<\/p><p> In the interest rate market and what has happened in terms of interest rates since the vote, if the Deputy had asked me where would German ten-year yields and Irish ten-year yields be four weeks after Britain had decided on Brexit, that is, to exit the EU, I am afraid I have to say my prediction at that stage would have been a long way off.  I might have been able to guess where Germany was - it is currently around 0% or -5 basis points - but Ireland has traded extremely well and I probably would have said it could have been out at 1% in ten-year notes.  It is around 0.5%.  We have not had any real credit impact, if one likes, for Ireland or the other peripheral countries.  Why is that?  It is because investors react to the first thing in front of their noses.  The political and economic impacts are down the road and the thing in front of their noses that they really believe in is central banks and their ability to pump liquidity into the system.  That is a proven capability that all the central banks have and they have indicated they are prepared to that do again if there is any kind of instability in the marketplace.  That confidence in liquidity coming in has been what has driven spreads lower and kept credit spreads tight.  We should not be complacent about that.  That is a short-term phenomenon because of that liquidity that they are confident of coming into the system.  Ultimately, the economic impact for Ireland and any political impact, if negative, will be reflected in our credit spreads in the medium term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. O'Kelly to discuss the impact of quantitative easing, QE, and how we will adopt to a post-QE world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#K00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1469088000,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Ireland has been a very big beneficiary of quantitative easing.

I point out again that the budget forecast in 2013 for debt service costs in 2016 was &euro;10 billion.  Today, the cost is &euro;7 billion and it is trending towards &euro;6 billion.  In large part, the reason for this is quantitative easing and the extraordinary interest rate environment that has been created by the interest rate policy in Europe, in addition to our improving credit story, which is obviously helping us move from being peripheral as a credit to being what we now describe as \"semi-core\" as a credit.  We have that combination but really it is the overriding interest rate policy and the driving of interest rates lower that has assisted us.  Particularly indebted nations benefit more proportionately from a lower interest rate environment and Ireland has been a very significant beneficiary.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, this is a big debate.  People are asking if this is the new normal environment or if we will return to a previous environment with which we are familiar.  That debate is ongoing because when quantitative easing was initially mooted, it was supposed to be for the short term.  It has been going on for much longer than anybody ever intended.  The role of central banks and the limitations of monetary policy are becoming clear.  That is why one is seeing a move towards the Juncker plan and fiscal policy.  We have to find other ways to stimulate economies because the traditional instrument of monetary policy has clearly had limitations and is not providing the stimulus or creating the inflationary impact it was designed to have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Does Mr. O'Kelly believe the NTMA has taken all it can in the current environment in the context of the possibility that costs will increase?

That is not what our mandate is to do.  I could take a big view on interest rates right now but I am not mandated to do that.  The NTMA is not a hedge fund and we are not being asked to bet on interest rates.  We are trying to manage the environment we have.  Our borrowing requirement is based on the budget that comes from the Oireachtas annually plus the refinancing requirement that comes through each year and that informs our requirement.  When rates are very low, we can potentially do a little more around the edges, move the maturity profile, mitigate our risk by widening our investor base, make sure our profile is right in terms of refinancing and optimise that and where we go on the yield curve, at what time or what part of the calendar we go on.

Bonuses and performance-related pay have been part of the NTMA model historically and people have a bonus provision in their contracts for the most part.

We have an independent board and an independent remuneration committee and they set the remuneration policy.  Within financial services and the sector that we are in, variable pay and performance-related pay are part of the competitive environment.  Financial services is a well remunerated sector and whether that is right or whether it is overvalued or undervalued is a debate for another forum.  We are operating in a marketplace where that is becoming more of a feature.  For that reason and due to the competitive pressures that are there, the board and the committee decided to increase the amount to just short of &euro;500,000.  As a result, 60 or 15% of the 430 employees of the NTMA received performance-related pay, which means 85% of employees did not receive any performance related pay.  The average payment was around &euro;8,000, which I believe is proportionate.

The EIB wanted to know why the city needed a metro system.  The report goes on to state the mayor was impressed by the fact that the EIB wanted to be sure the city was taking the right decision financially and in terms of EU policy goals.

If it decides that it meets the guidelines for a PPP project set down by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, it goes to us and the NDFA.  The public sector benchmark is constructed together with all of the methodology to be used not just in determining the upfront capital cost but all of the maintenance and servicing costs over the lifetime of the project.  The procurement process then starts and if the preferred tender or preferred bidder comes back with a tender, it has to be below the public sector benchmark; otherwise, the project will not be allowed to proceed to the next stage.  That is the test.  Before it reaches financial close, probably six to nine months down the road, there must be a retest against the public sector benchmark in case any of the variables has changed.

I heard Mr. O'Kelly reassuring me.  Obviously, it is somewhat like David and Goliath here in the sense of what members must go through - with the help of the Comptroller and Auditor General - to try to look at matters.  Going on my experience, I remember being on that committee and it was a mantra that public private partnership was better.  However, that mantra was not proven or backed up by any evidence and when some evidence came before us, it showed that the direct building of schools was much cheaper and much more cost-effective.  This has been stated by Deputy Cullinane and raised by the Chairman, which I support fully.  It concerns me that the Comptroller and Auditor General has stated that despite a statutory obligation, there has been no look-back on any of these public private partnerships.  At this point, that is a red alert.  A second red alert is he does not have staff to do it.  Consequently, while reassurances from Mr. O'Kelly are wonderful, they do not reassure me in that sense.  I really would like to see it in plain English, in order that I can explain it to the taxpayers.  That is the first point.<\/p> <p>  Staying on the subject of public private partnerships, what is the up-to-date status of the transfer of public private partnerships from the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, to the new Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII?

Obviously, there are two aspects to our costs.  There are our own costs - the costs of our own solicitors and barristers - and then we have the plaintiff's costs.  We had a case in which the professional fee of a plaintiff's solicitor was &euro;485,000 in a catastrophic injury case and we could not get any agreement, and therefore went to the taxation of cost system.  The fee was ultimately reduced to &euro;267,000.  That was appealed further to the High Court and it was affirmed by the High Court that that was the proper reduction.  Unfortunately, the Court of Appeal has now indicated that it has set aside that judgment, so that might have an effect.  However, that particular case had a fairly dramatic effect in terms of the number of settled costs that we got over a period of time.<\/p> <p>  In relation to our own costs, we carried out procurement for barristers in which we got them to tender in an open tender competition.  We imposed caps and limits, and we did the same with our own solicitors.  The combined effect of all of those things has driven down costs, but it is an ever-difficult challenge for us.  I could not say to the Deputy, given what has happened in this latest Court of Appeal decision, that we will always be as successful as we have been over the last period.  In fact, one may see costs rise if this decision has effect, particularly in relation to lower and medium-value cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#P01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen"},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Breen.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to another area in terms of investment, Mr. O'Kelly stated the NTMA's role is in managing the debt and all of that, but it has another role in investing money throughout the world.  In fact, I was staggered - I do not come from a financial background - at the amount of investment.  I looked at the risk assessment, which is a major issue for the NTMA.  Has climate change come into the NTMA's risk assessment?  I will also ask about the NTMA's investments in fossil fuel.  I will not delay, but it is worth reading out one or two quotes on climate change and our commitment to ensuring that the average rise in global temperatures is kept below 2&deg;C.  The Economist Intelligence Unit, in a major piece of research in 2015 entitled \"The Cost of Inaction,\" stated that the cost of inaction significantly outweighed the cost of action.  According to Mr. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, \"The challenges currently posed by climate change pale in significance compared with what might come\".  He also stated: \"Once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability, it may already be too late.\"  It goes on in a similar vein.  I have a report by an advisory committee to the European Systemic Risk Board on the risk posed by climate change.  I could quote Mr. Hank Paulson, the former US Secretary of the Treasury, and many others whom I will not quote, highlighting the climate change risk.  Where does that risk feature in any of this?  Why is the NTMA still investing in fossil fuels?  Has the agency made a decision to change that, or is it agency reviewing its policy?  I will start there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#P01300","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1469088000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Clearly, this is a live issue in investment markets.  We have examined it, and are continuing to do so.  I suppose our first decision is around the transfer of money from National Pension Reserve Fund, NPRF, investments into the new Strategic Investment Fund.  They were already investments with fund managers.  We ourselves are not directly investing in those stocks; we are investing in fund managers who are investing in those stocks on an ongoing basis.  The mandate that we give them can change at the time that one puts out the money, and at various stages throughout the year or the period.  What is happening in reality is that all that money has been transferred and liquidated and put back into the Strategic Investment Fund.  That is currently undergoing the so-called global portfolio transition strategy, so its investment mandate has changed very significantly.  The risk we used to take in terms of the kind of investments we made has changed significantly, and now the money is going through this new transition process.  It will come out, essentially, in three buckets: one will be a very liquid cash bucket; the next bucket will have short-term Government bonds and be semi-liquid, if you like; and the third one will have a little bit more risk, which could have some of those equity exposures.<\/p><p>In that case, we will be subscribing to the latest global protocol regarding investment, including in respect of fossil fuels and the environment.

I was following most of the debate on the monitor.  I have just a few questions, the first of which picks up on the Deputy Connolly's final point.  In a recent response to a parliamentary question, I was informed the proportion of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund's investment in fossil fuel industries had been reduced very significantly, from 25% at the end of 2014 to 11% at the end of 2015.  Is there a plan to phase it out completely?  Over what period will it be phased out?  In reply to Deputy Connolly's final question, the delegates spoke about ethical and social responsibility policy.  We would welcome sight of that.  Could the delegates outline the plan for phasing out investments in the areas that the NTMA does not regard as ethical?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the comments made earlier about the leveraging of EIB funds for the DCU development.  That is a very welcome development.  It represents very good use of the strategic investment fund.  What is the potential for using that same kind of approach in terms of leveraging European funds for general house-building?  What is the NTMA proposing in this regard?  There is a strong sense that access to funds is possible but that we are not maximising the potential in that regard.  Could the NTMA enter a similar arrangement with either local authorities or approved housing bodies?<\/p> <p>  My third question picks up on points made earlier by Deputy Cullinane on public private partnerships.  We have received some correspondence on this.  Members of this committee have asked, on an ongoing basis for a number of years, for evidence that public private partnerships actually represent value for money.  While we are told there is a public sector benchmark, we have yet to get sight of one.  Unfortunately, as we have learned on many occasions at this committee, initial costings for major infrastructural projects often run over budget and what may look like good value at the start may not turn out to be such good value.  Certainly, it may turn out to be very poor value afterwards.  A good example is the M3 project.  It appeared that value for money was being obtained.  The actual project was more or less on budget but afterwards there was not sufficient traffic to support the tolling system.  Therefore, the State and taxpayer ended up making compensation payments.  Presumably, these were not factored in to the original benchmark.  Many of us remain to be convinced that public private partnerships are the right way to go.  I would welcome the delegates' comments on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#Q01900","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1469088000,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I do not believe that PPP is a significant solution for social housing, given the scale one would need to get an effective PPP and the timelines involved.  The current PPP experiment project is for 1,500 houses - three bundles of 500 houses - but they will not be built to move into until 2020 or 2021 by the time one goes through all the public procurement, which is extremely onerous as the Deputy knows.  The identification of sites is a difficulty there, so personally I do not believe that PPPs will be a solution for social housing.  Looking for PPPs to be a solution is a mistake and will not be productive.<\/p> <p>  I was talking about two initiatives concerning the NTMA on social housing.  NAMA has a fund which we are looking at the possibility of replicating.  If properties are for sale which approved housing bodies or local authorities want to purchase, which they have identified as being appropriate for social housing, for which they do not have the capital or money and cannot or do not want to borrow the money, this vehicle would buy the property on their behalf and enter into a lease with them over 20 or 25 years.  This vehicle already exists and has worked quite well for properties that NAMA has been selling, which have been identified.  A vehicle already exists within NAMA which has more than 1,000 units in it.  The approved housing bodies and local authorities have found it to be useful.  They do not have to provide upfront capital cost, so this fund could bring in capital from the strategic investment fund as well as external capital, potentially, and access a vehicle that could buy the houses and even buy Part V houses and new houses being built, therefore accelerating that programme.  That is one of the suggestions we have made that we think has possibilities.<\/p> <p>  The other one is where the strategic investment fund would look to create a fund that would be drawn down for enabling infrastructure.  We have heard many reports that there are 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 houses, even in the greater Dublin area, that could be built and are waiting for enabling infrastructure to get started.  We are talking to developers and local authorities about creating a fund that would lend money over the long term in a way that other financial institutions would not do.  It may take in the houses themselves as collateral and ultimately take in the levies that might be created as ways of paying down the loan over time.

My recollection is that the National Roads Authority no longer seeks to put those kinds of floor in.

I spoke earlier about the importance of doing the look-back exercise and seeing that the value that was expected was actually achieved and where the value came from.  How is it that the thing was able to deliver value?  If there is some kind of innovation in the development of building schools, why would the State sector not learn from that point as well where it is doing direct build?  Why would it not incorporate the same money-saving technology and design?  There is a lot of value in those look-back exercises but I am not aware of any being carried out or, if they were, of them having been published.  If there are learning points there, it would be good practice to do it.  Deputy Connolly mentioned earlier a concern that look-backs are not being done despite a statutory obligation to carry them out.  It is not a statutory obligation but it is a clear obligation in the guidance from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on capital projects that there should always be a look-back exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#R03000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I have a few questions to ask, some of which relate to the annual report.

It is just to record that.  I move on to the State Claims Agency at page 118.  I have a couple of question on the agency and people will know that I have form on this from the past.  I still cannot get over the cost of legal fees on either side.  Can the agency send on to the committee, as it has done previously, the top ten payments in the years 2013 to 2015, inclusive, to firms of solicitors and barristers?  I want to see the list.  The most important list is one we have not discussed before.  Somebody touched on it, but I have an absolutely different take on it.  People put in a claim and there was a 42% reduction.  The case quoted was one where the Taxing Master made a reduction.  That was no credit to the State Claims Agency, it was a credit to the Taxing Master.  I acknowledge that the agency was not willing to pay the fee.  The public and I want to see the list for the three years 2013 to 2015 of the top ten over-claims by solicitors or barristers having regard to what the agency eventually paid out.  I bet the witnesses know the list of firms or people who consistently over-claim.  I suspect they have an idea of who they are.  I have no idea, but I would like to see if on average there is a 40% reduction.  The agency was saying, for example, that the fee was &euro;600,000 where the claim was for &euro;1 million.  As such, the saving was 40%.  Ultimately, the claims were 60% higher than the final fees.  I would like to see the list of those firms that are consistently doing that or to see if there is a pattern.  People should know.  I suspect that when the agency sees these firms coming from the other side, it is a matter of \"here we go again with an over-claim\".  I would like to see that.  Putting that information out there will alert the public and people in general that people who are putting in claims are being watched carefully and publicly because it is all taxpayers' money.  That is a list I would like to see.<\/p> <p>  I am here a couple of years but I am shocked at the State Claims Agency's estimate of final liabilities.  It has gone up 80% since 2011.  In the accounts at the end of 2011, it was &euro;990 million.  At the end of 2012, it was &euro;1.1 billion.  At the end of 2013, it was &euro;1.23 billion.  At the end of 2014, it was &euro;1.47 billion and today it is &euro;1.79 billion.  That is an increase of 80% over four years, which is phenomenal.  Why have those claims gone up by 80%?  The agency referred to early apologies and so on.  All of that sounds right, but none of it seems to match.  They are not claims by people.  These are the figures the agency has prudently pared back to put into its accounts as a liability.  As such, it is the agency's view that what it will have to pay has gone up by that amount.<\/p><p> Given that the State Claim's Agency accounts today say that in 2015 it paid out &euro;165 million and there is an outstanding liability of &euro;1.79 billion, it will be well over ten years at the rate it is going before it clears what is on its table as of 31 December 2015.  Many of those will have been several years in the system.  We all hear about children of eight, nine, ten and 11 and of things that happened at their birth.  How long will some people be in the system?  It will take ten years at this rate to clear them.  Some of them are probably there ten years already.  Will Mr. O'Kelly give us an age analysis of that &euro;1.79 billion?  What I mean is that out of that, how much of it relates to claims that were lodged in 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and right back to perhaps the millennium year?  How long have the oldest claims been in the system, because that figure is increasing?  Much of that will be legal fees.  That is why I am highlighting the legal fees issue.  <\/p><p> I want to ask one or two other small questions.  The witnesses probably do not have those answers; it is information that they can send on to us.  I want to come back to page 21 of the accounts which refer to the strategic investment fund.  I will not get into the issue but the biggest investment the NTMA made was to Irish Water.  That is one Government body moving money to another Government body.  That is the biggest flagship investment.  The figure is &euro;56 million of direct equity.  That is 2.5% of what the agency has invested so far of its &euro;2.2 billion.  It is a tiny amount; 2.5% of &euro;2.2 billion investment relates to direct equity.  Will Mr. O&rsquo;Kelly comment on why the NTMA&rsquo;s equity investment is only 2.5% of total investment?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#S01800","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1469088000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Direct equity is a small component of our overall strategy.

Given the level of legal fees that are paid out I know there are several legal companies around the country that would not survive if it was not for medical negligence claims.  It is a crazy basis on which legal practices can survive.  It is ultimately the taxpayer that is picking up the tab.  Reference has been made to mediation.  Has there been any kind of serious attempt to look at an alternative resolution system like, for example, what we were supposed to have in the case of insurance with the PIAB?

The pre-action protocols have been enabled as a result of the Legal Services Regulation Act.  They are similar and will be similar to the protocols that operate in England and Wales in regard to clinical negligence.  They are all about the pre-proceedings.  In other words, one is not getting into those high legal costs associated with proceedings.  The purpose of the protocols is to drive behaviour on both sides to be very upfront very quickly, to concede liability for the things one should be conceding very quickly and getting to settlement at a much earlier time.  The effect of it in England and Wales was so dramatic that it reduced the average life of a clinical negligence claim, down from about 4.5 years before the introduction of the protocols to about eight or nine months.  If one looks at the National Health Service Litigation Authority's 2014 accounts in particular, it has a graph showing the measurable effect of pre-action protocols and what they will do.  We take on average about three years from the time we get the claim to resolving it.  We would like to make that a lot less except we have a lot of difficulties getting experts and getting our reports and so on together.  The pre-action protocols would definitely change that and take out a lot of cost building that is in the current tort system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016072100002#T01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen"},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":330,"content":"<p>What has the experience been elsewhere where they have introduced those protocols?

I welcome Deputy Lisa Chambers who is substituting for Deputy O'Brien.<\/p> <p>  Before commencing today's business, I express my sympathy and that of the committee and extend our condolences to the families of those killed and injured and also to the people of France and those countries whose citizens were affected by the terrible attack in Nice on 14 July.  It is very sad for such a heinous event to occur and, in particular, be thrust upon innocent people on a day when they were celebrating their country's national day.  It is up to the people of Europe and the world to stand together to ensure that a solution is found to stop other future tragedies from occurring.  I have already written to the French ambassador, H.E. Mr. Th&eacute;bault, to express my condolences and those of the committee to him and the people of France.<\/p> <p>  The main business of this meeting is the resolution of the D&aacute;il that was passed on 7 July.  That resolution requested this committee to invite the ambassador of the Arab Republic of Egypt, H.E. Ms Soha Gendi, to appear before it to address the repeated delays in the trial of Mr. Ibrahim Halawa and to request her to convey to the relevant authorities in Egypt this House's concern that Mr. Ibrahim Halawa should be released and allowed to return to Ireland as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  I propose that we invite the ambassador, H.E. Ms Soha Gendi, to appear before the committee next Thursday.  I am anxious that we deal with this business before August.  Is that proposal agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Our convening here this morning was to enable to us to forward this request to the ambassador.  Once it is agreed, we will send that request immediately and we have decided on next Thursday as a suitable date for the ambassador to attend.  Hopefully, it will be a joint committee meeting.  I believe that Seanad &Eacute;ireann was to finalise its nominees last night and that will enable us to convene a joint committee meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2016072100002#A00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":384,"content":"<p>Will the meeting go ahead even if it is only a select committee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2016072100002#A00300","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1469088000,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I think so, yes.
