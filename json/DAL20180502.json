It underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring the economic recovery can be felt by every community and that we will build greater resilience for the future.  My Department has an important role to play in enabling economic development through the creation of jobs and the infrastructure required to support them and supporting communities to become sustainable and desirable places in which to live, work and raise families.  To help bring this about, the Department is working with our colleagues across government to create the conditions to support increased economic opportunities and local employment in all areas of the country; to deliver schemes and programmes that support the revitalisation of towns and villages; to improve access to services and social networks that ensure a high quality of life; to enable communities disadvantaged by location or social issues to reach their full potential now and in the future; and to support all communities to be able to have a voice in shaping their own futures and addressing their common goals.  The Department is doing this through the delivery of a variety of programmes, including flagship programmes such as the Leader and the social inclusion and community activation, SICAP, programmes, the revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, RAPID, programme, the town and village renewal scheme, the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme, the CL&Aacute;R programme, the local improvement scheme, LIS, the Dormant Account Fund, the seniors alert scheme and the communities facilities scheme.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also playing its part in the roll-out of the national broadband plan which aims to provide high speed broadband access to all areas of the country.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the addition of further functions to my Department, it is vital that any Department representing rural Ireland and communities across the country have the mandate to make a difference for these communities.

While there are other schemes within the remit of other Departments that could, in time, also be considered for transfer to my Department, my immediate focus is on delivering the significant programme of work ongoing in the Department.

I have the specific details for the Minister.

When we set up the new Department last year, I was anxious to receive funding.  A criticism made by local authorities and LCDCs was that I had allocated the funding too late.  What I am hoping to do with the new scheme is to identify the areas of most need.  Last year approximately &euro;64,000 of the national total of &euro;2 million was given to each local authority.  Some &euro;3.5 million has been ring-fenced for Dublin's inner city.  The Deputy and I both know that other areas in Dublin also face problems.  They need to be identified, targeted and supported.  I hope to be able to do so and have the programme announced by the end of May.  That is the reason for the review.  I do not want to see funding going to areas that do not need it; it should be targeted.  I happened to be in inner city Dublin recently and was pleased to see the way in which the funding was targeted, for example, playschools for mothers and toddlers, as well as other schemes.

That amount is not proportionate to the challenges facing them.  It is welcome that the Minister has reopened the programme.  He must ensure funding goes to those areas.

The public banking model has existed in Germany for over 200 years.  The banks are municipally owned and are not for profit.  The clear objective is lending into the regional economy.  Such banks would fill the void that has clearly been left behind by the pillar banks, which, as the Minister is aware and has heard in recent pronouncements, are rapidly disengaging from rural Ireland.  All they are interested in is more technology and removing the human face from banking.  The poor unfortunate bank workers, tellers and others who are left behind are absolutely overloaded.  It is a disgrace.  One has only to see what Ms McDonagh of Bank of Ireland and others in AIB have been doing in recent weeks to realise this.

This shocking and out-of-the-blue revelation confirms that the response to this crisis to date from the Minister and the Department of Health has been neither competent nor comprehensive.  It is now two weeks since the Minister was told about the issue and nearly a week since it became public, yet we are still discovering shocking and unsettling new information.  The Taoiseach and the Government have had enough time to get on top of this issue and they need to do so urgently.<\/p><p>As Vicky Phelan said last night on &quot;Prime Time&quot;, there is no one leading this and the news is changing daily.  Ministers have run to the hills and TV programmes have been absent of senior Ministers to explain things to the public.  Calm, competent authority is required in response to this crisis.  Confidence in the cervical cancer screening programme is being undermined and women throughout the country are fearful and worried.  They have been let down.  Despite everything, it is worth reminding people that this cervical cancer screening programme has identified up to 50,000 precancerous changes in women without symptoms and has made a very positive contribution to women's health.  The most effective route to restoring confidence is to have a competent, comprehensive inquiry that will get to the truth.  The precise model is not actually the key.  The key is the chair, the personnel and the terms of reference.  Yesterday there was more uncertainty.  The Government had spoken about a HIQA inquiry while, last night in the middle of a debate, we apparently moved to a commission of inquiry.  We urgently need clarity.<\/p><p>This morning we learn from a story in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, approved in writing that the director general of the HSE be allowed to take up a lucrative role at a US contraceptive manufacturer.  I have no personal axe to grind with Mr. O'Brien, though I did have issues with the manner of his appointment by the then Minister, now Senator James Reilly, in the absence of a public competition.  I believe the Minister made a serious error in consenting to this because if there is not a conflict of interest, there is a potential conflict of interest.  I do not believe one can be director of the HSE and a member of the board of a health product manufacturer.  In addition, the chairman of Evofem, the company in question, is Thomas Lynch who is chair of the board of Ireland East hospital group and the Mater Hospital.  It is reasonable to say that a HSE director should devote the whole of his working time to his job as director, as per HSE policy and earlier statements.<\/p><p>Does the Taoiseach believe both positions are reconcilable?  Does he agree that the Minister erred in making the decision to give consent to Mr. O'Brien taking this up, two months before he announced that he was going to retire as director general of the HSE in August?  What steps is the Taoiseach now going to take to authoritatively deal with this crisis?  Could we have some clarity, which is badly needed, on the form of the inquiry being proposed by the Government? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200012#K00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1525258800,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Once again, I want to say how deeply concerned and upset I and the whole Government are at the situation with which we are now grappling.  We still do not know all the facts, and last night, as Members will be aware, new information was given to the Minister only a short time before he came into this House to make a statement and answer questions.  He was put in the unenviable position of disclosing information to the House without having all the information himself, and we certainly do not have all the information.<\/p>  <p>  I ask for some time and space to allow us to establish the facts and space for calm and for facts, which the Leader of the Opposition mentioned.  There is an old piece of wisdom, which is, \"Act in haste, repent at leisure.\"  Whatever we do, I want to make sure we do the right thing.  I do not want us to act in haste, make the wrong decision collectively, and then be sorry for it into the future.  I know that many women in Ireland are very worried about this and many are feeling very vulnerable today.<\/p>  <p>  As a Taoiseach, as a doctor, and as a brother of two sisters, I want to say a few things.  First, this controversy relates to women who were already diagnosed with cervical cancer and are receiving treatment.  There are many women in the country at the moment who are worried that they might have cancer and worried that the HSE and CervicalCheck know that and have not told them.  That is not the case.  Nobody is going to get a phone call or letter in the next few days to tell them that they have cancer and that it had been concealed from them in some way.<\/p>  <p>  There are also many women who are worried about their smear tests, many of whom I have met in recent days.  They are women who have a had a smear test recently, been given the all-clear, and are now wondering if that is true.  I can reassure them that if they have been given the all-clear, it is true.  There is a margin of error in these tests but it is under 1%, as is the case with all screening programmes internationally.  We have no reason to believe that the information people have been given, to the effect that their tests are clear, is untrue.  If anybody is concerned, we invite them to visit their GP to discuss the situation and we will meet the cost of the consultation and the repeat smear test.  I thank the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO for their co-operation in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  To the women of Ireland, I want to say that I am determined to get to the bottom of this, to establish the facts and to restore confidence in our cancer screening system.  A number of actions have been agreed this morning.  First, we are going to ask a team of expert international cytopathologists to carry out a clinical review and to look again at the smears of all the women who were diagnosed with cancer in the past ten years.  We do not have the exact figure but it is between 2,000 and 3,000.  We will most likely find out that the majority of the additional 1,500, of whom we spoke yesterday, never had a smear test.  The review will be led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and will try to identify the genuine false negatives and those cases which should have been reported differently.  We believe this can be completed by the end of May.<\/p>  <p>  Later this year, we are also going to bring in a new, more accurate smear test and we will be among the first countries in the world to do this.  There will still be false negatives but not as many as in the past.<\/p><p>This test will be available to all women who want it.  They will not have to wait three years for their routine appointment.  This will be expensive and logistically difficult but it is something we need to do.  There will be a statutory inquiry.  There are limitations to a HIQA inquiry.  We know what they are.  There are problems also with a commission of inquiry and what we know what they are as well.<\/p> <p> There is a committee hearing today.  We would like that committee hearing to take place as it provides an opportunity for many of the senior officials and senior doctors to answer some questions.  Following the hearing, the Minister for Health will invite the spokespeople to meet him to discuss the best form of inquiry that should take place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200012#K00600","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525259400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.

There is no calm authority getting to grips with this crisis, and there has not been for the last two weeks, unfortunately.  The only way we can get confidence in the cervical cancer screening programme is to exercise such authority and make clear decisions.  I welcome the peer review of the cytology tests and so on but the Government needs to make clear decisions and to operate on the basis of being totally in charge of this issue, such that it is not going in all directions, as it was over the last two weeks.

Also, the Minister in approving it was aware that Mr. O'Brien was coming to the end of his term of office, which ends in 12 weeks' time.  It is on that basis that the Minister approved it.  I have no reason to question the validity of that decision.

He has described it as a cover-up.  To be honest, I was not 100% sure if that was the right description but I am now.  I am now convinced that we are faced with a cover-up by the HSE and for the following reasons.  We and the general public were previously led to believe that all smear tests were subjected to a review where a woman later developed cervical cancer having had a clear smear.  Some 208 women was the final number put into the public domain.  Then last night the Minister, Deputy Harris, came into the D&aacute;il and told us that \"a potentially considerable number of cases were not subjected to audit\".  We are now advised that approximately 1,500 more women, who may have been put at risk because of errors in the reading of their smear tests, are now affected.  Another 1,500 women potentially were left in the dark just as Vicky Phelan was.<\/p>  <p>  In the midst of a debacle centred on the withholding of vital information by the HSE - life and death information - we are now told that there was more misinformation and that more women are potentially caught up in this scandal.  This is breathtaking, Taoiseach.  It is increasing evidence that this controversy is not simply a case of catastrophic dysfunction; it is a case study of deceit of the gravest nature.  Simply put, Taoiseach, this is a national scandal.  It is a national scandal enabled by a toxic culture within the HSE.  Notwithstanding any inquiry, if we are to ensure that this does not happen again there must be accountability and wide-ranging change in the HSE and this needs to start at the top.  Notwithstanding the fact that we do not as of yet have not only all of the information but some of the most basic information that one might expect, we know that Tony O'Brien has presided over negligence, concealment and misinformation, with the most serious consequences for women and their families and so he cannot remain on as director general of the HSE.  This is the very least that women affected and their families need to see happening.  <\/p>  <p>  Let us be clear.  This was not a communications mess-up or, as Mr. O'Brien put it, a failure to close a communications loop.  This was a deliberate and devastating concealment of vital information to protect the management of the HSE and, ultimately, the State in court.  Women had a medical test read incorrectly.  This information was known to the HSE yet these women were kept in the dark for years, deliberately.  This organisational mindset does not develop by accident; it is the product of toxic leadership.  In any other walk of life, the person ultimately responsible for any such scandal would lose his or her job.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is the boss and the buck stops with him.  I put it to the Taoiseach, as I did yesterday, that he must remove Tony O'Brien from his post.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200013#L00700","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525259400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200013#L00800","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1525259400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I remind members that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against persons not in the House.

One needs to have an inquiry before one can make findings of fact, in my opinion and, I hope, in the opinion of most people in this House.<\/p>  <p>  The clinical director of CervicalCheck has already stepped down and the director, the official that runs CervicalCheck, is no longer in charge.

Cancer care in Ireland has improved dramatically in recent years.  We have better diagnoses, better treatment and better prevention.  Screening does work.  The incidence of cervical cancer has gone down from 14 per 100,000 in 2011 to ten per 100,000, a very significant reduction.  It is about 7% per year of the number of cases of cervical cancer.  Because of CervicalCheck, women are going for smear tests and screening and some 50,000 abnormalities have been identified.  That is 50,000 women for whom we have been able to prevent cervical cancer or ensure they received earlier treatment and had a better outcome.  It is 50,000 women whose lives, potentially, have been saved and whose treatment was instituted earlier because of CervicalCheck.  We should not forget that figure.  It is 50,000 women who have benefited from the programme.  The biggest travesty of all would be if women were to stop going for smear tests.

That might be his view, but it was some cock-up that left women without information to which they were entitled, information that affected their lives and the medical treatment they might seek.  It was subsequently kept from families when women deceased.  We know of 17 women so far, but I dare say there were more.  It is quite a cock-up.  The withholding of the information was not accidental.  It was clearly the policy and the strategy of the HSE to keep it from women and their families.  How do we know this?

What is ignored is that tribunals come about because we do not have the facts before us in the D&aacute;il, Members are not allowed to ask questions and when we do, we do not receive replies.  I suggest the Taoiseach come back with a comprehensive report on the knowledge that he, his Minister and the Department has.  We can then discuss that information in the D&aacute;il, with a view to deciding on what is the appropriate form of inquiry.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned the Grace case as an a example of how long an inquiry could take.  The delay was due completely to the previous Government.  It was decided in February 2016 to have an inquiry, but it took until last year to set it up and a little longer again because the Government did not give the senior counsel an office from which to work.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach referred to Galway and HIQA.  That is not what established the facts in Galway but an independent review with an independent chairperson from London who carried out a very effective inquiry.  I say all of this in coming to the health board and the case of three children who were raped systematically.  It was exposed on the \"Prime Time\" programme almost two weeks ago and has been raised by the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in and the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on health.  It is concerning that we have the facts about these three women.  The Taoiseach gave an answer in the D&aacute;il and waffled on about something as serious as an independent inquiry.  There will be an independent investigation.  He then went on to say there was an investigation, that it had been established in April 2016 and that he hoped it would be completed by the end of this year.  However, he did not have the terms of reference and knew nothing about it.  The first girl made a disclosure in 2009, the second in 2011 and the third in 2013, yet the Taoiseach came into the D&aacute;il and waffled about an independent review that would be set up or had been set up.  In April 2016 the referral was made to the independent review panel.  There was no explanation for how it had taken until April 2016 to be referred.  There was no explanation of the terms of reference and no commitment to learn anything from the case, except empty reassurances such as the ones the Taoiseach has given to the people on cervical smear tests.  He is not in a position to give reassurance, but he is in a position to give us the facts.  Will he explain to the House why it took until April 2016 to refer the matter to the independent review panel?  Who made the decision?  Why had there been no inquiry at that point?  The first girl came forward to disclose in 2009.  We are now in 2018, but we have no answers for her.  Before coming to the Chamber today, I took the trouble to re-read the Official Report and listen to the programme.  The girl has asked what was the point of her coming out and saying what she said.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might answer her today.  All I want from the Government is for it to state it does not know, that it will make inquiries and that it will then come and tell us.

We were also told that a contingent liability of &euro;2 billion is needed by the HSE to fund claims into the future.  The briefing note goes on to say that international evidence has demonstrated that patients are often forced down the legal route to get answers, acknowledgement and apologies when things go wrong with their care.  Here we are, ten years on, and a woman in the worst of circumstances has been dragged through the courts to get answers.  Indeed, had Vicky Phelan not been so brave to do what she did, then none of us would be any the wiser.  Even if open disclosure is in place and these issues are mediated, what assurances are there that the identified failures will be remedied for others in the future?  It takes people going public and not signing confidentiality agreements to force this into the public domain.  How many other scandals have fallen under the radar because someone has agreed to a confidentiality clause?  At what point do these repeated failings lead to system reform?  The State Claims Agency alone has the legal authority to determine the management of claims made against the HSE.  On the RT&Eacute; news last night, the State Claims Agency said that in the case of medical negligence, the agency's policy is to admit liability.  That is a direct contradiction to the statement of Caoimhe Haughey of C.M. Haughey Solicitors on the same programme, who said that, in her experience, the State Claims Agency robustly defends every case and shows little or no compassion.  Her comments are played out week after week when we see the HSE apologise after a settlement is made in the courts for medical negligence.<\/p>  <p>  There is a litany of cases we could point to, including the one to which Deputy Connolly has drawn attention.  Last week, we had the \"Prime Time\" programme relating to child and youth mental health services and the failures there.  Do we have to continuously have high profile failures or force people to lay themselves and their personal stories bare in the media or courtroom for our systems to be overhauled?  The Taoiseach was Minister for Health when the proposed legislation to make open disclosure mandatory was rejected.  He made a decision to establish a patient safety office within his Department rather than the impartial office which leading health experts said was required.  Does the Taoiseach accept that, in doing so, he removed any hope of true impartiality within that office and by failing to heed the World Health Organization's advice to implement mandatory open disclosure?  His actions in 2014 have directly contributed to the current scandal.  At the time, his now Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, said that in failing to legislate for mandatory open disclosure, all the Taoiseach was doing was maintaining a lawyer's slush fund.  He also described the Taoiseach's comments as absolute nonsense.  Does the Taoiseach accept that he was right?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200015#N00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1525260600,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Nobody in the Government, whether me personally, or anybody in this House, wants to see sick or terminally ill people dragged through the courts.  Nobody wants to see prolonged legal cases going on for years.  The public does not want that either.  It is not in anyone's interest.  It is not in the interest of taxpayers in the long run.  It is not in the interest of the health service when it comes to confidence the health service, and it is not in the interests of patients or citizens.  I have looked into this and am told by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and the State Claims Agency that 98% of medical negligence cases are settled or dropped and do not go to trial.  Only about 2% go to a contested court hearing and those 2% often go to court because facts or claims are contested.  There will always be a certain percentage where the facts or claims are contested.  In Vicky Phelan's case, as the Deputy knows, the case against the HSE was struck out but the laboratory settled for &euro;2.5 million without accepting liability.  While there may not have been legal liability on the State, I think there was moral liability on the State to ensure that she got the information about the case that she should have got.  There was a breach of duty to ensure that occurred.<\/p>  <p>  How will we deal with these matters?  The first thing is to ensure that more cases do not go to court at all.  We can do that by building a culture of truth in our health service.  That means open disclosure and many other things.  Bear in mind that this is the Government that legislated for open disclosure in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017.  That will be commenced before June this year.  We will also legislate, as we indicated last year and in the programme for Government in 2016, for mandatory open disclosure in the most serious incidents, which are those that are considered to be serious reportable incidents.  We need to reform our laws to make sure that legal cases proceed more quickly.  Let us not forget that the legal profession can help with this too.  Where something goes legal, there are two sides, and both sides need to work together to make sure that cases are not prolonged.  We can do that in a number of ways.  For example, pre-action protocols, periodic payment orders and mediation have been legislated for by this Government.  In the past year or two there have been three major Acts, designed to do exactly what the Deputy says should be done, namely, the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, Legal Services Regulation Act and Mediation Act, which were passed in the last few months.  I saw an example described yesterday in the news of a case which was handled very differently, that is, the case of a young boy who had a birth injury who settled for &euro;5 million.  That was done by mediation.  The sister described on \"Six One News\" last night how things can be and often are done differently.<\/p>  <p>  On that patient safety office, I was the Minister for Health who set it up.  There was not one before.  When one does things, one needs to do them in a stepwise manner.  It is not possible to make all reforms happen overnight but we are making those reforms happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200015#N00500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525260600,"counter":181,"content":"<p>When the Taoiseach says that 98% of claims are not pursued through the courts, there are many different things that can happen.

The Government has estimated that approximately 25,000 additional student-specific accommodation units are needed.  There has been increased investment, especially from international investors, in recent years.  Approximately 40 student-specific accommodation projects have been completed recently or are under way.  Approximately &euro;400 million is being invested in these projects which will provide approximately 5,000 student beds.<\/p><p>While any investment in increased student accommodation is welcome, the rent increases being encountered by students are not.  It is increasingly the case that the rents being charged in student-specific accommodation are substantially out of the reach of students and families with modest or low incomes.  This was highlighted recently by the significant controversy at Shanowen Square and Shanowen Hall near DCU, where rents are set to increase by between 20% and 27% from the last academic year to the next academic year.  That means students will have between &euro;8,300 and &euro;8,700 in rent over the course of the academic year, which equates to a monthly rent of between &euro;925 and &euro;966.  Rents in Shanowen Hall have increased by over 100% since 2014.<\/p><p>I commend the students of DCU on the Shanowen shakedown protest, which brought this matter to the attention of the public.  The problem of excessive rents is not confined to that part of the city.  Indeed, student campus accommodation in UCD can cost between &euro;700 and &euro;1,000 a month for nine months of the year.  Most Deputies on all sides of the Chamber have been asking who can afford such rents.  The answer is very simple.  Only students from very wealthy families or from overseas can afford them.  The maximum SUSI maintenance grant for an individual is between &euro;3,000 and &euro;5,000, which means students from low-income or modest-income families are increasingly unable to cover their rent from their grants, let alone look after other areas of their student lives.<\/p><p>The simple Bill before the House seeks to amend the definition of &quot;a tenancy&quot; in the Residential Tenancies Acts to include student licences.  Having spoken to officials in the Residential Tenancies Board, I understand the board is not sure whether student licences are covered under the Residential Tenancies Acts.  The board is encouraging students to take a case to it to ascertain whether such licences are covered.  Regardless of whether that transpires, there is a strong case for providing legal clarity by amending the relevant Acts.  Deputy Funchion and I are introducing this Bill for that reason.<\/p><p>The Bill proposes to include student licences under the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Acts, thereby ensuring properties in the affected areas are covered by the rent pressure zones and giving those living in student properties access to the Residential Tenancies Board for the resolution of disputes relating to deposits and maintenance, etc.<\/p><p>It would give them a level of protection they do not have.  There has been widespread political support from Deputies of all parties for the student protests in Dublin City University and a measure such as this which is very simple and straightforward should receive unanimous support across the House.<\/p> <p> It is our intention in Sinn F&eacute;in to bring forward this Bill in Private Members' time at an early opportunity to try to give students the protections they rightly deserve in advance of the next academic year.  I have introduced the legislation on First Stage and it is our intention to bring it forward on Second Stage.  I ask all Members of the House and, in particular, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to give the matter serious consideration.  If the wording of our Bill is not appropriate, I ask him to work with us to amend it to ensure students do not face rent increases of 27% or more, whether in DCU or elsewhere across the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200019#R02900","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525263600,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200020#S00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1525263600,"counter":298,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200020#S00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1525263600,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1525263600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>As this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200020#S00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1525263600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200020#S00600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1525263600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"All Terrain Vehicle Safety Bill 2018: First Stage","time":1525263600,"counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200020#S00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1525263600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to regulate the safety standards of the composition of All Terrain Vehicles and to regulate health and safety practices in use of All Terrain Vehicles in the workplace.<\/blockquote><p>This Bill addresses a number of safety inadequacies that have been proved to cause death and serious injury in users of quad bikes, in particular, in the past few years.

The Taoiseach has agreed with the analysis that a Minister outlining how he intends to handle a referral to a lobbyist breaks no rules, even where the company concerned views the information as significant and commercially sensitive.

Will he tell us if he intends to change the rules in order that in any future case there would be a clear sanction to prevent behaviour such as this?

He was asking that Mr. Sam Smyth be moved off his coverage of the Tribunal of Inquiry into certain Payments to Politicians and Related Matters.  That was direct interference in the freedom of journalists to write.  Mr. Smyth subsequently lost his job.  To add to that, Mr. O'Brien is a tax refugee.

It gives consumers more choice and reduces prices.  Competition is especially important in the media.  It is not a normal business.  It is part of our democracy and we need to have a diversity of voices in our media.  I do not think it is the role of politicians to decide what is the appropriate percentage that a media company should hold.  We have the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.  The appropriate role is for it to assess any proposals for mergers and to see whether that would give any player in the market a position that is too large.  I would not like to see Ministers adjudicating as to whether 27% is okay but 28% is not or to be in that space.  These things should be independent of politics and politicians.  They should be determined by a body such as the CCPC when it comes to a merger such as this, with the BAI having a role too.  I think that system is the right one and the policy is correct as we have it.<\/p>  <p>  I read the Reporters Without Borders media freedom index report recently.  It is interesting reading.  Deputy Brendan Howlin referred to it as well.  It gives us a relatively high rating in respect of media freedom.  We are in the first tier but down slightly on previous years.  I think we are around 13th or 14th in the world out of nearly 200 countries.  However, a few things were pointed out.  It pointed to what it believes is RT&Eacute; being too large in the broadcasting space, INM being too large in the print space and our defamation laws being too much on the side of the person who was defamed.  I imagine those defamed would have one view and defamers would have a different view.  The issue of the protection of sources was also raised.  We discussed that yesterday.  I am not sure if Deputies have proposals as to how we could reduce RT&Eacute;'s position in broadcast media or INM's position in print.  However, given that Reporters Without Borders put those two together, as two of the four issues it believes need to dealt with, when we talk about this we need to talk about both issues as well.

Asking Britain to come up with them seems a fatuous expectation now because we have had more than a year and the first effort at it by those responsible has been slapped down by the European negotiators as completely unworkable.<\/p>  <p>  It is important for the sake of clarity that the Taoiseach is open with the House about what he expects the point of arrival to be in July.  What are the minimum terms that would be acceptable to the Taoiseach to allow discussions to go on to October?  Certainly, there is no question of the Irish Border situation being folded into the post-October post-divorce discussions or into the long-term settlement discussions.  This is something Michel Barnier underscored as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200022#U00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1525264800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>This morning the hard Brexiteer wing of the Tory party told Theresa May that any proposed British customs partnership with the European Union was a non-runner.  The arch-Brexiteer that is Jacob Rees-Mogg has said that any such proposal is deeply unsatisfactory and that it would not get Britain out of the EU, which is what people voted for.  I agree with him on the first point.  A so-called customs partnership will not resolve the issues relating to the island of Ireland.  It is unworkable and unachievable and I think that is accepted by Brussels and by the Taoiseach.  My view on his second point is that the people in the North of Ireland who had the opportunity to vote actually voted to remain and so they have not consented to Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  That was the clear and reinforced message Michel Barnier received on his visit to the North.  To protect the economic and social interests of our island all of us, North and South, need to remain inside the customs union and the Single Market.  As the Taoiseach knows, that is the best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement and citizens' rights in the North as well as to safeguard cross-Border trade.  The British Government and the DUP simply have to come to terms with that reality.  It is regrettable that Theresa May's Government has still not come to terms with the reality of what it agreed to in December.  We should remember that.  The backstop agreement, which is the bare minimum required and is of itself imperfect, was signed up to by the UK Government.  I have said before that we really need clarity by June and I know others have sounded similar concerns.  I have deep concern that running down the clock to October will be the strategy of the British system and Government.  I believe that will leave us in a very difficult and potentially vulnerable position.  Therefore, I too wish to know, come the end of June, what the Taoiseach believes must be achieved.  What sufficiency does the Taoiseach envisage at that point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200022#U00400","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1525264800,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I asked the Taoiseach yesterday whether he and the European Union should condemn the shooting of what is now a total of 44 unarmed Palestinian protesters in Gaza in recent weeks by the Israeli forces.  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach condemned it, but really what I want to ask in the context of Europe, Donald Tusk and our role in Europe generally is whether we can move beyond the Taoiseach individually or this Parliament condemning what is going on to something actually being done about it by Europe.  Europe is not some external observer to what is going on in Gaza.  We give Israel favoured trade status.  Israel is effectively an associate member of the European Union.<\/p><p>A great deal of European money goes into the West Bank and Gaza and, in many cases, the products of that funding get blown to pieces or demolished by the Israelis and then we have Israel flagrantly breaking international law, killing unarmed civilians at present and they will continue to do so for the next two weeks and Europe will do nothing.  Could the Taoiseach speak up about this?  When he meets Donald Tusk and is engaging at the European Council could he appeal to Europe to do something about this, to put some pressure on Israel to stop killing innocent people, to stop breaking international law week in, week out and to demand that some sanctions be imposed?  In any other circumstances sanctions would be imposed on people when a state kills innocent people, breaks international law or illegally occupies a territory.  We would say something should be done about that but, for some reason with Israel, Europe does nothing.  It just stands by and allows it to happen.

Ireland's position is the position of 27 members states.  We negotiate as 27 from a position of strength.  Our position, which is in the guidelines, is that we will review progress at the meeting in Brussels in June.  We want to see real and meaningful progress by June if we are going to meet that December deadline, or rather the October deadline.  There is a real risk that we will not meet the October deadline if we do not see real and meaningful progress in June.  It is still early May.  It is only the first week in May.  There are many moving parts.  There are shifting sands.  An important UK cabinet meeting is under way today and parliamentary votes of significance are happening across the water now.  We need to treat this as an evolving situation, and it is one.  We are very far from making a decision point as to what the maximum amount of progress is that can be achieved in June.  Obviously, we will make that decision at the time.<\/p>  <p>  Let there be no doubt that we are insisting that there has to be a backstop in the withdrawal agreement.  The UK now acknowledges that there has to be a backstop in the withdrawal agreement.  People call it different things.  It is officially called the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  I believe I started using the term \"backstop\", which the EU has adopted as the term.  Prime Minister May calls it the last resort.  The Secretary of State, David Davis, calls it a reserve parachute.  What we all agree, no matter what one calls it, is that the withdrawal agreement must have that.  It must be in the withdrawal agreement and, if it is not, then there cannot be a withdrawal agreement.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth acknowledging some of the progress that has been made in these negotiations, step by step, during the past year or two.  There was the joint report in December in which the UK commits to ensuring that there is no hard Border, including physical infrastructure and associated checks.  There was the commitment to retain the common travel area, which is very important for reasons that everyone in this House will know.  There was the Kenny text, which allows Northern Ireland, should it decide to do so, to join the European Union through Irish unity, if that is something that the majority of people in Northern want to happen in the future.  We also have the transition period, which is really important, giving business, public services and individuals until the end of 2020 to prepare for any permanent changes that may take place.  I know there has been some suggestions from some parties in this House that we should have rejected those terms, that we should not have agreed to those terms of the transition agreement.  I strongly refute that suggestion.  Irish business, farmers and workers need that transition period to prepare for the future, to protect their businesses, farming and jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200023#V00500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525265400,"counter":347,"content":"<p>We all agree with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200023#V00600","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1525265400,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I certainly disagree with anyone who believes that we should not have accepted those terms.

The campaign is so extreme that it has even been attacked by a spokesperson for the part of the \"No\" campaign led by some of the main personalities in Youth Defence, an organisation not known for respecting boundaries in promoting its views.<\/p>  <p>  There is, of course, what appears to be a tidal wave of online advertising, some of which does not link with a regulated Irish organisation.  Given the roles of the Referendum Commission and the Standards in Public Office Commission, will the Taoiseach consider asking them at this point to track activity which they believe might raise concerns about the origins of the funding or other efforts to avoid Irish electoral law?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200024#W00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1525266000,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I reiterate those concerns which have been raised with me by people on the campaign trail who are regular Facebookers and say they cannot log-on without being bombarded with what are clearly expensive advertisements advancing the \"No\" position.

Our base law, the Constitution, is important.  We have spend a great deal of time making sure that when we have a debate on changing the Constitution, it is conducted on a fair basis.  We had the McKenna judgment and others that sought properly to limit the capacity of the State to influence a vote in order that there would be a level playing field to enable people to hear objectively everybody's point of view in a transparent way above everything else.  There are real concerns, not only about the volume but also the unattributed nature of so much of the advertising that is bombarding social media at an incredible cost.  It is targeted and often not clear.  For example, there is a website, <i>undecided8.org<\/i>, which one could confuse for being an official information website of the Referendum Commission.  These are improper developments.  It is clearly not in the purview of the Referendum Commission, as structured, but there is now an undeniable case for the immediate establishment of a standing electoral commission.  It would be too late for this referendum, but there will be other referenda.  When one sees the international debate on outside influences interfering in elections, we would be foolish to think we will not be influenced by somebody, either in elections or referenda, in the future.<\/p><p>My final comment on the disturbing imagery outside at least one maternity hospital is that yesterday I spoke to an &quot;expectant father&quot;, if that is the proper phrase to use, who was bringing his wife into the hospital.  The child is beyond the due date and when there was a little concern yesterday, they found it really disturbing to be confronted with that imagery when they were looking after the health of their child.

Whatever side people are on, they are overwhelmingly shocked by how vile the imagery is.  They are really upset by and very angry about it.  I take some consolation from the fact that many who were considering voting \"No\" will now vote \"Yes\" because they are appalled by this stuff.  Nonetheless, the vile, offensive and traumatising nature of some of the imagery is below any standard of decency, both for women who have been through abortions and people in general, in particular, children who are sensitive about such matters.  Children are asking their parents, \"What is that?\"  It is disgusting and some measures must be taken to deal with it.<\/p>  <p>  A point I do not know whether the Taoiseach is prohibited from making given his original answer but which I want to make to those campaigning for a \"Yes\" vote that arises from my experience of canvassing was borne out in the findings of a poll that came out at the weekend.  The findings of the IPSOS poll were much publicised.  They indicated that 47% of people would vote \"Yes\" but strangely what was less publicised was the answer to another question about the percentage of people who believed the law should be changed to allow women to choose to have an abortion, if they wished to do so.  The Taoiseach may be aware the figure was 62%, which is strange.  A tota of 47% said they would vote \"Yes\", while 62% believed women should have the right to choose.  That suggests we need to up our game in explaining what is at stake because when one calls to a door, people ask, \"Yes to what?  Repeal what?\"  People are not clued in to political debates.  When one explains the position, many say that personally they are not sure about abortion but that they think people should be allowed make their own decisions.

I know he makes a point of attending for Topical Issue matters and it is very much appreciated.<\/p>  <p>  The M50, the major ring road around Dublin carrying between 100,000 and 150,000 cars every day, is at a standstill at peak times.  Accidents which happen cause complete logjams and backlogs and affect both sides of the road, feeder roads and motorway junctions, including those for the M5, the M6 and M1, and have a serious impact on the commuter belt as drivers come into Dublin.  In a reply to a parliamentary question some time ago, the Minister said that congestion is estimated to cost this economy some &euro;350 million per year and the figure is growing, not to mention the impact on people's mental and physical health of just sitting in a car or a commercial vehicle for long periods during the day, or the logjam it causes in residential areas which feed into the M50.<\/p>  <p>  That is the problem.   However, the answer to the question as to what is the Government's range of solutions is \"zero\" as of now.  All the Government's projects are focused on Project 2040 and no projects are planned for 2018 or 2019 that would relieve traffic congestion on the M50.  There is no project to relieve the standstill which people are experiencing.  One of the things that was missing from Project 2040 is the eastern bypass, at which we must look again.  I am not a major proponent of building huge roads again but that one is the last piece of the jigsaw around Dublin and it needs to be looked at in a serious way.  I await the Minister's response. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200026#DD00300","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1525266900,"counter":403,"content":"<p>The Minister is as well aware of this issue as anyone else as congestion on the M50 features regularly on radio and news bulletins.  Rush hour on the M50 is now 7 a.m., not 8 a.m. or 9 a.m., such are the volumes of traffic.  It is not just the M50 but the feeder roads and their interconnectivity which are affected.  Last Friday a truck was involved in an accident on the N4 but it resulted in considerable tailbacks on the M50, as far as Ballymun in one direction and Tallaght on the other side.  That is an indication of the scale of the problem and the reliability of transport on the M50.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has previously said that the increase in traffic volumes is as a result of the economy growing and I do not disagree with him on that.  The NTA indicated that, in 2016 and 2017, the volume of traffic on the M50 rose by 16%, which is very substantial.  By most analyses, the volume of traffic we are experiencing on the M50 today is at a level anticipated by 2023.  The challenge is to introduce measures to alleviate the congestion people endure on a daily basis, both on the M50 and on the feeder roads onto and off it, which are all interconnected.  It was interesting to see that even a minor issue such as a small breakdown, rather than a fatal or multi-car accident, can bring everything to a standstill.<\/p>  <p>  I am not asking the Minister about the long-term plans he has published for 2040 but about steps we can take in the next year or two to address congestion on the M50 and have some short-term impacts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200026#DD00400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1525266900,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to address this issue in the House today.  It is not the first time it has been raised and I readily acknowledge that this is a constant problem that causes a great deal of difficulty for commuters.  I fully recognise the pressures on transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area, including the M50.  Since completion of the major &euro;1 billion upgrade of the M50 in late 2010, annual traffic growth on the route has increased at a typical rate of 6% per annum in line with increased economic growth.<\/p>  <p>  Over 170,000 vehicles per day are now using the busiest sections and in excess of 420,000 vehicles use some part of the M50 daily.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, along with other stakeholders, is continuing to implement a number of measures on the M50 to manage demand and optimise operational efficiency, including: changes to merge and diverge layouts at junctions; the introduction of permanently signed emergency routes; increased incident access points; increased provision of incident response units; and enhanced interagency co-ordination to improve incident management.<\/p>  <p>  Traffic incidents which obstruct running lanes are a significant contributor to commuter delays, with 1,429 incidents occurring in 2017 on the M50, over half of which occurred during rush hour traffic.  TII's incident response service resolves traffic incidents on the M50 as quickly as possible.  The average response time for the M50 in 2017 was approximately 12 minutes.  TII has also established a project team to manage the development of a programme for enhancing motorway operation services, which involves the implementation by 2020 of traffic control measures on the M50, including variable speed limits and dynamic lane closures.  The aim of this programme is to improve operational efficiency by smoothing traffic flow, improving journey time reliability and reducing the number of secondary traffic collisions.<\/p>  <p>  In so far as congestion issues in Dublin are concerned, the National Transport Authority, NTA, has overall responsibility for the implementation of its published transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, GDA.  Congestion is not confined to a single corridor in the Dublin region and it cannot be solved by focusing on just one or two corridors.  This GDA transport strategy provides a framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the greater Dublin area over the next two decades.  The strategy sets out a range of measures, including public transport investment and demand management measures, particularly in relation to the operation of the M50, which would reduce the time spent travelling on the network and alleviate congestion.  The measures proposed in the strategy are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.  While the management of the M50 falls within the remit of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, an interagency approach which includes Tll, the NTA and the relevant local authorities is required to achieve this.<\/p>  <p>  The national development plan, which was launched earlier this year by Government as part of Project Ireland 2040, identifies a number of key public transport priorities including the BusConnects programme, MetroLink and the DART expansion programme.  These will be delivered by the NTA progressively and steadily over the short, medium and long term, to deliver a comprehensive public transport network to match transport demand, alleviate congestion, provide an alternative to private car use and deliver a range of benefits over the next decade.  This will ensure that an integrated approach to the management of travel demand on the M50 corridor and connecting national roads, combined with the provision of alternative transport modes, is pursued such that the M50 is allowed to function for its primary intended purpose as a national road which caters for predominantly non-local trips of high economic value.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200026#DD00500","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1525266900,"counter":405,"content":"<p>The Minister's response was focused on Project 2040 and big projects and he did not even mention the air and noise pollution impact on people who live along the corridors.

There are no park and ride facilities on the major junctions along the M50 where people could park and avail of public transport, and no major employers have been issued with bus licences that could help ferry their employees to work and reduce their reliance on the M50.  There are no measures for the next year or two.<\/p>  <p>  I am alarmed to hear the Minister talk of \"demand management measures\".  That is a reference to tolling.

It also recommends protection of this corridor.<\/p>  <p>  The suggestion made by Deputies John Lahart and John Curran that I everything I mention is Project 2040 focused is somewhat unfair.  It is the nature of government and opposition that the former will always look for short-term alleviation measures and the latter long-term alleviation measures.  It would be absurd for me to say I have a short-term solution to the problem of congestion on the M50 because I do not.  Congestion on the M50 will continue in the short term.  We have introduced a number of measures to alleviate it which I have outlined and intend to introduce many more which are not Project 2040 orientated.  For example, the Luas cross-city service which is carrying an extra 10 million passengers per year will alleviate traffic congestion to some extent.  BusConnects, in which we are investing &euro;750 million plus, will commence operations next year, while MetroLink, on which work will commence in 2021, will be operational in 2027 which is a long way from 2040.  We have already extended the Luas service and propose to introduce further park and ride facilities.  We have introduced a number of measures, but we also have plans up to 2027 to remove thousands of people per day from their cars.  I am not suggesting there is a panacea to traffic congestion on the M50.  We have to optimise its use, but we are dong what is necessary to get people out of their cars onto public transport, which would automatically lead to a reduction in congestion on the M50. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200027#EE00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1525267500,"counter":409,"content":"<p>Does the Minister support tolling?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200027#EE00300","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1525267500,"counter":410,"content":"<p>We are moving to the second matter in the name of Deputy Pearse Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200027#EE00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Recruitment","time":1525267500,"counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200027#EE00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1525267500,"counter":412,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht an deis labhairt ar an cheist thromch&uacute;iseach seo agus an g&eacute;arch&eacute;im at&aacute; ann &oacute; thaobh seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; diaib&eacute;itis san iarthuaisceart a phl&eacute; sa Teach inniu.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to refer to the ongoing crisis in diabetes care services in the north west.  I use the term \"crisis\" in its truest sense because that is exactly what it is.  The latest HSE data for patient care and waiting times in Letterkenny University Hospital show the true extent of the crisis.  For example, adults with type 1 diabetes continue to wait for up to one year for routine appointments and up to two years for follow-up appointments, despite the HSE guidelines recommending that patients with type 1 diabetes be reviewed every six months.  We all know that in comparison with the general population patients with diabetes are at a significantly greater risk of developing one or more severe health complications owing to their condition.  Without a doubt, these figures make for harrowing reading.  Cardiovascular disease, reduced kidney function, uropathy, eye damage and amputation are some of the many complications associated with the condition if symptoms go unchecked.  Given that all of this is avoidable with appropriate and timely medical intervention, it is reasonable to assume that given the delays, patients in counties Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo face a heightened risk of suffering from such complications.<\/p>  <p>  Serious resource and staffing problems continue to go unsolved throughout diabetes services in the north west, including in paediatric, transitional and adult diabetes care services.  With reference to adult care services, a second additional full-time endocrinologist post remains unfilled, despite the fact that it has been sanctioned by the HSE advisory committee.  Similarly, parents and advocacy groups have expressed disappointment that the vacant consultant post at Sligo University Hospital is unlikely to be filled by a consultant paediatric endocrinologist to complement the diabetes services provided in the hospital.  At Letterkenny University Hospital, while long overdue efforts are being made to recruit additional dieticians, there is still no sign of a dedicated post for diabetes care.  I take no pleasure in reminding the House that despite many commitments made by the Government and the Minister for Health, the Saolta University Health Care Group remains without a centre of excellence for diabetes care.<\/p>  <p>  Why are patients in the north west less entitled to these services than their counterparts in the rest of the State?  This is postcode healthcare.  The people of County Donegal and the north-west region are supposed to feel grateful for the few services offered to them and happy with their lot, but they are not.  They are not happy and are standing up and demanding that the Government take action and provide the centre of excellence, the additional full-time endocrinologist, the second post in Sligo University Hospital and that it ensure there will be investment in pump therapy and other areas of diabetes services required for patients in the north west.  <\/p>  <p>  This is about saving lives and improved healthcare outcomes.  It is also about saving financial resources for the HSE.  What action does the Minister propose to take?  I demand that the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, respond positively to the lack of diabetes services in my home county which has result in people waiting for two years for a follow-up appointment.  It is unacceptable that they have to wait that length of time for an appointment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200027#EE00600","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1525267500,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this issue on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris.

However, steps are being taken to address this requirement.  In Letterkenny University Hospital additional registrar support has been assigned to support the monthly endocrinology clinic.  In addition to this extra support, a number of diabetes related posts have been filled in Letterkenny University Hospital.  A consultant endocrinologist and a team supported by a consultant physician, with extensive endocrinology experience, have been recruited.  Full-time podiatry cover and a clinical nurse specialist have been appointed, in addition to an advanced nurse practitioner in training for the paediatric diabetes service.<\/p>  <p>  Further enhancements are planned to address diabetes care services in the north west.

Having raised the issue with the Saolta University Health Care Group, the Department of Health has been informed that the procurement process for the diabetes day unit in Sligo University Hospital is under way and the HSE has advised that construction of the new diabetic centre will take place in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  On diabetes care services for paediatric patients across the group; a paediatric insulin pump service was initiated in May 2015.  This service is based in Sligo University Hospital, with outreach clinics in Letterkenny University Hospital.  A locum paediatrician is providing the service in counties Sligo and Donegal, with the permanent post to be advertised in the coming months.  In Galway University Hospital a paediatrician is due to take up a post shortly.  Diabetes care services are not only provided in an acute care setting; GPs also provide a diabetes cycle of care in the north west.  In October 2015 a structured diabetes cycle of care was introduced for adult medical card and GP visit card patients with type 2 diabetes.  The cycle of care enables qualifying patients who are registered for the service to avail of two annual visits to their GP for a structured review of their condition.<\/p><p>This initiative aims to improve clinical outcomes for patients and reduce complications often experienced with this condition.  To date, almost 100,000 patients have been registered nationally for the diabetes cycle of care by their GP.<\/p> <p> I am aware of the current situation for diabetic care services in the north west and that the Department of Health is monitoring the situation.  The Minister notes that the HSE and the Saolta University Healthcare Group are carrying out a broad range of measures in order to improve diabetic care services across the north west.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200027#EE00700","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525268100,"counter":415,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has informed me of what is happening, and some of that information when it is put together in two pages might sound grand, but let me inform him about what is happening on the ground.  There is a one year wait for an initial appointment and a two year wait for a recall appointment.  There is a reason why the HSE says that a diabetic patient should be recalled every six months.  In a four year period this would be eight check-ups if one lives in Cork, Dublin, Waterford, Louth, Monaghan or any of the other counties outside of Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.  If one happens to live in our region of the country, in the same period a patient only gets two check-ups, if he or she is lucky.  The list is getting worse and the length of time is getting worse.  We all know.  We can talk about health budgets and the amount of money that is spent on treating conditions resulting from diabetes, which is substantial.  We know that prevention is better than cure.  There are serious consequences, which I outlined to the Minister of State, and the Government is allowing patients to have worse health outcomes because they happen to be born in or live in Donegal and the Government has not sanctioned the necessary personnel in time to deal with their care.<\/p>  <p>  There is nothing in what the Minister of State has said that gives me any type of reassurance that the people I deal with daily in Donegal will get recall appointments anytime sooner than two years.  The second endocrinologist post was not even mentioned.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, spoke of a position in Galway but the vacant position in Sligo was not mentioned in the Minister of State's response, nor was the centre of excellence, which the entire Saolta region does not have.  When will the people of the north west, the people in my region, be respected by the HSE in providing these services? Imagine if this was my son, my daughter or my wife but because a person lives in a certain part of the State they would get worse care and, therefore, worse outcomes in managing a disease that is manageable if the personnel are available.<\/p>  <p>  The advocacy groups met with the Minister.  I was there along with other Deputies.  We heard all the promises, all the good words and so on.  It has not, however, materialised.  We need action now.

We are working against a backdrop of an increasing prevalence of diabetes in the community.

The HSE national clinical programme for diabetes, led by Professor Se&aacute;n Dinneen, has also established a guideline development group, which is chaired by Dr. Kevin Moore and includes two patients' representatives.  I appreciate that some of the national steps will take time to work their way into it, but I assure the Deputy there is recognition of the challenge being presented and there is acknowledgment of the difficulties that exist in the Deputy's area.  These challenges are not unique to the Deputy's area but they certainly exist in his area.  I will do what the Deputy has asked.

The painful process of making an application for a medical card is absolutely horrific.  I know one young girl who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and she is currently trying to finish her studies and get on with her life.  She has made the application for the medical card and has been refused.  She was looking for information from external sources, outside of her control.  Because her application went outside the three-month window they closed down the application.  When I called they said they were sorry but that was it and nothing could be done.  This is shocking.  I know another young man who has stomach cancer.  He is on social welfare and is trying to fight the system to apply for a medical card, an application which is actually getting refused.

A diagnosis of terminal illness is an automatic entitlement to a medical card, but a diagnosis of cancer, which also has a poor outcome but maybe a longer timeline, does not entitle the patient automatically to a medical card.

The HSE has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation for persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or ongoing medical care that they cannot afford and for persons in palliative care who are terminally ill.  These cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant.<\/p>  <p>  With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards granted in an emergency are issued on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the grounds of means or undue hardship and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the medical card eligibility.  It is also useful to note that in July 2015, the Director General of the HSE made a decision to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer with the card to be held for a period of five years.  It is undoubtedly important that the medical card application system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, especially arrangements relating to the issuing of medical cards on a discretionary basis.  To that end, the HSE has sought to implement revised processes to provide a more compassionate and more efficient process in the assessment of medical card applications.  Such measures include the development of a burden of illness questionnaire which is now being rolled out in selective circumstances where the assessing doctor in the HSE's national medical card unit requires a more comprehensive assessment of an applicant's medical and social circumstances and any resulting undue financial hardship.  In addition, in January this year, the new streamlined online medical card application system was launched.  This will enable applicants to find out immediately if they are eligible for a medical card and will bring considerable benefits for people in turnaround times, convenience and security.  Implementation of the measures above will aid the HSE's national medical card unit in providing an enhanced service to applicants, ensuring that the application process is as efficient and timely as possible.<\/p>  <p>  It is nonetheless important to note that eligibility for a medical card remains primarily on the basis of financial assistance.  This position was endorsed by the HSE's expert group on medical need and medical card eligibility which examined the issue of awarding medical cards on the basis of illness.  That group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility and that a person's means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  This position remains unchanged.  To summarise, I recognise that patients require a responsive and efficient health system to meet their medical needs, which may often be required urgently.  The processes in place in the HSE for granting an emergency medical card, the new measures of the burden of illness questionnaire and the online application system are aiding the national medical card unit to provide an enhanced service to applicants, ensuring that the application process is as efficient and timely as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200029#GG00100","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1525268700,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I am aware of doctors who are not aware of this emergency form that they can apply on.

That patient was told that the condition was not severe enough to allow the person to apply in this way, although it was signed off by a consultant, and that the patient should apply in the normal way.  It was horrific.  What about the student who was terminally ill and cannot get the paperwork in in time?  Her application was closed down after three months.  What should happen here, and maybe the Minister of State will discuss it with the officials, is that when an application is made for someone with long-term terminal illness such as cancer or another diagnosis, and the application is accompanied by a letter from a consultant, that should have some fast-track system to get through to get a medical card awarded.  That would be instead of the painful, slow process which happens, where people who are suffering dramatically are tortured by the system for information and asked ridiculous questions and for supporting documentation for a terminal condition.

People could be diagnosed, as I was myself a number of years ago, with a skin cancer which is something very mild.  I do not need a medical card.  I did not need it then and I do not need it now.

This Bill, if enacted, will compel a conceptual shift in attitudes and behaviour towards mental health at the highest level of policymaking and governance within the Department of Health and, consequently, the Health Service Executive, HSE.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Bill establishes, on a legislative basis, the principle of parity of esteem of our physical and mental healthcare and identifies a legal mechanism for the Minister to compel the implementation of this principle.  This Bill, if enacted, will place a legal duty on the Minister for Health to promote health parity and to ensure all organisations within our health system meet parity obligations in regard to mental health.<\/p><p>Ensuring access to timely and appropriate treatment for people with mental health needs on a par with physical health is a major policy concern for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  The overarching principle of parity of esteem is that of equality.  It means, among other points, equality of access to care and treatment, equality of efforts to improve quality of care, and equality of levels of choice of care and treatment.  It means the allocation of time, effort and resources on a basis commensurate with need, that mental health has equal status within healthcare education and practice, and that there is equal status in the measurement of health outcomes.  It means also that the stigma and prejudice about mental health care and treatment is tackled head on, that there is an understanding, acceptance and execution of the principle that our physical, mental and social health are inextricably intertwined and interdependent, and that there is no health without mental health.<\/p><p>One of the key motivations for bringing forward this Bill now is the downgrading of mental health services within the HSE.  A Vision for Change requires the appointment of a mental health directorate, yet the HSE recently abolished the role of the national director of mental health and has reverted to the old system of separating strategy and budget responsibility within mental health services.  That did not work in the past and it is difficult to understand why it is believed it will work this time.<\/p><p>The reality is that the relationship of mental health is that of Cinderella to the Department of Health and the HSE.  It is ignored for the most part, regarded as something other or lesser, and is the first to be treated badly in difficult circumstances.  That is reflected in the fact that for some time now the investment in mental health as a proportion of the health budget has been decreasing.  There is ample evidence that if we place mental health on a parity with physical health in our policies and in our healthcare system, we will improve outcomes for mental, physical and social healthcare.<\/p><p>The Government consistently says it has been doing all that it can, but the facts speak for themselves.  To provide the Minister with some recent examples, we still have a significant number of children being placed in adult units, some for up to six weeks at a time.  Sometimes they are placed in chairs and at other times they are placed in hallways.  The recent report from the Mental Health Commission highlighted the fact that it still does not have the powers to regulate community mental health residences, a power that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has in respect of similar non-mental health residences.  We have patients being kept in prisons due to a lack of space in adult units.  We have a chronic problem of mental health issues linked to social media such as cyberbullying and body dysmorphia, yet there is still no appointment of a digital safety commissioner.<\/p><p>We have the revelation that we spend &euro;400 million on psychotropic medicines and only &euro;10 million on community psychology.  Our mental health system seems to be geared towards triage and crisis intervention.  This is particularly acute in children&rsquo;s primary care psychology and child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  We know that 50% of mental health issues arise before a person turns 14, and 75% arise before they turn 25, yet early intervention for young people is limited, inconsistent and <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  There is clearly a mental health treatment gap with a very significant unmet need in terms of access to care and treatment.  That gap must be closed.<\/p><p>It is obvious that the mental health area is underfunded, and not just in real or relative terms.  It is also underfunded relative to its potential impact.  By that I mean that there is evidence that investment in certain early interventions can save more money than the interventions cost.<\/p><p>As stated earlier, this Bill, if enacted, will establish on a legislative basis the principle of parity of esteem of our physical and mental healthcare and will place a legal duty on a Minister for Health to promote that parity.  I implore Members on all sides of the House to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200031#JJ00500","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1525269900,"counter":444,"content":"<p>For someone in a vulnerable position who summons the strength to reach out and seek help while feeling helpless and alone requires a strength like no other.

What we need is early intervention and more positive action at an early stage.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that our mental health service has serious deficiencies which result in long waiting lists for services for some of our most vulnerable citizens.  We are all aware of where the problems lie.  Chronic underfunding is a massive issue.  Even the 8.2% figure set out in A Vision for Change has yet to be met.  For all the talk about mental health as a political priority, we remain far below the 13% figure we managed in the 1980s.  Without a meaningful and sustained increase in overall levels of funding, we will not be able to tackle the mental health crisis in our society.<\/p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission's recent reports on 43 units made for alarming reading, with serious deficiencies found in many of the residences, including the Lakeview unit in Naas and in Portlaoise, where there is an agreement on transfer late at night.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill does not aim to solve the funding, staffing and morale problems in mental health services.

Mental health must be placed on an equal footing with physical health and given the parity of esteem to which it is entitled.  This means equal access to effective care and treatment and equal efforts to improve the quality of care our constituents receive.  It also means equal status within healthcare, education, practice and measures of outcomes.  Mental health supports need to be holistic, providing individuals with care that addresses their physical and mental needs equally.  Urgent action is needed to address the crisis.  As a society, we need to move beyond the so-called stubborn stigma and treat mental and physical illnesses in the same way.  Compassion, acceptance and kindness are the cornerstones of a caring and compassionate society and should be reflected in health care policies and adequate levels of funding for mental health care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200031#JJ00600","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525270500,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague Deputy James Browne for introducing this Bill which seeks to put mental health on a par with physical health.  The aim is to provide equality of access to care and treatment for every patient.  There is no doubt, given the lack of resources, that we are now rationing mental health services.  People who need treatments and therapies are being told that they can access one, two or three hours of same but no more than that.  That is not sufficient to deal with patients' needs and provide them with the services they require.  Only 6% of the overall health budget is spent on mental health services which is very low by international standards and must be increased.  One of the key issues that need to be addressed is the lack of out-of-hours mental health services, particularly in rural communities such as mine in County Mayo where the only out-of-hours option is to present at the emergency department.  Let us think about that for one moment; think about a person in severe mental distress presenting at an emergency department which is overcrowded, under-resourced, manic and chaotic.  That is no place for somebody suffering with severe mental health difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of treatment is also an issue.  Cognitive behavioural therapies, CBT, and other talk therapies which we know are effective are not being provided to the level required.  Medication is often the first port of call and while there is a place for it, we must also adequately resource the provision of talk therapies.  A single CBT session can cost between &euro;80 and &euro;120 per hour, which is far beyond the reach of most individuals.  Many talk therapies are out of the reach of people who are relying on the public health system and cannot gain access to such treatments.<\/p>  <p>  We do not have equality of access to care and treatment.  If someone has private health insurance or adequate resources to pay for private treatment, he or she will probably be okay, but the public health system is not functioning properly for those with mental health difficulties who do not have insurance or sufficient means.  We see the reliance of many on organisations such as Pieta House, the annual fundraising walk of which, Darkness into Light, will take place soon.  That annual event shows that communities and citizens across the country are voluntarily giving of their time and own money to fund mental health services which should be funded by the State.  If we did not have such voluntary services and charitable organisations, where would we be?  Many communities would be devoid of any mental health service.  <\/p>  <p>  I commend the Bill to the House and urge the Government to address both the non-existence of out-of-hours services in most communities and the very low percentage of the overall health budget spent on mental health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200032#KK00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1525270500,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy James Browne for bringing the Bill before the House.

In County Tipperary we have no psychiatric bed of any description.  We were promised capital investment in South Tipperary General Hospital and if such capital investment is forthcoming, it is essential that a psychiatric unit form part of it.  We also need a psychiatric unit in Nenagh in the north of the county.  We have mental health clinics in the county which are completely under-resourced and both GPs and patients have lost faith in them.  A GP visited my constituency clinic in Thurles last Saturday morning and told me that he would no longer refer any of his patients to the mental health clinic in Thurles, which serves 34,000 people.  In recent weeks three teenagers have been in the paediatric unit in Clonmel hospital - one has been there for 11 weeks - while awaiting admittance to an acute psychiatric unit in Cork for adolescents.  The position is just untenable.  When Deputy Helen McEntee was Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for mental health services, we were promised a Jigsaw project in County Tipperary, but that has not happened.

It found a service in which a culture of blame, secrecy and negativity abounded.  Following the review it was suggested the committee's 27 recommendations be implemented without delay.  A management team was put in place but to this day, as far as I am aware, very few, if any, of the recommendations has been implemented.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to improving mental health services throughout the country.  Like my colleague Deputy Jackie Cahill, I am being parochial because what has happened in my county is appalling and outrageous, although I know that the situation is almost as bad in other parts of the country.  We must remember that the aforementioned external review commenced in August 2015 but was not completed until September 2017.

I must acknowledge that we now have an Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care which is drilling down deep into the subject.  The committee has been bringing in guest speakers who have been telling members about what is happening on the ground.  In recent weeks representatives from Community Health Office, CHO, 2 , covering the Galway area, were before the committee and told members that there were 20 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, CAMHS, beds for nine counties.  In the context of the Mental Health Parity Bill, that spells it out clearly for me.  There are only 20 CAMHS beds to cover nine counties, which is in no way sufficient.<\/p>  <p>  The aforementioned Oireachtas committee has also learned a lot about the great work certain groups are doing in their communities in supporting young people.  We heard from the Galway branch of Youth Work Ireland, which is providing a youth counselling service.  That service has helped 200 vulnerable children in sixth class in primary school through to third year in secondary school.  They had issues in adjusting to secondary school.  The counselling service is receiving referrals from Tusla and schools because they recognise the importance of early intervention.

The shortcomings in mental health care have been outlined on numerous occasions, most recently in last week's \"The Big Picture - Young and Troubled\", which focused on adolescents who are seeking emergency help.  When one looks beyond the services, one sees there is a great deal of goodwill and energy at grassroots level.  People are volunteering their time, funds and efforts to plug the gaps that are being left by the State.  I refer, for example, to the Darkness into Light walks, which will take place on many doorsteps next week.  Walks have been organised in many places in my constituency, including Inchigeelagh, Ballincollig, Kilmurry and Aghabullogue.

Various policy documents have been published, but unfortunately they have not translated into mainstream health provision as we would have liked.  Despite all the commitments and the improvements in monetary allocations within the budget system, it has been difficult to put enough professionals in place to meet the level of demand we regularly encounter at our clinics and elsewhere.  Even though magnificent work is being done by people in the voluntary sector and advances have been made in other areas of healthy living that improve the health of the mind, many people are still not able to access the sorts of facilities we would expect everyone to be able to access in the modern society we live in.  A Bill like this is essential to ensure in legislation that this country provides access to facilities, services and care in a way that is comparable to all other aspects of health provision to which we aspire.  I want to add my voice to the voices of many Deputies on all sides of the House, of all parties and none, who are keen to enable the D&aacute;il to be in a position to ensure these services and facilities are easily accessed.  It is because we regularly leave our clinics with a great sense of frustration and worry that we are seeking to ensure a level of expertise and professionalism of which we can be proud is available in our health service.

I am sure all Members of the House agree that we must prioritise our work on enhancing mental health and well-being.  I acknowledge Deputy Browne&rsquo;s commitment to maintaining a focus on mental health.  I assure Deputies that the Government will continue to promote a comprehensive health service that is designed to secure improvements in the physical and mental health of all our people.<\/p>  <p>  The stated aim of the Mental Health Parity Bill 2017, which is sponsored by Deputy Browne and was published on 26 September 2017, is to place mental health on a par with physical health with a view to securing improvements in physical and mental health and in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of physical and mental illnesses.  The Government does not oppose the Bill in principle.  While the maintenance of the equal status enjoyed by mental and physical health in the health care system is a laudable and desirable objective, the Government has some concerns about the legislation that has been proposed.  Its aims are general and aspirational in nature and appear to differ from the background to and stated purpose of the Bill as set out in the explanatory memorandum.  In its current form, the Bill raises serious questions regarding how we can achieve the aims that have been set out through additional legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The World Health Organization's definition of health, which has not been changed since 1948, provides that health is \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\".  This broad holistic definition of health recognises the interconnectedness of the various factors that contribute to overall health and does not seek to prioritise any one factor over another.  Under the Health Act 2004, the purpose of the HSE is \"to use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public\".  The same Act clarifies that the HSE \"shall manage and shall deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services\".  This makes it clear that mental health is acknowledged as an inherent component of health and health legislation, part of and indivisible from the whole.  Deputy Browne's Bill seems to refer to this in its effort to ensure \"the Minister for Health shall continue the promotion of a comprehensive health service designed to secure improvements in physical and mental health\".<\/p>  <p>  Legislation must be clear and specific and should be, to the greatest extent possible, easily understood.  The inclusion of policy aspirations in legislation is not generally regarded as good practice.  The implications of such an approach can be difficult to predict.  The possibility of unforeseen and potentially negative unintended outcomes must be borne in mind.  It may be easy from a policy point of view to understand putting mental health services on a par with physical health, but what does that mean when it is put on a statutory footing?  How do we determine in precise legal terms whether a service delivered for an individual in one context can be equated with another service delivered for another person in a different context?  Does the existing legislative text not already imply that all health, both mental and physical, should already be delivered on an equal basis?  If so, how is that to be measured?<\/p>  <p>  In the limited time available to it, the Department of Health has not identified a model in other jurisdictions for legislating for mental health parity.  The British Secretary of State for Health and Social Care has a legal duty to secure improvements in the physical and mental health of the people and in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of physical and mental illness.  It is not clear that the concept of parity could be given a legal basis and, even if it could, that it could be operationalised in light of the vast spectrum of illnesses that influence both physical and mental health.<\/p>  <p>  Another of the stated aims of the Bill is to compel the integration of mental health services with physical health services.  This is already legislated for in the Health Act 2004, which states that the HSE shall \"integrate the delivery of health and personal social services\".  Over the last decade, there has been a move away from the traditional psychiatric hospital model to treatment in specialist units associated with acute hospitals.  Ultimately, there should be a focus on achieving the best outcomes for people who are suffering from mental illnesses.  I have concerns about whether a prescriptive legislative approach is an appropriate method of achieving that focus.<\/p>  <p>  The draft Bill has not yet been discussed with Deputy Browne.  Along with officials from my Department, I intend to meet the Deputy to discuss the aspirations of the draft Bill with a view to establishing whether and how an amended wording might be considered.  We need to consider whether the stated aims of this Bill can be achieved by legislation, or are already being implemented more effectively through existing health policy.  I will expand on the implementation of various initiatives in mental health shortly.  While the importance of legislation cannot be overstated, laws in and of themselves do not heal people - only treatment and services can do that.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy hopes this Bill will result in mental health issues informing the highest level of policy making and governance.  I assure him that mental health is and will remain a priority for the Government.  Since 2012, approximately &euro;200 million, or 28%, has been added to the HSE mental health budget, which now totals over &euro;910 million.  This extra funding has allowed us to approve approximately 1,800 new mental health posts over this period.  Funding has been provided to recruit 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists in primary care and 111 of those assistant psychologists have now been recruited.  In addition, funding has been provided to increase the number of undergraduate psychiatric nurses by 130 per year.  This will bring the total number of psychiatric nurses graduating each year to 400 by 2021.<\/p>  <p>  A comparative positioning of Ireland internationally suggests that the percentage resource allocation today is close to the median level across EU member states.  The Government is committed to increasing funding as circumstances allow.  Of course there are challenges in agreeing what does and does not constitute mental health spending.  If the percentage spend on mental health is to be increased, it may mean reducing the spend elsewhere in the health budget or increasing allocations to mental health far more than increases in all other areas over a fixed period of time.

The crux of the Bill is something we have been trying to address for some time in this country and, historically, we have treated mental health differently, including how we engage with people with mental health problems, how we address them and the funding given to the mental health area.  However, I do not agree that in recent times mental health has been treated badly.  The Minister of State has already outlined that our budget has increased by 28% or &euro;200 million, which is significant given the times we were in and that other budgets were cut significantly.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for allowing me to share this time with him and I know Government time is short with Private Members' business.  Allowing time to debate this is very important.  I welcome the commitment of the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Jim Daly, to this area and his offer to work with Deputy Browne to ensure the intention of the Bill can be achieved.  We all hope this can be achieved through an agreed text that is legislatively sound and effects change.  I note the concerns of the Minister of State from a legal perspective, and to be viable perhaps the Bill needs to be a little clearer and specific, taking into account good practice, as we are talking about policy aspirations in legislation and that generally does not happen.  However, the intention and statement of the Bill is that mental health should be addressed in the same way and with the same urgency and care as physical health.  There should be no distinction between the two when it comes to care and treatment.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the Minister of State's comments that the Government takes into account the 1948 World Health Organization definition of health, which is unchanged since that time.  It defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of ill health, disease or infirmity.  In other words, we are looking at a holistic approach.  This is about ensuring everything we do as a Government takes into account services and the right kind of support for people who need services at a time when they need them.  When we speak about diagnosis and prevention in particular, mental health should be on a par with physical health.<\/p>  <p>  I have had the opportunity to engage with many organisations over many years.  Over the weekend, I had two fantastic volunteers taking part in Cycle Against Suicide stay as part of a home stay.  I had the opportunity on Sunday morning to speak to our cyclists as they headed off on their day.  I was asked to encourage people to look after their own mental health.  From my time as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and my engagement with young people, I know the only way we will be able to put mental and physical health on a par is to teach from an early age to look after their health.  We must encourage them to eat well, get enough sleep, exercise regularly and speak with somebody if they are not feeling well.<\/p>  <p>  Bringing benefits to physical and mental health will only come about through improving services together and not separately; we must not separate our physical and mental health.  It is somewhat of a paradox that we have a Minister of State with responsibility for mental health.  It highlights the importance placed by the Government on mental health but it also takes away from it in that we are separating it from physical health and putting it in a separate box.  I commend the Deputy on raising this as an issue and it is something we have been trying to deal with it.  As it stands, the Government is trying to ensure that services are improved in mental health in the same way as they are in physical health.  We are looking to ensure that funding can be increased in mental health in the same way as it is with physical health, with the outcomes being essentially the same with respect to prevention, diagnosis and treating people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200034#MM00200","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1525271700,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Browne on bringing forward this Bill.  I am glad to have an opportunity to speak more on mental health in the D&aacute;il.  As I have said many times, the mental health services have a responsibility to address and to treat mental ill health.  These are two of the biggest issues I come across on a daily basis in my work as a public representative.<\/p><p>Everything in our lives impacts on our relative state of mental health.  This includes our work, education, family, social lives and the climate we live in culturally, politically and environmentally.  Our mental health is also tied to our physical health and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Prolonged illness in either regard has an impact on the other.  The parity of mental and physical health is an undeniable fact because of this link and there is potential for either pillar of our health to have a devastating effect on our quality of life should illness befall us and go untreated or unresolved.  This does not necessarily affect the policy of this Government.  Political decisions are far too often not based on fact, rational decision making or even what is effective but on compromise in order to serve an ideological goal.<\/p><p>Mental health sits not in parity with physical health but quite far below it in Government policy.  It is often seen as a soft touch where Government divestment from public service provision could be pursued and important functions of State institutions could be outsourced to community and voluntary bodies, undermining service provision and the rights of workers and patients in turn.  The problem is not one of law, although we support this Bill.  It is one of policy and political will.  Mental health services are seen by the political class that has run this country for decades as an expensive and complicated burden, much like housing.  That does not change with a paragraph of stand-alone legislation but it can change with real policy and real political will to deliver world-class public services as a function of a State that sees its role as one of caring and providing for its citizens.  This would be a good point to remember when Fianna F&aacute;il discusses its relationship with Fine Gael as an enabler to a Government that has completely failed to address the problems in our mental health services, which although complicated by their enduring presence are essentially the day-to-day tasks of running a service.<\/p><p>There are difficulties with recruitment but they would be far less damaging to our service if they had not been allowed to deepen by heaping the brunt of austerity on people working in them over many years.  This affected nurses, in particular, but all levels of the mental health service have had to work in chaotic, dysfunctional and sometimes dangerous conditions, overworked and too often underpaid.  That problem was allowed to develop without intervention for many years and now with services at breaking point and national scandals like the crisis in CAMHS, it is a Government problem of its own making, although it is not insurmountable.  We cannot play the waiting game while lives are at stake, hoping unrealistically that things will get better.  No medical professional would ever advise a patient to ignore a problem and hope it goes away, and nor should any Government.<\/p><p>Speaking on First Stage, Deputy James Browne, who has given his support to this Government stated:<\/p><blockquote>It sets out a pathway for addressing staff shortages and other resourcing issues affecting our mental health services.  It is imperative that all organisations within our health system need parity obligations and this Bill will help bring Ireland into line with international standards on the provision of mental health care.<\/blockquote><p>This Bill does not provide a pathway to anything other than speaking time in the D&aacute;il.  There is a pathway for addressing the problems he correctly outlines as being seriously damaging to our services.  That pathway is the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Healthcare and the recommendations of its interim report on which the Deputy, I and others have worked on.  Fianna F&aacute;il should be using its position to hold this Government to account on these issues and ensuring speedy implementation of this pathway.  This Bill, however well-meaning, will not do that.<\/p><p>We need a more positive and realistic approach and I appeal to all parties to stop the talking and head-nodding.  Now is the time to invest in our mental health services.  We should remember that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael did not support our proposals for &euro;37.5 million in additional funding in 2016 or the roll-out of 24\/7 services.  The Minister of State mentioned a while ago an additional 1,800 new posts but the latest report I have is that 1,700 staff could be lost in the next five years due to retirement.  That will have a negative effect again.  I will finish by calling on the Minister of State to commit to maintaining the mental health committee beyond the final publication of its report and indefinitely to work in parallel to the health committee.  That would be a real step towards parity.  I know Deputy Browne supports this and I ask that he bring the full weight of his party on the Government in seeing this become a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200034#MM00300","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speech","time":1525271700,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I take this time to speak specifically about the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.<\/p><p>I speak as a parent of someone who has had personal experience.  It is an issue close to home for me.  I do not want to talk about the waiting times because we all know there are significant delays in getting into CAMHS.  The waiting times are disgraceful.  There is nothing we can say about that only that we need to recruit more staff so that there are not waiting times.  I want to talk about when a person first realises that their child potentially has a mental health difficulty.  It could be the parent who notices or it could be a teacher who brings this to the parent's attention.  It is a difficult thing to deal with.  No matter what is said and no matter how often it is said it is okay not to be okay, a parent still feels he or she is still failing a child if he or she has to access CAMHS.  There is no point saying anything else about that.<\/p> <p> I find it is an extremely faceless service.  It is all paperwork.  The bunch of forms are asking questions at a time when it is hard to process what is going on and what the difficulties might be.  People have 14 days to return the forms.  Then a whole load of information about drop-in and walk-in clinics is sent out.  It states that if a parent is concerned for a child, he or she can drop into this or that clinic.  Of course the parent is concerned for his or her child.  That is why he or she is accessing CAMHS in the first place.  Much of the information is difficult to digest and it has to be dealt with at an already difficult time in the lives of parents and children.  Many people at that point just cannot cope with it and do not know where to go or what to do with the information.  It would be far better if there was a phone service or a face to face service where people could go in and speak to someone who could assist with the forms.  A parent is not a mental health expert and cannot say what category a child falls into.  That is really important because we need to have it as an accessible service at the very start.<\/p> <p> Then we need to look at the waiting times.  It is extremely frustrating when a parent knows there is a difficulty but cannot do anything about it.  As a parent, not being able to help a child is one of the worse feelings in the whole world.  The child is on a waiting list and the parent is pulling his or her hair out trying to deal with it.  It is okay for people who can access private services.  However, not everyone is going to be able to do that and not all the private services suit children's mental health.  We need to make CAMHS much more accessible, much more friendly, much more helpful and we definitely need to look at the waiting times and the lists.  We need to ensure children are not left languishing on a list and then turn into an adult with even more difficulties and problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200034#MM00400","speaker":"1266","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525272300,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I have raised this issue many times with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and with others here.  Staffing is the problem.  It is a problem for the service users but also a huge problem for the people working in the service.  I have come across people in a stressed situation on numerous occasions.  I was recently talking to someone working in the administration side of CAMHS.  She is nearly in need of mental health services herself at this stage.  She feels terrible talking to parents and to people and making up excuses as to why there is not a service for them.  This person is now looking for work elsewhere.  The pay is fine, it suits her and she is happy to be in the employment she is in.  However, she is continually stressed at finding herself in the position the system has put her in.  She is becoming a block to people getting the service.  When the phone rings, she is the person who has to try to deal people who are in a terrible state because their child is suicidal, self-harming or is in a difficult situation.  They are trying to get an appointment with a psychologist that in many cases does not exist or are they trying to get a review of medication that was done six or eight months ago and they cannot get an appointment to get that review to happen.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the mental health service in all its aspects.  It is the same in the adult health mental service.  A mental health nurse in Sligo tells me that the position is the same there.  They are understaffed and conscious that their service is not up to scratch.  These people are dedicated to what they do.  They feel they are letting down the public.  Then they look around and recognise that the reason for that is that there is not enough of them.  It is as simple as that.  Additional staff is the one thing that would make the biggest difference to the mental health services.  The Minister of State has said that more money has been put in and there has been an increase here and there.  I acknowledge that.  Those increases have come in the aftermath of such a terrible disaster over the last ten to 15 years.  The service was gutted.  When there is a crisis in government or in the economy, the first part of the service to be hit is the community service and the services that are at their weakest.  Mental health fits into that category nicely.  Bringing parity to this is certainly required.  What we really have to do, though, is recognise that mental health services are a priority.  It has to be made a priority not just of the Department of Health but of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200035#NN00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1525272300,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy James Browne for bringing forward this Bill.  It gives us the opportunity to highlight the inadequate funding for mental health and the continual reluctance of the Government to address the problem.  I am aware of the need for more funding and resources for mental health in my constituency of Limerick City.  I commend Jigsaw in Limerick city.  I visited that project recently and it does great work in offering mental health support to young people and their families.  Jigsaw aims to ensure that no young person feels alone, isolated and disconnected from others around them.  It provides vital supports to the mental health of young people by working closely with communities across Ireland.  Limerick Suicide Watch also provides an invaluable service in Limerick city.  It patrols our streets at night time.  Unfortunately, its services are needed far too often.  The huge efforts of these volunteers should not go overlooked.  They are a credit to our city.<\/p>  <p>  Data compiled earlier in the year by the national suicide research foundation found that from 2014 to 2016 the average rate of suicide in Limerick city was 23.7 per 100,000.  This is higher than the last report from 2011 to 2013.  That recorded a rate of 22.4, in the midst of the economic crisis and austerity when suicide tends to increase.  While the figures for suicide nationally are declining slightly, unfortunately Limerick figures have risen.  It is both shocking and upsetting that the suicide rate for Limerick city is more than twice the national average of 10.5.  This clearly demonstrates that a properly resourced 24-7 crisis intervention service is essential for our region.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, figures also showed that 425 people took their own lives nationally and that twice or three times as many men as women die by suicide.  Unfortunately, accurate figures for death by suicide are hard to obtain, as the Minister of State knows.  Many other cases of death by suicide have been recorded as accidental death when the individual may have died by suicide.  The only way to get real figures and a true insight as to the actual rate of death by suicide is by talking and listening to the families that have lost loved ones.  In 2016, the national self-harm registry Ireland recorded 11,485 presentations to hospitals due to self-harm.  Accident and emergency departments do not offer appropriate care or follow up for those in acute mental stress.  I know that from friends.  The provision of 24-7 crisis intervention services is required.  That could provide assistance to people day or night when they require help and hopefully reduce the number of suicides.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, there are 2,603 children and adolescents waiting for an appointment with a CAMHS team, which treat vulnerable children in Ireland with moderate to severe mental health problems.  This is largely due to a failure to recruit the staff needed to operate a CAMHS team fully.  Currently, and for quite some time, about half the positions in CAMHS teams across the country are vacant.  Figures released recently to Sinn F&eacute;in also show that the child and adult mental health team in the Limerick region is operating with only 58.7% of the recommended staff set out in the strategy, A Vision for Change.  That strategy recommends that youth mental health services be fully staffed at 1,047 people.  As of December 2017, however, the CAMHS teams had just 587 doctors and nurses.  The sad reality is that without adequate resources and the provision of proper services for those in acute mental distress, the figures for death by suicide by self-harm will only continue to increase.  The Government needs to sit up and take notice of the public desire for more funding and resources to be allocated for mental health services across the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200035#NN00300","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1525272300,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy James Browne for his work on this Bill and express the support of the Labour Party for it.  Ireland, and indeed the world, has come a long way in respect of mental health but a lot remains to be done.<\/p><p>It is poignant that we are discussing Second Stage of the Bill at this point, given that the Darkness Into Light event run by Pieta House takes place on 12 May, a little over a week from now.  I imagine Members across the House will join me in praising this fantastic initiative which aims to raise awareness and funds for people suffering from mental illness.  I encourage people to take part, if possible.  I shout out to some of my friends, including Mick Matthews, Jackie Morrison and those involved in the Skerries Cycle Against Suicide group.<br\/><br\/>The intention of the Bill is to place mental health on a par with physical health.  It is an important Bill which, if enacted, will bring Ireland further into line with international best practice in medicine.  I hope it will be enacted soon.<br\/><br\/>Our goal should always be to treat a patient with a mental health issue with the same compassion and clinical excellence we would expect for someone with a physical health issue.<br\/><br\/>I am keen to reference some examples from overseas related to mental health parity or parity of esteem, as it is also known.  In the United Kingdom the then NHS director for people with long-term conditions, Dr. Martin McShane, succinctly put the issue of parity of esteem for mental health on the table in 2014.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>To me parity of esteem means tackling mental health issues with the same energy and priority as we have tackled physical illness.<br \/><br \/>It is about changing the experience for people who require help with mental health problems.<br \/><br \/>It is about putting funding, commissioning and training on a par with physical health services.<br \/><br \/>And parity of esteem is about tackling and ending the stigma and prejudice within the NHS which stop people with serious mental health problems getting treated with the same vigour as if they had a physical illness such as, say, diabetes.<br \/><br \/>That stigma can be demonstrated like this: if you fall down and break your hip, an ambulance will be with you in eight minutes to give emergency care at the scene before taking you to A&amp;amp;E.  If, however, you suffer an acute psychotic episode in the street, you are just as likely to be attended by a police car and taken to a cell.<br \/><br \/>We must end the stigma associated so often with mental health.  We must raise awareness of the importance of mental health care and recognise the inadequacies of how we have regarded mental health in the past.  This means raising awareness within the NHS itself.  And we must create parity for mental health care in reality &ndash; rather than just issuing rhetoric and paying lip service to it.<\/blockquote><p>On 2 February 2011 the British Government published a 109 page report entitled, No health without mental health &ndash; a cross-government mental health outcomes strategy for people of all ages.  The comprehensive document listed key achievements required to bring the NHS up to date in mental health care.  The report references the fact that there are many interdependencies between physical and mental health.  In principle, this is a departure from prior thinking, which suggested mental health was a separate and distinct area never truly considered to be on a par with physical health.  The NHS mandate 2014 to 2015 directly states the objective of the NHS is to put mental health on a par with physical health.  That is what the Bill also seeks to achieve.<br\/><br\/>In 2009 Harvard Medical School published an article entitled, Benefitting from mental health parity.  The article referred to the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act 2008 which came into law in the United States on 1 of October in that year.  Prior to enactment patients suffering from bi-polar disorder and schizophrenia were liable to vast costs.  Many insurance plans now fully cover these illnesses.<br\/><br\/>The importance of the Mental Health Parity Bill 2017 is the proposed establishment of a legal commitment to have equal and due regard for psychiatric patients when provision is being made for improvements in the health service.  In Ireland today we bear witness to children waiting 15 months to see a psychologist and, more generally, a total of 2,500 young people awaiting access to public mental health services.  There is a crisis in the provision of child and adolescent mental health services.  General practitioners are referring patients to a waiting list because there is a serious lack of immediate counselling services available.  This, in turn, has a knock-on effect on the clinical outcome for these patients.  A striking example arises in cases of moderate to severe depression, in which a combination of medication and psychotherapy is recognised as the optimum treatment.  Owing to the lack of psychotherapists, a shortage of cognitive behavioural therapy specialists, an inability to fill vacancies for adult and child psychiatrists, as well as the shortage of other mental health care specialists, patients are often left solely on anti-depressant medication without the additional counselling intervention that has been proved to be beneficial in tackling the underlying issue.  I am dealing with a mother who is at her wits' end because her son is being left on anti-depressant medication and nothing beyond.  It is frustrating and unacceptable.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that currently private health insurance cover has a focus on inpatient psychiatric care as opposed to care on an outpatient or community basis.  For example, there is full cover available for inpatients in a psychiatric hospital up to 100 days per calendar year.  There is a separate arrangement for people suffering from substance abuse.  Often such persons are covered for 91 days in a five-year period.  Depending on the insurance plan, patients who see mental health teams on an outpatient basis receive limited cover for outpatient expenses.  For example, if an initial consultation fee to see a psychiatrist is &euro;180, the patient may receive a refund of &euro;60.  Naturally, the crisis in child and adolescent mental health services is masked by this dependence on private care.  If we are serious about seeing parity between physical and mental health, we need to drastically improve out-of-hospital mental health care servoces.  Inpatient care is, by its nature, unsuitable to deal with all cases of psychiatric distress.  Research into outcomes for patients strongly favours community-based care to treat certain classes of depression and other less serious psychiatric illnesses.  We have heard much over the years about a shift towards care in the community.  With the further development of primary care centres, I am hopeful psychiatric care will become integral to everyday medicine at a local level.<br\/><br\/>I alluded to the shortage of adult and child and adolescent psychiatrists and the fact that the HSE regularly advertised posts that were not filled.  To tackle waiting times, we need to be more proactive in staff recruitment and retention.  I could develop the point further, but I will leave it at that.  I thank Deputy James Browne and look forward to serious engagement on the issue and enactment of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200035#NN00400","speaker":"1301","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525272900,"counter":462,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht an deis labhartha seo.  I welcome the Bill.  It is both important and timely and I commend Deputy James Browne on bringing it forward.  It is warranted.<\/p>  <p>  For decades we have struggled to adequately finance and operate physical health services.  As a result, mental health medical services have always been put to the back of the line.  They have not received the priority or attention they so richly deserve.  There is now an unacceptable situation throughout the State where many children and young people are experiencing mental health difficulties and not receiving the age-appropriate timely services or supports they badly need.  This is impacting on them and also has consequences into adulthood.  It also impacts on their families, communities and schools.  We need to give it urgent attention.  I am pleased the Bill suggests intervention in terms of equivalence and that nothing else is required.  This includes specialist 24-hour psychiatric first responders who could be deployed with every ambulance dispatched, with psychiatric consultants and registrars being rostered over 24 hours in every emergency department.  We have all heard of situations where young people with mental health difficulties are referred to emergency departments.  It is a shocking and humiliating experience for any young person to encounter and must stop.  We need specialists in place to deal with the problem.<\/p>  <p>  Community-based primary care services must, as a matter of course, engage specially trained psychiatric medics in GP services.  A mental health condition should be treated by such services, with the same access to qualified medical practitioners as someone who presents with any other medical condition.  Why should a mental health condition be treated differently?<\/p>  <p>  Mental health care will only attain parity with physical health care when both are co-located within easy access for any member of the public.  The underlying premise is that any person at any given time may require mental health care.  We need to break down barriers and de-stigmatise the area of mental health.  I am keen to acknowledge the great work being done by many organisations throughout the State.

We have had a debate on this issue in this House on numerous occasions during the past two years.  It is healthy to have this debate.  I understand Deputy Browne's Bill is largely aspirational.  It has much merit.  Ensuring there is parity between our physical and mental health is very important, but the reality is very different.  Other Deputies have stated that 6% of our health budget is spent on mental health services but largely in Europe the expenditure on this sector is approximately 12%.  Where there is a lack of funding, one finds a shortage of staff and that people fall through the cracks.<\/p>  <p>  I want to bring to the attention of the Minister and Members an article reported in the newspapers at the weekend, which I found extraordinary.  The clinical director of the Central Mental Hospital stated that 26 ill patients are currently in prison and cannot get into the Central Mental Hospital.  He stated that is completely detrimental to their mental health.  They are a danger to themselves and to other people.  He further stated that, under the laws of the land, he is almost in contempt of court for not meeting his obligations as the clinical director of the hospital.  Unfortunately, it gets worst.  There is capacity for ten extra patients in the Central Mental Hospital but it cannot fill vacancies due to the shortage of psychiatric nurses.  That facility has cost a great deal of money but it cannot get staff.  That is the crux of the issue.  Retaining and recruiting staff, particularly psychiatric nurses, is extremely difficult.  Psychiatric nurses are demoralised in some ways because of the state of the health service and they are feeling the pinch.  It is extremely important to address the issue of the retention of staff.<\/p>  <p>  I am to blame at times for lambasting our mental health services.  There are some extremely positive aspects in terms of the staff in those services and the voluntary bodies in the State but when we look deep down there are serious anomalies in the services.  Last week's RT&Eacute; programme \"The Big Picture\", which showed how young people are being failed by the State, would break one's heart.  That failure is the result of austerity and lack of funding of our mental health services by successive Governments.  We have seen the State fail people when they have sought services.  The services fail them, they fall through the cracks and some people die because of that disgraceful situation.  There is a shortage of staff.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue, which many speakers have raised, is our child and adolescent mental health services, CAHMS, which is in crisis.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Healthcare.  What it has found is damming of our health service.  It found chronic staff shortages with staffing levels as low as 47.5% of what was recommended in some regions.  The child and adolescent mental health services have only 56% of the number of staff who were meant to be employed.  It is pretty bad.  The social damage that does is incalculable and people die because of a lack of services.<\/p>  <p>  A Vision of Change, which I believe was introduced in 2007, was a very good document but like all documents that come into this House it never gets implemented.  A Vision of Change is quite conservative regarding what the funding should be.  It is 8.6% in the State but in line with European levels it should be double that.  Until we tackle the chronic underfunding, particularly of our mental health services, we will have a constant crisis in our mental health services.  I welcome the debate on this issue but until the Government tackles the danger posed by the lack of funding of our mental health services, we will continue to have this debate and people will continue to die.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200037#PP00200","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1525273500,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I welcome the introduction this Deputy James Browne's Private Members' Bill.  An increase in the provision of mental health care in this country is urgent to say the least.  We should be very careful about how this parity between physical and mental health proceeds and we should be especially careful about how we frame the discussion.  It is important to be conscious of the fact that the term &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo; is a highly loaded and ideological one that takes away agency and certain types of possible treatment from a person.  When one says someone is ill, one presumes to understand what a healthy person would look like.  This is well and good for physical problems like diseases, and degenerative diseases, but if one applies this to the mind, then we are in very different territory.  No one in the history of humankind has ever seen a mind, or been able to study one in anything resembling what we call the scientific method, and anyone who pretends to know what a healthy one looks like is not telling the truth.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have time to go into how over time the brain has become the realm of science and consciousness has been left to the philosophers but a number of major problems result from that ideology.  One of them is drugs.  Pharmaceutical drugs that are used to treat so-called mental illnesses are physical things and that means that they can only have a physical effect.  If the mind of a distressed person is a purely physical thing and our mental distress is purely the result of a malfunctioning of a person&rsquo;s material brain, then there is a possibility that these may work.  That is, presuming that the manufacturers of these drugs understand the human brain and how all the different parts of it relate to all the different diagnosed illnesses.  However, any neuroscientist who is honest would tell you that we do not have a clue how the brain works.  Any one of us here knows from our life experience that the circumstances in our lives and in the lives of those who are routinely diagnosed with so-called mental illnesses are a major factor in people presenting with distress and mental health issues.  These life experiences and how we react to them are not physical things.  The drugs are only designed to alter how people perceive their lives, not change them.  The problems that lead to someone having a breakdown are not solved by taking the drugs: the problems remain.  The issues that are at the root of the breakdown are not dealt with by taking the drugs, the issues remain.  People can bury immense trauma deep in their consciousness in order to survive and it can be triggered years, even decades, later in the form of what a psychologist would diagnose as a severe mental illness.  The drugs will not help these people build the tools to cope in a world where that world has violated them in an unimaginable way - the grief will remain. <\/p>  <p>  A second problem is related to the first in a profound way.  Talking therapies are rarely used by the HSE.  One reason for this is that psychologists are running the show and they do not see any scientific value in talking to people they diagnose as mentally ill, the problem being scientifically, a materially, brain located one.  Another is that there is no regulation of psychotherapy, a problem the Minister has said he is working on, but people should not hold their breath.  The lack of regulation leads to an issue of insurance for the HSE, and only those educated in the art of denying the existence of human consciousness, with their PhDs from the highest institutes in the land, are a bankable proposition in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  A third problem is that it is costly and time consuming to talk to people, and if one listened to what they are saying it would undermine the dominant medicalised model of mental health care, which is so cosy with the pharmaceutical industry.  If one presents to a general practitioner, GP, he or she has the power to prescribe very powerful drugs.  Usually this prescription is based on a few questions about one's behaviour - is one anxious, has one trouble sleeping, has one negative thoughts and so on.  The GP will not ask, nor is he or she qualified to ask, what has been going on in a person's life and how he or she might deal with that.  What is more, a GP will commonly not tell a person about the side effects of these powerful drugs.  The number of people committing suicide because of the reckless prescription of these drugs is a scary reality in Ireland and nothing is being done about it.<\/p>  <p>  At a meeting in New Ross just over a year ago, at which Independents 4 Change was presenting a submission on how to improve mental health provision, the executive clinical director for mental health services in community healthcare organisation area 5, CHO5, responding to a query as to why there were not more talking therapies provided by the HSE, told one of my staff that the mentally ill were not to be trusted, so there was no point, scientifically, in talking to them.<\/p><p>If we are to increase funding to the mental health services in Ireland, powerful people in the HSE who hold such positions should not be part of the process.  We need to wake up to the reality that many people who are in charge in the HSE mental health services would not last long if we stopped talking about mental illness and started to talk to people about what is going on in their lives.<\/p> <p> I have spoken in this Chamber on a number of occasions in the past while about five children who have presented with suicidal ideation in Wexford in the past year and a half.  These are children, as young as seven years old and ten years old, and up to 14 years old, who want to kill themselves.  Every one of these children has had to wait for over two years to access child psychiatry services.  As I stated the last time I spoke here about suicide prevention services, I appreciate that not everyone presents with suicidal ideation and that it is, of course, not always possible to identify signs that someone might be suicidal, but from speaking to those trying to avail of mental health services in Wexford there seems to be an incredible lack of an emergency response to those who present with suicidal ideation.  It is unforgivable.  We have to take these threats seriously.  We already know of very young children in Ireland who have committed suicide.<\/p> <p> I was contacted this week by yet another mother, the mother of an eight year old boy who also presented with suicidal ideation.  It is not easy reading about her son.  For parents who are experiencing this for the first time, the lack of services and the length of time they will have to wait for these services comes as a shock.  Having had experience of dealing with other parents in the same situation previously, I know what the waiting times are like.  I dread breaking the news to the parents who are dealing with this for the first time.  This poor mother has only just realised that the waiting time for her son who has presented with suicidal ideation is two and a half years.  What must it be like?  What is even more infuriating is that in Wexford we have someone who many people believe to be one of the best child psychiatrists in the country, Dr. Kieran Moore, but children cannot get access to him because the waiting lists are so long.  I have never met or spoken to Dr. Moore but I have spoken to a number of parents who speak incredibly highly of him, not just as a psychiatrist but as a human being who cares deeply about his patients and, I have been told, goes above and beyond for these children and parents.<\/p> <p> I recently received a letter from a woman in Wexford who said the recent suicides of two of her friends had spurred her to write to me.  Suicide is an epidemic in Wexford.  It is a remarkable letter.  I would not mind showing it to the Minister, if I got the woman's permission.  It is handwritten, and she lists 20 different individual significant problems with mental health services in Wexford.  I have raised a number of these issues over time in here, but not all of them.  The letter is a remarkably comprehensive and insightful list.  In isolation, each problem she lists causes massive problems for people in Wexford but by listing all 20 problems together in her letter, she shows the overwhelming extent of the lack of mental health services in Wexford.  As well as the list, she makes a perceptive observation, one that explains to some extent why parents in Wexford have not revolted.  She states that many parents cannot advocate publicly because they are worn out just getting through each day keeping the children safe.<\/p> <p> We have an awful lot to answer for in this place.  What is going on is too bad and I am sorry but it is not changing.  It is getting worse in Wexford, not better, and all the talk in the world will not sort it.  Our approach is wrong, there is not enough funding and one cannot blame the parents for feeling that the organisations and apparatuses that run this country just do not care enough because that is how they feel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200037#PP00300","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525274100,"counter":467,"content":"<p>The Rural Independent Deputies have nine minutes.

Allow me, ar an ch&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, to salute Deputy Browne for his commitment to the issue of mental health and the time and effort he and his staff have put into drafting this Bill.<\/p><p>There is absolutely no parity between how physical and mental health are treated in this country.  This Bill seeks to amend that.  Indeed, Deputy Browne described it in the memorandum for the Bill, as follows:<\/p><blockquote>The neglect of Mental Health is a deep seated cultural issue at policy, institutional, organisational and individual levels.  This Bill aims to offer hope and provide a catalyst for better Mental Health care by ensuring that vulnerable persons with mental illness are cared for effectively and equally.<\/blockquote><p>We also saw in the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Healthcare's second interim report, the launch of which I was privileged to attend in the AV room last week, that &quot;[t]he lack of cohesion between primary care and mental health services often means that the most marginalised people are the most adversely affected in terms of accessing mental health services.&quot;  That is telling.  This is a very good report and I salute the committee, chaired by Senator Freeman.<\/p><p>The interim report goes on to state that the HSE, at a meeting on 30 November 2017, confirmed to the joint committee that only 60% of the 114 community mental health teams in Ireland have a seven days a week service.  It is appalling.  What about the places that do not have it?  Even the ones that have a seven days a week service, it is scant at times.  Like other Deputies, I salute those working on the front line.  The vast majority of psychiatrists and everybody else do a wonderful job.  The report indicates that &ldquo;[i]f these teams are really to be the bulwark of the service they were envisioned to be in A Vision for Change, Ireland should be working towards a situation where supports are available seven days a week and 24 hours a day...&quot;.  They should at least have that.<\/p><p>Tragically, this is clear in my own constituency where we have children and young adults languishing in paediatric wards for months without any access to appropriate levels of care.  At present, there are two languishing there.  One, a girl of 14, is waiting 11 weeks and she is from County Waterford, Deputy Butler's constituency, but my parish.  Another girl is six and a half.  Imagine that girl is in her 11th week.  It will be 12 weeks come the weekend.  This is scandalous.  I raised the matter last week in a Topical Issue debate and instead of receiving clarity about what will be done, I received a dry official reply about how wonderful the funding levels are.  There is nothing more insulting than that when we all know of the horror and the trauma.  It was pathetic.  In the meantime, the children suffer and their parents are driven to their wits end.<\/p><p>That clearly demonstrates the need for a Bill of this type and I compliment Deputy Browne on bringing it forward.  The situation is just not good enough.  One of these girls who is taking up a bed in the children's ward is 14 years of age and is almost an adult.  However, there are eight beds lying idle in &Eacute;ist Linn in Cork because of bad management, mismanagement and stubbornness by the management.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to try to make some effort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200038#QQ00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1525274100,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak on this Bill and I thank Deputy Browne for bring it forward, as I believe mental health is an area in Ireland that has been neglected.  According to the Healthy Ireland survey 2015, 10% of the Irish population over the age of 15 have a probable mental health problem at any one time.  Everyone has somebody in his or her life who has an issue with mental health, whether it be depression, anxiety, stress, alcohol issues and-or drug issues.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 6% of the overall health budget is spent on mental health each year, which is totally inadequate and needs to be changed.  The Government needs to fully realise its commitments to mental health and adequately invest in mental health and update current legislation in order to improve the mental health outcomes of adults and children living in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I am hearing from my constituents about a number of issues around mental health.  Many families tell us horrific stories when dealing with child and adolescent mental health issues.  There are only 69 child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams when it is recognised we need 95 such teams to adequately cover the country.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the child and adolescent mental health teams are inadequately resourced and as a result, the patients and families are suffering.  It is vital that we have early intervention but, unfortunately, this is not always the case.  The health service has stated that emergency response times to child and adolescent mental health issues should not be greater than 72 hours.  We need 24 hours seven days a week access to our mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of children and adolescents being admitted into adult mental health facilities is totally unacceptable and needs to be addressed.  According to United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, UNICEF, difficulties in accessing the mental health services and closure of beds are adding to the seriousness of Ireland's teenage mental health issues.<\/p><p>The UNICEF report states that Ireland's teenage suicide rate is the fourth highest among high earning countries.  We need considerably more supports and treatment centres for people suffering from eating disorders.  Some people suffering from eating disorders are being admitted into adult psychiatric hospitals due to the lack of specialised units.  Supports for people with postnatal depression need to be improved.  While I accept some improvements have taken place, a lot more needs to be done.  I acknowledge the great work being done by self-help and advocacy groups across the country, such as Lisheens House in Skibbereen.  The Men's Sheds Association is a good initiative.  Organisations such as Pieta House are doing outstanding work.  Without organisations such as Pieta House, our mental health service would be in a much worse position.<\/p> <p> People suffering from mental health issues can no longer be seen as objects.  They must be involved in a meaningful way in making decisions about their treatment and care and in any legislation that seeks to increase the standards of mental health care in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200038#QQ00400","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525274700,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Browne for introducing the Bill and for the opportunity to talk on the issue.  The Deputy is right that we are not giving treatment to people who present with mental health issues comparable with the treatment given to people who present with physical or other health issues.  I will talk about Kerry.  To go back in time, there were 1,200 patients in St. Finan's mental institution.  There were many people in there who should not have been there.  There were people in there who needed treatment.  We have gone from that figure down to very few in our county.  Young people presenting with mental health issues are not able to get one-to-one treatment which they need 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  I know of a family that lost its lovely 23 year old son.  He told his parents that he had problems and issues.  I will not say where he was taken but he did not get treatment and he is, sadly, no longer with us.  His family is heartbroken.  There is a vacant chair at the table and he will never sit in it again.  He was very good.  He told them all he had a problem but he did not get the help he needed.  There are many other cases like that.  We do not have enough to deal with them.  It is a serious issue.  There are only hours in it.  Some people who were seen are fine.  They are living and are with us today.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Denis and Marie O'Carroll in Killarney who lost their son Nathan 11 years ago.  They started the Darkness into Light walk every year.  It has been done since then and we will be doing it again this year.  I thank those in Pieta House for the help and work they do and the other people who volunteer around Killarney and Tralee and elsewhere around our county who are trying to help people who present with mental health issues.  We need more assistance from the HSE.  It needs to be recognised more by the Department of Health.  What Deputy Browne is asking for should be acceded to.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue is that when young fellows or young girls who were getting treatment or help from doctors have to leave the treatment because they turn 18, the do not get the continuity of service they received until they were 18.  There is something wrong with this because they are still very young at 18 and 19 years of age and they should be getting the same treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200039#RR00200","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1525274700,"counter":472,"content":"<p>While the principle of the Bill is one I wholeheartedly support, it represents only a starting point.  I think that is generally accepted.  The experience in the UK shows that similar legislation, while having a positive effect on the provision of mental health services, is by no means a panacea.  The 2012 Health and Social Care Act in the UK enshrined in law parity of esteem for mental health and is defined as valuing mental health equally with physical health.  Despite being a central plank of NHS policy for six years now, serious issues remain with mental health services in the UK.  It is a system that, even when parity was introduced in 2012, was years ahead of our own in terms of service delivery and treatment provision.<\/p>  <p>  While the concept has merit, it is not a silver bullet.  We all know what is needed to fix out mental health services - funding, a reform plan and the political will to deliver on both of those.  The absence of these things has hampered the effective implementation of A Vision for Change almost since it was first published.  This is partially due to economic circumstances and partially due to the political decisions that were made as a response to those circumstances.  The slashing of mental health funding during this period, aside from being wholly unjust, was a classic example of short termism.  Individuals who would have benefited from earlier interventions to address mental health issues at the lowest level of complexity were abandoned or offered inappropriate pharmaceutical treatments in the absence of any kind of talk therapy.  We simply do not know the impact it will have in the future and it is likely that it is having an impact now.  Studies have shown that later, more complex interventions for mental health illness are less effective and more costly.  Long-term planning and not panicked crisis-to-crisis reaction is the truly transformative measure that has been sorely missing from not only our mental health services but our health services in general.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report would represent a grounded first step towards achieving parity for mental health.  The 2018 budget for mental health services is &euro;917.8 million, 6.3% of total health spending.  This is below the level advised in A Vision for Change and compares very badly with similar states.  A Vision for Change recommended it should be over 8%.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report recommended as an initial target 10% of the overall health budget being ring-fenced for mental health services.  A Vision for Change recommended well-trained, fully staffed, community-based, multidisciplinary mental health teams be rolled out across the community health areas.  The report also detailed the additional staffing requirements for these teams.  Indicative funding needed to deliver on this amounts to just over &euro;120 million, adjusted for population growth.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report recommends this funding be phased in over five years.  This includes funding for child and adult mental health teams, child and adolescent liaison, old age psychiatry and mental health services for people with intellectual disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  People with medical cards can avail of counselling through referring clinicians.  This is a new service which 9,374 people utilised in 2016.  For this service to be extended to the whole population, a budget increase is needed over time.  Given the limited availability of talk therapies and community mental health teams, extending counselling in primary care would represent a way to address mental health needs at a lower level of complexity and in a much more effective way.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report recommends the provision of universal access to six to eight counselling sessions for those whom their GP determines are in need of this service.  The allocation for this service in 2016 was &euro;6.5 million.  The report recommends doubling this spend over a three-year period.  A further allocation of &euro;5 million would allow additional psychologists to be hired as part of primary care services to work with people who do not need a referral to community mental health teams.<\/p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare plan offers the only grounded and achievable roadmap for achieving the transformation in our mental health services which is badly needed and which would allow us to reach the minimum level of care that was promised 12 years ago in A Vision for Change.  We can only hope the Government does not allow to slip through its fingers this once-in-a-generation chance for real reform of our mental health services and an achievable way of ensuring parity for mental health.  We must act on implementing Sl&aacute;intecare as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200039#RR00300","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1525275300,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Mental Health Parity Bill 2017.  I compliment Deputy Browne on bringing it forward and I confirm my support for the Bill.  The Bill represents another step in the journey to bring mental health into the heart of the community and give it equal status with physical health.<\/p>  <p>  When I think of the journey of institutional care to the centrality of community-based services I think of my late dad, who worked as a psychiatric nurse at St. Luke's Hospital, Clonmel for over 40 years.  He joined the staff in 1932 as a warder - there were no psychiatric nurses then.  Although he was always a very gentle and compassionate man, the emphasis in the work at the time was on physicality and patient restraint.  In his early days, St. Luke's had little or no contact with the outside world.  There were locked main gates controlled by gate lodges, 8 ft high walls and locked wards but his generation of work colleagues quickly became qualified psychiatric nurses and began the journey to create a humane service.  They tore down the walls, did away with the gate lodges and the locked gates and invited local people in to integrate the hospital and its patients into the local community.<\/p>  <p>  They did trojan work and they came a long way but a lot more needs to be done.  The challenge now is to make mental health services truly community-based and able to provide an immediate response to persons experiencing mental health difficulties in the same way as we have now for people with physical health difficulties.  The key to this is to resource and fund mental health properly.  For too long it has been the Cinderella of the service.  We need a proper out-of-hours service, 24-7 crisis intervention teams providing rapid assessment and a comprehensive primary care counselling service.  We also need to staff our community-based teams and the child and adolescent mental health teams fully.  It is also vitally important to resource and support community organisations which do tremendous work across the country.  In my area there is the River Suir Suicide Patrol, TaxiWatch and the C-Saw community suicide awareness workers.  They are all volunteers but they work tremendously long hours on an ongoing basis in support of persons with mental difficulties.  Talk therapies are important in this journey to truly community-based mental health services whereby we can react immediately to persons with difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200040#SS00200","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"speech","time":1525275300,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I know the topic is no stranger to the Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for disabilities, Deputy Finian McGrath, and I do not doubt his personal commitment.

There are not many debates about mental health in the House, or on legislation specific to it, so he could have cleared the diary if the inclination was there.  Whether it is his own fault or that of his diary secretary, it does not augur well for the approach of this House to this very important area.<\/p>  <p>  I fully support the Bill put forward by my colleague, Deputy James Browne.  It brings us in line with international best practice as regards parity, as is seen in our nearest neighbours.  It ensures that mental health is central to health issues.  Sadly, over the years, mental health has consistently been the poor relation and we have seen scandals of various descriptions at different times.  There have been a few flashes of spin-managed celebrations by Governments but A Vision for Change, which all parties have bought into over the years, cannot celebrate its successes because less than 50% of it has been implemented, despite the fact that we are at or around the 12th birthday of the initiative.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim North, and in south Donegal and north Roscommon, as Deputies Scanlon, McLoughlin and Martin Kenny will verify, we have a shambles of a service, notwithstanding the very hardworking professionals in it.  The national staff numbers are 600 down on what they should be for an adequate service and for us to do what we are supposed to be doing.  Our clinics are inundated with people of every party, colour and creed, desperately trying to get a child assessed, sometimes just for a follow-up on ongoing medication to ascertain whether it is necessary for them to continue to have the prescribed dosage of what are often very heavy medications.  In some instances they may need to be increased but in many more they need to be decreased and it is arguable that children are being badly affected by this.<\/p>  <p>  Our health system generally, although it is populated by many hardworking professionals, is packed with managers, administrators and so on but is absent of leaders and this is underpinned by this week's crisis.

The Mental Health Parity Bill will see mental health well-being treated the same as physical health and we believe there should be parity of esteem.<\/p>  <p>  I will focus on the number of children who present with mental health difficulties but for whom, unfortunately, the correct facility for their needs is not available and the only option in some cases is in an adult facility.  The latest batch of inspection reports from the Mental Health Commission in March shows that children were admitted to the acute psychiatric units at UHL, the centre for mental health care and recovery at Bantry General Hospital, the Lakeview Unit, Naas General Hospital and the Aisling Centre in Dublin.  The department of psychiatry in University Hospital Waterford and Drogheda hospital's department of psychiatry also admitted children.

I see, at first hand, his own frustration with the current system and with minors being in adult facilities.  A Vision for Change mental health strategy, published in 2006, outlined that Ireland would need 100 inpatient mental health beds for children and adolescents to meet patient demand.  The national numbers for operational psychiatric beds for children and teenagers as of November 2017 stood at 68, though I am open to correction on this.  There are four CAMHS acute admission units in Ireland with a maximum capacity of 76 beds but only 68 beds for every single minor in Ireland with a psychiatric need.<\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks we have seen the failure of the system to deal with the demands being placed on it and, last week, RT&Eacute; exposed the serious gaps in our child and adolescent mental health service, in a special programme \"Young and Troubled\" which focused on children and mental health services for the young.  The stories were heartbreaking but for many families these experiences are all too familiar as the standard of care children receive can depend on where they live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200040#SS00400","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1525275300,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy James Browne for bringing forward this Bill in the area of mental health, which is so important to so many of us.  The whole service for mental health is simply not being delivered, despite the funding that has been put into it, and a number of speakers have illustrated this quite eloquently.<\/p><p>I recently debated a Topical Issues matter with the Minister related to the Kildare North service, where, as recently as last Christmas, a man with mental health issues showed up and was told to go away as the service could do nothing for him.  Prior to that, a child on suicide watch who had been allowed to move from A to B without supervision went missing for over five days on two occasions.  There are many examples of where services are not in place.  When I met the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, last July, I told him about a good service in operation in Celbridge known as the Abbey Community Project.  It is a voluntary organisation with qualified, trained counsellors and psychiatrists that has been operating for ten years and deals with people with a dual diagnosis.  The Minister said this model should be developed.  For the past two years I have been dealing with the HSE, the Department of Health and the task force on the provision of funding for this organisation, but it has not received one cent.  It operates on bucket collections.  When its public liability insurance policy was due for renewal recently, everyone involved had to put in a few quid to pay for it.  That is not balanced mental health services provision.  The Abbey Community Project in Celbridge services much of north Kildare and has in excess of 90 cases.  It receives referrals from the HSE, but it gets no State funding.  The Minister said this model should be developed and supported, but for two years this organisation has not received one cent in funding.  No one is giving it any support, good, bad or indifferent.  How long can a voluntary organisation that is providing a service that is not being provided by the State continue to exist without support?  It is shocking.  The people reporting with mental health issues have nowhere to go.  If we are to get real, we need to deliver.  We need to put funding into the right services.  Let us stop talking and provide the services needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200040#SS00500","speaker":"1324","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525275900,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Ensuring access to appropriate treatment for people with mental health needs is a major policy concern.  The public health system is in crisis.  Ireland's youth suicide rate is now the fourth highest in Europe.  The inner workings of the HSE remain a mystery, with no accountability offered.  The Bill places a duty on the Minister for Health to promote health parity and ensure all organisations within the health system meet parity obligations in mental health care.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out that there are amazing health professionals who are committed to helping, treating and comforting the most vulnerable in our society.  Sadly, the system is failing both their efforts and the requirements of those whom they treat on a daily basis.  We have all heard the accounts of those in suicidal crisis turning up at emergency departments only to be sent home, with a vague hope of receiving an appointment to see a mental health professional in the near future or, worse, with medication which could well become a drastic means to an end in the absence of specialist intervention.  This cannot continue indefinitely.  With due respect, no number of special Government committees can stem the steady tide of those who lose the will to live while waiting for a solution.  <\/p>  <p>  Services are way behind where they should be.  The Government is simply not investing enough in them or supporting resources, as illustrated in the RT&Eacute; \"Prime Time Investigates\" review of waiting times for adolescents who seek emergency help.  The stories were heartbreaking.  Sadly, many of us are hearing from people every day who find themselves in similar situations.  There are those who cannot or simply will not speak out about their experiences.  <\/p>  <p>  There are also serious deficiencies in children's mental health services.  I have spoken many times in the House about the Child and Adult Mental Health Service, CAMHS, in the north west.  I thank Ms Teresa Dykes and her staff for the work they do.  There is no question but that this service has improved and that its waiting lists are getting shorter.  <\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il recently has received data which show that at the end of January, there were 6,181 children waiting for a primary care psychology appointment, over one quarter of whom had been waiting more than one year, which is not good enough.  If we want to help vulnerable children and young people in need of essential mental health services, the Government needs to take a lot more action.  The State and the HSE have a duty to do better.  It is crucial that every person be treated with dignity, fairness and respect, regardless of their mental health status.  <\/p>  <p>  In regard to people who present at doctors' surgeries, what we need is a 24-hour helpline through which GPs can access advice from mental health consultants because they do not know where to turn when families present with a young child with suicidal tendencies and so on.  Such a helpline would be of valuable assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200041#TT00200","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1525275900,"counter":479,"content":"<p>On behalf the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and the Government, I thank Members for their contributions to this wide-ranging debate.  This is an important debate which addresses our common desire to ensure the mental health service meets the highest international standards.  There is no doubt that the subject of mental health, in all its aspects, rightly concerns all parties and Independent Deputies represented in the House.  As such, when the particular mental health topic is legislation, it is only right and proper that all Members of the House be afforded the opportunity to have their say on how we should proceed in ensuring best practice in legislating in the area. <\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy James Browne for introducing the Bill.  The area of mental health is one of the priorities of the Government and the Deputy&rsquo;s ongoing work serves as a strong reminder that all stakeholders in the area want to ensure the issues are debated regularly.  This point has been well made and is accepted on this side of the House.  As alluded to by the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, there is extensive work under way in the Department of Health on far-reaching changes to mental health legislation, both in the short and medium term.  This involves continuing work on the general scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act 2001 on the basis of the comprehensive recommendations of the expert review group, as well as Private Members' Bills focusing on mental health.  In addition, there is also a process under way to refresh A Vision for Change, the national mental health policy.  The oversight committee responsible for this refresh is making significant progress and it is intended that it will have completed its work by the end of the year.  We are also closely following the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health which is working to achieve cross-party agreement on the implementation of a single, long-term vision for mental health care and the direction of mental health policy in Ireland.  We await with interest the publication of the committee&rsquo;s final recommendations.  <\/p>  <p>  Additional funding in the order of approximately &euro;200 million between 2012 and 2017 supported modernisation of mental health services in line with A Vision for Change and previous programme for Government commitments.  A key focus has been the provision of additional posts to strengthen community mental health teams for adults and children.  It has also been used to enhance specialist community mental health and forensic services, to increase access to counselling and psychotherapy and for suicide prevention initiatives.  The Government is committed to continuing this trend of increased funding in the area as economic conditions allow.  <\/p>  <p>  The objective of placing physical and mental health on a par in legislation which is the stated aim of Deputy James Browne's Bill must be carefully considered to avoid unintended and undesired consequences.  Without doubt, this poses challenges.  Significant consultation will be necessary with all relevant stakeholders to ensure any new or amended health legislation will be effective in improving outcomes for citizens.  In that regard, we should also investigate the experience in other jurisdictions in developing similar initiatives and learn lessons appropriate to our unique circumstances.  We always need to be mindful of improvements in the way we attend to the mental health and welfare of citizens and amend or expand our legislation, as necessary.  We also need to ensure that when the changes are made, they are the right changes and will have the intended effect.  Most important, we need services to be accessible and without stigma.  We need to encourage people to engage with services at the earliest opportunity and ensure the mental health service is attractive to those we want to work in it.  We all accept that the service can and should improve, but in levelling unjustified criticisms we risk discouraging people who need those services from using them and those interested in working in services from applying for the many posts available.<\/p><p>As I said, we already have several pieces of legislation relating to mental health currently under consideration, each of which is at a different stage of progression.  When enacted we will monitor the beneficial effects of these legislative changes on the full landscape of mental health services provision and will be mindful of how this affects further proposed legislation in this area including this Bill.<\/p> <p> I assure the House that the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, and the Department of Health will review all the comments made this evening in the context of Deputy James Browne's Bill.  These comments will be borne in mind as work progresses on our mental health legislation objectives and the delivery of health and personal social services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200041#TT00300","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525276500,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy James Browne on this Bill and on his huge efforts during the run-in to last year's budget to ensure a proper multiannual framework for budgeting.  All of the work the Minister of State has spoken about with regard to legislation is coming from this side of the House, from the Opposition.  The priority the Opposition has given, collectively, to pursuing mental health legislation and funding places in a very poor light the long-fingering we have seen again in the Minister of State's statement.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation such as Deputy Browne's Bill can only do so much.  Ireland needs a complete change of culture and attitude.  Can one imagine running emergency departments on a Monday to Friday nine-to-five basis?  It would not be allowed to happen.  This is, however, what we are doing with our emergency mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  We also need a change in the culture among our general population.  One of the biggest examples of a culture change in environmental awareness, for example, has been the green flag programme in schools.  Children at national school level have led the change - and the change in tone - around how we treat our environment in each household.  I would like to see a similar programme introduced around mental health awareness at primary school level to equip teachers with the resources and the skills they need to be alert to the mental health of their pupils and to encourage children from an early age to talk about mental health in the same way we talk about physical health.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation can be put in place, the resources can be put in place, but we also need a change of culture so we treat mental illness in the same way we treat physical illness.  When physical illness hits a family the meitheal goes around the family with the chain of supports.  There are, however, often cases where the support does come around when it involves mental health and people tend to stand back.  This could change with programmes such as a school programme.<\/p>  <p>  The culture within Government also needs to change completely.  The organisations that work in the area of mental health should be given the same priority in government and by the Government as this Opposition has given to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200042#UU00200","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1525276500,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Deirtear sa seanfhocal &quot;is fearr an tsl&aacute;inte n&aacute; na t&aacute;inte&quot; - your health is your wealth - but I have found that it is fast becoming &quot;Your mental health is your wealth&quot;.

A physically ill patient would not be held in prison-like circumstances while waiting on a bed, so this should not happen to a person who has a mental illness.

I commend the Bill.<\/p><p>From the figures we can see the reduction in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and a reduction in the availability of services.

Time and again persons with mental health difficulties are sidelined and made to feel that their plight comes secondary to those with physical health issues.<\/p>  <p>  It is both sad and embarrassing to have to admit that the real gravity of the mental health situation in Ireland is unknown because we are only aware of those suffering once they take the brave step to seek help.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to introduce parity of esteem.  This needs to be the new phrase when speaking about mental health.  All aspects of health have to be addressed on an equal footing.  Mental health should not be referred to as though it is a separate sector.  For too long mental health organisations have been surviving on the remnants of the health budget once every other sector of the health service has been funded.  This does not help waiting lists, which are currently unacceptable.  Pieta House will host its tenth Darkness into Light event in ten days' time.  More than 200,000 people will walk side by side in their communities to raise money to fund its brilliant services.<\/p>  <p>  People understand the necessity to have mental health normalised and treated as the serious health issue it is.  Many of the amazing facilities, of which we are all aware, receive no funding from Government.  There is a fantastic facility in West Cork called Lisheens House.  I shall attend a meeting there tomorrow evening to discuss issues around rural isolation.  The staff there have said that lack of knowledge is the biggest barrier for them.  They are currently providing question, persuade and refer, QPR, training to 40 people.  In addition, they have eight counsellors providing counselling in six locations in Cork and they have a helpline that is getting busier by the day.  This service is all financed by local fundraising.  They do not have money to advertise and the service relies on word of mouth.  How can this be acceptable in the 21st century?<\/p>  <p>  We need to bring Ireland into line with international best standards and this Bill is a huge step in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200042#UU00600","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1525276500,"counter":486,"content":"<p>The mental health area has suffered systemic neglect and lack of resources.  If anybody is in any doubt about this they only need to see RT&Eacute;'s \"The Big Picture\" from last week.  It is, unfortunately, truly reflective of what so many parents and patients throughout the State are experiencing with mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  The numbers are reflected in the percentage of funding that is spent on mental health out of the overall health spend.  It is currently barely over 6%.  A Vision for Change provides that it should be 8.4%.  Sl&aacute;intecare has said it should be 10%.  The World Health Organization, WHO, recommends that the spend should be 12%.  The confidence and supply agreement inserted a requirement that A Vision for Change would be funded over the lifetime of the Government.  This was reflected in a proposed &euro;35.4 million per year over each of five years.  In budget 2017, however, when the &euro;35 million was announced we found out subsequently that only &euro;15 million could be spent in the following year.  How this adds up is beyond me.<\/p>  <p>  We were then given an undertaking that in budget 2018 the baseline would include the original &euro;35 million and an additional &euro;35 million would be added.  After the 2018 budget we discovered that this also was not the case.  For budget 2019 we have had to get a signed undertaking that &euro;55.4 million would, in fact, be available and that we could finally commence a multiannual budget.  It is expected that this money will be there this year.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that this shortchange was led by the Department of Health and one wonders if any of the funding would be available today without the confidence and supply agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The WHO's definition of mental health was referred to.  Why is this definition not included in Ireland's equality and employment legislation?  Why has the legislation not been updated to include the definition if it is being relied upon by the Department of Health?  Where is the Bill to implement the expert group review of the Mental Health Act 2001?<\/p><p>Only one out of 165 recommendations has been implemented to date.  Where is the Bill to give powers to the Mental Health Commission so that it can have powers equal to those of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to investigate 24 hour residential community care centres?  Why was the role of the director of mental health removed by the HSE this year?  Why has the number of referrals seen by child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, dropped by more than 2,000, from just over 12,000 to just over 10,000?  All of this reflects the fact that mental health simply is not being given a priority in the Department of Health.  That was the catalyst to bringing forward this Bill.  This Bill mimics and reflects similar legislation in the UK.  There is little or no reason for the Government not to be able to enforce this legislation.  The Minister of State seemed to imply there would be some sort of difficulty in doing so.  It was flagged several months ago with the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and it is a pity that he is not here to hear the closing speeches.  It was flagged with him several months ago so it was no surprise that this Bill was coming forward.<\/p> <p> I believe that the lack of parity for mental health is partly due to a deep-seated cultural issue at policy, institutional and organisational levels and at individual levels at the height of the Department of Health.  It is seen as something other and something lesser within the Department and it is not given the priority that it deserves.  The previous Fianna F&aacute;il Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2017 that came through the Houses is now on Final Stage in the Seanad, having worked its entire way through the D&aacute;il.  I expect it will pass all Stages in the Oireachtas within the next two months.  I intend to pursue this Bill with the same drive that that Bill was pursued and I will not let it rest there.

Irish public bodies, as we know, is an umbrella movement loosely representing all local authorities and operations of local government.  It took some time for the Minister to accede to the request to have a separate mention for local authority members.  It rings hollow because local authority members and local government have been decimated by the previous Government with all the attacks on and the banishment of local authorities as we knew them.  In my county, there were five or six of them.  It has happened to town, urban and district councils such as the borough council for Clonmel which used to be and may still be the biggest inland town in the country.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to hold a plebiscite to see if they could be reinstated, if the public wanted them, on a no-cost basis.  I have not heard a word about it since the Minister closed the books that evening, almost two years ago now.  There has not been a mention.<\/p>  <p>  The acceptance by the Minister of this amendment to the Bill is certainly welcome because in the times when I was a member of the local authority, I did not feel that Irish public bodies was that caring and nurturing of local authority members.  One could get lost in the system and the whole cumbersome nature of IPB and its dealings with Government, Ministers and officialdom at a national level.  It was a national organisation, as we all know, but sometimes it did not represent its members.<\/p>  <p>  It is important for any legislation to address any person who is elected to a local authority.  Local authorities are now nearly a third of a D&aacute;il constituency.<\/p><p>They deserve to have their place rightly recognised but they have been stripped of most of their powers.  They are nothing like they used to be.  They were tighter districts before the amalgamation and everything else.  That was certainly the case in Tipperary.  As I stated, the councils are now nearly a third the size of constituencies.  There are two towns in my local borough district: Cahir and Clonmel.  There is a huge difference between them.  Clonmel is a town of 20,000 people, while Cahir only has a population of 4,000.  They each have different services and expectations of members.  The Minister is making faces at me as if to say that I am rambling but I am not.  Local authority members must be respected.  They have been overloaded with huge districts, a lack of recognition and a lack of respect by many officials in many counties.  A workshop is held behind closed doors before every meeting members attend to discuss matters.  The manager must get what he or she wants and any member who does not agree with that will feel the brunt of it.  Representation is very difficult.  That is not what democracy is about.  We must have respect for those put themselves forward and get elected.  Many notable men and women served as councillors long before we were around.  It was not about remuneration but, rather, public service.<\/p> <p> Fine Gael disbanded town councils.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to borough district councils.  Many local authority members would like to go back and serve on the districts which were previously in place.  They would do so without remuneration but, rather, just for the sake of having some say and coherence in the overall planning, running, maintenance and image of their town and district.  A borough used to be only the town and its immediate environs, and its boundaries would extend less than a mile outside the town.   Boroughs now extend 30 miles one way and 25 miles the other way.  The images of many towns, and the towns themselves, have been completely diminished and they are suffering badly as a result.<\/p> <p> I welcome that on this Stage the Minister accepts that local authority members will be specifically mentioned in the Bill.

It is very important and addresses a variety of anti-corruption measures on national and international levels.  The legislation is necessary to aid in the elimination of white collar crime.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise a matter that I have previously brought to the attention of the Minister.  A constituent of mine from Skibbereen, County Cork, leased a mountain-top site in Dunmanway from Coillte, a State agency, in 1990 for the purpose of developing a wireless telecommunication system for west Cork and beyond.  It was one of the most valuable sites in the area in terms of mobile telecommunication.  However, the arrival of Esat Digifone and O2 to surrounding sites resulted in the matter ending up in the Circuit Court in July 2005, 15 years into a 25 year lease.  The case is relevant to section 7 of the Bill, which deals with corruption in regard to office, employment, position or business.  There were several court hearings on the matter and it is alleged that no registrar was present to swear in a witness, which is required by law under the Courts of Justice Act 1924.  In spite of that, my constituent's case was heard and judgment found against him.  The Cork Circuit Court office has since stated that a registrar was present but it was unable to provide any names or proof of claimed expenses by that registrar on the day in question.  My constituent was denied his right to appeal because there was no registrar in court to record the content of the judge's findings on the day.  As no registrar was present, the end result is that all Circuit Court appearances in the case are unconstitutional, null and void.  This ongoing nightmare destroyed the man's business ambitions and family and the stress he suffered has contributed to the deterioration of his health.  No one in the Courts Service has done anything to assist him after 20 years of presenting his case to the best of his honest ability.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to again ask the Minister if the Bill will provide any assistance to my constituent.  When implemented, will the legislation allow him to appeal his case and have it re-examined as a result of the corrupt court proceedings?  Will that man and many others like him receive justice for the white collar crime of which they have been the victim?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200044#WW00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1525277700,"counter":503,"content":"<p>We are dealing with amendment No. 1, which proposes the inclusion of a member of a local authority in subsection (j) of section 2.

I cannot remember the exact terminology used by the Minister but it sounded like he accepted it in desperation because he is afraid the confidence and supply pipe could erupt at any time.  Ministers are four days away from the two-year mark and will be entitled to Government pensions and everything else on 6 May.  Anything could happen next week.

Each of the amendments seeks to do the same thing to each subsection in which the forfeiture penalty appears.  On Committee Stage I flagged that I might need to bring forward such an amendment.  Members will be aware that under section 27(1) there are four penalty options for a court where a person is found guilty of the offence of trading in influence.  The penalties are a fine, a term of imprisonment, the forfeiture of a gift, consideration or an advantage and a combination of one or more of these penalties.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 2 is to section 17(1)(iii) which provides for the forfeiture penalty.  The subsection states a court may order the forfeiture of any gift, consideration or advantage offered, given or agreed to be given, accepted, obtained or agreed to be accepted.  Advice on the section has outlined that this provision, as worded, may be difficult to enforce.  Ordering somebody to forfeit something he or she has already given to another person is not possible.  The same applies to gifts, etc. agreed to be given or accepted.  There is no guarantee that there is actually such a gift or that the person convicted has it in order to allow it to be forfeited.  Amendments Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, follow in the same vein in the penalties for other offences under the Bill.<\/p><p>Essentially, what we are doing is ensuring a court may only order the forfeiture of a gift, an advantage or a consideration that the person being convicted actually holds.  The amendments are technical in nature and I ask Deputies to give favourable consideration to the points mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200045#XX00100","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1525278300,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I will support the amendments.  If a person receives a gift, a consideration or an advantage in return for an act of corruption, one of the penalties should be that that gift, consideration or advantage be seized.  However, the way the legislation was drafted initially indicated that the gift could be seized if it had been offered or there had been an agreement to give it.  In that situation, as the Minister said, the gift might not have been given.  Therefore, if somebody was to offer to give somebody a sum of money and the money was not paid, it would be extremely difficult to seize the money from the individual since he or she had not received it.  It makes much more sense to change the wording to \"a gift, consideration or advantage which has been accepted or obtained\".  It introduces less ambiguity into the penalty section in section 17.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200045#XX00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1525278300,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I, too, support the amendment on the following grounds.  I was to speak about something that hurt me greatly.  The Minister will know that some of the finest people who ever served in local government were local councillors in terms of their dedication and commitment of time.  He will also know that until 1999, there was no such thing as remuneration for being a county councillor; they were paid expenses.  The late Danny Kissane - God be good to him - was a fine councillor for Fine Gael on Kerry County Council and I admired him a great deal.  He reliably informed me that for the 12 months of 1981 the remuneration he had received for attending all his meetings and all of the time he had given to local government was &pound;220.  The point I am making is that we had respectable people like the late Danny Kissane and others from all parties - Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, Fine Gael and others - as well as Independents.  They were extremely dedicated to what I call their profession.  They might have been small farmers, had a small shop or other job, but they were serving their communities.  What hurt me badly - the Minister knows this as well as I do - was that as a result of the actions of a very small number of people, we had tribunals looking into payments made to politicians and so on.  I do not want to brand places, but some of the cases happened to be in Dublin city.  They gave what I would call highly respectable people a bad name.  They also gave politics a bad name.  However, people like the man I named were extremely dedicated and gave a lifetime to politics for no remuneration whatsoever.<\/p>  <p>  Speaking to the Bill-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200045#XX00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1525278300,"counter":528,"content":"<p>Will the Deputy, please, speak to the amendment?

This amendment is about the forfeiture of goods or gifts received and I have to outline my reason for supporting it.  In the past that type of activity sullied and gave a bad name to respectable people who were serving their communities.  They worked very hard to bring group water and local road improvement schemes to their areas.  They tried to develop county development plans and local regional area plans and did all of the donkey work that had to be done in each area which, to this day, is being carried on by the highly respectable members not just in Kerry County Council but all other local authorities throughout the country.  It is only right to recognise their work.  It is important to acknowledge the time they gave and the work they did in their local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  I support the Minister's amendment because anything that will squeeze out that nonsense and those who blackguard the system is to be welcomed.  At times, politicians got a bad name and it was due to the activities of a very small number of people.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as a person steeped in local, national and European politics for many years, knows that being a politician can be a tough job at times. but we do it because we like it.  However, we certainly do not like it when the idea of being a politician is sullied because of the activities of a very small number of people who lose track of what they are supposed to be doing and do things they are not supposed to do.

The Minister might think this is semantics and that I am playing with language and grammar, on which Teachta Jim O'Callaghan advised me a while ago, but it is very important that the wording be as tight and also as loose as possible to incorporate all of the aforesaid activities.  On a few occasions it was certainly put in my way that if I were to do such a thing, I would be looked after.  We have to stamp out that activity completely.  There is no place for it in any modern democracy.  The amendment is, therefore, necessary.  I know that the legal advice was to change the longer wording to \"accepted or obtained\", but the problem with the high fliers involved in white collar crime or crime of this nature is they have the resources and the wherewithal to wheel in Deputy Jim O'Callaghan or one of his colleagues and send him to the building by the river where the matter can be held up forever.<\/p><p>We saw what happened with the collapse of the economy, the banking inquiry and the court cases and the way they collapsed.  This needs to be very tight and very stringent, with no tolerance for it.  As Deputy Michael Healy Rae said, it was only c&uacute;pla daoine, a small number of people who tarnished the reputation of the whole.  It is fairly widespread in our economy and our country.  The examples have been given here, including the scandal that we are dealing with at the moment.  It is not corruption <i>per se<\/i>but it is a form of it in that there is no accountability.  I just watched the &quot;Six One News&quot; and heard a certain gentleman refuse point blank to consider stepping aside when people have died.  Many people have died and more people face death sentences.  Why would corruption not be out there and be practised when people see that kind of disdain for democracy?  We were here last week demanding that a Minister resign because he spoke to someone on the telephone but there is no demand for the resignation of the Minister who is championing and presiding over this horrible debacle involving cruelty and the suffering of so many women and their families, not to mention the dead women and their children and families.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle might think I am straying from the matter before us but I am not.  This is all giving the impression that certain people in the Government are untouchable and we have no way of getting them to resign.  I called twice last night and twice today for the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to resign.  He is in charge and the buck must stop somewhere.  It stops with him at Government level and with the CEO of the HSE.  They have to resign because it is just not good enough.  In the context of this Bill, what kind of message are we sending to young people?  Surely there must be some follow through, some bit of accountability and some engagement with the democratic process.  If things like this happen, there must be accountability.  <br\/><br\/>I have dealt with a lot of families who have been in terrible turmoil.  Only yesterday a family received no protection from the courts and their house was repossessed by the law agents of this State, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on behalf of KBC bank.  Deputies Michael Healy Rae and Michael Collins and myself made representations that to bank six weeks ago but have not even had the dignity of an acknowledgement from the CEO who we requested to meet peacefully.  We wrote several letters to that bank.  When one compares one with the other, we need a lot of the words in this amendment, including &quot;accepted or obtained&quot;.  A lot of things were accepted and a lot of things were obtained during the so-called boom that destroyed our country.  One thinks of the greed, giving, taking, obtaining, bullying, misuse and abuse of people.  <br\/><br\/>In the final analysis, the right to homes Bill that we tried to bring in here did not get through and that is important in the context of what we are talking about with this subject.  It is a murky subject.  A former colleague and former Member of this House served time in prison on a charge of blackmail.  He served his time and suffered the penalties of the law and had redress to court.  It is important that it be for everyone.  We cannot victimise politicians or others; it must be for everyone, without fear or favour.  We cannot allow squeaky lines or, as with the banking inquiry, the shredding of files, of which the Minister is aware.  Necessary files were shredded in the DPP's office in the middle of court cases and the cases collapsed.  That is widely known but it is okay because they are the elite, for whom we are all paying.  Our children, our children's children and our grandchildren's children will be paying back the debts to our so-called friends in Europe and the IMF.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200045#XX00900","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525278900,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to stick to the amendments under consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200046#YY00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1525278900,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I am sticking to the amendments.

Deputies will recall that in the course of the Committee Stage debate I stated that a further technical amendment to the 1994 Act might be necessary and here it is.  The new section 23, paragraph (a) amends the definition of realisable property in the 1994 Act.  That definition relates to property that is suspected to be linked to criminal activity.  Realisable property under the Act can be frozen in contemplation of criminal proceedings.  This would be the case so as to ensure that the person who holds the property is stopped from disposing of same until the conclusion of those criminal proceedings.  This is done in anticipation of a confiscation order which, of course, would have the effect of depriving an individual of the benefit of any such property.  That can be ordered once a conviction is secured.  In light of advice received from the Office of the Attorney General and following extensive consideration, it is proposed to exclude any property that is forfeited under section 17 of the Bill from the definition of realisable property because forfeiture under section 17 is part of a criminal penalty and should be excluded from the civil freezing regime under the 1994 Act, as per paragraph (a).  Paragraph (b) seeks to achieve a similar aim in that the property which is ordered to be forfeited under section 17 cannot be used in satisfaction of a confiscation order under the 1994 Act.  Paragraph (c) is merely a restatement of an amendment which we already agreed on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>I ask the Deputies for their indulgence and support of this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200046#YY01400","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1525278900,"counter":548,"content":"<p>It would be very neglectful of us in discussing this not to acknowledge and recognise the work that has been done by CAB for many years.  If my memory serves me correctly, the Government of the day which was led by Fine Gael introduced legislation following the death of the journalist, Ms Veronica Guerin.  Politicians at that time, both in government and in opposition, came together and passed the necessary urgent legislation which dealt with people who were involved in organised criminal gangs at that time who thought they could do whatever they liked and that they were above the laws of this State.<\/p><p>They were running roughshod over the country at the time.  They were laughing in the face of justice.<br\/><br\/>During the discussion on this amendment, it is right and important to recognise a group of people who are working in a very stressful situation.  I refer to the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who work in the Criminal Assets Bureau and do our State a great service.  They have to take over properties and possessions that have been deemed to be gained on foot of acts of criminality, including theft and corruption.  The bureau resulted from urgent emergency legislation that was put together by the politicians of the time to give members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the extra powers they needed.  They have done sterling work for our country and our communities.<br\/><br\/>In recognising what happened at that time, I would like to mention the late Veronica Guerin and other people who were threatened and intimidated.  I know some of them concentrated on this issue more than others.  Virtually every week, the <i>Sunday World<\/i>is to the fore in the campaign against organised crime.  I compliment the journalists in various newspapers who have worked in this field in the past and who are working in it at present.  They are subject to a lot of worry at times just for doing their jobs.  To be honest, we would not know about much of what goes on in this country only for the good work of journalists who dig deep to expose the criminal actions of people who are involved in highly organised crime.  Some of those people have left this country to go to Spain and other parts of the world to enjoy their ill-gotten gains.  Their actions have been brought to the attention of the public by journalists who are following in the footsteps of the late Veronica Guerin.<br\/><br\/>During our debate on what the Minister is proposing in respect of section 17, it is right and proper for us not only to express our support for this proposal but also to recognise the work of the Garda and the Criminal Assets Bureau.

The penalty should fit the crime.  It is a different story for parents whose children are being born today at a time when drugs are available around our country.  As they bring up their children, they have to face the scourge of drugs that are readily available in our towns and, in some cases, although I do not wish to name any places, in our villages.  It has gone down to that.  If we can break down these devils and demons by confiscating their property, that is to be applauded and supported.  Given that it is necessary to provide social housing to people who do not have a roof over their heads and may never be able to put a roof over their heads, I suggest that buildings which are confiscated under this legislation should be turned over to local authorities for use as social housing.  That would penalise individuals who are involved in criminality while at the same time helping people who need social housing.

The 1994 Act and other Acts were badly needed to keep up with the activities of well-organised and highly trained criminals who had resources oozing out of them and had overseas links on several countries and continents.  Like the previous speakers, I praise the brave officers who put their lives at risk when the Criminal Assets Bureau was set up.  They did this to try to have some impact on guys who were dancing around the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the courts, who knew the law as well as Deputy O'Callaghan knows it and who had lawyers at their disposal to find loopholes and to challenge every court from the Circuit Court to the High Court and the Supreme Court.  We even set up a new court system to deal with them.  I salute the brave members of the Judiciary who had to sit in those courts.  As we know, there had to be non-jury trials during times of war for good reason.  These trials were not easy because of the intimidation that went on and the fear factor that existed.  Garda&iacute; were followed to their homes by people who wanted to know where their families lived.  All of this was very subtle, but it was not very nice.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and his officials that I consider the proposed new section to be highly commendable.  It is supported by the Opposition party with which the Government has a confidence and supply agreement and by other Members as well.  Subsection (a) provides for realisable property to be frozen in criminal proceedings to be procured and disposed of after a conviction has been secured.  Of course the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven has to be a flagship in any debate on these issues.  It must be recognised and acknowledged.<\/p>  <p>  We are talking about experienced and dangerous criminals who have significant resources, money and networks.  It is frightening that a few people who are controlling the drugs situation in towns in my constituency of Tipperary are using children as young as eight years of age to do their drug runs.  Property must be seized.  This amendment will give the tools of the trade to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the justice system so that these assets can be frozen until the appropriate time comes.  We saw a notable case on the television at an early stage.  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae mentioned a brave journalist, Veronica Guerin.  Many other brave journalists write about these issues.  I must compliment those involved with \"Prime Time Investigates\" as well for their bravery.  These people do not like to be messed with or to have questions asked of them.  They do not like to be knocked off their perch in any way.  They want free rein.  They want to be able to do what they wish with who they wish.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and his predecessor have met a group in Tipperary that is trying to save local communities that are close to where people get on and come off motorways.  The road network allows criminals to be in Tipperary in an hour and a half from the capital or wherever else.  It is a question of high visibility.  I know the Minister is making an effort to give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na more powerful vehicles and air support, etc.  It is needed because our police officers are brave.  Goodness knows they have been dragged into disrepute over so many inquiries, whistleblowers and God knows what.  Such matters have to be dealt with too.  We must never forget the ordinary men and women who are on the beat as garda&iacute;.  We must remember our very good detectives as well.  As I always say, they cannot do anything without the support of the public.  It is very important for the public to support them.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this amendment.<\/p><p>It deals with the freezing of assets and the sending of the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions to back up the charges when people are arrested and arraigned.  The charges must then be proved and an eminent justice must sign it.  These people would have very valuable assets in many cases.  Some garda&iacute; have shown me the pictures and videos after they visited some of those people and the homes were palatial.  All of it came from the proceeds of misery visited on ordinary people, including torture, intimidation and abuse.  These are crimes against a person, which should be the worst of all.  I know there are many Acts on the Statute Book to deal with crimes against a person but we had to get real.  This is getting real.<\/p> <p> When the Bill leaves the House tonight, how long will it take before its provisions are implemented?  Will there be some kind of assessment?  Many pieces of legislation are passed here and there are never impact assessments of the ones we oppose.  There should certainly be examination of how legislation beds in, whether it functions and if there are unintended consequences.  I hope there will not be any but there should be tracking of loopholes that might be challenged in the courts.  There should be a period for settling in before coming back to matters like this.  We are down to semantics, grammar and words.  An order can be frozen while the conviction is being processed through all stages of the courts, and if there is a conviction, the property may be seized, secured and sold.<\/p> <p> The purchaser should not be intimidated, as that is also a major issue.  There may be subtle messages that people should keep away or the property is a no-go area, so we must deal with such a practice as well.  It is a sensitive, tricky and cagey business so we must be twice as cagey as those people.  They get up early in the morning because they do not go to bed at night.  When the ordinary working man tries to rest, they are prowling on the streets of towns and elsewhere, seeing who they can prey on next.  The busy person pays taxes and works, whether as a working man or business man.

Properties were purchased in this respect.  I must be careful how I describe these activities because I do not want to name particular cases.  Activities were undertaken by officials in other countries who knew the funds involved were ill-gotten gains but they chose to turn a blind eye to that.  It was a wrong-doing in itself but it could not be punished by this State in any way.  There was no possible downside for the people involved because we had no jurisdiction in the matters.  This is catering for that \"loophole\" of such cases that occurred in the past.  People using funds in the way they did in those specific cases has resulted in the Minister's proposal this evening, and I hope this goes a long way to ensuring such activity does not happen again.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the Minister heard of, or did some fettering of an animal in the past, and this is the same type of thing.  The Minister will fetter criminals, not by tying their hands or legs but rather by ensuring they are not free as they have been in the past.  To be honest, the criminals were beating the system here and abroad.  They had the best of legal people whom they could hire and they could get the best advice on how to use ill-gotten goods to buy properties and invest in businesses, as many of them did abroad.  They were involved in different types of hotels and bars in warmer climates than here.  In that way, they were able to launder their ill-gotten gains.  They could take it from here and buy a business over there, so the money they made over there appeared to be legitimate.  Officials working abroad were part and parcel of that system.<\/p>  <p>  I could compare that system to some of the activity going on here now that we have discussed in this Chamber on other nights relating to very questionable insurance claims.  The system existed between professional people here and professional people abroad who used the money.  This amendment puts the squeeze on and ensures such a practice cannot happen in future.  Money is no good to these people unless they can use it.  Their ill-gotten gains are no use unless it can be laundered.  They are doing it by buying property and especially businesses, including rental properties or restaurants and similar activity.  In the 1980s and 1990s such people bought club venues here, particularly in Dublin, in order to legitimise their money.  I compliment the Revenue Commissioners on their efforts to put a squeeze on the ill-gotten gains of crime.  They did their job and should be complimented on that.  Some people paid a very high price as they were terrorised by criminals who targeted them for only doing their job.  When the heat got too much for these criminals in Dublin and around the country, they decided to take their money abroad, and that is why what is being discussed by the Minister is so important.  If it makes it easier to punish people assisting that type of illegal activity outside the country, it is to be welcomed.  That is why I support the Minister's statement.  I thank him and his officials for the amendment.<\/p>  <p>  It has taken much work to pull this together as the Department had to account for not just our jurisdiction but others as well.  Much time, consideration and research had to go into the process.  The Minister only has so much time to do what he does.  Much official expertise had to be used in drafting the amendments.  I am sure it was tedious work and it was not easy.<\/p><p>It was not easy for them to do.

I welcome this as well.  I have great respect for the OECD.  We do not listen to it often enough.  It is an independent advisory body.  It has done a series of evaluations.  This is the third report.  There is talk of setting up inquires here.  Given the number of tribunals we have here, it would be better to bring in people from abroad who have no connection.  They would provide independence and clarity.  I put my own hand up.  We might often be too close to issues to be able to see what is wrong.  This is very important.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to criminal conduct and laundering the proceeds.  That happened for a long time in sa tir seo, na h&Eacute;ireann.  They had so much proceeds they had to find useful work for wilful gain.  They could not mention the way that they had got it.  They sent scouts out and linked up with European and then international gangs.  They were able to transfer funds by various means.  Sometimes it was just carried in bags but at other times it was transferred by electronic transfer.  A web of deceit operated by bankers could transfer money from account to account and move it here and there.  Lots of property was bought out of their ill-gotten gains.  I salute the journalists that investigated it.  I also salute the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Interpol and other police forces.  We must always recognise the support of Interpol and other police forces that have to painstakingly follow and untangle this web.  The proceeds of crime must be gotten.<\/p>  <p>  Section 5(1) and section 6(1) in respect of foreign officials are necessary as well.  That was a trick because the powers were not there under our legislation to follow these criminals and follow their tangled web of deceit.  There were no powers to ensure they were monitored, were under covert surveillance and were identified and to ensure a case would be made to lead to arrests and questioning.  The dual offence for crimes that took place abroad is very important.  Otherwise we were going nowhere.<\/p>  <p>  I congratulate the Minister, his drafters and his advisers on this excellent legislation.  We could see the wealth, the villas, the hotels and the palatial mansions on the sunny beaches of other countries.  They had a lovely life of luxury after the misery that their empire perpetrated on the people of Ireland and, indeed, many other countries.  It is important that we support this.  When wrapping up, the Minister might indicate when this will be implemented and when he thinks there might be an evaluation of it.  It is more difficult when it is offshore and off-site because we do not know what continent they have gone to.  We have a massive coastline to patrol, as well as our airports.  We have to cater for all kinds of movements.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this legislation and hope it is introduced speedily and that it will be of benefit.  We should go back to the OECD and ask it to evaluate it again for us.  I know it is not altogether happy with some issues.  I refer to the situation with white collar crime and the issues I spoke about on previous amendments about the banking inquiry.  It is not very happy with some of the investigations and some of the roles of our police force.  The OECD had things to say that we need to learn from.  We need to talk to the OECD.  Perhaps it could help us find a new Garda Commissioner.  Perhaps we need international experience and people who have experience in police forces that have dealt with these issues in the countries they are from.  The OECD is a valuable resource to have and we should listen to it.  We must engage with it and be thankful for the advice it has given, especially in respect of this amendment.  I am glad have accepted it.  We can often become insular and say we know best ourselves.  However, we often do not.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the cold calm eye of an outside body like the OECD and such bodies that are not for profit and are for the betterment of developed countries and countries that are trying to develop.  This is excellent legislation and I support anything we can do to curtail or restrict the salubrious lifestyles of the people who emigrate and tarnish and sully the name of this little nation.  They laugh all the way to the bank, to their villas, to the seaside and to their fine wines because I am reliably informed that some have their own vineyards.  They have a great lifestyle from their ill-gotten gains.  They are into catering, hotels and all kinds of activities as a cover.  It is not work.  They do not work.  They just want to bury and hide the proceeds of crime.  They have a very salubrious lifestyle from a trail of misery and destruction left in our country.  It is important that Interpol and all the other police forces around the world act on advice given by the OECD.  They must work with our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We must try together - in aghaidh cur le ch&eacute;ile - to make a dent and bring down those empires of drug cartels and of deceitfulness.

It is innovative because it seeks to include those two criminal offences as examples of criminal conduct that can allow the operation of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that corruption is an international issue.  If we look at examples of major international corruption, there are countries where one would start and one is not Ireland.  There are countries where one would say that individuals involved in government have been, and are, involved in acts of corruption.

Our money laundering and terrorist financing legislation can be used to freeze moneys that happen to end up in Irish bank accounts if it can be established that those moneys are the proceeds of crime committed under sections 5 and 6 of this legislation.  That is irrespective of whether or not those crimes are crimes in the country where the foreign official comes from.<\/p><p>I believe it is an innovative proposal in this regard.

They were giving us two thumbs up from abroad and doing practically whatever they liked.  They took the view that they were untouchable in certain countries.  I am unsure how far this will extend or whether those in other countries can still evade our laws and operate criminal rackets from afar.<\/p>  <p>  This is important.  There are drugs coming in around our shores.  We must congratulate the Garda on the great work done and for much of the apprehending of people caught bringing drugs.  People are serving time in many cases.  However, the problem remains because of the people who put drivers into lorries or who have people take the drugs or whatever.  The real managers and bosses are still evading conviction in this country because the law was not good enough to deal with them.  I hope this amendment will deal with these people.  It hurts me when I see young people who started out well in life but lost their way because of drugs being readily available.  Perhaps when their defences were down a little they started using drugs.  These monsters or predators enticed such people into what I would call a desperate disease whereby they developed a craving for drugs.  Not alone does it upset the person concerned, it upsets partners, children, fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters.  It brings them to a new kind of low that they thought they would never encounter in their families.  When one person in the family is affected, it affects the rest of the family as well as friends and members of small communities.<\/p>  <p>  I support the amendment.

Any right-thinking Member or person would be supportive of it.  As I said, several enactments are being amended, some of which are rather old.  The criminal justice legislation is only from this year but this Bill is also relevant to section 30 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  I was only doing my leaving certificate in school at that time.  It is important that some of the legislation is updated and upgraded, especially when we are dealing with a situation of international crime gangs and money laundering and all that goes with it.  The Criminal Justice Act 1994 is amended as well.  It is important that we put them all together and have a workable document.  It is important to provide clarity for our police service - the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this case - and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  They need to be able to understand clearly rather than playing hide-and-seek with these marauding terrorists.  They are terrorists.  I know terrorism has been used in a different vein today - something I very much resent, but we will deal with that in the next session.  This is terrorism because people are the victims of all these heinous crimes in their homes.  They are literally terrorised in their homes, businesses and communities, whether they are at work or play.  It is important that we pull together the various strands of the Acts, including the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  That is what it is.  It is important we embrace all those provisions in this legislation.  That is why I support it.  This is relevant for anyone who supports or who speaks against the 2010 Act or this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  We have the tools of the trade, as I said earlier, to put a stop to these people, get them off the road, take the wheels off their wagon and take the wind out of their sails.

Therefore, I will speak to a number of amendments and I trust that is permissible.  I had a brief opportunity to start my contribution on the previous occasion.  I made the point that it has been illegal for a motorist drive a car with a blood alcohol level in excess of the 50 mg limit since 2011.  Despite many positive changes that have been introduced to our road traffic legislation, such as the reduction of the blood alcohol limit, the introduction of penalty points and random breath-testing, the fact remains that, unfortunately, we still have fatalities on our roads.  The point I made on the last occasion and the point I want to make again tonight is that we should be focusing our scarce resources on tackling the area that is the biggest problem.  The only up-to-date figures we have, which are certified and produced by the Road Safety Authority, are from 2008 to 2012.  Of the sizeable number of fatalities in that period, 39 had a blood alcohol level of in excess of 250 mg, 37 had a blood alcohol level of between 201 mg and 250 mg, 25 had a blood alcohol level of between 150 mg and 200 mg and 20 had a blood alcohol level of between 100 mg and 150 mg.  Despite that, this area is not even being considered by the Minister.  He seems to believe, and he reiterates this time and again, that the only real deterrent for people who break an existing law is automatic disqualification.  If automatic disqualification was the deterrent the Minister seems to believe it is, we would not have the fatalities in this category because those people are already liable if caught to be put off the road.  If automatic disqualification was the deterrent the Minister says it is, the figure for 2016 which the Minister gave us on Committee Stage was that 8,063 people were arrested and detected for having alcohol in their blood that was over the limit.  Of that 8,063, 93% were in a category that would deem automatic disqualification.  The point I am making is that if automatic disqualification was such a deterrent we would have fewer people in the category of people who have been disqualified and fewer fatalities in that area.<\/p>  <p>  The real deterrent, and this has been backed up time and again, is the fear of being caught.  Unfortunately, the checks are too sporadic.  During the past number of years, the number of people working in the traffic corps has decreased from full capacity, which was more than 1,000, to approximately 667 now.  There are 444 fewer people working in the traffic corps now than was the case when it was at full capacity.  The real deterrent is for people to be afraid when they look in their wing mirror and see a blue flashing light behind them or for people to be stopped at an automatic check point.  That is not happening now.  During 2016, when a very good Christmas campaign was launched, it resulted in a decrease of 34% in road deaths compared to the same period in 2015 and a decrease of 27% in road deaths compared to the same period in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  I have no sympathy whatsoever for anybody who willingly goes out and breaks the law by drink driving.  However, where I have sympathy, and I believe the Minister's proposal is disproportionate to the offence, is where somebody who takes a taxi, a Nitelink, shares a lift or whatever home, goes to bed, gets up the next morning and may be marginally over the blood alcohol limit of 50 mg.  The Minister is now saying that person did everything right but we will put him or her off the road for three months.  As a result, that person who may be the breadwinner and the only earner in the house will lose his or her job.  I believe that penalty is disproportionate.<\/p>  <p>  In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the blood alcohol limit is 80 mg.  In Ohio and a number of other states in the United States, the blood alcohol limit is 80 mg.  In Canadian provinces and territories, it is 80 mg.  Already, we are below the blood alcohol limit in many other countries.  What we are proposing as a party and what we believe to be fair and proportionate is to increase the penalty points to five and have a &euro;500 fine.  That is fair and proportionate in terms of the penalty.<\/p>  <p>  We have to remember that what we are doing now is being done against a backdrop of Garda breath test figures over which we cannot stand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050200051#DDD02700","speaker":"1250"}]
