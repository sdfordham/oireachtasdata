Central to this approach is the concept of &lsquo;claim and commitment&rsquo;.  Jobseekers have a right to claim an income support from the State but also have a responsibility to commit to engaging with the employment services offered by the State whether those services are provided directly by the Department&rsquo;s own staff or by staff contracted through the Local Employment Services or JobPath and working as agents of the Department.<\/p><p>The concept of rights and responsibilities is reflected in legislation.  The Social Welfare (Consolidated) Act 2005, as amended, specifies that participation in activation meetings is mandatory, therefore jobseekers in receipt of a jobseekers payment are required to engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation services whether, as I have indicated, the service is provided internally by an Intreo case officer or, externally by any of the contracted providers.Therefore once a jobseeker is referred to JobPath, they must engage with the service.  All jobseekers who have been unemployed for more than a year are eligible for selection for the JobPath service and clients are chosen by means of a random selection process. <\/p><p>This is in the best interests of the jobseekers themselves as evidence internationally is that job search assistance and employment counselling is the most effective form of support in terms of improving employment outcomes.

My department works very closely with Vincent de Paul in addressing many issues in relation to vulnerable people, including food poverty.  The Department administers the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD), which provides food and basic consumer products to people most at risk.  My Department&rsquo;s FEAD budget for 2018 is &euro;8m, of which &euro;4.5m will be allocated to ongoing food distribution with the remainder allocation to the distribution of material assistance in the areas of homelessness, school kits and new migrants.   In 2017, though a network of charitable partnership organisations, the Department distributed almost 1,000 tonnes of food to over 80,000 people in communities throughout the country, either in the form of food parcels or as meals prepared by charitable organisation.  In 2017, FEAD assisted 26 St Vincent de Paul conferences or regions through the provision of food from the three FoodCloud Hubs depots in Tallaght, Cork and Galway.  The total value of food collected and distributed by these organisations was in excess of &euro;650k consisting of 205 tonnes across 23 food product ranges available through the FEAD Programme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the School Meals programme provides funding for a breakfast for all children and lunch for up to 90% of children in DEIS schools for the entire school year from September to June.  For the first time in many years, breakfasts are also now available to some schools outside DEIS.  Funding towards school meals is being provided in over 1,580 schools and other organisations, supporting over 248,000 children at a cost of some &euro;54 million in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The primary role of the social welfare income supports provided through my Department is to sustain an adequate standard of living and to prevent poverty, including food poverty.  The Irish social welfare system is, generally, relatively successful in this role.  In 2016, the most recent year for which the relevant data are available, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 33.6 per cent to 16.5 per cent, representing a poverty reduction effect of 51 per cent.  Ireland was the best performing EU member state in this regard, and this reflects the Government commitment to protect core weekly welfare rates during the recession.<\/p>  <p>  The CSO publishes two items from the Survey of Income and Living Conditions relating specifically to the consumption of food. <\/p>  <p>  First, in 2016, 2.3% of the population were &ldquo;unable to afford a meal with meat, chicken or fish every second day&rdquo;.  This was down from 4.2% in 2013, when the effects of the recession were most felt.  <\/p>  <p>  The figure of 2.3% for 2016 was the third lowest among the EU Member States in that year, and compares with an average of 8.6% for the EU overall. <\/p>  <p>  Second, 5.6% of the population were &ldquo;unable to afford a roast once a week&rdquo;.  This is a decrease from the 2013 figure of 8.1%.  No EU data are published for this indicator.<\/p>  <p>  Difficulty in meeting food and other regular ongoing needs may result from a family encountering exceptional once-off expenditures.  In this regard, under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has provided over &euro;36 million for exceptional payments in 2018.   Any persons who consider that they have an entitlement to an exceptional needs payment should contact my Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2017.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, is currently developing a successor plan for the period 2018-2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300046#WRB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300046#WRB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[18664\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300046#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on developing an individual placement and support model of supported employment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>The Government recognises the need for the social protection system to provide flexible and effective supports for persons who encounter mental health difficulties.

Under the IPS model, a person is viewed as capable of undertaking competitive paid employment, if a suitable work setting can be found and appropriate supports provided.   This approach provides a useful addition to the range of employment supports for persons with disabilities provided by my Department.   The Department has recently participated as a partner organisation in the Integrating Employment and Mental Health Service (IEMHS) IPS pilot project, led by the HSE which ran between 2015 and 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  The aim of this project was to demonstrate how the existing HSE and Employability service could practice the IPS model for clients with severe and enduring mental health issues.  <\/p>  <p>An evaluation report, Steps into Work, was published on the 8th   February last and found that through improved cooperation between mental health services and employment support services, improvements could be achieved in the health and employment outcomes of people with mental health difficulties. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is now collaborating with the HSE and the EmployAbility service to extend this pilot programme on a nationwide basis in partnership to enable employment specialists to be put in place across the country. <\/p>  <p>  I look forward to seeing the results of this interagency collaboration specifically in terms of better health and employment outcomes for persons with mental health difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300046#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Levels","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300046#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[16829\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300046#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the discussions her Department has had with other Departments to address the issue of unemployment blackspots; and if there have been specific actions taken to address the fact that eight of the top ten unemployment blackspots are in Limerick city.","asker":"1327","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>Unemployment blackspots are small areas identified in the Census of Population in 2016 as having particularly high levels of joblessness.  In general, they are small residential areas within larger urban areas, with a significant number within the city of Limerick. The approach adopted by my Department is that the services delivered by Intreo are focused on unemployed individuals rather than on areas.  This means, therefore, that those areas where unemployed individuals are most concentrated will also be the areas that receive a greater share of income support payments and activation and employment services.  The focus of those services is to support unemployed people living in, for example, the relevant parts of Limerick to access and prepare for jobs in the wider labour market of the greater Limerick area.  This involves substantial co-operation between my Department and other public authorities, particularly those engaged in education and training under the Department of Education and Skills.   These areas in Limerick will also have benefitted from the general improvement in employment conditions in the Mid-West region where unemployment, as shown in the Labour Force Survey, has fallen from a peak of 16.6% in late 2012 to 6.6% by the end of 2017.  Numbers in employment in the region have increased from 153,700 to 178,500 over the same period.<\/p>  <p>  While data from the Labour Force Survey is not available at the county level, trends in the Live Register can give an indication of underlying trends in local unemployment.  Overall, the Live Register in Limerick has fallen by almost 54% in the 5 years to February 2018, well above the reduction of 44% nationally.  In the year to February 2018, the Live Register in Limerick has fallen by 1,674 people, or 16%, again surpassing the national trend of 13%.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment since 2012 is twofold:<\/p>  <p>  Firstly the Action Plan for Jobs, which is led by my colleague the Minister for Business Enterprise and Innovation,  sets out to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs.  This policy now includes a specific regional Action Plan for the Mid-West Region that has seen over 16,500 jobs created in the region in the last two years.  Successful implementation of this Plan is targeted at the creation of 23,000 extra jobs in the region by 2020.  The Plan aims to achieve this through building on key sectors of potential for the region like Aviation, Lifesciences, Engineering, Internationally Traded Services and Tourism.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, through Pathways to Work, my Department ensures that as many new jobs and vacancies as possible are filled by people taken from the Live Register.  Under this policy, as I have said, employment services and activation supports are heavily concentrated on the areas of highest unemployment, including those in Limerick.<\/p>  <p>  To date, the policies being pursued under the Action Plan for Jobs and under Pathways to Work have been effective in reducing unemployment, both nationally and in Limerick and I am confident that they will continue to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300046#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Offices","counter":21,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300046#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[19259\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300046#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will report on the conclusion of talks between her Department and an organisation (details supplied) dealing specifically with the agreed financial arrangement put in place; her plans to distribute the funds; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":23,"content":"<p>My Department currently has 58 Branch Offices at various locations throughout the country.

The most recent data shows that, nationally, unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15% in 2012 to 6.1% by March 2018.  Within the South East region, which includes Wexford, unemployment has fallen from a peak of 19.0% in 2012 to 7.3% by Quarter 4, 2017 with numbers in employment increasing from 184,700 in Q4 2012 to 226,400 by Q4 2017.While data from the Labour Force Survey is not available at the county level, trends in the Live Register can give an indication of underlying trends in local unemployment.    Overall, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by almost 43% in the 5 years to February 2018, close to the reduction of 44% nationally.  In the year to February 2018, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by 1,625 people, or almost 14%, again closely in line with national trends.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment since 2012 is twofold:<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs.  This policy now includes a specific regional Action Plan for the South East Region that has seen over 8,000 jobs created in the region in the last two years.  By 2020, the Plan aims to facilitate the creation of an additional 25,000 jobs in the region and bring the unemployment rate in the region to within 1% of the national average.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, through Pathways to Work, my Department ensures that as many new jobs and vacancies as possible are filled by people taken from the Live Register.  Under this policy, employment services and activation supports are heavily concentrated on the areas of highest unemployment, including those in Wexford.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, there are 11 Activation Case Officers in the Intreo service in Wexford.  This is an increase of one in comparison to January 2017, when there were 10. Prior to the roll-out of Intreo, there were 8 Activation Case Officers in Wexford, including former FAS personnel and DSP Jobs Facilitators. <\/p>  <p>  The Case Officer capacity is supplemented by referrals to Turas Nua under the Job Path programme and to Wexford Local Development which operates the Local Employment Service (LES) on behalf of the Department.  Wexford Local Development is contracted to provide intensive supports to 960 customers and employs 8 mediators to support LES operations. <\/p>  <p>  A total of 9,114 customer engagements were scheduled by Activation Case Officers in 2017 in addition to their work with employers.  Local records indicate that approximately 5,300 referrals to Turas Nua took place over the course of the year.<\/p>  <p>  To date, the policies being pursued under the Action Plan for Jobs and under Pathways to Work have been effective in reducing unemployment, both nationally and in Wexford and I am confident that they will continue to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300046#WRB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions Reform","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300046#WRB03500"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[19166\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300046#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the State pension rates will be restored to those who left the workforce due to childcare and are now receiving a lower rate of pensions due to previous changes in regard to PRSI contributions in 2012.","asker":"1232","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[19165\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300046#WRB03700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the progress that has been made to address the anomalies in the State pension due to the changes introduced in 2012.","asker":"1232","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 29 together.<\/p>  <p>  A policy to introduce the Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pensions calculation was adopted by the then Government in the National Pensions Framework in 2010, as was the decision to base the entitlements of all new pensioners on this approach from 2020.<\/p>  <p>  On the 23rd January, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated under a total contributions approach, which will include up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring credit.<\/p>  <p>  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.  <\/p>  <p>  In particular it will benefit people whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a full-time caring role.

The Deputy will appreciate that the welcome reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.  Long-term unemployment is expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecasted fall in overall unemployment.     In the context of the economic recovery, my Department undertook a review of the work programmes in 2016.  While the primary focus was on CE, the review also looked at other employment programmes such as T&uacute;s.  <\/p>  <p>  Arising from the review, the Government agreed to implement changes to the qualifying conditions for CE in order to broaden access to a wider range of people.  These new rules were implemented from July 2017.  The qualifying age was reduced to 21 years.  In addition while, in general, all placements will now be for one year only, if a CE participant is undertaking training to achieve a major  award, their time can be extended by up to 2 year to allow them to complete the training which will enhance their overall employment prospects.  This allows for 3 years continuous participation on CE.  Those over 55 years of age can also remain on CE for three years.  In addition, the reference year for CE participation was moved from 2000 to 2007 which ensures that more people can re-qualify for the programme.  Overall, these changes improve the way the schemes operate and will allow more people who are long-term unemployed to access them.  I continue to keep this whole area under review so that these schemes provide real and valuable support to both individuals and communities.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I recently announced that from June 2018, customers currently engaged with the JobPath service and those who may be referred in future will have the option of applying for CE and T&uacute;s placement while continuing to engage with JobPath.  <\/p>  <p>  This has a number of benefits both for the vital services provided at a local level by participants on CE and T&uacute;s programmes and directly for my Department&rsquo;s customers.  It maximises the assistance and services for people who are long-term unemployed through a combination of a quality work placement and personalised job seeking support provided through the JobPath service.  I want to make sure that their valuable contribution to their local communities will continue, and that they continue to benefit from the personalised, case-managed activation support of the JobPath service.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is very mindful of the large number of work programme places involved in service delivery and other valuable services around the country.

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded and just 1% are appealed.   Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The most recent figures for March 2018 are 28.4 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.4 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p>  <p>  The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeal officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the higher courts and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  <\/p>  <p>  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a number of new appeals officers have joined the appeals office over the past year, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.  This changeover in staff has led to a slightly longer time to conclude appeals in 2017 and so far in 2018.  However, the Chief Appeals Officer has advised that she is hopeful that processing times will improve over the course of 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal and that any favourable decisions are backdated to the original date of the claim.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300047#WRC05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Training","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[19394\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the amount spent on facilitating departmental members' attendance at social media training conferences or other external events.","asker":"1274","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p>My Department has not incurred any cost in facilitating departmental members' attendance at social media training conferences or other such external events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":122,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications Administration","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[19339\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the case of a person (details supplied); if a public services card is a requirement in order to make an application for a renewal passport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>Since 29 March 2016, the Passport Service has required all first time passport applicants, aged 18 and above, who are resident in Ireland to hold a valid Public Services Card (PSC).

If an applicant falls in to one of the above mentioned categories of applicant, their application must include a copy of their PSC. I am informed by the Passport Service that the most recent passport issued to the individual referred to expired more than five years ago and hence a copy of the individual&rsquo;s PSC is required to be submitted with their renewal application.   A key principle behind the concept of the PSC is that the delivery of services is more efficient when a person&rsquo;s identity does not have to be authenticated at every transaction. With specific reference to the issuance of passports, the introduction of the PSC requirement has allowed the Passport Service to dispense with requirements for certain additional documentation and reduces the overall volume of documentation that Irish citizens must submit when applying for a passport.

Ireland condemns the use of the death penalty in all circumstances, and I welcome that these death sentences have been commuted.  I am, however, deeply concerned about the renewed use of capital punishment in Bahrain since 2017, which was extremely disappointing since Bahrain had not used the death penalty since 2010. The continued imposition of death sentences throughout 2017 and 2018 remains a cause for grave concern.  This move is a backwards step in Bahrain&rsquo;s efforts to improve its human rights record, and only serves to reinforce the concerns that I have recently expressed in this House about the deteriorating human rights situation in Bahrain.   Ireland is unequivocal in its stance on the death penalty.  We oppose its use in all circumstances, and in particular in cases where there are allegations of unfair trials preceding its implementation.

The tax commenced on 1 May 2018 and applies to first supplies in the State of sugar sweetened drinks. Sugar sweetened drinks are water and juice based drinks, in ready to consume or concentrated form, that contain added sugar and have a total sugar content of 5 grams or more per 100 millilitres in their ready to consume form. <\/p><p>The tax applies on a volumetric basis at one of two rates, dependent on the total sugar content of the ready to consume form of the sugar sweetened drink. A rate of &euro;16.26 per hectolitre applies to drinks with a total sugar content of 5 grams or more, but less than 8 grams, per 100 millilitres. A higher rate of &euro;24.39 applies to drinks with a total sugar content of 8 grams or more per 100 millilitres. <\/p><p>A sugar sweetened drink contains added sugar if sugar is combined with other ingredients in its production or manufacture. If no sugar has been added, such as in the production of a pure fruit juice, then the drink does not contain added sugar and is not liable to SSDT. Where sugar has been added, the basis of assessment of the drink is the total sugar content of the drink in its ready to consume form. This means that a drink containing both naturally occurring and added sugar is assessed for the tax by reference to the total amount of sugar it contains in ready to consume form. <\/p><p>Where a sugar sweetened drink that contains added sugar is first supplied in the State in a concentrated form, such as a cordial or squash, the tax will apply if the total sugar content of the drink prepared from the concentrate is 5 grams or more per 100 millilitres. <\/p><p>Certain drinks, such as alcohol-free beers and wines, drinks based on soya, cereals, nuts or seeds, or drinks that contain milk fats and those labelled as food supplements, are excluded from the tax. In addition, any drinks excluded from EU food labelling obligations on the basis of their small scale production are not liable to the tax. For reasons of clarity, a legislative amendment will be brought forward in this year's Finance Bill to ensure that some of these exempt categories are exempt from the tax only where they deliver calcium levels comparable to dairy.  <\/p><p>Comprehensive details regarding the operation of the tax are provided on the Revenue website at<\/p><p><i><\/i><i>.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD06200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Training","counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD06100"},{"type":"question","counter":172,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[19402\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD06200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the amount spent on facilitating departmental members' attendance at social media training conferences or other external events.","asker":"1274","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":173,"content":"<p>My Department has had no expenditure in relation to attendance by departmental staff at social media training conferences or other external events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":175,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD06500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD06400"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[19355\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD06500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the situation in which the principal at a school (details supplied) is a teaching principal will be reviewed in view of the fact the role of the principal should be that of walking principal to ensure that the staff resources at the school are properly utilised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":176,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[19385\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300048#WRD06600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the status of a principal at a school (details supplied) will be reviewed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":177,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 76 together.<\/p><p>The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts is published annually on the Department website.

In response to an increase in complaints from consumers about car rental, in 2015 the European Commission and national consumer authorities in EU Member States, including the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, engaged through a common position with the five leading car rental companies with a view to securing better compliance with EU consumer protection legislation. The five companies - Avis, Europcar, Enterprise, Hertz and Sixt - account for around two-thirds of all private car rentals in the EU. As a result of this engagement, the joint action was concluded in January 2017 following changes made by the companies to a number of their commercial practices, including some of the practices referred to in the details supplied by the Deputy. The companies undertook that car rental prices should include all unavoidable charges, that information on additional insurance should be  clear, that consumers should always be given the option to get and return a car with a full tank and that procedures for inspection of vehicle damage and for handling of damage claims should be clear and fair. The European Commission and the national consumer authorities agreed that they would continue to monitor the car rental sector closely. I am aware that since the agreement with the main car rental companies there have been further complaints about practices in the sector in respect of matters such as overcharging for repairs. This underlines the need for continued monitoring of the sector by national consumer protection authorities and the European Commission. <\/p>  <p>  I have referred the details provided by the Deputy to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for consideration. Those details refer among other things to a charge by one car hire company for the use of a credit card for the purpose of a collision damage waiver.  As the Deputy may be aware, surcharges by traders for the use by consumers of the most commonly used credit cards have been prohibited since January 2018 under the Regulations that give effect to Directive (EU) 2015\/2366 on payment services.

The CSO reports that in the year to April 2017, net migration for Ireland, at +19,800 was at the highest level since 2008.

It is vital that the employment permits system is responsive to changes in economic circumstances and labour market conditions. In order to orient the flow of skilled migrants into the country to meet skills and labour demands that, in the short term, cannot be met by the resident labour force, it is necessary to review the highly skilled and ineligible lists on a regular basis.<\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s review of the highly skilled and ineligible lists is predicated on a formalised and evidence-based process.   An EU-wide study in 2015 showed that Ireland is ahead of most EU member states in terms of linking market intelligence to labour migration policy.<\/p>  <p>  The review of the lists is an evidence based process undertaken twice a year, informed by the annual publication of the National Skills Council&rsquo;s National Skills Bulletin and the Vacancy Overview Report, which is also an annual release.  In addition, an extensive internal consultation between officials of my Department and Solas, reviews of relevant sectorial reports or other pertinent releases are undertaken and a public consultation process with Government Departments, agencies, industry and social partners are invited to provide observations. Revised lists are included as schedules to Employment Permits Regulations which are laid before these Houses. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the biannual updating of the lists is the culmination of continual consideration by my Department  of labour market needs and the approach taken has been developed to ensure the sourcing of skills required for economic and social development without undue disruption to the State&rsquo;s labour market. <\/p>  <p>  However, in the light of the changing macroeconomic context, my officials are currently engaged in an overarching review of the employment permits system to ensure that it remains a good fit to support the State&rsquo;s skills and labour requirements where these can&rsquo;t be met from the resident and EEA labour pool.

Recognising the changed economy and labour market, my Department is undertaking a review of the economic migration policies underpinning the current employment permits system.

As a result, equipping the workforce with the skills required for the jobs of today and those of tomorrow is a strategic priority for the Government. Meeting the growing skills needs of industry through investment in education and training is central to our continued economic success. <\/p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) is an independent, non-statutory body, which includes representatives from the business community, education and training providers, learner-support groups, trade unions and a number of Government Departments and agencies. It identifies the skills required by enterprise across occupations and sectors, as well as providing information to education and training providers to allow them to support the alignment of programmes with employers&rsquo; needs. My Department provides the EGFSN with research and secretariat support. <\/p>  <p>  The EGFSN has ongoing work and upcoming publications for 2018 concerned specifically with skills and labour shortages in Ireland. This includes skills forecasts across sectors such as Food and Drink; Design; Freight Transport, Distribution and Logistics; Childcare; and ICT. <\/p>  <p>  In April 2017 the EGFSN published the &lsquo;Update on Future Skills Needs in the Food and Drink Sector&rsquo;.  This report assesses skills needs in the food and drink sector in Ireland and makes twelve recommendations aimed at addressing any gaps that might currently exist, under the headings of work-based learning; internships, mentoring and apprenticeships; languages and international selling; and coordination.  These recommendations are currently being implemented and their progress is being monitored by my Department on behalf of the EGFSN.<\/p>  <p>  &lsquo;Winning by Design: An introduction to the design skills required for firms to be innovative and competitive in global markets&rsquo; was published in November 2017. The report addresses the broadening of design skillsets in response to the growing demand from industry for cross-disciplinary design skills. This includes a Design Skills Action Plan to enhance and develop design in Ireland. These actions are currently being monitored and their progression is reported to the EGFSN.<\/p>  <p>  Upcoming publications for 2018 include a refresh of the ICT Skills Demand Forecast previously undertaken in 2013. &lsquo;Forecasting the Future Demand for High Level ICT Skills in Ireland, 2017-2022&rsquo; aims to assess the annual demand scenario forecasts for ICT Practitioner skills. This is broken down for Computer Engineering and Electronic and Electrical Engineering, by NFQ Levels 6-10 within the ICT Sector and other sectors of the economy. This forecast will provide an overview of ideas and recommendations elicited from stakeholders on how to boost the quantity, quality and diversity of ICT Practitioner skillsets and competences in Ireland, over and above those currently pertaining.<\/p>  <p>  The EGFSN will also deliver &lsquo;Addressing the Skills Needs Arising from the Potential Trade Implications of Brexit Report&rsquo; in 2018. This study examines the skills needs arising from the potential trade implications of Brexit, with a strong focus on qualifications, skillsets, competencies and workforce roles relevant to the diversification of trade at enterprise level, and the movement of trade across international borders, at both enterprise level and in the wider Freight Transport, Distribution and Logistics sector. Eight interventions will be recommended to address the skills issues identified in this study. <\/p>  <p>  Another example of the EGFSN&rsquo;s upcoming work on meeting growing skills demands and the changing skillsets of the Irish workforce is the report on &lsquo;Skills for the Digital Economy&rsquo;, which will emphasise the importance of the constant reskilling and upskilling of the workforce in creating a resilient economy. The report will focus on how different roles and different sectors will be impacted by digitalisation and will develop a synopsis of approaches to upskilling the existing workforce. This report is currently underway and is expected to produce a series of key findings and recommendations. This report will add to the body of work completed by the EGFSN since its inception in relation to filling skills gaps using our current labour market.<\/p>  <p>  Through the ongoing work and publications outlined above the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, supported by my Department, will continue to ensure that an adequate and appropriately skilled workforce remains readily available in Ireland to meet the emerging challenges of a modern, growing economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300051#WRG03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Ireland Site Visits","counter":358,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300051#WRG03500"},{"type":"question","counter":359,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[19552\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050300051#WRG03600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of IDA Ireland site visits in each county in quarter 1 of 2018, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":360,"content":"<p>The following table sets out details on the number of IDA site visits to each county of Ireland in the first three months of 2018.<\/p><p>As I have indicated previously, the IDA continues to highlight the benefits of expanding or locating in all counties of Ireland to its clients, including through site visits to regional areas.

The Programme is responsible for assisting with mapping and developing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise- nationally and internationally; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.<\/p><p>In line with the National Rare Diseases Plan, the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health, encouraged designated centres of expertise in Ireland to apply for membership of European Reference Networks (ERNs) during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks.  Three of these centres are now represented on ERN network.<\/p><p>Membership of ERNs will bring opportunities for engaging in research relating to Rare Diseases in keeping with the National Rare Diseases Plan.  Further centres are expected to apply for membership or affiliated membership of ERNs when the next call takes place in early 2018.<\/p><p>The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) was a key recommendation of the Rare Disease plan.  The office provides current and reliable information about rare diseases to the general public, health care professionals, researchers and policy makers.  The National Rare Diseases Office is responsible for updating Orphanet Ireland.  Orphanet is the international rare disease reference and information portal funded by the EU.  The office also manages the National Rare Diseases Information Line (a Freephone service) and provides online information about rare diseases on their website.<\/p><p>A number of recommendations about access to appropriate drugs and technologies were contained in the plan.  One chief recommendation in this regard refers to the HSE developing a Working Group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies; and that the approach should include an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the National Cancer Control Programme.  The HSE Acute Hospitals Division has developed the terms of reference, required membership and reporting relationship for this committee.  A Chairperson has now been identified and the Group met in March 2018 to start the process of identifying interested stakeholders and considering the remit of the Committee in relation to the assessment of drugs for rare diseases.<\/p><p>One of the recommendations of the National Plan for Rare Diseases was that the Health Identifiers Bill and the Health &amp;amp; Patient Safety Bill be published.  The former was published in 2013 and enacted in 2014.  The Individual Health Identifier part of the project is now being implemented by the HSE. A revised and much expanded General Scheme of a Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by the government in November 2015 and published on the Department's website.<\/p><p>Two recommendations referred to training in rare diseases for healthcare professionals.  The Department of Health has contacted formally the various healthcare representative and professional bodies about implementing these recommendations.  The National Rare Diseases Office developed eLearning modules for healthcare professionals. These modules are available on HSE website.<\/p><p>The issue of rare diseases and of the creation of an all-island patient register has been raised in the context of on-going discussions at North-South meetings.  It is also anticipated that the Model of Care for Rare Diseases will set out recommendations for rare disease registries.  This model of care is in development by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases.  At the EU level, the Joint Research Centre is developing a joint European Platform on Rare Disease Registration which will promote EU level standards for data collection and contribute to the development of rare disease registries across the EU.<\/p><p>The Plan also recommended that an Oversight Implementation Group of relevant stakeholders, including patients' groups, be established to oversee and monitor implementation of the plan&rsquo;s recommendations.  This group was established by the Department of Health in 2015 and it has met on a number of occasions.<\/p><p>The National Rare Disease Plan continues to be implemented.

The full year cost of increasing the existing allowance to &euro;25,000 and the corresponding modified allowance to &euro;12,500 for these practices would amount to approximately &euro;930,000.

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The most recent figures for March 2018 are 28.4 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.4 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p>  <p>  The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeal officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.

Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.

It will also fund services in relation to regeneration and programmes to upgrade existing housing (energy efficiency improvements, adaptation grants, housing for travellers, pyrite, etc.)  The balance of the funding will go towards meeting the needs of over 17,000 additional households to be supported through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Scheme and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) in 2018, as well as existing households already supported through those schemes, and will also fund housing supports and services in relation to homelessness.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's specific query regarding projected spend on a quarterly basis, it is difficult to provide information to sub-programme level, given that it is affected by timing factors.  However, given that my Department is working intensively with local authorities on an ongoing basis to accelerate the delivery of social homes and has been very clear with local authorities that funding is available to support this delivery, the pace of spend, albeit still somewhat weighed towards the second half of the year, is tending to be more evenly spaced over the course of the year.
