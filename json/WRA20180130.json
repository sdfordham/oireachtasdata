Something had to be done to preserve and boost jobs and it is an unavoidable fact that difficult economic situations require hard and very often unpopular decisions.

The additional levy of 0.15% which my predecessor introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund Jobs Initiative, also ended in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the Initiative has been a success in this regard. The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the JobBridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the temporary halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.<\/p>  <p>  Under the legislation, the payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.\u00a0 It is up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy should be passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it must be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members. In no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy. Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme. The consequence of this treatment by the trustees or insurer could be a permanent reduction in members' benefits.<\/p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levy has been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees, etc.) are benefitting from the changes which my predecessor began in Budget 2015 and which have continued in subsequent Budgets to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000060#WRC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000060#WRC02200"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[4139\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000060#WRC02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 131 of 12 December 2017, his views on the recent cases of persons openly and publicly utilising marriage equality legislation for the expressed purpose of benefitting from the same threshold as enjoyed by those in group A and B before paying capital acquisitions tax; his further views on whether a wider review of the heavy emphasis on marriage is needed (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>It is a long held principle of capital acquisitions tax (CAT) that transfers of property between spouses are exempt. All inheritances taken by a spouse from his or her spouse since January 1985 are exempt from tax and are not to be taken into account in computing tax. A similar exemption for gifts between spouses is also in place since January 1990. The spousal exemption from gift and inheritance tax was extended to civil partners with effect from 1 January 2011. Because the tax relief operates as a full exemption spouses and civil partners are not included in any of the three tax free group thresholds and gifts and inheritances between spouses and civil partners are not counted for aggregation purposes. Thus in the case referred to by the Deputy, the individuals in question benefitted from a long standing CAT treatment of the transfer of gifts or inheritances between spouses.  <\/p>  <p>  For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary) determines the life time tax free threshold - known as the group threshold below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise. When a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of the relevant tax free threshold (when aggregated since 5 December 1991) CAT at a rate of 33 per cent applies on the excess over the threshold. It is the beneficiary and not the disponer who is liable for CAT. <\/p>  <p>  There are three group thresholds. The Group A threshold (currently &euro;310,000) applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, step child, and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. The Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, nephew, niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendent of the disponer. The Group C threshold (currently &euro;16,250) applies in all other cases. <\/p>  <p>  Where certain conditions are met, it is possible for a person to be exempt from payment of inheritance tax on the receipt of a dwelling house from a person who is not his or her parent. The main conditions are that the beneficiary must have lived in the house that was the sole residence of the disponer for at least three year prior to inheritance and must not have an interest in any other house. This exemption is not contingent on the relationship between the disponer and the beneficiary. <\/p>  <p>  Ordinarily a beneficiary cannot avail of the Group A threshold unless he or she receives a gift or inheritance from a parent. However, certain beneficiaries who are nephews or nieces of a disponer can avail of \"favourite nephew relief\". A nephew or niece who has worked substantially on a full time bases for a period of five years prior to the gift or inheritance in carrying on or assisting in the carrying on of a trade, business or profession of the disponer is entitled to the Group A threshold instead of the usual Group B threshold. Other reliefs than can also apply are agricultural and business relief. <\/p>  <p>  The current CAT treatment of gifts or inheritances provides for horizontal equity in that beneficiaries of gifts or inheritances are treated equally for the purposes of the application of CAT. I do not therefore consider it necessary to make any amendment to the existing CAT treatment of gifts or inheritances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000060#WRC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rental Sector","counter":52,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000060#WRC02500"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[4315\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000060#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the debt levels of the State's largest landlords and other large property funds operating here will be examined to determine the risk to the property market and the wider economy.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":54,"content":"<p>My Department continually monitors developments in both the residential and commercial property sectors.

This report takes a global perspective in examining inequality.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset, I want to outline Ireland&rsquo;s position regarding the distribution of wealth. In 2013, the Central Statistics Office conducted the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), which provided the first comprehensive data on Irish household wealth. <\/p>  <p>  The net wealth Gini coefficient is a commonly used measure of inequality, where a figure of 100 indicates that one household holds all the wealth and 0 indicates that wealth is evenly divided among all households. This measure, based on the HFCS data,\u00a0indicates that wealth inequality in Ireland (64) for 2013 is lower than the euro area average (69). In addition, the HFCS results also\u00a0show that wealth in Ireland is less concentrated at the top of the\u00a0distribution (i.e. the top 1% of the population) than the euro area average.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the Oxfam report&rsquo;s recommendations to governments for tackling wealth inequality, the Irish Government is committed to various targets, policies and initiatives to further reduce inequality in Ireland:<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, we are committed to further implementation and progress towards our inequality reduction goals within the Programme for Partnership Government, particularly through the equality proofing process of the budget.<\/p>  <p>  Our highly progressive income tax and well-targeted welfare systems are notably successful at reducing income inequality.

The refund scheme has a number of conditions that are designed to ensure that only those builders and developers who provide completed housing units within a reasonable period of time can qualify for a refund of the difference in the amount of stamp duty payable at the rates of 2% and 6%.<\/p>  <p>  Finance Act 2017 also provided for a change to the CGT relief for land and buildings which applied where development land and residential\/ commercial property was purchased between 7 December 2011 and end-2014 (the qualifying period) and held for seven years. The change in the law allows individuals retain the right to sell those assets subject to the relief at or after the current seven year limit, but will allow for full CGT relief on any gain to apply if a qualifying asset which was purchased during the qualifying period is sold at any time between the 4th anniversary of its purchase and the 7th anniversary of that purchase. This change could help encourage and promote the sale of assets such as development land and existing residential properties, which qualify for the CGT relief, as there would be no need to wait for the full seven years to elapse in order to enjoy full relief from CGT.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 I announced a new, time-limited deduction for pre-letting expenses incurred on property that have been vacant for one year or more.\u00a0 The purpose of this relief is to encourage owners of vacant property to bring that accommodation into the rental system, thereby increasing the overall supply of residential accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  This measure was an option put forward in the report of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Rental Accommodation Providers. The report outlines the current situation in the rental accommodation sector, summarises the main issues raised in a public consultation conducted by the working group, and puts forward ten potential policy options for consideration.\u00a0 The measure introduced in Budget 2018 was prioritised as it was specifically designed to encourage an overall increase in housing supply by bringing currently vacant property back into residential use.<\/p>  <p>  The Help-to-Buy (HTB) initiative introduced in Budget 2017 provides a tax rebate for first-time purchasers to assist them to fund the deposit required to purchase or self-build a new house or apartment to live in as their home. One of the policy aims was to encourage the additional supply of new housing. My Department commissioned Indecon to complete an independent impact assessment of HTB in March 2017. The report was published as part of Budget 2018 and it found that there was some evidence of improvement in the supply of housing in the Irish market since the introduction of HTB. However, as supply inevitably takes time to respond, any identifiable overall impact of HTB on supply is likely to be only seen over time. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the assessment, 55 contractors were surveyed by Indecon. The contractors indicated they had built or commenced building on 3,098 housing units since the measure was introduced and firms in this sample were planning on building 12,752 additional new housing units over the next three years. Most of the contractors suggested that the HTB scheme had encouraged them to commence building new units.<\/p>  <p>  While not constituting a taxation measure, the Deputy will be aware that section 86 of Finance Act 2017 provides for an exploration of the key issues in relation to the potential application of a tax on vacant residential property, to be reported on within 9 months of the passing of the Finance Act. I consider that the objective to be met by such a tax would be to increase the much needed supply of homes for rent or purchase to meet the growing demand.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) is making a very substantial contribution to new private housing supply which is critical in terms of meeting the pent up demand for housing across all sectors of the market. In line with its double bottom line mandate, ISIF has already invested in a number of significant financing platforms and projects in the construction sector, and is actively examining other investment opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000061#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Aid Investigations","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000061#WRD01600"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[4138\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000061#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding the escrow account for all of the fines levied by the European Commission against a company (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[4310\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000061#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a company (details supplied) has provided part of or all of the fines levied by the European Commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":90,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 167 together.<\/p><p>I am assuming the Deputy is referring to the alleged State Aid in the Apple Decision. <\/p><p>Ireland has never accepted the Commission&rsquo;s analysis in the Apple State aid Decision.<\/p><p>However, we have always been clear that the Government is fully committed to ensuring that recovery of the alleged Apple State aid takes place without delay and has committed significant resources to ensuring this is achieved as quickly as possible whilst ensuring that the interests of the Irish taxpayer are adequately protected.<\/p><p>Significant progress has been made on this complex issue and the establishment of an escrow fund, in compliance with all relevant Irish constitutional and European Union law requirements, is close to completion.

This commitment was most recently detailed in the White Paper on Defence published in August 2015.  This reaffirmed that Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality remains a core element of Irish Foreign policy, as had been previously articulated in the review of Foreign Policy, &ldquo;The Global Island&rdquo;, published in January 2015.  This Government upholds and will continue to uphold that longstanding and publicly cherished policy.<\/p>  <p>  This policy, together with our international activism on issues such as disarmament, international crisis management and peacekeeping, has helped us to speak with a distinctive and independent voice on many of the key challenges facing the world in relation to the maintenance of international peace and security.   <\/p>  <p>  Permission must be sought in advance for landings by all foreign military aircraft.  Foreign military aircraft, of any and all States, requesting permission to avail of facilities at Shannon or any other Irish airport must adhere to strict conditions: conditions that are applied to ensure compatibility with Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality.  These conditions routinely include stipulations that the aircraft is unarmed, carries no arms, ammunition or explosives; that it must not engage in intelligence gathering and does not form part of any military operation or exercise.  Successive Governments have made landing facilities at Shannon available to the US for many years.  The facility to land is also made available to military aircraft from other countries.  In considering requests for landings by foreign military aircraft, my Department&rsquo;s primary focus is on whether the flights in question comply with these conditions.  No distinction between States is made when it comes to the application of these criteria. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied with the strict application of these conditions and with their compatibility with Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality.  Facilitation of landing requests for foreign military aircraft does not alter nor breach this policy and re-fuelling of a government jet en route to political consultations does not alter nor breach this policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000063#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000063#WRF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[4033\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000063#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps he is taking to raise the detention of a person (details supplied) in an Israeli prison; the steps taken to advocate for their release; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[4034\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000063#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the actions taken by him and his officials on the approximately 350 Palestinian children held in Israeli prisons and detention centres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":159,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 133 together.<\/p>  <p>  The overall human rights situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the treatment of children in detention, remains a matter of concern.  Ireland has repeatedly drawn attention to concerns regarding the treatment of Palestinian prisoners.  We have paid particular attention over recent years to issues related to the detention of minors.  Ireland also provides financial support to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs who are active in bringing these issues to light.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the issues raised by UNICEF, including in the February 2013 UNICEF report, entitled &ldquo;Children in Israeli Military Detention&rdquo;.  I would urge the Israeli authorities, in accordance with their obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to use detention only as a means of last resort, and for the shortest appropriate period of time, in the case of minors.  The rights of the child are human rights.  Detained Palestinians, especially children, should have the same protections and conditions that Israel affords its own citizens when detained.  <\/p>  <p>  During my visit to the Middle East last week, I again raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the detention of minors directly with the Israeli authorities, including the issues of night-time arrests and blindfolding.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also raised these issues at EU level and in international fora, including during the Universal Periodic Review of Israel at the UN Human Rights Council in 2013.  In the most recent Universal Periodic Review of Israel, last week, Ireland raised the issue of administrative detention, and made recommendations on the rights of detainees.  My Department and I will continue to press on these issues in the relevant multilateral fora, and also, where appropriate, directly with Israel.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the case raised by the Deputy, and note that the individual in question remains in custody.  An Irish diplomatic representative was present at this person&rsquo;s hearing in Ofer military court in the West Bank on 20 December, along with other international representatives.  In view of her age and the nature of the charges against her, I am concerned that the military judge ruled at a remand hearing last week that she be held in detention for the duration of her trial.  I understand that the first trial hearing is scheduled to take place on 31 January.  My Department will continue to monitor that case and others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000063#WRF00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Aid","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000063#WRF01000"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[4043\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000063#WRF01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on Irish Aid&rsquo;s programme in Sierra Leone; and his further views on whether this programme is vital and should be sustained in view of the fact that the country is still emerging from conflict and humanitarian crises.","asker":"1276","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing engagement in and with Sierra Leone, a key partner for our development cooperation, is consistent with Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing commitment to support fragile and conflict-affected states.<\/p>  <p>  The programme of bilateral assistance delivered by the Embassy of Ireland in Freetown played a crucial role in supporting the response to the Ebola crisis between 2014 and 2016, including through close cooperation with local and international partners.

Ireland&rsquo;s on-going commitment to meet our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact will ensure continuing improvements in the debt and deficit ratios. <br \/><br \/>The consolidation measures introduced after the financial and economic crisis led to a sharp reduction in capital investment. The 10 year capital plan will seek to address the ensuing deficits in infrastructural investment. Once major capital projects, boosting potential output and enhancing our competitiveness, have been completed, a debt ratio of 45 per cent of GDP will once again be targeted. <br \/><br \/>A debt ratio lower than specified in the Stability and Growth Pact and the introduction of a Rainy Day Fund will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal capacity and our ability to absorb external shocks to the economy.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Provide a clear statement on the scope and operational guidelines of the Rainy-Day Fund to serve as a counter-cyclical buffer to adverse shocks.<\/td><td>The Oireachtas consultation process regarding the Rainy Day Fund (RDF) that I initiated through the publication of my consultation paper on Budget Day last October is still ongoing. My attendance at the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight on Wednesday 31 January\u00a0will provide a\u00a0significant opportunity to exchange views on the RDF. Following that discussion and consideration by my Department further details on the operational modalities of the RDF will be published in due course.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Evaluate the effectiveness of SARP to ensure the scheme is meeting objectives and remains internationally competitive and\u00a0 accessible to enterprises based in Ireland including SMEs<\/td><td>The Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP)\u00a0was introduced by my Department in Budget 2012, with the aim of reducing the cost to companies of assigning skilled individuals and key decision makers from abroad to take up positions in the Irish based operations of their employer or an associated company.<br \/><br \/>A full review of SARP, including a public consultation, was undertaken by my Department and Revenue in October 2014. Subsequent changes were enacted in Budget 2015, which included a number of enhancements to the scheme. Revenue compiles data on the numbers of individuals availing of SARP on an annual basis.\u00a0The most recent report on SARP compiled and published by Revenue, in respect of the 2015 tax year, highlights the uptake and cost of the scheme on an annual basis since its introduction, as set out in following table below**<br \/><br \/>The consistent increase in the number of claimants and the associated cost of the scheme shows that it is being successful in attracting individuals to Ireland from other arms of Multi-National Enterprises. The report also indicates that the programme is reaching a broad range of industrial sectors, with assignees being spread across IT, Financial Services, Pharmaceutical and Medical, Consumer and Industrial, and Other services.<br \/><br \/>As with all such schemes,\u00a0SARP remains under review from budget to budget, and I will continue to engage with my colleagues in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation\u00a0in this regard.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Conduct a review of the Irish Tax System as it applies to SMEs and Small Mid-Caps to consider how its competitiveness could be enhanced in the context of Brexit.<\/td><td>Three year corporation tax relief for start-up companies is an incentive to encourage new business start-up, and therefore create additional employment.\u00a0This measure provides relief from corporation tax on trading income (and certain capital gains) of new start-up companies in the first three years of trading. This tax relief is due to expire in 2018 and therefore a review of the scheme will be undertaken this year, in line with the Department of Finance&rsquo;s Tax Expenditure Guidelines. <br \/><br \/>Furthermore, the Knowledge Development Box (KDB) (Certification of Inventions) Act 2017 introduced a new certification scheme to allow smaller companies avail of the KDB without the need to apply for a patent. This is intended to make the scheme more accessible to smaller companies who may not be able to avail of the KDB otherwise. <br \/><br \/>My Department conducted a review of share-based remuneration in 2016 which led to the introduction in Finance Bill 2017 of a new Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP) share option incentive for employees of SME companies.\u00a0 The purpose of KEEP is to assist SME companies competing with larger businesses in recruiting and retaining key employees. Also, as I indicated last November, a review of the Employment &amp;amp; Investment Incentive (EII) will be completed in advance of Budget 2019, to ensure it operates as a competitive, efficient and effective measure in accordance with state aid rules and my Department&rsquo;s Tax Expenditure Guidelines.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Consider further changes to the income tax system which will contribute to the decline in replacement rates as part of the Government&rsquo;s consideration of income tax, and considering the factors encouraging take-up of employment.<\/td><td>Deliberations in relation to potential income tax measures will take place over the next 9 months, in advance of Budget 2019 which I expect to deliver in October this year. \u00a0As is the case for each Budget, deliberations in relation to income tax policy measures take into account a wide range of factors, including the distributional impact of tax measures on different household types across a range of income levels and financial incentives to work. For example, the Income Tax and USC Tax Strategy Group paper, produced in advance of the Budget each year and available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.finance.gov.ie\/what-we-do\/tax\/the-tax-strategy-group\/, contains an ex-ante equality impact assessment of possible changes to the income tax system. Where possible, taking into account the potential scope for income tax changes, this analysis also takes account of the impact of potential measures on financial incentives to begin work or increase hours worked. \u00a0However I would also note that, when considering the impact of any Budget, it is necessary to consider the budget package in the round, looking at tax and welfare changes together, rather than at taxation measures alone.  My Department, independently and in conjunction with other Departments, conducts a number of analyses to examine the distributional and work incentive impacts of possible Budget options and of the final Budget package (see for example <i>www.welfare.ie\/en\/Pages\/SocialImpact2017.aspx<\/i>).  These provide an evidence base on equality and work incentive issues which can be integrated alongside other budgetary considerations.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Consider extending the scope of the Foreign Earnings Deduction Scheme to all non-EEA countries.<\/td><td>The Foreign Earnings Deduction (FED)\u00a0scheme was introduced by my Department in Budget 2012 to incentivise individuals to seek expansion opportunities for trade into non-traditional export markets for Irish goods and services. <br \/><br \/>The incentive was reviewed in 2014.  This\u00a0resulted in its extension in Budget 2015, with some additional enhancements.  In Budget 2017, FED was extended until the end of 2020 in order to provide certainty for potential investors in Ireland, following on from the UK vote to leave the European Union.<br \/><br \/>The question of extending the scope of FED to all non-EEA countries was considered recently in the run-up to Budget 2018.  There has been a significant degree of broadening out of the relief in recent years and the full impact of these changes will take time to feed through. \u00a0Also, such a broad extension to FED as proposed, even when viewed in the context of Brexit, would very likely result in significantly increased costs to the Exchequer, including deadweight costs.  Accordingly, I do not intend\u00a0to progress\u00a0the proposed change to FED at this time.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Broaden the distribution capability and market coverage of the SBCI by adding new on-lenders and working to develop innovative products, thereby serving to drive competition in the SME finance market.<br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>Continue to facilitate partnerships between SBCI <br \/><br \/>and international lenders, especially in non-bank finance, to increase<br \/><br \/>competition and\u00a0provide alternative sources of finance for SMEs.<\/td><td>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland&rsquo;s (SBCI) mission is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs and, in time, other sectors that address failures in the Irish credit market, while driving competition and innovation and ensuring the efficient use of available EU resources. The SBCI began lending in March 2015.  The SBCI uses an on-lending model rather than lending directly, channelling its funds through lending partners, known as on-lenders.  The SBCI currently has three bank and four non-bank on-lending partners.<br \/><br \/>The SBCI is engaged with a range of potential on-lenders to broaden its distribution capability and market coverage, subject to robust due diligence processes designed to mitigate risks to Irish taxpayers while optimising funding to Irish SMEs. <br \/><br \/>In October 2016, the SBCI took over operation and management of the Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) on behalf of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  In 2017, the SBCI developed and delivered an enhanced Credit Guarantee Scheme.\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>Additionally, the SBCI has been developing risk sharing guarantee products to enhance access to finance during the course of 2017.  As announced in Budget 2017, the SBCI in conjunction with Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, rolled out a &euro;150 million Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan scheme to provide working capital support to farmers to deal with price and income volatility. <br \/><br \/>The SBCI is also tasked with delivering the &euro;300m Brexit Loan scheme, as I announced in Budget 2018.  The Scheme has been developed by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and Enterprise Ireland.  The SBCI engaged with the European Investment Fund (EIF) to utilise its Innovfin counter guarantee facility to support the Scheme. <br \/><br \/>The purpose of the Scheme is to assist Irish SMEs and Small Midcap firms (less than 499 employees) affected by Brexit with their working capital needs to allow them to diversify and restructure their businesses and adapt and innovate in response to Brexit. <br \/><br \/>The SBCI is continuing to work on a number of risk sharing initiatives, particularly the continued use of guarantees with European counter-guarantees to support lending by finance providers, which aim to address sectorial market failures and recognising the collateral limitations of SMEs and collateral obligations of banks.  Risk sharing initiatives are open to banks and non-bank lenders.<br \/><br \/>The SBCI&rsquo;s engagement at a European level continues with regular discussion with the European Investment Bank Group (EIB and EIF) on new initiatives emerging under European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI). <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Expedite the development of a commercial property price register encompassing data on commercial sales and leases.<\/td><td>This is not a policy matter for the Minister for Finance.

The Irish crowdfunding market is nascent and comparatively small.  Equally, while the European crowdfunding market has been growing it is still relatively small and growing at a relatively low rate.  A\u00a0public consultation on the potential regulation of crowdfunding was carried out by the Department of Finance in 2017.  Based on the findings of the public consultation carried out, there was general support from the crowdfunding industry and stakeholders for the regulation of crowdfunding in Ireland and it was felt that regulation would be beneficial to both industry and consumers.  The main concern was that regulation might be overly burdensome or onerous and stifle or hinder the development of the industry.\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>Subsequent to the public consultation, the European Commission proposed a pan-European regulatory regime for crowdfunding in its 2018 work programme.  The Department of Finance will monitor the progress and developments on this and implement European regulations as necessary.\u00a0 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ensure the R&amp;amp;D tax credit and Knowledge Development Box incentives provide value for money and remain internationally competitive, accessible and relevant to evolving enterprise needs. <\/td><td>My officials and I are cognisant of the need to monitor the cost and effectiveness of both the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit and the Knowledge Development Box, as we do all tax expenditures.

I believe its remit will continue to evolve over the next 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000063#WRF04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000063#WRF04600"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[4141\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000063#WRF04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of secondees from businesses (details supplied) working in his Department and each other Department.","asker":"1259","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":198,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that there are no secondees from the businesses (details supplied) currently\u00a0working in the Department of Finance. <\/p><p>However, in previous years the Department of Finance did have secondees from some of these businesses and those details can be found on the Department of Finance website at www.finance.gov.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000063#WRF04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Costs","counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000063#WRF04900"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[4149\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000063#WRF05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the growing frustration of motorists who, despite the working group on motor insurance, have seen premiums continue to rise, particularly for older persons.","asker":"1291","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":201,"content":"<p>At the outset, the Deputy should note that it has been brought to my attention that some policyholders, particularly older persons, are continuing to experience increases in their insurance premiums in spite of the fact that prices are generally in decline.

Consequently, neither the Government nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. <\/p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.  This in turn should lead to the increased availability of flood insurance.  To achieve this aim, there is a focus on:  <\/p>  <p>  prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,  <\/p>  <p>  development and implementation of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and   <\/p>  <p>  improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.  <\/p>  <p>  The above approach is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.  In this regard, the Insurance Ireland\/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.  <\/p>  <p>  While I have not discussed the issue of flooding in Dublin 3 directly with Insurance Ireland, my officials on the aforementioned working group are in regular contact with both Insurance Ireland and the OPW regarding proposed and completed flood defence schemes and how the levels of insurance cover might be improved in areas where flood defence works have been completed.<\/p>  <p>  You should also note that I have been advised by the OPW that in relation to the schemes located in Dublin 3 (The Tolka - East Wall Scheme, the Tolka - Hawthorne Terrace Scheme, and elements of the Tolka - Richmond Road Scheme) that all have been built to the 1\/100 year standard, and that information in relation to these schemes has been shared with Insurance Ireland under the Memorandum of Understanding.  I have also been informed that Dublin City Council are currently progressing flood relief works in Dublin 3. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.

Sparkassen are German local public banks.  They are only permitted to operate in particular geographic regions local to them.  Their business model is to promote economic development and financial inclusion in the particular regional area in which they operate, not just profit maximisation.  Part of this business model also includes building close relationships with SMEs in their region of operation.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the investigation of local public banking, a consultation process involving engagement with stakeholders and interested parties was conducted last year by the Department of Rural and Community Development, with assistance from my Department.  <\/p>  <p>  The investigation has also included an analysis of a proposal for a potential model of local public banking, based on the German model, in Ireland.  This proposal was put forward by Irish Rural Link and the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC), the international development wing of the Sparkassen group.  Officials in my Department, and the Department of Rural and Community Development, have met with representatives from Irish Rural Link and SBFIC on a number of occasions. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in both departments have been working closely together and have finalised a report on their investigation on local public banking.

Notwithstanding that, the Central Bank already has considerable powers to protect customers of financial institutions and punish regulated entities which mislead or lie to their customers. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code provides that<\/p>  <p>&ldquo;A regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and within the context of its authorisation it: <\/p>  <p>2.1 acts honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market; <\/p>  <p>2.2 acts with due skill, care and diligence in the best interests of its customers; <\/p>  <p>2.3 does not recklessly, negligently or deliberately mislead a customer as to the real or perceived advantages or disadvantages of any product or service&hellip;&rdquo; <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank can impose sanctions on regulated entities which breach this Code. <\/p>  <p>  I should point out that the Code also provides that &ldquo;A regulated entity must have written procedures in place for the effective handling of errors which affect consumers.&rdquo;  The Code also specifies the procedures to be followed in the event of a complaint.<\/p>  <p>  When the complaint is finalised, the Code requires that the consumer be informed that they can refer the matter to the Financial Service and Pensions Ombudsman.\u00a0 If a consumer is not satisfied with the outcome of a complaint, I would strongly advise them to pursue a complaint with the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. <\/p>  <p>  As I announced in December, I propose to increase the compensation amount which may be awarded by the Ombudsman to &euro;500,000 in order to ensure the Ombudsman can fully compensate those most severely impacted by the appalling behaviour of the banks.\u00a0 Such a large increase in the compensation payments capability of the Financial Services Ombudsman will also serve as a clear indication to the banks that unacceptable behaviour towards customers will not be tolerated and that when it happens, they will have to compensate customers appropriately.<\/p>  <p>  The Tracker Mortgage Examination highlighted that significant cultural issues and challenges remain in some of the retail banks and that customer interests have not been sufficiently protected or prioritised.  Section 6A of the Central Bank Act, 1942, as amended, provides that I, as Minister, may consult with the Governor of the Central Bank in relation to our respective functions.  To this end, I wrote to the Governor on\u00a0last November, requesting that the Central Bank undertake an assessment of the current cultures and behaviours and associated risks in Irish retail banks, and the actions that may be taken to ensure that banks prioritise customer interests in the future. <\/p>  <p>  Work on this report is underway, and is due to be finalised by end-June 2018.

The top marginal tax rate for income up to &euro;70,044 has now been reduced to 48.75%. \u00a0 It should be remembered that, as recently as December 2014, the marginal rate of tax for a single individual on all income over &euro;32,800 was 52%. <\/p>  <p>  The impact that the income tax burden has on the creation of employment has also been recognised, and I have introduced targeted measures to support Irish SMEs in this regard.  \u00a0For example, as mentioned by An Taoiseach at the event to which the Deputy refers, a new Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP) was introduced in Budget 2018 with the aim of assisting SMEs competing with larger, more established businesses to recruit and retain the key staff needed to support business growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000064#WRG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base Proposals","counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000064#WRG04400"},{"type":"question","counter":257,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[4308\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000064#WRG04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the efforts he has undertaken to oppose harmonisation of the EU corporate tax base; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":258,"content":"<p>Taxation remains within the sovereignty of individual member states.Unanimity is needed before any tax changes can be agreed at EU level.Proposals for tax harmonisation at EU level are not new.The common consolidated corporate tax base has been discussed for years and was first formally proposed in 2011. \u00a0<\/p><p>Ireland's position has always been clear - we do not support tax harmonisation that undermines a member state's ability to set its own tax rate and to determine its own tax base.We have however shown we are willing to agree EU tax directives that seek to implement agreed international best practice in a consistent manner across the EU.This remains Ireland's position.<\/p><p>As always, in line with the programme for partnership Government, Ireland is constructively engaging in the debate on the CCCTB proposal while critically analysing the extent to which the proposal impacts Ireland's interests. \u00a0<\/p><p>Ireland are by no means alone in having concerns about tax harmonisation.These views are shared by many other member states across the EU. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000064#WRG04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":259,"content":"<p>Question No. 166 answered with Question No. 149.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":260,"content":"<p>Question No. 167 answered with Question No. 104.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":261,"content":"<p>Question No. 168 answered with Question No. 149.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Issues","counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000064#WRG04900"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[52267\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000064#WRG05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the criteria he plans to establish regarding affordability in HBFI funded developments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":264,"content":"<p>In my Budget speech on 10 October 2017, I announced a proposal to establish a new dedicated fund, Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) to provide funding on market terms to viable residential development projects whose owners are experiencing difficulty in obtaining debt funding.\u00a0  Up to &euro;750 million of ISIF funds will be allocated to HBFI to provide funding on market terms and the fund is estimated to have capacity to finance about 6,000 homes in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  HBFI will not be directly involved in development &ndash; its role would be solely as a commercial lender and therefore will not have any role in designing the housing mix contained in the schemes it funds.  HBFI will provide lending on commercial, market-equivalent terms and conditions.  This approach would be akin to a bank or private equity investor.

Primary legislation will be required for the changes to be implemented.  In approving the proposals, the Government also approved the General Scheme of a Bill to give effect to the changes.  The Attorney General&rsquo;s Office has been asked to give priority to the drafting of this legislation so that the new compulsory retirement age for pre 2004 public servants will become effective as soon as possible.  The new compulsory retirement age will only apply to pre 2004 public servants who reach the age of 65 following the commencement of the new legislation.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Government has approved some limited interim arrangements to apply in the period between the Government Decision and the commencement of the necessary legislation.  The interim arrangements (which have to respect the current statutory position of the compulsory retirement age of 65) through retirement and re-hire, will allow pre 2004 public servants who reach the age of 65 in that period to remain in employment only until they reach the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory), which is currently 66.  Details of how these interim implementation arrangements will operate in the wider public service, including in the education sector, have been put in place by the individual sectors.<\/p>  <p>  The policy across the public service is that, where a retired employee is re-hired, they are paid at the minimum point of the relevant scale, rather than at the pay point they had reached when they retired.  This practice is continuing in the context of the interim arrangements.  Pension abatement rules will, however, apply in the case of a public servant availing of the interim arrangements.  Pension abatement means that the pension that has been awarded will be reduced so that the person concerned will not receive more in combined pension and salary payments than they would have received if they had remained working.  Given that the person's \"new\" salary will be at the minimum point, there will be room through the payment of pension and the &ldquo;new&rdquo; salary rate so that the sum of the &ldquo;new&rdquo; salary rate and the pension in payment can address the difference between the minimum point of the scale and the pay point they had reached when they retired.  Taxation is a matter  for the Revenue Commissioners and is applied to all taxpayers in accordance with statutory provisions and Revenue Commissioners rules and procedures.<\/p>  <p>  It is not intended that the practice of payment at the minimum point would apply to public servants who choose to remain beyond the age of 65 once the legislation is commenced.  Those public servants will not be in the position of having retired and been re-hired.   It is intended that when the legislation is enacted, it will allow for the retention of public servants who reach the age of 65 following the commencement of the legislation, on current terms and conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000065#WRH04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000065#WRH04600"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[3936\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000065#WRH04700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the outcome of discussions to date with the European Commission on cohesion funding post 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>Proposals for the next Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) will be published by the European Commission in May 2018.

The EU Procurement and Remedies Directives govern the way public authorities and certain utility operators purchase goods, works and services.  The rules are transposed into Irish law and apply to tenders for public contracts whose monetary value exceeds certain thresholds.  There are remedies available when an economic operator that has an interest in a public procurement procedure believes that it has been run without proper application of the EU Public Procurement Directives.  An unsuccessful economic operator can bring a case to the High Court.  The European Commission can also take action against a Member State if it considers that the Procurement Directives are not being applied correctly.  For tenders of lower value, national rules apply which must respect the general principles of EU law such as equal treatment, non-discrimination etc.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for\u00a0individual contracting authorities to ensure that\u00a0their public procurement function is discharged\u00a0in line\u00a0with\u00a0the standard\u00a0accounting and procurement rules\u00a0and procedures.  Under Section 19 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, each Accounting Officer is personally responsible for the safeguarding of public funds and property under his or her control; for the regularity and propriety of all the transactions in each Appropriation Account bearing his or her signature; and for the efficiency and economy of administration in his or her Department.  Public procurement practices are subject to audit and scrutiny under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, and the Local Government Reform Act 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has responsibility for developing and setting out the overarching policy framework for public procurement in Ireland.

It enables public bodies to adopt procedures to meet their Public Procurement requirements and facilitates compliance with EU and National Procurement Rules.<\/p>  <p>  Last July, my colleague, Minister of State Patrick O'Donovan, launched new Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services.  This comprehensive interpretation of the public procurement directives has been designed to improve consistency and promote best practice in the application of the public procurement rules.<\/p>  <p>  However, as set out above, while the OGP guidelines facilitate and enable compliance with public procurement rules, it is the responsibility of each Contracting Authority to ensure they adhere to these rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000066#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Status","counter":350,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000066#WRJ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":351,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[4237\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000066#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding the flood improvement works which will be carried out by location in County Louth; when the list of all areas covered by these works will be published by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":352,"content":"<p>The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding is the Office of Public Works (OPW) Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.

There will be additional and refocused expenditure deployed on programmes directly relevant to employers, including an expansion of the apprenticeship and traineeship programmes and enhanced funding to Skillnets to provide in company training.  The NTF will also be more aligned with employer needs and as an initial step the composition of programmes has been reviewed to bring greater alignment with employer needs.  Funding for &lsquo;in-employment&rsquo; has risen by 10% in 2018.  There is currently a comprehensive independent review of the NTF ongoing and this will guide strategic decisions on its structure and future direction in order to inform budget 2019.  <\/p><p><b>ICT <\/b><\/p><p>The high-level ICT Skills forecast for the period 2018-2022 is currently under development and is due to report in Q1, 2018.<\/p><p><b>Apprenticeships<\/b><\/p><p>As set out in our Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, my Department is, in conjunction with SOLAS, currently reviewing the pathways to participation in apprenticeship in a range of diverse groups, including female participation.  The review, which commenced last year, will be completed later this year.<\/p><p>Currently, there are over 5,000 employers using the apprenticeship system as a talent pipeline in Ireland and the majority of these are SME companies.  The number of participating employers is continually increasing and as part of the current expansion of apprenticeship in Ireland it is expected that, by 2020, more than 7,000 employers will be taking on apprentices.  The Apprenticeship Council and industry-led consortia are actively monitoring and working on employer participation in apprenticeship. <\/p><p>In 2017, there was a second national call for proposals for new apprenticeships to be developed.  This provided industry-led groups the opportunity to work with education providers to develop proposals for new apprenticeships in their individual sectors.  Last month, 26 new national apprenticeships were approved for further development in areas ranging from animation to healthcare. <\/p><p>To help communicate the expansion work, a phased communication campaign began last year with a focus on public relations, events and digital media.  As a result there has been a large increase in media coverage of apprenticeships and a strong social media presence has been established across Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.  The campaign&rsquo;s initial focus was on potential apprentices, including women, and key influencers such as guidance counsellors and parents.

The NEPS mission is to support the well-being and the personal, social and educational development of all children through the application of psychological theory and practice in education, having particular regard for children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>NEPS bases its recruitment of staff on an open market offer, made through the Public Appointments Service, to appropriately qualified professionals.  This process has proved successful in its application and intent over the years.  Recruits thus identified and employed are supported through an induction programme and on-going professional development supports and the quality thereof is high and their retention very satisfactory.<\/p><p>Clinical Psychologists fulfil a particular function within the Health Sector which is subject to a number of contextual differences to those pertaining to Educational Psychologists in my Department and in which situation it has been deemed necessary to create a supported traineeship to secure and retain appropriately qualified personnel.  I set out below for the Deputy&rsquo;s information a note on the matter supplied to my Department by the HSE.<\/p><p>Clinical Psychologist Trainee<\/p><p>Employment of psychologists in the Irish Health Services began in the mid-sixties.  Mirroring developments in the United Kingdom, the initial cohort of psychologists recruited were all employed as clinical psychologists mainly within mental health services.  This practice was formally recognised with the introduction of the Department of Health (DoH) regulations in 1979 governing the recruitment of psychologists which related specifically to clinical psychology, attached.  <\/p><p>In the early 1970s, in order to address the growing need for clinical psychologists and in the absence of formal training programmes, a clinical psychology apprenticeship in-service model was established within the Health Boards.  <\/p><p>  In 1978, clinical psychology training accredited by the British Psychological Society (BPS) was developed by the Eastern Health Board in collaboration with the University of Dublin, Trinity College (TCD). Successful trainees were awarded the BPS Diploma in Clinical Psychology.  This led in 1992 to the establishment of a clinical psychology training programme in TCD.  In 1983, University College Dublin (UCD) established a clinical psychology training programme in conjunction with Health Boards.<\/p><p>Currently, there are five doctoral level clinical psychology training programmes that have developed through and operate in partnership with the HSE.  They are based at the National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG), University of Dublin, Trinity College (TCD), University College Dublin (UCD), University College Cork (UCC) and the University of Limerick (UL).<\/p><p>All five clinical psychology training programmes have, as required by the Accreditation Standards of PSI, a central purpose which is to train professionally qualified clinical psychologists to work in the Irish health service. It is the only branch of psychology to which the PSI attribute this purpose.<\/p><p>Parallel to the development of the partnership approach to clinical training between the HSE and the university sector, the PSI, in response to a request by the Department of Health to help meet the demand for psychologists at that time, established in 1992 its own in-service professional clinical psychology training programme.  This course was discontinued in 2010. In 2015, approval was granted to establish a post graduate clinical psychology training programme in University College Cork (UCC).  <\/p><p>Clinical psychology is the only branch of psychology whose central purpose is to work in the health sector. This programme of study and clinical placements is specific to the mental health services in the HSE and the programme content and placement locations are specified by the HSE.  Participants undergoing these programmes receive are contracted for employment to the HSE are receive fee support. On completion of the programme of study the psychologists have a 3 year employment commitment to the HSE.<\/p><p>Workforce, Analysis and Informatics, National HR Directorate, HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000067#WRK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":404,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000067#WRK02000"},{"type":"question","counter":405,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[4083\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000067#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the selection process for schools that were selected to teach the new leaving certificate computer science subject; the number of schools that were offered the programme in County Laois; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":406,"content":"<p>The introduction of Computer Science as a Leaving Certificate subject is part of this Government&rsquo;s overall commitment to embed digital technology in teaching and learning.\u00a0 I asked my Department to accelerate the introduction of this exciting new subject into the first phase of schools to September 2018.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As part of the process of identifying schools to participate in Phase 1 of the implementation of the new subject, my Department issued a circular letter (ref 0067\/2017) to all post-primary schools inviting them to apply.

The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the new pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards it will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.<\/p>  <p>  Differential pay scales for newly qualified public servants were introduced by the then Government in 2010.  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher. <\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  A commitment is included in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.  That process has now commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that within 3 months of the passing of the Act, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000068#WRL02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":470,"content":"<p>Question No. 244 answered with Question No. 240.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Private Partnerships","counter":471,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000068#WRL03200"},{"type":"question","counter":472,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[4366\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000068#WRL03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the liquidation of a company (details supplied) will delay the opening of two new schools in County Wicklow; the action his Department is taking to ensure that there will be no delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":473,"content":"<p>The schools referred to by the Deputy form part of the current Schools Bundle 5 PPP programme.

Equality, and last week in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il I outlined the proposal and rationale for opting into the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive under the terms of Protocol 21, annexed to the EU Treaties.\u00a0 I also outlined the process involved with the EU Commission which will take four months to complete as well as the need for interim arrangements between 9th of February and the completion of the opt-in process in order to comply with the decision of the Supreme Court of 30th November last.\u00a0 I am pleased that the Oireachtas has approved the decision of the Government to opt-in thus enabling formal discussions to commence with the EU Commission &ndash; a process which as I have said\u00a0is expected to take 4 months to complete.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>The interim arrangements for the short period prior to opt-in will enable those seeking international protection to access the labour market through the Employment Permits Acts 2003- 2014.  The same rules as currently applies to any non-EEA national seeking access to the labour place will apply to those seeking international protection.\u00a0 I might add that generally, any fees accompanying such access is paid by the employer.\u00a0 In addition, I have decided to use my discretionary powers to introduce, on an administrative basis, for applicants who are 9 months or more without a first instance\u00a0recommendation to allow access to self-employment for eligible applicants.  The full details of this administrative scheme are currently being finalised and will be published prior to the 9th   February.  Any person entering the workforce are subject to Irish employment laws and International Protection applicants will be no different in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined, these are interim measures until the opt-in process is complete. Once this happens, access to the labour market will be underpinned by EU law.\u00a0 The implementation group, chaired by my Department and with representatives from all relevant Departments and Agencies, is currently working through the details, which will include less restrictive access to different categories of work than the\u00a0employment permits regime which will apply in the interim period. Widening access to the labour market is a complex issue needing to take account of a range of factors such as maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area, potential impacts of Brexit and any impacts on the existing\u00a0employment permits regime for non-EEA nationals.  These considerations will be balanced with meeting the Directive&rsquo;s requirement of granting effective access to the labour market, being cognisant of current labour market shortages,\u00a0the skill set of applicants and employment opportunities available in both urban and rural communities.  The arrangements will be subject to review.<\/p>  <p>The group will also be engaged with the European Commission to ensure compliance with each aspect of the Directive &ndash; a process that could only formally commence once the Oireachtas approved the opt-in on 23rd   January and the Commission and European Council\u00a0have been formally notified. It must be stressed that the Directive covers a number of areas other than labour market access, including important provisions in relation to children&rsquo;s rights - including for unaccompanied minors, healthcare and education provision.  The Directive also defines the required material reception conditions for applicants, which includes housing, food, clothing and a daily expenses allowance.\u00a0 Compliance with all of these aspects will be discussed in detail with the EU Commission in the coming period.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Participation in the Directive will, for the first time, place the provision of these material reception conditions for applicants, which are currently provided for under the executive system of Direct Provision, on a statutory basis, underpinned by EU law.<\/p>  <p>  Opting into this Directive will align that process fully with EU norms and standards. \u00a0This is an important and major development and one which has been requested by a number of NGOs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000069#WRM06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Applications","counter":552,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000069#WRM06300"},{"type":"question","counter":553,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[3928\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000069#WRM06400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of applications in the single procedure application system under the International Protection Act 2015; the number of applications that have been processed within the six month target; the waiting times experienced by those persons beyond six months; the length of time to process such applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":554,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[3929\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000069#WRM06500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons awaiting decisions on asylum applications that applied before the provisions of the International Protection Act 2015 came into force; the length of time those persons have been waiting; the length of time to process such applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":555,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[3930\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000069#WRM06600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he is satisfied that the International Protection Office has adequate resources to fulfil its obligations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":556,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 274 to 276, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the International Protection Act 2015 was commenced on 31 December 2016.\u00a0 Every effort is being made to process applications efficiently and in a timely manner, in the context of implementing new processes and procedures and dealing with the transitional arrangements under the new Act.  Added to this is the demand led nature of applications which has meant a specific processing time limit has not been set by Government as suggested by the Deputy.  However, the objective remains that the single application procedure will lead to improvements in case processing times and more timely outcomes for applicants, and work continues towards that objective. \u00a0<\/p><p>The 2015 Act introduced a single procedure that enables all grounds for seeking international protection (refugee status and subsidiary protection) or permission to remain in the State for other reasons to be examined and determined in one process.<\/p><p>At the end of 2017, there were some 5,100 applications awaiting processing in the International Protection Office (IPO).  Some 2,800 of these applications were made before the commencement of the 2015 Act but were not finalised by the former Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) by that date.  These applications reverted to be processed by the IPO under the transitional provisions of the 2015 Act.  Various categories of cases reverted to the IPO including asylum appeals transferred from the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal and asylum and subsidiary protection cases transferred from the former ORAC.  This has added significantly to the IPO&rsquo;s caseload, but has freed up the restructured and resourced Appeals Tribunal process considerably. <\/p><p>Considerable efforts were required by the IPO in getting the new single procedure processes up and running in the first part of 2017.  Notwithstanding, in a consequential shorter processing year, the IPO scheduled over 2,400 single procedure interviews (including in respect of EU relocation cases) once the process was up and running in 2017.  Some 1,780 recommendations\/decisions in respect of international protection and permission to remain have also been made by the IPO.  This includes some 750 recommendations in respect of the grant of international protection.<\/p><p>In relation to the scheduling of interviews and the processing of cases in the IPO, I am also advised that the prioritisation of international protection applications is provided for in the International Protection Act 2015 subject to the need for fairness and efficiency. When the Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2) and other supporting documentation is returned by applicants, the IPO is scheduling applications for interview primarily on the basis of date of application (oldest cases first).  However, certain categories of applicant are also being prioritised such as those who arrive under the Irish refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), from refugee generating countries (such as Syria) and unaccompanied minors.  The IPO&rsquo;s approach to prioritisation has been agreed with the UNHCR, explained to NGOs at the IPO Customer Service Panel and is available on its website<i>: www.ipo.gov.ie<\/i><i>. <\/i><\/p><p>In respect of a non-prioritised application for International Protection made today, it is estimated it will take approximately 19 months to the date of the interview. Prioritised cases can expect to be scheduled more quickly for interview and most cases under the IRPP are being processed in 8-12 weeks.  At the present time, it is not possible to calculate an accurate current median processing time for international protection applications due to the different case types on hands, which were returned to the IPO under the transitional provisions in the 2015 Act. <\/p><p>Considerable additional resources have and are being allocated to the IPO to assist it in undertaking its statutory functions with a view to processing the volume of cases on hands as soon as possible. In 2017, 55 additional staff were assigned to the IPO.  The current staffing complement in that office is now 139.9 (as at 19\/1\/18).  In addition, there are some 50 serving members of the IPO&rsquo;s Legal Processing Panel.  The resources assigned to the IPO are being kept under ongoing review as the State cannot predict how many people will present on our shores seeking international protection.  During last year there was a twenty per cent increase in spontaneous (i.e. excluding relocation and resettlement) applications for International Protection, which has put increased pressure on the system.  Additional resources will be allocated as these become available so that the caseload on hand, both those preceding the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 and the increased volume of new applications are dealt with as quickly as possible and waiting times for those applying for international protection are reduced to the greatest possible extent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000069#WRM06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":558,"content":"<p>Question No. 277 answered with Question No. 271.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000070#WRN00400"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[3979\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000070#WRN00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress made to date on replacing the Communications Retention of Data Act 2011; if it will be assigned to the relevant Oireachtas committee for pre legislative scrutiny; if the European Court of Justice has set a deadline for a new Bill to be enacted in view of the fact that without new legislation it may impact on certain legal cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>On\u00a03 October 2017\u00a0the Government approved my proposals for a new Communications (Retention of Data) Bill\u00a0to replace the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with procedures in place, I\u00a0wrote to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality on 3 October 2017 to ask it to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme\u00a0for the new Communications (Retention of Data) Bill. <\/p>  <p>  The Committee has heard submissions from a range of invited parties, including officials from my Department, and I look forward to receiving the\u00a0Committee's\u00a0report in the context of bringing forward proposals for legislation as a priority.<\/p>  <p>  The Court of Justice of the European Union did not in respect of this area or law and does not generally\u00a0set deadlines for the enactment\u00a0of national legislation.

The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is working with the CSO to resolve an issue which emerged in relation to the classification of homicide offences.  When a homicide occurs, the offence may be classified as murder, manslaughter or violent death.  <\/p>  <p>  My understanding is that all of these cases were subject to investigation but that an issue emerged due to the fact that the classification of a crime may change as investigations evolve; for example, a serious assault may become a murder or manslaughter if the victim subsequently dies, or a murder charge may ultimately need to be reclassified as a manslaughter following Court proceedings.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initiated a review of homicide classifications, initially for the period 2013-2015 but later extended the review to cover the period from 2003-2017.  This is obviously a time consuming and complex process but it is important that both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the CSO are confident that their data is robust and accurate.

This success has been attributed to the Winter Phase of Operation Thor and I would like to commend An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their work under Operation Thor, particularly to combat burglaries as indicated by these provisional figures, while acknowledging that they are not the official figures until such time as they are verified by the CSO.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000071#WRO03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Civilian Staff Data","counter":626,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000071#WRO03400"},{"type":"question","counter":627,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[4316\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000071#WRO03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of civilian staff employed in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the end of each of the years 2010 to 2017, in tabular form; the proportion of total personnel numbers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that this represented at each year end; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":628,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate,\u00a0it is\u00a0the\u00a0Garda Commissioner who has responsibility to carry on and manage and control generally the administration and business of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including\u00a0by arranging for the recruitment, training and appointment of its members and civilian staff.\u00a0<b><\/b><\/p><p>I have set out below in tabular from the year-end number of civilian staff for 2010 to 2017.

The projected 4,000 civilians represents a medium-term target of 20% of the Garda full-time workforce comprised of civilians.  This target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing roles where their skills\u00a0can be used to best effect\u00a0with the backfilling of these\u00a0roles\u00a0by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.\u00a0 The Garda Inspectorate identified some 1,500 posts held by Garda&iacute;\u00a0that could be examined for suitability for civilian staff.<\/p><p>Progress is being made in relation to civilianisation. During 2017 some 200 new civilian posts were sanctioned by\u00a0the Policing Authority with the consent of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The bulk were to address critical skills gaps and capacity\u00a0issues with a proportion sanctioned to make a start on the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing duties. \u00a0Of particular significance is that\u00a0a number of civilians have been appointed to newly created senior leadership posts at Executive Director level to take responsibility for Strategy\u00a0&amp;amp;\u00a0Transformation\u00a0and Legal\u00a0&amp;amp; Compliance. \u00a0It is also\u00a0expected that a Chief Data Officer will be appointed shortly.  These newly created leadership posts support the major reform programme underway within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will assist in bringing diverse perspectives and management skills to the top levels in the organisation. <\/p><p>To ensure that progress on civilianisation continues this year Budget 2018 has provided funding\u00a0for a further 500 civilian staff.\u00a0Civilianisation is a key element of the reform programme that is being pursued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0It will not be done overnight but progress on achieving the target of 20% \u00a0implementation must continue and, indeed, must move at a greater pace.

It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013.  The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly some serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. <\/p>  <p>  The \"Programme for a Partnership Government\" includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures.  In line with this, the Government has in place a plan to achieve a Reserve strength of 2,000 by 2021. With the plan to reach 15,000 Garda members well on track it was possible for the Commissioner and the Public Appointments Service to undertake a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves\u00a0last March\u00a0which attracted 2,394 applicants. It is expected that\u00a0applicants from this campaign will enter training in\u00a0early 2018. <\/p>  <p>  In conjunction with the major expansion of the Reserve over the next number of years, we must ensure that it is used to optimum effect to support effective policing.  To inform future decisions around the use of the Reserve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a strategic review as a matter of priority with a view to completion early this year.  As a first step, the Garda Executive has taken a decision to transfer the management of the Reserve to the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for Community Engagement.

It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013.  The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly some serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the past three years.  <\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to double the Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures.

A review of EP 2025 is being undertaken by the Department in the context of global changes that are likely to have an immediate impact on Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise development, specifically Brexit and potential relevant policy changes under the new US administration.

Policy recommendations to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s productivity performance are set out in the Council&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge report. In 2017, the Council published a report Benchmarking Ireland&rsquo;s Productivity Performance   relative to other countries and the performance of individual sectors within Ireland.

Take-up and awareness of the supports continues at pace with a 40% increase in the numbers of these projects in the last 5 years. Specific supports such as the Innovation Voucher scheme specifically target companies who are new to collaboration and innovation and the Enterprise Ireland Technology Centres and Technology Gateways are charged with continually increasing the number of SMEs they engage in collaborative RDI with every year. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Continue to maximise the drawdown from Horizon 2020.

D\/BEI will continue to monitor Ireland\/ UK participation and potential any opportunities and threats arising from the future disengagement as the work programme for 2018 &ndash; 2020 is rolled out   The Horizon 2020 support network, based in Enterprise Ireland, will continue to drive a strong and continuously increasing drawdown from this important source of non-exchequer funding. To date, Ireland has won &euro;475 million in competitive funding from the Horizon 2020 programme. More than 1,100 applications have been successful for 536 higher education researchers and 430 companies, placing Ireland&rsquo;s success rate above the EU average.   Science Foundation Ireland is undertaking considerable work in this area and has put in place specific targets with SFI Research Centres to maximise the drawdown from H2020 (data available is required)     SFI has focused resources on planning for Brexit. UK will continue to be a power house of research excellence and all efforts must be made to continue the IE\/UK collaborative relationships.   SFI already has a significant number of partnerships with highly-respected international funding agencies.  These include joint programmes with Wellcome  (UK), the Royal Society (UK), the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and the Department for the Economy NI.  These partnerships enable Irish researchers to access prestigious UK funding schemes and to undertake joint projects with their counterparts in the UK.  In addition, they associate Ireland with important international researchers and research funders, thus demonstrating to global stakeholders, industry and the research community alike, the quality of Irish research.   The agency is in negotiations with representatives within UK policy and academia to advance further partnerships to implement joint PhD, Joint Professorship recruitment programmes and bilateral research funding programmes.   Horizon 2020 is the current EU framework programme for research and innovation. A hard Brexit is likely to have a much more significant impact on FP9 than it will on Horizon 2020.   The overall FP budget may be reduced with the UK leaving. The monetary reduction for this is unclear as it will depend on negotiation outcomes.    Until the buy-in from the UK to the EU following Brexit is clarified it is very difficult to clearly map the potential impact of the removal of EU policy and legislation.  It is clear that Ireland must continue to collaborate closely with  researchers and research centres of scientific excellence and strategic relevance in the UK to advance our research endeavours.   Science Foundation Ireland requested an additional &euro;6.5M capital budget in 2018 specifically to advance BREXIT related programme activity (this requested budget was part of a bigger budgetary ask of &euro;53M).

Private sector consultation was carried out in 2017 through the Advisory Group for Small Business and through a wider public consultation that was open to all relevant stakeholders.   The SME Test will be piloted within DBEI on two appropriate pieces of legislation in 2018 prior to a wider roll out across the various Government Departments.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Supplement the Innovation 2020 expenditure target with a measure of R&amp;amp;D intensity relative to GNI <\/td><td>DBEI is tracking R&amp;amp;D expenditure relative to modified GNI (GNI*) and reported on this metric to Cabinet in September 2017. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Consider extending coverage of the Annual Business Survey of Economic Impact to benchmark the prevalence of management practices in Irish-owned and foreign-owned enterprise. <\/td><td>DBEI agrees that improved collection of data on management practices would be hugely beneficial. Additional ABSEI questions on management training spend would be in keeping with the existing quantitative questions and could be relatively easily incorporated. Consideration is being given to the best way of capturing data on management practices and will require discussions with a number of different bodies. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>To drive greater economic impact from public investment in research and development progress proposals for a Research and Technology Office model to complement\/add value to the work of Research and Technology Centres. <\/td><td>In 2017 the Irish Manufacturing Research Technology Centre received an investment of &euro;15 million under an Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland programme to create 40 hi-tech jobs. This centre is now a member of EARTO (the European Association of Research Technology Organisations).    This Department, working with IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland is progressing proposals for the establishment of an Advanced Manufacturing Centre based on the RTO model. Deliverables of an Advanced Manufacturing Centre will include training, technology acceleration and adoption and service delivery.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Examine enterprise RDI support programmes where necessary and appropriate to ensure their comprehensiveness and appropriateness to indigenous enterprise particularly SMEs. <\/td><td>The Enterprise Ireland in-company RDI support for indigenous companies has been substantially improved and optimised in 2018. Changes include increased support for IP protection, improved flexibility to deal with specific client needs, quicker approval and turnaround times, more flexible financing options.   An Agile Innovation Fund was also  launched to support companies to respond more quickly to market opportunities and challenges, including those posed by Brexit. Offering fast-track approval and a streamlined online application process, companies can access up to 50% to support product, process or service development projects with a total cost of up to &euro;300,000.   This substantial redesign to Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s in-company RDI support has also been accompanied by a significant communications campaign to highlight the benefits of RDI and the support Enterprise Ireland can provide.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Strengthen and intensify linkages between indigenous and multinational enterprises. This includes active engagement by the Enterprise Agencies to assist suitable indigenous firms to optimise supply chain business opportunities. Review the impact of the Global Sourcing Initiative. <\/td><td>IDA Ireland has a continued strong relationship with the Global Sourcing Team in Enterprise Ireland (EI).  Each of the operations departments works directly with the team to make introductions for Enterprise Ireland to our clients.     EI&rsquo;s Global Sourcing Team work to make sure the right Irish companies are introduced to IDA&rsquo;s international MNC clients with a view to winning new contracts and the opportunity to partner over time with the MNC around new product\/technology development.   The Global Sourcing Team in EI also organise an annual Ireland Trade Mission led by the Minister.  This involves strong collaboration between EI and IDA to make this happen particularly at a regional level.   Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are actively working to strengthen and intensify linkages between indigenous and multinational enterprises. Based on the Global Sourcing initiative, approximately 60 new contracts have been secured by Irish companies since 2013 totalling at least &euro;20 million. As part of this, in 2017, both agencies held a two day Trade Mission to Ireland. At this event 470 one-to-one meetings were held between 167 Enterprise Ireland clients and 116 IDA Ireland companies. These meetings are invaluable to Irish companies seeking credible access to procurement teams in global MNCs. This was the biggest, most ambitious mission to date and will provide MNCs with direct access to potential suppliers, as well as raising awareness of the innovative capabilities of Irish SMEs across a range of sectors.  A review of the Global Sourcing Initiative will be carried out in due course<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Recommend best international practice to enhance the claim process in Ireland and benchmark personal injury awards internationally. <\/td><td>The Personal Injuries Commission produced its first report in December 2017 which was approved by Government and published on the 7th December 2017.  The Report makes a number of recommendations including the adoption of a standardised and internationally recognised approach to the diagnosis, treatment and report of soft tissue injuries by practitioners who are appropriately competent and trained.  The standardised approach should be along the lines of the South Australian guidelines for best practice management of acute and chronic Whiplash Associated Disorder (WAD). The Personal Injuries Commission has commenced the next phase of its work to benchmark compensation awards in Ireland against other jurisdictions.  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The relevant section of the Report for the Digital Economy and Digital Single Market Unit is pp 136-141.

Enabling companies to tap into external sources of innovation &ndash; locally through EI Technology Centres, EI Technology Gateways and the wider Irish Research System, as well as internationally.\u00a0 The Knowledge Transfer Ireland (KTI) office in EI plays an important role in this regard as a connector and will enable a smoother interaction between industry and academia.  KTIs new online &lsquo;Find RDI Funding&rsquo; tool enables companies find easier access to fund their R&amp;amp;D projects.Through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), Ireland's national pre-procurement programme, EI facilitates and co-funds innovative solutions to specific public sector challenges and needs.  SBIR Ireland&rsquo;s aim is to drive innovation across all sections of the Irish Public Sector.\u00a0 <\/p><p>These enhanced activities, while serving to increase the diversity and scalability of clients will also serve to contribute to a key target in the Government&rsquo;s Innovation 2020 Strategy, namely the doubling of business expenditure on R&amp;amp;D by 2020.<\/p><p>EI's innovation supports enable companies to develop new market opportunities and maximise their business performance.They provide a range of financial and non-financial supports to companies to drive innovative capability across the enterprise base.  To ensure companies throughout Ireland are aware of, and can avail of, Enterprise Ireland innovation supports, the agency has:<\/p><p>- Launched a national media campaign, &lsquo;Global Ambition&rsquo; , to drive awareness of the benefits of innovations via the use of real stories from real companies;<\/p><p>- Redesigned its R&amp;amp;D Fund.  The new Agile Innovation Fund is more streamlined and responsive for companies, especially smaller companies;<\/p><p>- The agency&rsquo;s new company-led diagnostics client engagement model permits Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Development Advisors to direct companies to the most suitable innovation supports based on their business need, stage of development and global ambition.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland will continue to support companies with supports for innovation, competitiveness, management and financial capability to become more resilient in international markets and to compete with other economies as a location for investment.<\/p><p>In regard to innovation performance within FDI companies, today half of IDA Ireland clients invest in R&amp;amp;D and employ over 15,000 people directly in R&amp;amp;D.  The challenge remains to increase the number of MNCs engaged in R&amp;amp;D activity in Ireland so that their activities move them up the value chain.  At the end of the third year of IDA&rsquo;s Strategy, 76 new companies had invested in R&amp;amp;D for the first time in Ireland.<\/p><p>In line with this, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy Winning FDI 2015-2019 outlines a plan to support clients in creating 80,000 new jobs and to win &euro;3bn in new RDI investment projects, including in-house and collaborative RDI projects with companies and universities, and to encourage 120 additional companies across the FDI portfolio to engage in R&amp;amp;D for the first time.<\/p><p>Investment in R&amp;amp;D has the effect of anchoring FDI clients and securing sustainable employment and related benefits to the Irish economy.  Half of IDA&rsquo;s total grant-aid budget is allocated to RDI investments each year.

Article 40 of the Irish Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to form associations and unions.\u00a0 It has been established in a number of legal cases that the constitutional guarantee of the freedom of association does not guarantee workers the right to have their union recognised for the purpose of collective bargaining.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy however that it has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to promote collective bargaining through the laws of this country and through the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations that is premised upon freedom of contract and freedom of association.\u00a0\u00a0There is an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary bargaining process.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Arising from an earlier\u00a0Government commitment to\u00a0bring\u00a0Irish law on employees&rsquo; right to engage in collective bargaining into line with decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act was introduced in August 2015.  In the lead up to this legislation,\u00a0in-depth consultations with stakeholders, including employer and worker representatives, took place.  <\/p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into effect in\u00a0August 2015 provides an improved framework in this area\u00a0for\u00a0employees&rsquo; right to engage in collective bargaining.  The 2015 Act provides a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality can be assessed where collective bargaining does not take place.  <\/p>  <p>  The Act\u00a0ensures that such workers, aided by a trade union, can advance claims about remuneration and conditions of employment and have these determined by the Labour Court based on comparisons with similar companies.  It provides definitions of key terms as well as guidelines to help the Labour Court identify if internal bargaining bodies are genuinely independent of their employer, and policies and principles for the Labour Court to follow when assessing the comparability of the remuneration and conditions in dispute.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the improved framework introduced in the 2015 Act, a statutory Code of Practice on Victimisation was adopted\u00a0in October 2015 that includes an explicit prohibition on the use by employers of inducements (financial or otherwise) designed specifically to have staff forego collective representation by a trade union.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the 2015 Act,\u00a0combined with the Code of Practice on Victimisation, provide strong protections\u00a0in the area of\u00a0collective bargaining in this country and I\u00a0have no plans to introduce further legislation in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000072#WRP06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Expenditure","counter":711,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000073#WRQ00300"},{"type":"question","counter":712,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[4470\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000073#WRQ00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the reason the details of her expenses have not been uploaded to her Department&rsquo;s website since July 2017; and her plans to ensure these are made available.

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.<\/p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.

The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring\/Summer session 2018.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that: <\/p><p>- There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation; <\/p><p>- There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;  <\/p><p>- Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and <\/p><p>- The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>The draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill were circulated to other government Departments and have been the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is hoped to circulate a revised Memo for Government and General Scheme shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.

The BSSD is an essential piece of legislation which protects the public, patients, workers and others from all forms of ionising radiation.<\/p>  <p>  My Department conducted a general consultation on the BSSD in June 2017 and sought views on the provisions of the Directive where Member States had discretion.

The seasonal influenza immunisation campaign is one of the cornerstones of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Initiative Plan.  The HSE launched their influenza immunisation campaign for winter 2017-18 on 2 October 2017.  The primary focus is to increase vaccination rates among healthcare workers and among at risk groups. <\/p><p>The initial reports indicate an increase in the numbers receiving the vaccine this year:<\/p><p>- Health Care Workers in Acute Hospitals - the uptake is now 37.9%, which is higher than the total uptake last winter (33.7%); <\/p><p>- Health Care Workers in Long Term Care Facilities - this is now 32.2% (up from 27% at the end of the last flu season). The uptake of vaccine in long term residents is now 89.9%; <\/p><p>- At risk groups - over 900,000 vaccines distributed an increase of 109,000 on last year; <\/p><p>- Immunisation of over-65s. To date uptake is 61.9% (an increase of 3% on the same period last year);  <\/p><p>- Other at risk groups - PCRS figures indicate that 180-200,000 medical card\/GP services card holders have received the vaccine.<\/p><p>However, these figures are preliminary and more detailed information will be available in 2018.<\/p><p>The influenza vaccine purchased by HSE is based on WHO advice on the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2017\/8 northern hemisphere Flu season. It is recommended that trivalent vaccines for use in the 2017-2018 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following: <\/p><p>- an A\/Michigan\/45\/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;  <\/p><p>- an A\/Hong Kong\/4801\/2014 (H3N2)-like virus; and <\/p><p>- a B\/Brisbane\/60\/2008-like virus.<\/p><p>The WHO issued this advice on 2 March 2017.  This season (2017\/18) the HSE procured the trivalent inactivated Influenza vaccine (Split Virion) BP seasonal influenza vaccine for all those in the recommended at risk groups and health care workers and carers.  The trivalent vaccine used in Ireland is the most widely used influenza vaccine in Europe.  The initial evidence suggests that the vaccine provides higher protection against the Influenza A strains than recent years (H3N2 &amp;amp; H1N1). While it is less effective against the B strains predominating this year, people who received the flu vaccine in recent years should still have some residual immunity.<\/p><p>In Ireland the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) an independent committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland which comprises experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics, and public health makes recommendation on vaccination policy in Ireland.  Their recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  I am aware that NIAC is considering the need to expand the current recommendations for influenza vaccine, including the potential community wide benefit of extending recommendations to include all children.. <\/p><p>The HSE National Immunisation Office and HSE Procurement are responsible for the purchase of influenza vaccine.  To ensure vaccine supply, this tender process must be completed 9 months in advance of the first delivery into Ireland at the end of August.  I have been informed by the HSE that the Executive has already completed and awarded the tender for the supply of trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine for 2018\/19 at a cost of &euro;3.2- 4 million (depending on whether contingency doses are procured).

In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.<\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p>  <p>  There are other arrangements which protect people from excessive medicine costs.  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, since 1 January 2018, no individual or family pays more than &euro;134 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.

In order to avoid distress to patients and their families, I am advised that the SCA, that wherever it is proper to do so and based on expert medical and legal advice, that the breaches of duty are admitted at the earliest possible opportunity.  However, many of these cases, particularly those involving catastrophic injuries, are very complex in nature and require time to investigate and verify the cause and the liability.

The report was considered by government in January 2009 which agreed the implementation process.  The overall objective of the Commission was to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure that safety and quality of care for patients is paramount within the healthcare system.<\/p><p>The Commission made 134 recommendations concerning the provision of a high-quality health service delivered in an effective way in a safe environment.  The recommendations covered a broad array of areas, including issues related to: <\/p><p>- Involvement of Patients, Carers and Service-Users, including communications and open disclosure; <\/p><p>- Leadership and Accountability in the system, including governance, management and reporting structures, education, training and research;  <\/p><p>- Organisational and Professional Regulatory Framework, including licensing of healthcare facilities, regulation of healthcare professionals and credentialing; and  <\/p><p>- Quality Improvement and Learning Systems, including clinical effectiveness evidence-based practice, clinical audit, adverse event reporting, medication safety, health information and technology. <\/p><p>The implementation plan endorsed by the Commission recommended the immediate establishment of an Implementation Steering Group (ISG) to report to the Minister for Health and Children regarding progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the report. Government approval was given on 27 January 2009 to set up such an ISG to drive the implementation of all the recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Report.  The ISG was set up in May\/June 2009 and met 12 times in the period June 2009 &ndash; December 2010. The Implementation Group published a Report on 10 March 2011, which is available at<\/p><p><i> .<\/i><\/p><p>Key areas in relation to patient safety and healthcare quality continue to be developed. An update on these items is set out below. It should also be noted that the National Patient Safety Office (NPSO) was established by the Minister for of Health in December 2016 and is progressing a programme of legislation, policy changes and the promotion of the clinical effectiveness agenda. <\/p><p>Programme of Patient Safety Legislation<\/p><p>Legislation on licensing of public and private healthcare providers &ndash; the Cabinet approved the general scheme of the Patient Safety (Licensing) Bill in December 2018 and it has now been forwarded to the Oireachtas in order for drafting to commence and to allow the Bill to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas Health Committee.  The Bill will introduce a licensing system for all hospitals, public and private, as well as certain designated high risk activities which take place in other settings.  The Bill will provide for regulations which licensees must abide by, while the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) will be the licensing authority.  The Bill will also place a heavy emphasis on clinical governance arrangements, to ensure that hospitals are engaging in best practice with regard to accountability mechanisms.<\/p><p>Mandatory reporting of serious adverse events is provided for in the patient safety elements of the Health Information and Patient Safety (HIPS) Bill, which underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in January 2016  at the then Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  In relation to the policy of open disclosure on patient safety incidents, Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 provides a framework for clinicians and other relevant personnel to engage in open disclosure with a patient and their families when an adverse incident has occurred. Regulations arising from the passage of the Bill will be brought forward shortly.<\/p><p>Standards<\/p><p>HIQA have statutory responsibility for the formulation of standards, which are then forwarded for consideration by the Minister as to whether they should be introduced into the healthcare system. The National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare, in place since 2012, provide the overarching framework for the current approach to standards, with others e.g. the National Standards for Safer Better Maternity Service (December 2016) flowing from that. HIQA also develop standards for Health Information governance, to ensure interoperability of systems. <\/p><p>Clinical Effectiveness- National Clinical Guidelines and Clinical Audit<\/p><p>The National Clinical Effectiveness Committee was established in 2010. Its terms of reference are:<\/p><p>1. Provide strategic leadership for the national clinical effectiveness agenda.<\/p><p>2.  Contribute to national patient safety and quality improvement agendas.<\/p><p>3.  Publish standards for clinical practice guidance. <\/p><p>4.  Publish guidance for National Clinical Guidelines and National Clinical Audit. <\/p><p>5.  Prioritise and quality assure National Clinical Guidelines and National Clinical Audit. <\/p><p>6.  Commission National Clinical Guidelines and National Clinical Audit. <\/p><p>7.  Align National Clinical Guidelines and National Clinical Audit with implementation levers. <\/p><p>8.  Report periodically on the implementation and impact of National Clinical Guidelines and the performance of National Clinical Audit. <\/p><p>9.  Establish sub-committees for NCEC workstreams.<\/p><p>Publish an Annual Report.<\/p><p>To date the NCEC has published 16 National Clinical Guidelines and one National Clinical Audit. <\/p><p>Health information and ICT:<\/p><p>The Government approved and published the <i>eHealth strategy<\/i>in 2013 for developing eHealth and ICT capability in the Irish health system.  This strategy sets out a number of objectives and a road map for the delivery and implementation of eHealth for the benefit of patients by supporting a more patient centred approach and also underpinning patient safety and efficiency.  The <i>Knowledge &amp;amp; Information strategy,<\/i>published in 2014 by the Office of the Chief Information Officer in the HSE, builds upon the eHealth strategy and outlines how integrated information and enabling technology will support the delivery of innovative, safe and high quality patient care to meet the needs of our population across all patient pathways and care settings.<\/p><p>Significant progress has been made on both strategies since their publication.  This includes the establishment of eHealth Ireland, the appointment of a Chief Information Officer for the HSE, the establishment of the eHealth Ireland Advisory Committee and the Irish eHealth Ecosystem.<\/p><p>Progress has also been made in relation to the implementation of the Health Identifiers Act 2014, which provides for a system of unique identification for patients, professionals and providers, via an Individual Health Identifier (IHI).  My Department has worked closely with HIQA on the development of a system of identifiers.  The Individual health Identifier initiative aims to enhance patient data security and confidentiality and support administrative efficiency.  This was a key recommendation of the Commission on Patient Safety. <\/p><p>On 30 May 2017, a Commencement Order and Regulations under the Health Identifiers Act 2014 were signed, allowing the further progression of the implementation of the IHI.<\/p><p>The HSE have also developed a business case for the implementation of an electronic health care record (EHR) in Ireland.  The roll-out of electronic health records was also a recommendation called for in the Commission on Patient Safety.  The business case sets out a number of investment scenarios including timescales for implementation and roll out.  The Department of Health is currently working closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on an approval mechanism for the EHR business case.<\/p><p>Progress has been achieved with the roll-out of the Maternity and New-born Clinical Management System (MN-CMS), which is the design and implementation of an electronic health record for all women and babies in maternity services in Ireland, went live in Cork in December 2016 with Kerry following in March 2017, the Rotunda in November 2017 and the National Maternity Hospital in January 2018.  In each location the new MN-CMS successfully replaced paper processes with efficient digital processes.<\/p><p>The delivery of digital health care services will require a robust legal framework to ensure confidentiality and security of patient data consistent with the new EU data protection regulation, Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 (General Data Protection Regulation).  The GDPR will have a significant effect on how and where data is gathered and the purpose for which it is used.  My Department is currently examining the appropriate information framework that will provide the optimum environment to support future developments in eHealth. In this context, a public consultation was carried out in late 2017 seeking views of the public and other stakeholders on the proposals to inform the drafting of a national health information policy in 2018.  My Department is working closely with the Department of Justice and Equality in relation to Data Protection Bill 2017 which will provide mechanisms to enable the health service to develop legislative capability to support the processing of personal health data in and across the health system that promotes health services goals and builds public confidence in how health information is used in the context of the General Data Protection Regulation.  In addition to the provisions in the new Data Protection Bill there are also legislative provisions in the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill that will provide robust support for the best use of information to support health and social care goals.<\/p><p>Increases in capital spending and resources have been facilitated and the capacity and capability of HSE ICT to successfully undertake large scale ICT projects have been further developed, which will see continued progression on the area of ICT and eHealth.  Delivery of eHealth is also being examined in the context of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which advocates the <i>&ldquo;Continued strong support of the e-health strategy<\/i>&ndash; <i>particularly ensuring the necessary funding for timely roll-out of the EHR system<\/i>&rdquo;.  The report is currently being reviewed by my Department in the context of its implementation and with a particular focus on further implementing the eHealth strategy and a National Electronic Health record.  Additional investment in eHealth and ICT was secured for the period 2018-2021 as part of the Mid-Term Capital Review.  The capital provision for eHealth and ICT for 2018 to 2021 is set out below and will allow for a multi-annual rolling programme of work on multiple projects including the capital ICT elements of the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital.<table><tr><th>2018<\/th><th>2019<\/th><th>2020<\/th><th>2021<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;60m<\/td><td>&euro;85m<\/td><td>&euro;100m<\/td><td>&euro;120m<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Professional Regulation:<\/p><p>Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland<\/p><p>On 21 December 2011, the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 was signed into law.  This Act updated the provisions relating to the regulation of nurses and midwives.  It has been commenced in three stages with the exception of Part 11 - Maintenance of Professional Competence, and any provisions of the Act associated with that part.  The Board's functions are to safeguard the public - this requires the Board to establish procedures and criteria for establishing and maintaining the register of nurses and midwives.  Additionally, the Board sets the standards for and approves education programmes for the purposes of registration and continued registration and keeps these programmes under review.  The Board also sets standards of practice and provides support for registered nurses and midwives. This includes developing, publishing and reviewing the code of professional conduct and ethics and providing guidance on clinical practice.  It also provides guidance on how nurses and midwives should provide care to patients, their families and society. Through its fitness to practice functions, the Board is responsible for considering complaints against nurses and midwives.  <\/p><p>CORU<\/p><p>Work continues on the phased implementation of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act, 2005, with the number of professions designated for regulation under the Act having increased from 12 to 15  14 professions (rising to 16 in the coming weeks months). In terms of protection of the public, as of now, 12,500 health and social care professionals are registered by CORU.  Eleven registers of the designated professions have been established and the titles of 7 now fully protected in law. Registration Boards for a further 3 professions are appointed and working hard towards opening their registers as soon as possible.<\/p><p>With a view to further strengthening protection of the public and ensuring more robust governance of health profession regulatory bodies a <i>Regulated Health Professions Bill<\/i>amending all five regulatory Acts is to be published in Q.2 and work has commenced on the preparation of the general scheme of a new Dental Bill.<\/p><p>Continuous Professional Development (CPD) is an integral component in the continuing provision of safe and effective services by health and social care professionals registered by CORU under the 2005 Act, for the benefit of service users.  In order to ensure that registrants keep their professional skills and knowledge up to date, the Registration Board for each profession issues and updates CPD standards and requirements specific to the profession.  Each registrant must engage in a range of CPD activities on an ongoing basis, complete 30 CPD credits in a 12 month period, demonstrate that the CPD activities are relevant to their professional role, taking account of current and future practice and maintain an up to date CPD portfolio. <\/p><p>A Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics<b><\/b>is developed by each Registration Board and is specific to each profession.  The code is developed following consultation with the general public, members of the profession, their representative bodies and employers.  The Code sets out the standards of conduct, performance and ethics which a member of the profession must adhere to throughout the course of their work.  All registrants must abide by the a statutory Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics and on applying for registration must verify that they have read, understood and agreed to abide by the Code for their profession.  They must also sign a statutory declaration stating that fact.<\/p><p>Both the Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics and the CPD Standards are living documents which are reviewed and update on a rolling basis.  Open communication principles, standards and patient safety \/protection of the public are central to the provisions of these documents.  <\/p><p>Medication Safety<\/p><p>A subgroup of the Medication Safety Forum was formed to prepare a report on the problems and solutions surrounding unlicensed medicines and medicines shortages.  This report forms the basis of the work being undertaken by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in its new function of leading the coordination of efforts by national agencies to manage medicines shortages.<\/p><p>S.I No. 272 of 2012; S.I. No. 273 of 2012; and S.I. No 274 of 2012 transposed amendments to our national legislation to strengthen the European-wide system for monitoring the safety of medicines.<\/p><p>Since July 2012, all new medicinal products must now have a Risk Management Plan which focuses on the assessment and minimisation of important risks associated with the medicine throughout its life cycle.<\/p><p>Risk minimisation measures are interventions intended to: prevent or reduce the occurrence of adverse reactions; maximise the benefit risk; exclude patients where use is contraindicated; or educate a target audience about safe and effective use of medicinal products.  Additional risk minimisation measures will be identified in the risk minimisation plan for a particular medicinal product.<\/p><p>Direct Healthcare Professional Communications (DHPCs) are used to deliver important safety information directly to healthcare professionals.  These communications inform of a safety concern and advise on what action needs to be taken to minimise a concern. Periodic Safety Review Reports provide an opportunity to re-evaluate the safety profile of a medicine and to review any new safety information that has been reported.  Pharmaceutical companies are legally required to prepare PSURs for all authorised medicines and these are then assessed by the HPRA either nationally or in collaboration with other regulatory authorities in other member states in the EU.  Following assessment of the information provided, updates to the product safety information may be considered necessary or safety concerns which require further consideration may be referred for review at a European level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000079#WRW04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":1070,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000079#WRW04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1071,"qnumday":474,"qnumall":"[4627\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000079#WRW04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to introduce a device (details supplied) under the long-term illness scheme for type 1 diabetes; if his attention has been drawn to the device and that it has been introduced in the UK; if research has been carried out on the amount it could save; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1072,"content":"<p>Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the administration of the community drug schemes; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000079#WRW04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Provision","counter":1073,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000079#WRW04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1074,"qnumday":475,"qnumall":"[4641\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000079#WRW04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an additional emergency ambulance fleet will be allocated in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim; the extra funding that will be provided to the ambulance service in the north west in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1075,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000079#WRW04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":1077,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000079#WRW04800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy Negotiations","counter":1076,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000079#WRW04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1077,"qnumday":476,"qnumall":"[4598\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000079#WRW04800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he has spoken to his other EU colleagues regarding CAP post 2020.","asker":"1224","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1078,"content":"<p>Discussions on the future of CAP post-2020 have been afoot since the middle of 2016 at many forums.

This contrasts with other EU member states which have had severe difficulties in negotiating\u00a0successful renewals of their derogations.<\/p>  <p>  The achievement of securing the renewal of the derogation is a significant milestone in the context of an expanding dairy herd and increasing milk production.  While there are some additional stipulations attached to the derogation, these are the outcome of\u00a0year long negotiations with the Commission and two separate public consultations.\u00a0 It was important when seeking the renewal that Ireland demonstrated commitment to tackling agricultural impacts on water.<\/p>  <p>  The measures in Ireland&rsquo;s derogation take account of the growing numbers of derogation farmers who are farming at intensive stocking rates, and also environmental objectives for water, climate change and ammonia which Ireland must achieve.  Furthermore, opportunities for large savings on farms through better grassland management and improved timing and application of fertiliser have been taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  Agriculture is responsible for 98% of ammonia emissions and, under the National Emissions Ceiling Directive, Ireland must reduce these\u00a0emissions by 5%, by 2030 compared to 2005.  Research has shown that ammonia losses from slurry are significantly reduced by slurry application in the springtime and also by using low emission slurry spreading (LESS) equipment.  Consequently the timeframes for slurry application stipulated in this measure will be effective in\u00a0reducing ammonia losses.  The new measure will assist farmers to deliver their production targets, reduce their greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions and reduce the risk of runoff to water quality.<\/p>  <p>  In order to\u00a0help farmers with the purchase of LESS equipment, support is\u00a0provided under\u00a0the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme known as TAMS II is, subject to the terms and conditions of the Scheme, at a general grant rate of 40% rising to 60% for qualifying Young Farmers.

There are currently approximately\u00a025,000 herds\u00a0covered between\u00a0the two\u00a0schemes.  <\/p>  <p>  Whilst France retained a coupled suckler payment from 2005, Ireland chose the option of decoupling Pillar I direct payments from production to allow producers\u00a0respond appropriately to changing markets.  This approach and the range of supports as currently\u00a0configured represents a balance between direct income support for the sector and rural development measures designed to improve its competitiveness and sustainability.  <\/p>  <p>  Any introduction of a coupled suckler cow\u00a0payment\u00a0under Pillar I would necessitate a linear\u00a0reduction in all\u00a0farmer's existing BPS of approximately\u00a0&euro;175 million, based on the number of suckler cows\u00a0in the most recent AIM statistics, to fund such a scheme.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000081#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Retirements","counter":1157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000081#WRY00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1158,"qnumday":503,"qnumall":"[4968\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000081#WRY00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of persons at assistant principal level under the aegis of his Department due to retire in the next six months due to age in counties Galway, Mayo, Roscommon and Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1159,"content":"<p>I can confirm that\u00a0no staff\u00a0at Assistant Principal\u00a0level in my\u00a0department based in the counties mentioned are\u00a0due to retire on age grounds\u00a0in the next six months.   <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that, following the Government\u00a0Decision of December 2017 to increase the compulsory retirement age to 70 for public service employees recruited before 1 April 2004, the Department of Public Expenditure and\u00a0Reform published Circular 21\/2017 effective from 5th December 2017.

Some examples, in the case of enterprises, \u00a0include an EV Purchase Grant which provides grant aid of up to &euro;3,800 towards the purchase of a new Battery EV (BEV) or new Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV); VRT reliefs of up to &euro;5,000 for BEVs and PHEVs; and\u00a00% Benefit in Kind without mileage conditions for Battery Electric Vehicles.  <\/p>  <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is currently developing an Electric Vehicle Public Engagement Programme which will include commercial fleet trials as well as an awareness campaign to highlight the benefits of electric vehicles and the supports that are available.  <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are co-chairing a Low Emission Vehicles (LEV) Task Force to consider further measures and options available to accelerate the deployment of low emission vehicles.  The work of this Task Force has been divided into two phases with the first phase focusing solely on electric vehicles.  The second phase will examine other low emission technologies.  <\/p>  <p>  Energy Infrastructure in the context of climate and renewable energy targets<\/p>  <p>  Over the last decade EirGrid has placed a key emphasis in ensuring that the national electricity transmission grid is adaptable and flexible and also contributes to helping Ireland achieve our 2020 and 2030 targets.  As a country, we are now able to integrate over 60% of our renewable electricity onto the grid, meaning that Ireland has become a world leader in the integration of renewables onto the electricity grid.  This has been recently recognised by the European Commission who have awarded an EirGrid-led consortium &euro;20m in Horizon 2020 funding for the &ldquo;Sysflex&rdquo; project, that seeks to explore how the successful integration of renewables in Ireland might be transferred to the wider European electricity grid.  EirGrid&rsquo;s stated aim is to increase renewables penetration to at least 75% by end of 2020.  In addition, proposals for enhanced electricity interconnection to the UK and France are actively being pursued by project promoters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000081#WRY03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Efficiency","counter":1184,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000081#WRY03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1185,"qnumday":512,"qnumall":"[4061\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000081#WRY03600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the details of the recently announced energy efficiency scheme for those in receipt of turf-cutting compensation; the way in which interested parties can submit an application; the types of work covered on the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1186,"content":"<p>Ireland is making progress on improving the energy efficiency of our residential sector, with a view to maximising progress towards our national target to improve energy efficiency by 20% by 2020.

Such measures deliver energy efficiency savings for the lowest cost, and have helped build public awareness of energy efficiency in the residential sector.

SEAI will fund up to 50% of the total capital and project management costs.  The Deep Retrofit pilot will inform a model that can make deep retrofit available to individual homeowners on a larger scale, and critically will help Ireland move away from fossil fuels to clean renewable heating systems.

The responsibility for emissions reduction is a collective one and Ireland's emission reduction targets are national and not sectorial in nature.  A reduction in carbon emissions of at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 has been collectively targeted across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors, in parallel with an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector. <\/p>  <p>  To progress this objective and place transport firmly on a decarbonisation pathway we are deploying a diverse range of measures, key among them being the increased uptake and operation of cleaner alternative fuels and technologies as well as promoting modal shift to public transport and active travel modes where possible.  A wide-ranging set of transport mitigation measures and corresponding action points are detailed in the National Mitigation Plan and it is anticipated that these measures will develop further as climate research and technological innovations progress.<\/p>  <p>  It is worthwhile noting that a number of successful mitigation measures have been introduced which have impacted and are positively addressing greenhouse gas emissions from transport.  They include sustained investment in the public and sustainable transport network, implementation of EU vehicle standard regulations limiting tail pipe emissions, redesigning the Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) and motor tax regimes to promote low carbon emitting vehicles, incentives to encourage alternative fuel and technologies, and the introduction of a Biofuel Obligation Scheme.<\/p>  <p>Yet, the transport sector needs to build on these and go further to address this challenge.  A series of measures announced in Budget 2018 clearly reflected this Government&rsquo;s determination to make progress on decarbonising transport.  I am pleased to have secured significant funding commitments to actively address the climate challenge on three key fronts.  Firstly, we are working to enhance the capacity and quality of public transport to ensure that, as far as possible and practical, our increased transport demand is met by greener public transport (over &euro;400m will be invested in public transport infrastructure in 2018 alone with a 4 year capital envelope of over &euro;2.5bn).  Secondly, we will invest over &euro;100m in a multi-annual cycling and walking programme to support greater uptake of active travel. And, as recommended by the Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce, a suite of tax and expenditure measures was announced to clearly indicate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a low-carbon electric vehicle future.<\/p>  <p>  The MLR Project is an extremely complex multi annual project involving the merging of two totally different data sets.  The current focus of the project is in relation to the linking of driver and vehicle records, which supports the requirement for the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  The first phase of the MLR matching project is complete.  This phase involved associating vehicle owner records with driver records by matching on name and address details.

Families will qualify for an income-based subsidy based on parental income and, parents&rsquo; who are\u00a0in work or training will be approved for the\u00a0maximum number of hours of subsidy available.  Some families will qualify for the scheme for other reasons and more detail relating to this\u00a0is included later in this answer.  The scheme's approach to eligibility for maximum hours for those in work or in training is based on evidence\u00a0regarding how to achieve\u00a0the best outcomes for children and families.<\/p>  <p>  When parents are engaged in work (including part-time work and labour market activation programmes) or in education or training, they will be eligible for an enhanced subsidy of up to 40 hours per week.  When parents are not in work or training, childcare will be subsidised on a standard basis of up to a maximum of\u00a015 hours per week.  I believe that this is a reasonable approach for the majority of children and families.<\/p>  <p>  It will mean that this Scheme is open &ndash; albeit for standard hours rather than enhanced hours &ndash; to parents who are not taking part in work or training, but who choose to avail of up to 15 hours of childcare per week.  In the case of school going children, the child development objectives are met through school-going hours and, as such, the 15 standard hours of childcare applies to non-term time.<\/p>  <p>  The Childcare Support Bill 2017, as published, will enable me to make regulations that specify definitions of \"work\" and \"study\" for the purposes of the Scheme.  When setting out these definitions, I intend to adopt an inclusive approach that recognises the diversity of progression routes towards labour market participation, particularly for those who are distant from the labour market.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that, where a parent is at home and not engaged in any relevant form of work or study,\u00a0a family with school age children\u00a0will not benefit from subsidised after-school childcare.  However, I believe it is important that the Scheme should actively support labour market participation through linking the number of hours of subsidy to a family&rsquo;s need for childcare for the purpose of work, education or training.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a small but important group of families for whom childcare is needed on child welfare grounds or for whom childcare is a necessary early intervention support.  Under the current subvention schemes Tusla and the HSE may make referrals for subvention for such families.<\/p>  <p>  For the Affordable Childcare Scheme, the Childcare Support Bill 2017 specifies five statutory bodies that may provide referrals for free or additional childcare: Tusla, the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills (in relation to parents who are under 18), the Department of Justice and Equality (in relation to asylum seekers and programme refugees), and Local Authorities (in relation to homeless children and children transitioning out of homelessness).<\/p>  <p>  It is proposed that, where such a referral is made, families would automatically qualify for a subsidy under the Affordable Childcare Scheme without having to satisfy any income or work\/study test.  The referring body would recommend the hours of childcare needed, which may - depending on the referring body and the needs of the family - be for up to full-time childcare.  The Scheme would then provide the maximum rate of subsidy in respect of those hours of care, and no payment would be asked of the parents in these circumstances.  This approach is consistent with current practice under the Community Childcare Subvention scheme and is critical to supporting strong child welfare and protection practices.  My officials are currently in discussion with the relevant statutory bodies in relation to the way in which this referral process will operate in the Affordable Childcare Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000083#WRAA05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Private Partnerships Data","counter":1324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000083#WRAA05800"},{"type":"question","counter":1325,"qnumday":560,"qnumall":"[4429\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000083#WRAA05900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the public private partnerships her Department is currently engaged in; the name, cost and timeframe of each; the names of all private parties involved; the nature of each project in terms of design, build, maintain and so on, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1326,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department is not currently\u00a0engaged in any public private partnerships.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000083#WRAA06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education Data","counter":1328,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000084#WRBB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1329,"qnumday":561,"qnumall":"[4492\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000084#WRBB00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the demand for places under the early childhood care and education scheme in County Cork; the way in which deficits are being made up in local areas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1330,"content":"<p>There are currently 2,359 children availing of the Early Childhood Care and Education scheme (ECCE) in services in Cork City and a further 10,419 children at services in Cork County.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Having conducted an analysis of ECCE capacity my Department is confident that there will be no shortfall in places for the 2017-2018 programme year.

This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome.   The new TCA with substantial HomeCaring credits will be available to all people who reached pension age after 1st September 2012, when the revised rate bands took effect.<\/p>  <p>  Under the new arrangements a person who has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  This means, regardless of when a person started working, they may only need 20 years of paid PRSI contributions, over the course of 50 years, to receive a maximum rate pension, if they also have home-making periods.  If they had periods of unemployment or illness where they received credited contributions, they may use up to 10 years of such contributions for such periods, subject to an overall cap of 20 years.  People who were in receipt of Invalidity or Widows Contributory Pensions at retirement age will generally receive a maximum rate pension, regardless of this calculation.<\/p>  <p>The new TCA for pensioners assessed under the 2012 rate band changes, comes into effect from 30 March 2018.  The Department will invite over 40,000 pensioners, currently assessed under the 2012 rate band changes, to have their pensions recalculated under TCA to determine if they qualify for a higher rate of entitlement.  However, as it will take time to design and set up administrative processes, and the necessary IT systems, the Department expects to send out the invitations from the fourth quarter of 2018, and to begin payments, including arrears for any period from 30 March 2018, from Q1 2019.<\/p>  <p>  This measure will allow those who reached pension age since September 2012, and were negatively impacted upon by the yearly averaging system and\/or lack of recognition of home-making periods pre-1994, to benefit from TCA.  It will not, however, remove the situation where some people may receive a maximum rate pension for little over 10 years contributions, for example where they moved here in their early 50s.  This anomaly will only be removed when the Yearly Average calculation system has been abolished.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisioned that from 2020, all new pensioners will be assessed under the final Total Contributions Approach.  The final design of this model will be subject to broad public consultation later this year and the final model will then be presented to Government for approval.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000084#WRBB05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Question Heading for question(s)  578","counter":1379,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000084#WRBB05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1380,"qnumday":578,"qnumall":"[3961\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000084#WRBB05400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of gender recognition certificates issued in each of the years 2015, 2016 and 2017.","asker":"1434","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1381,"content":"<p>A Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) can be issued to a person who:<\/p><p>- has his\/her birth recorded in either the register of births or the adopted children register maintained by an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir  (General Register Office); or<\/p><p>- is registered on the foreign birth register maintained by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade; or<\/p><p>- is registered in the register of intercountry adoptions maintained by the Adoption Authority of Ireland; or<\/p><p>- is ordinarily resident in Ireland; AND<\/p><p>- is at least 18 years of age on the date of application.<\/p><p>Under Section 12 of the Gender Recognition Act of 2015, an application for a GRC made on behalf of a child who has attained the age of 16 but not 18 years, may only be considered if furnished with an order from the Circuit Family Court.

In November 2014 the Board of the Citizens Information Board decided to restructure the governance arrangements of local CIS and MABS services.  In October 2016, the Board decided that the new structure should be regionally based and in February 2017 the Board of CIB adopted a recommendation that the current structure of ninety three individual local companies would be replaced by sixteen new regional companies, comprising eight CIS and eight MABS boards.<\/p>  <p>  The changes are being made at local company board level only.  The new regional companies are being set up as voluntary bodies, with their own governing Boards of Directors, in line with best governance practice.  CIB under its existing remit is empowered to provide funding to the new regional companies.<\/p>  <p>  The valuable work carried out by those employed by CIS and MABS services and those who volunteer in CIS cervices countrywide will continue as heretofore.  The staff and boards of individual local CIS and MABS companies have been assured by CIB that there will be no change to the terms and conditions of staff, no job losses for those working in the services, no diminution of existing services, no closures of service delivery points and, crucially, no disruption to services for those who use them.<\/p>  <p>  CIB has taken this operational decision following years of analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model.  The aim of the change is to improve the effectiveness of the control environment, financial management and governance of the CIS and MABS networks, which are 100% State-funded.  The change is also about consolidating managerial and administrative efforts, focussing on front line service delivery to citizens, improving the consistency and quality of service delivery and, where possible, extending services for those who rely on them.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000085#WRCC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Data","counter":1416,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000085#WRCC03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1417,"qnumday":594,"qnumall":"[4163\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000085#WRCC03200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"to set out the number of persons in receipt of rent supplement that transferred to HAP per annum in each of the years 2013 to 2017 and to date in 2018; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1418,"content":"<p>Rent supplement plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting approximately 34,400 recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;180 million for in 2018.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the strategic policy direction of the Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support with the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme on a statutory phased basis from September 2014.<\/p><p>The HAP scheme is available nationwide from 1 March 2017, and there are currently some 32,000 active HAP tenancy arrangements of which almost 9,000 are direct transfers from rent supplement.

This Circular was deemed effective from the 5th December 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 provides that Civil Servants appointed on or before 1 April 2004, shall retire upon reaching the retiring age of 65. The Government recently agreed to increase the compulsory retirement age to age 70 for public service employees recruited before 1 April 2004, other than the uniformed pension fast accrual group (Garda&iacute;, Prison Officers, Firefighters, Permanent Defence Force) and to the drafting of legislation to give effect to that decision. The Government also agreed that, in advance of the legislation coming into effect, interim arrangements could be introduced for serving public servants affected by that decision who reach the age of 65 between the date of the Government Decision and the coming into effect of the necessary legislation, to enable them to remain in place until they reach the age of eligibility for the CSP (age 66 at present, rising to age 67 on 1 January 2021 and to age 68 on 1 January 2028). The purpose of Circular 21\/2017 is to detail the nature of those interim arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of circular 21\/2017, Before a retention is approved, the Government Department or Office should be satisfied that the officer&rsquo;s health, conduct and performance is satisfactory and that a business need exists to warrant the retention, i.e. that a continuing role is available for the applicant for the duration of the period up to the age of eligibility for the CSP. Any civil servant who wishes to apply for retention under the terms of this Circular should apply to the appropriate person at least 8 weeks before reaching the age of 65. Any civil servant whose retention is approved under this Circular must sign an undertaking indicating that he\/she accepts the terms and conditions of retention as set out in the Circular before the retention is commenced, and in particular their understanding that retention under the Circular does not confer any rights on the individual civil servant to any new arrangement that may be provided for in future legislation in relation to compulsory retirement age, whether or not the officer is still retained under the terms of this Circular on the date of commencement of that legislation.<\/p>  <p>  When a civil servant has been accepted for retention under the terms of circular 21\/2017, the following arrangements apply: civil servant retires at 65 years of age; the officer&rsquo;s lump sum is paid; pension abatement rules will apply; civil servant is retained in an unestablished capacity; civil servant is retained on a work pattern with the same or fewer hours, subject to any reduction in hours being consistent with the business needs of the organisation; no pension contribution is payable and no public service pension benefits are accrued during the period of retention; if the salary of the individual civil servant is based on the PPC scale prior to retirement, following retention they will be placed on the non-PPC scale (to take account of the fact that no pension contribution is payable); PRD (pension related deduction) will still be payable; salary for all civil servants retained under this Circular to be paid at the minimum point of the non-PPC pay scale, adjusted for work pattern as required; class A PRSI will apply; and no applications for retention beyond the age of eligibility for the Contributory State Pension will be entertained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000085#WRCC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance Scheme Eligibility","counter":1425,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000085#WRCC04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1426,"qnumday":597,"qnumall":"[4202\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000085#WRCC04100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"to outline her plans to make the back to school clothing and footwear allowance available to families of children that qualify for ECCE (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1427,"content":"<p>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a once-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when children start school each autumn.

This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome.<\/p>  <p>  The new TCA with substantial HomeCaring credits will be available to all people who reached pension age after 1st September 2012, when the revised rate bands took effect.<\/p>  <p>  Under the new arrangements a person who has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The new TCA for pensioners assessed under the 2012 rate band changes, comes into effect from the 30th March 2018.

To that end, a dedicated Customer Service Unit receives and processes a wide range of feedback from customers on their experiences of interacting with the Department.<\/p><p>Where customers are dissatisfied with the standard of service that they have received, in the first instance, they are advised to convey their concerns to the staff member or section of the Department with which they have been dealing.

They can do so in a number of different ways, such as by letter, by email, or online using a <i>Customer Feedback Form<\/i>, which can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website (www.welfare.ie\/en\/Pages\/secure\/Submit-a-comment-or-compliment.aspx).  Alternatively, customers can make contact by phone or they can speak face to face to a member of staff in any of our Intreo centres around the country.  <\/p><p>Once a complaint is received, my Department endeavours to issue an acknowledgement by letter or email within three working days, and a case reference number is also issued to the customer.  The complaint is then forwarded to the Customer Service Officer(s) within the relevant business area(s) to be investigated and responded to within 15 working days, where practicable.  If it is not possible to issue a response within that period of time, an interim response will issue, explaining why the 15 day time frame cannot be met and providing details of an expected response date.  All complaints will be dealt with promptly, fairly and impartially, and the outcome of the investigation will be reflected in the final response to the customer.  <\/p><p>Customers are advised that if they are unhappy with the outcome of the investigation, they can request to have their complaint reviewed by another officer who was not involved in dealing with the original complaint, explaining why they are not satisfied with the initial response.  If a review is to be conducted, a response should be provided to the customer within 20 working days. <\/p><p>Customers are also advised that if, after review, they are still unhappy with the outcome, they can contact the Office of the Ombudsman to seek to have the matter examined by that Office.<\/p><p>Overall, in its efforts to deliver the highest possible standard of customer service, my Department aims to provide its customers with a complaints procedure that is accessible, efficient, effective, standardised and fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000086#WRDD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Overpayments","counter":1450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000086#WRDD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1451,"qnumday":605,"qnumall":"[4365\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013000086#WRDD00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) who is receiving maternity benefit and who incurred an overpayment on their claim is now being deducted at a rate of 15%, in view of engagement made with her Department to establish a suitable method of recovery by way of establishing a payment plan.","asker":"1276","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1452,"content":"<p>The person concerned is aware that maternity benefit and one parent family payment are not fully payable together and consequently she has an overpayment due for recovery by the Department<font color=\"#004080\">.  <\/font>She was informed that 15% of her weekly payment (the Departmental standard rate that can apply to the repayment of debt without a person&rsquo;s consent) would be deducted for this purpose.

The new loan will enable credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.\u00a0\u00a0The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not have otherwise been able to afford at a higher interest rate. <\/p><p>The Housing Finance Agency (HFA)\u00a0has raised &euro;200 million from a variety of sources, on a fixed rate basis for periods out to thirty years maturity.  Based on the pricing achieved, local authorities can offer a first tranche of fixed rate annuity finance to eligible borrowers at rates of 2.0% and 2.25% per annum, for twenty five and thirty years, respectively, up to an aggregate maximum of &euro;200 million.  The funding is not allocated to individual local authorities but rather will be drawn down by local authorities from the HFA to match fund their lending under the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Local authority borrowing from the HFA, that is on-lent to the borrower, is not considered spending by General Government as the borrowing is offset by the financial asset held by the local authority, i.e. the loan to the end borrower.\u00a0 <\/p><p>For the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, the Housing Agency will continue to provide a central underwriting and support service to all local authorities, staffed by appropriately skilled personnel, including qualified underwriters.\u00a0 This central service will assess loan applications and report back to the local authorities on the applicant&rsquo;s ability to repay a loan.\u00a0 All loan applications will be assessed in accordance with the financial criteria set out in the statutory Credit Policy underpinning the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.\u00a0 The final decision on loan approval is a matter for each local authority and its credit committee. The local authority must satisfy itself on the financial risk it is undertaking in respect of each loan and must adhere to the requirements of the credit policy. <\/p><p>As has been the case since the introduction of house purchase lending by local authorities, default risk continues to lie with the local authorities, as lenders and as final decision makers on all applications. \u00a0Where arrears arise, the local authority\u00a0will follow the established Local Authority Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP)\u00a0framework for handling mortgage arrears cases.\u00a0 Local authority borrowers are encouraged to engage with their local authority at the earliest opportunity if they are having difficulty making loan repayments.\u00a0 Information in relation to the Local Authority MARP and the help available to borrowers is available on my Department's website at the following link:<\/p><p><i><\/i>.<\/p><p>A Mortgage to Rent scheme, specifically for local authority mortgage borrowers, is available as part of the MARP arrangements.

In addition,\u00a0the private or institutional investor must retain ownership of the property both\u00a0during and after the term of the lease.

I have asked my Department, in consultation with the RTB, to undertake a detailed examination of the current legislative provisions, which have not yet been commenced, to identify any improvements and further legislative provisions required to take account of the changed circumstances since the development of the 2015 scheme.

There have been significant changes in the rental market since the 2015 scheme was first envisaged and designed.  For example, the draft scheme was originally intended to be financed by the interest payable on deposits lodged; this is no longer viable, given the current financial market conditions.  Furthermore, disputes relating to deposits are no longer the most common dispute type referred to the RTB.  In 2016, deposit retention was the third most common dispute type referred to the Board, behind invalid notice of termination, and rent arrears and over-holding of rental properties.  <\/p>  <p>  Financing the operation of the scheme is an important issue particularly in terms of ensuring that the likely outcomes of a new scheme are achieved efficiently and effectively and that the best value from public funds is secured.
