It is not clear whatsoever if the Minister gave permission in this case.  That is the question we have asked.  I do not know where that answer is.  We have got answers to parliamentary questions.  We have got an answer from Caranua which is totally and utterly confusing.  The message from the committee was that the agency should not waste survivors&rsquo; moneys on signing a rent agreement.<\/p> <p>  The second message was whether the Minister had given permission.  At this point, having read it, does the Office of Public Works, OPW, own the building in which Caranua working?  It is not clear.  One is pushing the other.  The OPW is talking about a signing a new lease on behalf of Caranua where it is the third party as it were.  Why is the OPW signing a new agreement?  Does it not own the building?  I have no idea what is going on.  The reason for that is not through any lack of diligence.  I have read about it and tabled questions about it.  I have no idea.  I do know when Caranua was here; it said it did not pay rent.  I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office if Caranua paid rent.  It said it did not pay rent but was about to because it had to move.  Now it looks like it was obliged to pay rent of over &euro;100,000 from 2016 onwards.  Now, it will pay even more rent.  On top of that, it seems to me it was outfitting premises.<\/p> <p>  At this point, I am appealing to the Chairman that this is a limited fund.  There is absolute upset over the way the survivors have been dealt with.  We know the agency&rsquo;s chairperson said when he went into the organisation that it was a mess and a shambles.  There is currently no board.  Its term finished in March and its last meeting was on 23 March or 24 March.  This organisation is functioning without any oversight.  It would seem it has delegated permission to the chief executive officer and the chairperson to sign a lease.  I have gone through the minutes and it is extraordinary at a time when the board was more worried about the level of pay-outs rather than their own costs.<\/p> <p>  This committee is of the opinion that Caranua should not be paying rent.  We asked it to clarify and not to sign a lease.  We do not know if it is value for money.  No business case was ever presented through any of the minutes.  We have asked the Department of Education and Skills to clarify what is going on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017051800002#B01500","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1495094400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Cullinane wish to talk on this topic?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017051800002#B01600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1495094400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017051800002#B01700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1495094400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Can we try and deal with the point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017051800002#B01800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1495094400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>As it feeds into a broader issue, I want to make this point.<\/p> <p>  I agree with everything Teachta Connolly said on this issue.  We ask questions to get clarity.  Unfortunately, we have not got clarity.  There is more confusion now than there was before we got the correspondence.  Obviously, that is problematic for is.<\/p> <p>  We are juggling many issues which is quite difficult for us.  We have the issue of the Garda training college, as well as the third and fourth level sectors.  We are going in the right direction in putting a focus on many of these issues.  Caranua is a good example.  I have said a number of times that we are holding hearings.  The hearing was also in respect of the special report the Comptroller and Auditor General did on the redress schemes.  Many were issues were raised by members with the Secretary General as to how the scheme was devised in the first place, false and mistakes and so on.  Where is the follow up for the committee?  If one looks at the structure we are putting around the third and fourth level area and the Garda training college, we are moving in the right direction.<\/p><p>Maybe we can do something similar here so that we know exactly what the follow-up is.  Teachta Connolly has raised serious issues.  I am not sure how it is best for us to proceed.  It is not good enough that we have hearings and ask questions to which we receive inadequate responses.  We just go back and forth in correspondence and do not get anywhere.  We need to give some thought to dealing with this.  It is somewhat similar to the other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017051800002#B01900","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495094400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>These services were designed to provide for a particularly vulnerable group.  Survivors bring up the issues of the legal costs and the fact that it was supposed to be mediated, along with other overheads.  When an organisation is asked a specific question by the Committee of Public Accounts and does not answer it, the only conclusion we can draw is that the organisation does not want to answer the question.  The group receiving services from Caranua is most vulnerable and is relying on us to get responses.  We have to be very clear with Caranua that we want a yes or no answer.  We do not want to go around the houses.  We want clear responses and a commitment that we will not have lease arrangements hoovering up funds that will not be replenished, as Deputy Connolly has said.

One or other of them is telling Caranua it has to pay rent and cannot have a building for nothing.  That seems to be the position.  The board of Caranua, however, also seems to want a new building.

The report is very interesting and I suggest that all members give some time to read it.  <br\/><br\/>No. 495C is correspondence dated 15 May 2017 from Deputy Alan Kelly.  This is an email containing a reply from the T&aacute;naiste's office on a matter raised in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Kelly on the finances in the Garda College and related matters.  We will discuss that shortly when we discuss the issue relating to the Templemore issue.  <br\/><br\/>No. 498C is correspondence dated 16 May 2017 from Deputy Alan Farrell stating that he wishes to discuss the Department of Defence's disposal of the naval vessel, the <i>LE Aisling<\/i>.  Deputy Farrell is not here so we will hold it over.  Obviously, we will want to get information from the Department.  In the absence of Deputy Farrell, we might agree on his behalf because we know what he is looking for, which is to write to the Department for a full briefing on the matter.  His letter is on the record.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017051800002#C01800","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495094400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>He had not spoken about it but I am sure-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017051800002#D00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1495094400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>He would not expect us to hold things up.

A copy of the document was requested by another Member of the Houses.  Is it agreed that we make this document available to the Member?  Agreed.  The Library and Research Service has a protocol.  If somebody asks it to do a body of work, it does so but before a third party seeks a copy, it must get the consent of the person who asked for the work to be done.  We have no problem regarding making a document on the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts widely available.  We will note and publish that ourselves.  I think it is doing some further work on it.  It is a very useful document that is helpful to us.

The next item is the Irish Museum of Modern Art for which there is a clear audit opinion.  The next item is the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority for which there is a clear audit opinion for 2015.

I wish to start by reflecting on some of the evidence which we heard at the last meeting and comments from Dr. Brady in respect of the importance he placed on vacant possession in the matter of the disposal of the stadium at Harold's Cross.  Obviously, that was motivating factor when it came to the manner in which he moved in the Valentine's swoop.  I wish to examine a number of areas in this respect.  On the manner in which it was conducted, given the importance that Dr. Brady has placed on vacant possession from the point of view of the banks and disposal, was there any part of the IGB's debt written off by the banks as a sweetener to ensure it would get vacant possession of the stadium at Harold's Cross?  Was Dr. Brady motivated to act in the heavy-handed manner in which he did?  He admitted here the previous day that he was wrong to do so and that he would revisit the decision if he could.  It is obviously causing a lot of agony.  It is also the central motivating point in respect of this dispute.  If there was a write-off, is that now in jeopardy because of the stand-off?  As has been confirmed in the letter from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, no moneys have passed into the accounts of the IGB at this point.  Obviously then, no money has been passed on to the banks in respect of paying the debt.  Will Dr. Brady begin on that point please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017051800002#O03000","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495094400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I will take the first part of the question.

It is important that questions be answered today.  Let me remind the witnesses of something, given the seriousness of what is involved.  People are watching these proceedings who are concerned for their sport.  Many of them listened to \"Drivetime\" on RTE Radio 1 on Tuesday and would have been shocked by the fact that this sport received &euro;300,000 per week in taxpayers' money.  Mothers who cannot get occupational therapists for their kids because of a lack of resources, elderly people who cannot get medical cards and people who are under financial pressure are watching a sport for dogs that have less meat on their bones than I do, yet the witnesses are talking about the payment of such sums.  These are serious issues and significant payments into the sport, so I would appreciate answers.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the &euro;23 million - we could not get that figure the previous day, but thank God for the Department of Education and Skills, which can give us a three-page report - secured from the sale of Harold's Cross to the Department, we have clarified that the land has been zoned as Z9 - open space.  No local area plan, LAP, was prepared in advance, but Mr. Murnane's comments were interesting, in that departmental officials walked the site in 2016 and alternative uses for it were explored.  Do the witnesses believe that a proper price was paid for this land?  We have just completed an investigation into Project Eagle and whether there had been losses on land.  I wonder whether the Comptroller and Auditor will have to audit \"Project Greyhound\" and whether too much has been paid for this land, given that it was zoned as open space.  The amount magically hit the debt figure incurred by the IGB and the Department of Education and Skills suddenly paid a composite amount for the purchase of the property.  Does Mr. Gleeson believe that this was the correct amount of money?  There is no guarantee that the land will be rezoned or that there will be planning permission, yet &euro;23 million has been paid for the site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017051800002#P02700","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495094400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I do not know what an appropriate valuation for the site is because I am not a valuer and have no expertise in that regard but a process has been established under circulars promulgated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

Mr. Murnane has indicated that alternatives were explored in 2016.  To what depth?  Given that Dublin City Council was entering into a new city plan at the time, the IGB could have approached the council and sought an LAP for the site.  That is now being done retrospectively.

The Indecon report goes through it meticulously.  It says that the Bord na gCon targets were not met.  The report pointed out serious concerns for what Bord na gCon could expect in 2013.  For example, the first year of the strategic plan ended with a total group surplus of &euro;40,000, compared with the planned figure of &euro;238,000.  The report states that the most significant aspect of the 2013 performance was the non-achievement of the target for net turnover from the racing facilities.  It also states that the plan appears to be approximately one year behind and so on.  Why am I raising that?  It is because there were concerns over the strategic plan.  Indecon hoped that Bord na gCon would meet its targets further out or later on in the period.  Did the board meet them?  We do not know.  The Bord na gCon representatives are not even sure of the years of the strategic plan.  I am simply quoting from what the taxpayers have paid for.<\/p> <p>  The aim was to restore confidence.  I realise the value of the greyhound industry.  Serious issues around welfare arise that I might come back to.  Anyway, the purpose is to restore confidence and integrity.  Then, Bord na gCon goes on to sell one item, Harold's Cross.  It does not account for the empty premises in Limerick.  There is a call centre in Thurles.  What is the cost of that?  Bord na gCon is paying for a call centre in Thurles.  Is that correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017051800002#S04800","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495094400,"counter":305,"content":"<p>We sold the empty premises in Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017051800002#S04900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Meaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1495094400,"counter":306,"content":"<p>No, I am referring to the premises overhead.

HRI has managed to offset the on-track decline with an exceptional performance in international markets, which would include the US, South Africa, Canada, France, Germany and Italy.

What can happen is that if the zoning on the site is not appropriate to the planning application being considered, the application can go in as a planning application and the local authority, with the consent of the planners and the elected members can agree to grant a material contravention for that site for that specific purpose.

With the appropriate zoning to allow for institutional use, the market value is probably &euro;1.5 million an acre, which is very substantially less than &euro;23 million.

That is ironic because, similarly, while those values would apply, and I believe that site was in Sandyford, which would not be as good an area in terms of property values, the Department of Education and Skills paid more than &euro;5 million per acre for institutional zoning for a site on which there was a listed building.

It spelled out what was wrong in the industry four years ago.  According to it, people had been witness to the virtual collapse of the Irish greyhound industry in the preceding few years, with a decreasing tote, attendance level and dog pool evident.  It asserts that the people administering the industry tried to dismiss the figures and that promises of a bright future appeared to lack credibility.  Trainers up and down the country were feeling a financial pinch, it reads, with individual trainers frustrated at the IGB's apparent lack of direction.  The reduction in spending on track maintenance was clear for all to see, as were the escalating levels of serious injuries at tracks coupled with malfunctioning equipment.  According to the invitation, there appeared to be no transparency or accountability in the IGB as it limped from one crisis to the next.  The main issue was the repayment of &euro;25 million in 2016, which was growing closer on the horizon.  This invitation shows that breeders and trainers saw these problems in the industry in 2013.<\/p> <p>  The trainers association held a meeting that night in September.  Approximately 80 people attended.  However, another meeting was held where 30 professional trainers were brought into a room on their own and the rest were locked out.  It was stated at that meeting that the board had offered professional trainers a bonus of &euro;10 for every dog they raced.  This meeting appointed a chairman on the night, but no meeting has been held since.<\/p> <p>  When I asked Dr. Brady at our previous meeting about how important it was to meet stakeholders, he stated that a forum had been set up.  However, that forum has not met for six months.  This forms part of the problem with the industry.  The board is not playing ball with stakeholders and those who matter, namely, the breeders and owners of dogs.  It is not bringing stakeholders and people who have concerns along with it.

In the meantime, a large number of salaries have to be paid and prize money is declining sharply.  Prize money is the reason the industry will thrive but it is going south.  There is an operating profit, however.  As Dr. Brady stated, the operating profit is there because Bord na gCon has to repay its debts and so forth.  My impression is of an industry in crisis.  We heard in evidence that prize money increased before being reduced again.  However, the fact that it is tumbling shows the extent of the crisis. <\/p><p> I will ask some quick-fire questions.

We know that Dr. Brady is an interim CEO and that issue will be dealt with in the future - I presume he does not want to stay in this job forever - so that will change.  We acknowledge his love for the industry, but if it came to it that as part of this process the result was that Shelbourne Park did not open again, if that meant the industry getting back going in the right direction, does he feel if he moved aside and facilitated that, it would be the right thing to do?

There is a number floating around of &euro;31 million that was lost.  That presumes the economy, which was booming in 2007, would have continued to boom all the way through to 2017.  I will use an analogy from a business I am very familiar with, which is the Irish motor industry.  It is often used as a barometer of economic growth and macroeconomic growth.  The Irish motor industry was selling nearly 200,000 new cars in 2005 and 2006.  It sold 57,500 new cars in 2008.  It crawled its way back to 140,000 new cars in 2016.  Mentioning the &euro;31 million figure is like saying if the motor industry continued to sell 200,000 cars in 2008, 2009 and 2011, the available revenue would be a particular amount.  That never happened because we had a massive recession so the number does not stack up.  We have a debt problem that needs to be cleared.  We cannot generate enough revenue or EBITA to meet that debt.  We have a bank that wants to get paid back because the debt is seriously in default.  There is only one option to substantially increase prize money and put the industry back on a solid footing and that is to discharge the outstanding debt.  It is the only option, namely, to do it and do it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017051800002#AAA01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Creed"},{"type":"speech","time":1495094400,"counter":1311,"content":"<p>My last question is on the intermediary that has been mentioned.
