There was a comprehensive discussion at the last meeting about the staff complement of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  Reference was made to the authorised maximum staff number and the actual number of staff employed.  The authorised figure was 164 and the actual figure was 146.  There was some discussion about agency staff, contracted staff and outsourced audits.  I followed up with questions and I believe it merits discussion at a further meeting.  In 2011, the staff complement as a percentage of the authorised maximum staff complement was 97%.  It is now 89%.  When the authorised maximum staff complement at that time was combined with contracted staff and outsourced staff for audits, it was greater in number.  It is now less.  This shows up potential capacity problems within an office that is very relevant to our work.  It merits a discussion when we come back again in the autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071400002#H00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1468483800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Are there any other matters arising from the minutes?

We will note that and its representatives will be here shortly.  Correspondence items 17B, 18B, 19B, 20B and 21B were deferred from our last meeting and are to do with various reports of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the Bytel project, wards of court, fisheries harbours and a review of costs associated with undelivered capital projects of the Dublin Docklands Authority.  I propose that we try to sign off on those next week before we break up for the recess.  I ask members to have a look at those documents in case they wish to raise any issues at the next meeting.

Item 4C is an item deferred from last week; it is correspondence from Mr. Graham Doyle, the Secretary General at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, regarding the committee&rsquo;s request for information in relation to alleged unauthorised dumping on the R158 regional road upgrade.  It has been determined that this matter is being dealt with by the local authority and does not fall within the remit of the committee.  However, the clerk has reviewed past correspondence and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in its supervisory role of local authorities, has a file open in relation to this issue.

I accept that it is not possible for representatives from Revenue to come before us at tomorrow's meeting.  We had a very lengthy discussion with legal advisors anyway with regard to the internal audit report.  It has some relevance to that.  At the same time, this whole issue flags and raises questions of process for the HSE, which we will deal with tomorrow as appropriate.  It also raises questions for the Companies Registration Office in terms of controls, as well as the Revenue Commissioners.  If we are going to ask questions of the HSE about its internal processes, we have a responsibility to ask the same questions of the Revenue Commissioners and the Companies Registration Office.  There were many issues within that report that jump out at me as failures in processes and lax controls.  That is my opinion.  Others may have different views.  My party and I certainly feel that it is very important in the context of this report that we have the Revenue Commissioners before the committee because the report flags systemic problems.  If these problems arise across the full remit of these organisations, it has implications for taxpayers' money.

Obviously work is done, perhaps by internal audit, to test that the controls are working.  The results of that would be fed up the chain.  If there is a problem with some of the controls not working, it means the top level of the entity knows there is something to be addressed and makes sure the action is taken.  It is a requirement in the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  There is a separate governance code for vocational education committees, VECs, as they were, and now for ETBs, but the requirement is there.  As a result of the restructuring of the VECs and the creation of ETBs in 2013, they had an 18-month accounting period.  In most of the ETBs there was a problem getting the systems in place to ensure that review was carried out.  If we were to look back at last week's presentation, I would have been making the same point about most of them.  They did not carry out the review in a timely way.  We always flag it because we think it is an important control and a governance expectation.  I would expect for 2015 that all the ETBs would have their systems fully functional and that we would not be making the same finding in respect of the 2015 financial statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071400002#H02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468483800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The first part of my question has been answered and Mr. McCarthy expecting an improvement.

It is a difficulty and it is something we have raised in relation to a number of organisations, particularly where there are amalgamations and restructuring.  Many organisations are locked into 25-year leases, for example.  There may be break clauses and it is good if there are, but some organisations have got caught with longer leases and they have this difficulty.<\/p> <p>  If members look at item 4.12 on the next page, it is a more significant case that has been brought to the attention of the committee previously, relating to the Industrial Development Agency Ireland, IDA Ireland.  It was locked into a situation with a building called Carrisbrook House, which is in Ballsbridge.  Every year we were reporting that it had non-effective expenditure of about &euro;1 million and it was locked into that until 2023 or 2024, or even longer, but in 2015 it managed to buy out the remaining obligations under the lease at a cost of &euro;9.4 million.  Had it not paid that &euro;9.4 million, it would have been tied into it.  I recall now that it was for the next 22 years, costing &euro;1 million a year.  While this is non-effective expenditure, it is better to be out of the lease at this stage.

It was never expected that it would be empty for any period like that.  It was thought there would always be a State body that would be able to take it up.

The report for consideration by the committee relates to an examination by my office of the way in which the OPW plans for and manages the risks associated with river and coastal flooding.  Flooding is a long-term and complex problem that presents a very serious challenge in Ireland and many other states, including many of our European neighbours.  By now, most people accept that flooding is a problem that will become worse in the future, both in its intensity and likelihood.  Sadly, at the time my report was being completed, Storm Desmond was causing widespread flooding, leading to damage and distress in many parts of the country.  As public resources are scarce, it is essential that expenditure on flood prevention measures and the response to flooding be well planned and targeted at the areas where it will deliver the maximum social and economic benefit.<br\/><br\/>In my examination I considered the governance and project management arrangements in place for strategic planning for flood risk management.  I also assessed OPW's management of, and progress to date on, the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme and a set of pilot river basin flood management plans.  In 2004 an interdepartmental policy review group recommended<i><\/i>that future flood risk management focus on mapping and strategic planning at river basin level.  That model of planning was being applied elsewhere in Europe.  The 2007 EU floods directive established a common, whole of river-basin approach to the assessment and management of flood risks across the European Union.  The directive set a series of deadlines for all EU member states, requiring them to identify areas at serious risk of flooding; produce flood hazard maps and flood risk maps for these areas; and produce flood risk management plans for whole river basins.  The OPW was able to incorporate the work already under way as part of the 2004 review into its work programme to meet the directive's requirements.<br\/><br\/>Planning for flood management for whole river basins started in 2005 on a pilot basis.  The aim was to test the approach in advance of the roll-out of a national programme.  The OPW originally envisaged that nine projects would be undertaken at the pilot stage to test approaches in different types of river basin and using different models for delivery.  In the event, only four pilot projects proceeded for the River Suir, the River Lee and the River Dodder and in the Fingal and east Meath area.  In March 2006 the OPW planned that the pilot testing would be completed in 2007.  All four pilot projects reviewed ran significantly over their original schedules, with delays of at least six years in each case.  The Suir pilot project was not completed on a stand-alone basis and the OPW has incorporated it into the planning for the south-eastern CFRAM study.<br\/><br\/>Costs also increased compared with what had been originally planned for the pilot schemes.  Indicative cost estimates for the four pilot projects totalled approximately &euro;3.5 million.  Expenditure to the end of 2014 on the projects was &euro;8.9 million.  In the case of the two pilot projects managed by local authorities, no service-level agreement was put in place between the OPW and the relevant local authorities prior to commencing the projects.  The lack of such agreements can potentially lead to difficulties in resolving project issues that may arise and can also increase the exposure of public bodies to costs in excess of those agreed at the outset.<br\/><br\/>The national CFRAM programme got under way in 2011, focused on six regions, each comprising a number of river basins.  The report includes a map, on page 21, indicating the regions. <br\/><br\/>One of the CFRAM programme's main objectives was to produce the required maps and flood risk management plans within the timeframe set out in the EU floods directive.  There was some evidence of learning from the pilot schemes being transferred to the CFRAM programme, but this did not happen in a formalised manner.  The first CFRAM programme delivery target required the preparation and submission to the European Commission of preliminary flood risk assessments by March 2012.  The OPW met that target, identifying 300 areas as being at high risk.  The second delivery target required the preparation of flood risk and flood hazard maps for each of the identified areas by December 2013 and their submission to the European Commission by March 2014.  The OPW had submitted maps for only 50 of the 300 identified areas by the due date and had not submitted additional maps by December 2015.  We have included a set of maps for the area around Gort, County Galway, as an appendix to the report in order that readers can get a sense of what is involved.<br\/><br\/>At the time my report was being finalised, OPW did not expect to meet the directive's delivery target of March 2016 for submission to the European Commission of final flood risk management plans.  The OPW informed me last November that it aimed to complete the plans for all river basins by the end of 2016.<\/p><p>The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee on progress in that regard.<\/p><p> The OPW estimated in 2009 that the cost of implementing the CFRAM programme would be &euro;30 million excluding VAT.  My report notes that the OPW expects the final cost of producing all the plans to be approximately &euro;27.4 million.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee on that. <\/p><p> It is critical to the success of large scale programmes, such as CFRAM, that in addition to project management and oversight arrangements, progress is also actively managed at the programme level.  A high-level interdepartmental group to oversee national co-ordination of flood risk management and flooding response met between March 2006 and September 2009 but did not meet again for a period of almost six years up to July 2015.  A steering group established to oversee the CFRAM programme similarly met between May 2009 and November 2010 but did not meet again during a four-year period up to November 2014.  In the case of the pilot projects, there was a lack of clarity about the oversight arrangements.  While OPW established structures to monitor project management, these were evidently not adequate, particularly in light of the delays and cost escalation that occurred.<\/p><p> Capital expenditure on flood risk management for the period 2005 to 2014 was &euro;329 million.  This comprised major works at a cost of &euro;242 million, strategic studies - including the pilot projects and CFRAM - at a cost &euro;52 million and minor works that cost &euro;35 million.  In September 2015, the Government announced details of a &euro;430 million six-year programme of capital investment on flood defence measures as part of the its overall capital investment plan for the period 2016 to 2021.<\/p><p> It is a concern that 12 years on from the report of the flood policy review group and eight years after the EU floods directive, substantial capital expenditure commitments continued to be made without the full benefit of the comprehensive analysis and strategic plans that will emerge from the CFRAM programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071400002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468483800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

Following the strategic review of flood risk policy in 2004, the Office of Public Works was assigned the lead co-ordinating role for flood risk management in Ireland.  At the core of the OPW's work is the objective of reducing, to the greatest extent possible, the level of flood risk to people, property, infrastructure and the environment.  In the context of its role and responsibilities in respect of flood risk management, the OPW delivers services through the following four key areas: strategic planning to manage flood risk in future through the CFRAM programme in compliance with the EU floods directive and a strategic role to co-ordinate, for consideration by Government, cross-sectoral policies that mitigate flood risk now and in the future; a programme of capital investment to address existing flood risk to properties and infrastructure through major and minor flood relief projects, which are delivered in partnership with local authorities; programmed maintenance of 11,500 km of river channels, including 800 km of embankments of arterial drainage and urban flood relief schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995; and an advisory role to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the general public to assist them in preparing for and responding to flooding.  In carrying out these functions, the OPW works in close co-operation with other State bodies, principally local authorities, which also have key responsibilities in the area of flood risk management.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report on Strategic Planning and Flood Risk Management.  I have ensured that the OPW has in place appropriate structures to give effect to the three recommendations outlined in the report.<\/p> <p>  The Government&rsquo;s flood policy involved developing a planned programme of prioritised feasible works, with a greater emphasis on non-structural measures.  To deliver this required proactive assessment and planning for areas at potential risk from flooding.  Ireland&rsquo;s national flood risk policy corresponded with subsequent requirements of the EU floods directive.<\/p> <p>  Any investment to defend areas from flood risk that does not get it right first time can cost incrementally more to fix.  Since 1995, the OPW has invested some &euro;460 million in flood risk management measures including, in co-operation with relevant local authorities, the construction of 37 major flood defence schemes throughout the country at a cost of &euro;348 million.  In total, these major - and over 500 minor - flood mitigation works protect an estimated 12,000 properties and confer an economic benefit to the State in terms of damage and losses avoided estimated at some &euro;1.2 billion.<\/p> <p>  No major flood relief scheme has been advanced to date without the benefit of highly detailed analysis, both at a scientific and engineering level, and economically in terms of cost benefit appraisal, with comprehensive stakeholder and public consultations to inform and support all decisions taken.  All decisions taken to date in allocating funding to flood relief capital works have had clear and robust evidence to support the need and full justification for proceeding.  Completed OPW schemes have performed successfully in protecting towns and communities concerned.  They were tested in the events at the end of last year.  From the its extensive experience in planning flood defence measures, the OPW builds in flexibility to respond to issues that can naturally arise due, for example, to local topographical issues or ground conditions.  Where these arise we automatically evaluate the possible planning impact and, if required, reset our overall planning and delivery timelines.  These events, while potentially extending the envisaged planning and delivery timeframe, provide valuable and necessary information to inform the optimum outcome - one that returns the greatest benefit to communities and homeowners from the proposed investment.<\/p> <p>  CFRAM is a planning vehicle and its outcome will have a positive impact for people and communities in areas at risk from flooding.  The national CFRAM programme is without precedent in its scale and complexity.  For example, the flood mapping exercise has involved detailed modelling and mapping in each of the 300 areas for further assessment, including surveying and modelling of 6,700 km of watercourse and 9,400 km2 of flood-plain.  Given the importance and impact from the CFRAM programme, getting it wrong is not an option.<\/p> <p>  The task faced by the OPW was to assess Ireland's watercourses and coastlines for the risk of flooding, to map the flood extent and assets at risk in these areas, and to set out a plan of appropriate, co-ordinated and feasible measures to reduce and mitigate this flood risk.  The OPW&rsquo;s implementation plan recognised that there were a variety of opportunities and options that could help to inform delivery of the right solutions.  The OPW, through subsequent discussions with local authorities, agreed that three pilots would provide the wealth of information and experience that would lead to the right approach to planning and governance for a national CFRAM programme.<\/p> <p>  A further CFRAM project, the Suir study, was commenced in-house to build the technical expertise to enable OPW staff to critically assess and work with CFRAM outputs, noting the OPW's responsibility to maintain and review the plans.  The completion of the Suir CFRAM project is now, as mentioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General, aligned and co-ordinated with the south-eastern CFRAM project, given the overlap of membership between the steering groups for both projects.  Comprehensive governance and management structures were put in place for each pilot.  In terms of their planning, the initial plans and indicative estimated budgets formed part of the implementation plan.  The Dodder and the Fingal-east Meath pilots were managed by the relevant local authorities.<\/p> <p>  The pilots to test and inform the best approach to undertake a national CFRAM programme were undertaken in parallel with the delivery and completion of flood defence schemes for these areas.  For example: in parallel to publishing the River Dodder draft flood risk management plans in 2012 and finalised in November 2014, tidal and fluvial protection works have continued along the River Dodder since 2007 providing protection to a large number of properties; many elements of the proposed scheme for Cork city and the lower Lee as set out in the Lee flood risk management plan, FRMP, have been progressing through project-level development, with exhibition currently planned in the coming months; and Clonmel's flood defence schemes were completed in 2014, as were Waterford's, while Templemore's are in train.<\/p> <p>  Finalising the draft FRMPs in the pilot study areas has not been an impediment to the progression of significant flood risk management works in these areas.  Moreover, lessons from the pilots have been invaluable to inform how to progress with the national CFRAM programme.  The lessons, which I accept were not captured in a formal report at the time, significantly informed the published brief for the national CFRAM.  These lessons can be categorised as: technical lessons that informed the approach and specifications for aerial survey requirements, survey work, defining the watercourses to be modelled and including stronger calibration of the hydraulic modelling to the outcomes of the hydrological analysis; programming lessons that informed governance and oversight structures, timescale for milestone delivery, approach to procurement, communication and engagement with the public and key stakeholders and data collection; and appraisal lessons by broadening the appraisal of options beyond purely economic cost-benefit analysis to include the assessment of possible measures against social, environmental, cultural and technical objectives.<\/p><p>It also included an assessment of the potential impacts of climate change.<br\/><br\/>As Accounting Officer and in terms of overall management, I am satisfied the pilot schemes informed our budgeting and project management for the national CFRAM programme.  I acknowledge that Ireland did not report to the European Union in full to meet its flood map requirements by March 2014.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General said, we reported and provided maps for 50 of the 300 areas at that stage.  However, in referring to this, I point out that in 2014 the OPW could have reported and provided national predictive flood maps to comply with the EU deadline.  However, these would have been indicative maps only and the OPW, while technically compliant, did not consider it to be of benefit to the European Union to report based on these maps for the sake of compliance, rather than wait to report and provide the more detailed and reliable maps being developed under the CFRAM programme. <br\/><br\/>It also has to be recognised that the flood mapping and plans developed by the OPW under the CFRAM programme exceeded the requirements of the EU floods directive.  We have also completed an extensive and important public consultation process in which we met over 350 people, public representatives and communities to explain and seek their views on flood risk and the solutions for their areas.  We also learned of the need to do this from the pilot projects.<br\/><br\/>Our maps fully inform feasible solutions to manage future flood risk, are a valuable resource used in planning and development decisions by local authorities and inform planning for emergency responses.  Our plans are the outline design for preferred measures which can allow for a reduction of up to two years in completing future structural flood defence measures.<br\/><br\/>It is acknowledged that the implementation plan had estimated indicative budgets for the pilot schmes in the region of &euro;3.5 million, which turned out to be far less than the sum required.  Importantly, given their pilot scheme status, the lessons from these them have informed a more accurate estimate of the budget for the national programme which has been set at &euro;30 million, excluding VAT.<br\/><br\/>Delays of approximately one year have been encountered in survey work.  This was due to poor market response to a procurement process, despite the OPW publishing a prior information notice in the Official Journal of the European Union for the entire survey programme.  It may have been due to heightened demand across the European Union at the time arising from the EU floods directive.  While the OPW has managed the impact of this delay through proactive project management, there are some budgetary implications that are ongoing and commercially sensitive.  I am satisfied, however, that they are not significant in the context of the overall budgetary figure of &euro;30 million.<br\/><br\/>On final delivery, the EU floods directive requires each member state to publish its flood risk management plans by March 2016.  Our plans are on schedule to be finalised for approval by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform by the end of 2016, about nine months beyond the reporting deadline for the six year programme.  Managing flood risk has always involved a close working relationship between the OPW and local authorities.  This relationship dates back as far as 1945 when the Commissioners of Public Works were assigned statutory responsibility for arterial drainage.  In recent years this close and good working relationship has been set out in service level agreements.  Prior to this our close working relationship was not formally set out, even though it was understood.<br\/><br\/>I have set out the governance structures for the pilot schemes in the briefing document I circulated to the committee in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting.  The long-standing constructive relationship between the OPW and the local authorities in flood risk management provided confidence and greater certainty that these structures<font color=\"#4141FF\"><\/font>would be applied in full, particularly in the light of the awareness of their role in informing the planning of a national programme.  The interdepartmental group met on four occasions between March 2006 and September 2009.  During this period, many elements of the outline implementation plan that involved other parties in addition to the OPW were undertaken and-or completed.  The Government reconvened the interdepartmental working group in July 2015 and it is preparing a report for the Government on other policy initiatives for consideration by it.  The report is expected to be completed shortly.<br\/><br\/>The steering group to set the direction for the development of the national CFRAM programme was established in May 2009 and met, as the Comptroller and Auditor General said, on six occasions up to November 2010.  During this period, the group provided an input into the preliminary flood risk assessment; the preparation of the CFRAM programme brief that was used for the appointment of engineering consultations through a procurement process for each of the study areas; and the preparation of the statutory instrument to transpose the EU floods directive.  In this regard, the core elements of the national CFRAM programme had been set by the end of 2010.  Therefore, the group had largely met its initial objectives in setting the direction of the national CFRAM programme.<br\/><br\/>The ongoing implementation of the CFRAM programme after the appointment of the consultants involved significant survey work and technical analysis such as hydrological analysis and hydraulic modelling.  This work was being co-ordinated and overseen by the steering and progress groups for each of the six CFRAM study areas.  These groups are represented by the key stakeholders at project level, including local authorities.  During the period from 2011 to November 2014, when the national CFRAM steering group reconvened, there were in the order of 160 meetings of the oversight steering and progress groups established for each project.  These groups have been invaluable in driving, steering and co-ordinating the work of the CFRAM programme locally and in providing the information for the OPW which is leading and monitoring the programme.  During the intervening period there have also been multiple bilateral meetings with stakeholders and interest groups to inform the process, including the State bodies Waterways Ireland, the ESB and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, and other interested bodies.<br\/><br\/>The steering group was reconvened in 2014 with agreed terms of reference when the outcomes of the technical work were being prepared for public consultation and met again in June 2016 in advance of preparation for the public consultation process.  As of tomorrow, 15 July 2016, flood risk management plans for two of the six areas will be put out for public consultation.  We are beginning to roll out the public consultation process for the final plans, with a view to final reporting once approved by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform towards the end of the year.<br\/><br\/>I am happy to address these matters in more detail and other queries the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071400002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McGrath","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468483800,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McGrath.

Every member called thereafter will have ten minutes.  <\/p> <p>  Before I call Deputy Catherine Connolly, I wish to refer to one aspect of the report by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is dealt with on page 55 and concerns the cost of the pilot project schemes.  I have two brief questions.  The report was completed in 2015 and published earlier this year.  My first query relates to the costs contracted up to 31 December 2014.  Perhaps Ms McGrath might clarify if the OPW has an update on the costs incurred on the pilot projects in the subsequent 18 months.  Considering that the information we have available is 18 months old, where are we today? <\/p> <p>  My second query relates to two items listed in the appendices which give me cause for great concern.  The first concerns the figure in paragraph A1 - cost of the River Lee pilot project.  The principal contract value was &euro;1.048 million but the outturn up to 18 months ago was &euro;2.199 million.  That represents an increase of &euro;1.151 million or 110% above the original contract value.  What happened and what went so wrong that the contract went over 100% above the contract price?  I do not even know if that is the complete figure. <\/p> <p>  I also refer the committee to the figure in paragraph A5 - River Shannon CFRAM study, for costs up until 2014.  At the bottom of the appendix the OPW states: \"The expenditure to date includes payments for additional work totalling just over &euro;692,000 and payment of compensation claims of just over &euro;305,000.\"  Perhaps the OPW might explain why the figure of &euro;692,000 was not built in to the original contract proposal and why there is the big figure of &euro;305,000 for compensation payments?

The question then is how do we do this from looking at international practice.  To determine how we would deal with flooding nationally, we would look to develop the process around doing pilot projects.  We did not have complete knowledge as to what the process should be and we carried out the pilots to determine what might be involved.  As part of the process, we were doing exercises on how we would determine costings.  In respect of the pilots, one of the significant elements of the costings related to surveys.  We had to carry out extensive surveys.  We learned from that and it informed the pilots.

The pilots were about asking ourselves how we would do the national CFRAM and how would we learn from our experience.  It was not about how we would we deliver a scheme for an individual project.  We were working on the plan that would be needed to deliver for the country as a whole.  We need to learn from our pilot projects.  We were not clear as to what the process might be.  We were doing the pilots in a number of different ways to discover the ideal process.  The Chairman asked about extrapolating from the estimates we did on the pilot projects in order to obtain a picture in respect of the national programme of projects and my response is that we are within the figure of &euro;30 million plus VAT for the 300 projects.  We have learned from the pilot projects and we can then say that we will proceed on the basis that the overall cost will be a certain figure.<\/p> <p>  I will now address the specific questions relating to the River Lee project.  The draft plan for the River Lee was delivered in 2009 and was capable of being published in 2010.  As we all know, there was a flood event in 2009 on the River Lee.  This made us pause our pilot project instead of proceeding as planned.  We had to take on board the information relating to that event and learn from it.  We had been looking at flooding from the tidal perspective.  This was fluvial flooding and there were complications in the hydraulic modelling of that event.  It was complicated.  The consultants were involved in coming up with modelling, because we had to take account of the impact of the dam.  There was a great deal more work in the hydraulic modelling that arose after the delivery of the draft plan.  We were piloting a project that would be part of the way we would deliver on national projects.  I accept that we could have documented some of the work we were doing on this project in order to be able to report that documentation which had given rise to making us pause.

This learning happened between the various teams involved.  There were multiple reviews and I accept that many of them related to the manner in which we were specifying for the national CFRAM programme.  One of the technical areas of learning from the pilot projects was the need to include and specify bespoke aerial survey requirements to ensure products would be suitable for all intended uses under the CFRAM programme.  It was also learned that there was a need to specify the survey work to be done to ensure bespoke outputs that could be adapted for inclusion in the hydraulic models and to define the watercourses to be modelled within the areas to be assessed to ensure the inclusion of relevant smaller channels that could cause flooding, as well as main areas.  That came from the pilot projects.<\/p> <p>  We also engaged in development testing of a new multi-criteria analysis framework to broaden the appraisal of options beyond purely an economic cost-benefit analysis.  When we are looking at potential solutions, we can avail of this system of multi-criteria analysis within each area for further assessment to determine the best solution.  That also came from the pilot projects.  We determined our definition of future scenarios to provide for the assessment of the potential impacts of climate change and other possible future scenarios on the basis of the pilot projects.  It was not an EU requirement.  We also provided for the inclusion of assessments of geomorphology.<\/p> <p>  If the Deputy wants more details of any of these matters, my colleagues can give her more detailed descriptions.  There was stronger calibration of the hydraulic modelling to the outcomes of the hydrological analysis.  That came from the pilot projects, particularly the River Lee project.  The EPA reviewed our strategic environment assessment report from the pilot projects and worked with us to ensure a transfer to the national CFRAM consulting group.  That is what we were doing in that space on foot of the pilot projects.  I acknowledge that procedures were developed within the organisation.  We took the lessons on board and developed our procedures for our own project management.  This was done in-house.  We then sought ISO accreditation in 2008.  We developed our own internal procedures.<\/p> <p>  I have mentioned some of the lessons we learned on the technical side.  We learned in the time we were involved in the pilot projects that the work involved was more substantial and was going to be more substantial than had initially been estimated and that for that reason longer project periods were required.  This lesson is reflected in the programmes set for the national CFRAM programme.  We learned from the pilot CFRAM programmes that the work involved was more substantial than had initially been estimated, that our initial budgetary estimates were too low and that our programme budgets needed to be reviewed.  A figure of &euro;30 million was set in the review and that has remained the budget.<\/p> <p>  We refined the project brief.  A large number of technical issues which arose in the pilot projects needed to be clarified.  By engaging with the external consultants involved in the pilot projects, we found out things that were happening in these projects and translated them into the briefs and specifications for the subsequent national CFRAM programme.  We refined the procurement process to provide for a greater level of detail in the tender brief to permit more efficient tender preparation and review and more accurate pricing of the work involved.  We refined things like payment schedules where we had been operating purely on a milestone basis.  We needed to engage in blending to make sure there was greater competition when arranging the competition nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071400002#O01900","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McGrath"},{"type":"speech","time":1468483800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Ms McGrath is outlining what was learned.

It is the case that we have to manage for flood risk.  We cannot necessarily defend against all flood risk.  We have to manage it.  The programme is identifying those at the greatest level of risk, in other words, people in communities.  This has been the main focus of the CFRAM programme.  It is around coastal and fluvial risk.  It is recognised that there are problems in areas outside of that, particularly smaller numbers of houses or smaller communities.  Since 2009, in recognition that the policy was moving in this direction, we have introduced the minor works programme.  Under this programme, local authorities can come forward having identified feasible schemes and there is funding up to a cap of &euro;500,000.  They may need support and consultancy in determining the nature of such schemes.  They can come forward and we will fund them.  This programme recognises that there will be other scenarios.  It is the case that benefit will accrue if there is a risk to a home, and such schemes are available.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referred to the &euro;35 million expended in this area since 2009 on 534 schemes.  Some 5,000 properties might be affected.  I am not suggesting some of these do not overlap with the CFRAM programme but we recognised the need while CFRAM was being developed.  It is not that there is nothing in other areas, but the focus of the CFRAM programme is on communities where we are getting the greatest benefit and where there is potentially the greatest impact of flooding.<\/p> <p>  I will come back to the committee on what Deputy Burke said about the area outside Athlone - I cannot confirm it.

This related to schemes we have completed to standard and providing the information which insurance firms then use to determine insurance.  The Office of Public Works has no role in determining who gets insured or how people are insured or in the policy.  The policy at sectoral level comes from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  However, along with Insurance Ireland we put in place the memorandum because we have a common interest in having appropriate and relevant information on flood defence schemes to enable the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  The memorandum of understanding was signed in March 2014.  The primary structure to implement this is through a working group, which meets to determine the areas for which flood defence schemes information will be provided as well as the format in which data will be supplied, delivery dates and the frequency of supplying the data.  We have done this for 12 completed schemes, including the River Suir, Clonmel: the River Dodder - tidal, Dublin; the River Tolka, Dublin; the River Tolka, Fingal; the River Tolka, Meath; the River Nanny, Duleek; the River Bandon, Dunmanway; the River Fergus - upper, Ennis; the River Blackwater, Fermoy; the River Nore, Kilkenny city; the River Mornington, Mornington; and the River Tullamore, Tullamore.  The data have been given.  In January 2015, information on the next tranche of schemes was given in respect of the Munster Blackwater, Mallow south and west; Hazelhatch, Celbridge; Derrymullen, Ballinasloe; and Carlow.  As we complete the schemes, we will continue to give the information.  At that stage, as far as we are concerned, we have supplied the information and we expect that the insurance industry will treat with that.<\/p> <p>  One issue that has come up relates to demountable defences.  In the cases of Fermoy and Mallow, we have put in place demountable defences which depend on intervention by the local authority when it has been given a warning in sufficient time to put up those defences.  The insurance industry has questions on that.  From the point of view of this office, we have clearly articulated that such defences provide the international level of protection.  We have conversations with the insurance industry in that area.<\/p> <p>  The interdepartmental group has been reconvened and will report to Government shortly.  In this area, the Department of Finance takes the lead on policy.  The Department is developing a position on whether there is or should be recommendations on insurance and flood risk.

It is almost like being in a slow bicycle race towards the inevitable future we know we will have to embrace, which is putting in flood prevention measures across the country.  That said, there were serious concerns in relation to costs, timelines and the management of the process.  At the initiation of this, nine projects were proposed, which number was then reduced to four.  I know some projects were done by local authorities in different combinations and avenues.  Were there projects which did not get to the starting line?  How were projects ranked?  Surely, there is a piece of paper somewhere recording the ranking on the four and how the decision was made.  There must be some critical analysis somewhere.

My question, however, regards wanting to see documentary evidence of this rather than commentary.  Can the OPW provide that to the committee after this meeting?  I do not expect the witnesses to have it here.  I am sure the arguments are valid and just want to know from a management structure point of view that there was a process in place to do this.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of other questions which I might throw out and they can be answered collectively.  In relation to the overruns, I take the comment.  It was a good comment that budgeting not budget overruns are done.  In relation to value-for-money, is the OPW satisfied that it has been achieved?  In relation to the budget overruns, I cannot see a recalibration of the publicised timelines and costs at various junctures.  Is the OPW happy from a management point of view that this was communicated?  Given the length of the time period, there was a recalibration of the costs.  Surely, that was analysed.  I do not know if any of us working in public life was made aware of that.  If we were, the witnesses might tell us how that happened.<\/p> <p>  What efforts, if any, were made with local authorities to put SLAs in place?  The following is a bugbear of mine.  I heard Mr. Adamson talk about working with European colleagues on state-of-the-art technology.  The accuracy of the work and the data modelling concerns me greatly.  I have referenced this before.  I share with Deputy Connolly the belief that lengthy public consultation is necessary, but the length of time these maps are in place in a consultation format is of concern.  The data being used in some of the maps are extremely concerning, because I do not believe they are accurate.  I am fairly confident that they are inaccurate in many cases.  While the public consultation filters down that process, my direct experience from Newport, Tipperary, and other cases where people came to me, is that the computer generated maps are causing real issues and in some cases hardship because local authorities are sometimes making reference to them for planning and development decisions.  That is causing serious problems.  We understand that there has to be an initial process and that the OPW has to edge it down, but it has to happen more quickly because it is affecting people's daily lives.  The issue is sterilisation of decision making when it comes to development or planning, which is having economic impacts in certain parts of the country.  Can the OPW let us know about data modelling and accuracy?<\/p> <p>  I have experienced many minor works projects, some of which are exceptional and work well.  Is there a process in place for measuring continually the learnings out of those?  What management process is in place to do that?  That brings me to the next question.  On decisions on demountable versus permanent structures, there have been learnings from cases that made sure that the demountable defences could be used.  Is that a continuous process?  I am sure it is but I want to see how it is documented.<\/p> <p>  On budgeting, we talk about looking backwards.  I listened to the Comptroller and Auditor General's comments, but on future-proofing for budgeting, I estimate that the scale of the budget required to implement the plans which will come out will be seismic.  What processes have been put in place to measure things so that we as public servants collectively can estimate for the future?  We have done it already, but is it accurate?  Based on the experience and learnings to date and based on the fact that the OPW has not been able to achieve its budget up to a point, for which I accept that there are some legitimate reasons, how can we predict costs into the future?  My assessment is that costs here will be seismic.  How can the OPW help us in doing that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071400002#U01100","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1468483800,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I will take the questions in order in which I think they were asked.  I was asked about value for money.<\/p><p>It would be helpful for me if the committee could hear the length of time it takes to deliver a flood relief scheme.  We have to go onto land belonging to other people who might not benefit from the scheme and we have to determine matters without full information.  Sometimes, we have to wait until we are in the river to find out some of the issues that can arise.  It is very unlike putting up a hoarding around a site.  There is a long, complicated process to ensure that, when we do it, we do it right.  It can take five to seven years to deliver a flood relief scheme. During the pre-feasibility phase, when we model and develop the scheme, we look in-house or externally to identify the source of the problem and the viable flood risk management measures that could potentially be provided for the area.  As part of this, we have to collect data and hydraulic modelling.  This can take 12 months.  As part of it, we need to look beyond it in greater detail.  With the national programme for all the areas and the six plans, we have potentially done up to 24 months of the work as part of this for the individual locations where we will progress to schemes.  There has been an element of achieving additional value in terms of the economies of scale regarding the work that has been undertaken.<\/p><p> Regarding the SLAs and the engagement with local authorities, we have a prescribed system regarding what needs to be achieved to undertake minor works, and the local authorities commit to it.  We have committed to doing random audits of it to ensure they are delivering from it.  These are done through our regional structures, which are responsible for maintenance of arterial drainage schemes and urban schemes.  Through our regional structure and what has been coming in from minor project proposals from local authorities, there is a gathering of information on what is and is not feasible.  We have been doing this for some time.  I accept that we need more formalised SLAs regarding local authorities, particularly where large works are to be undertaken.  The local authorities are equally seized of the need to address the issues for local communities.

The maps we are developing through the CFRAM process are a number of orders of magnitude better in terms of their level of detail and the technical approaches being used to develop them.

Our teams go out and are available to talk people through the maps and explain what they show, what they mean and how they are developed, and very much take comments on whether people consider that they correspond with their understanding of flood risk in the area.

We are anxious to get the legislation through.  I gave a commitment at the North-South Ministerial Council last Monday week that we would try to facilitate its passage.  The objective behind it relates to having an integrated single electricity market on the island of Ireland.  The integrated market was established in 2007.  With respect to changes in EU legislation and issues which have arisen with the market, we have brought forward this legalisation to deal with them.  It is given far more significance on foot of the decision in the United Kingdom to exit the European Union.  <\/p> <p>  There are issues regarding interconnectivity.  When I addressed the 50 members of the Council of Ministers in Bratislava earlier this week, I pointed to the importance of interconnectivity for Ireland.  Our electricity and gas networks are connected directly via the United Kingdom to European networks.  I had an interesting meeting with my Norwegian counterpart.  Norway is developing an interconnector with the United Kingdom.  That brings into focus not only the need for interconnectivity across the island but also the broader challenges we face.  The French President and the Taoiseach will next week sign an agreement on the Celtic electricity interconnector between France and Ireland.  I also had very interesting discussions on liquefied natural gas, in which some members will be interested in terms of the opportunities along the Shannon Estuary.  With reference to production in the United States, I understand that within the next five years Australia will be the biggest producer of liquefied natural gas.<\/p> <p>  While we had hoped the outcome of the Brexit referendum would have been different, we had been involved in contingency planning.  We have engaged at European level to explain to our colleagues the importance of the United Kingdom not only in terms of the energy market but also in dealing with far broader trade issues and in the context of the need to make progress in having an integrated single electricity market, I-SEM, on the island of Ireland.  This legislation will facilitate the development of the I-SEM in the context of EU directives.  Whether they will still apply in two years time post the negotiations, I do not know, but the reality is that it will give greater stability to the electricity network, North and South.  Because a substantial amount of electricity is generated from renewable resources, the additional stability will benefit everyone on the island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CCS2016071400002#D00300","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1468483200,"counter":275,"content":"<p>It is proposed to group the follow amendments for the purpose of debate, amendments Nos. 4 and 8 and Nos. 5 and 9.

To reflect more what is happening or is likely to happen, we propose this amendment as we believe it is fairer, a more proportionate way of doing things and that it will be more effective.  It is in that spirit we offer this amendment for consideration in the round of matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CCS2016071400002#E00800","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1468483200,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for tabling this amendment.  We have had quite a degree of discussion on this particular amendment.  As the Deputy is aware, the primary focus in the legislation is to provide the commission with the power to impose financial sanctions for improper conduct.  Improper conduct will be the failure of a licenceholder to comply with such standards of performance to be developed by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and subsequently specified by the commission in its licences.<\/p> <p>  This administrative sanctions regime in the Bill is a start in providing the Commission for Energy Regulation with the effective enforcement process and it is not an end.  The penalty provision of 10% specified in the Bill is in line with existing penalty provisions in other Irish statutes for regulatory breaches.  It is also in line with penalty limits in EU directives.  It would not be appropriate to exceed the penalty limits of EU directives.  To do so may run the risk of a successful challenge on the grounds of disproportionality of penalties in excess of European norms and this could result, however unintentionally, in preventing the provisions being enforced in practice.<\/p> <p>  Our priority at this point is to enact the legislation and a more useful approach might be to assess the working of the penalty provisions after a suitable period of operation.  At such point and as part of such a process of review, the Commission for Energy Regulation could come before the committee and provide an informed view on the overall effectiveness of the operation of the sanction regime.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputies are aware, the Commission for Energy Regulation is statutorily independent and is accountable to the committee of this House and not to the Government.  On that basis, I cannot accept the amendment.  However, I hear where the Deputy is coming from regarding the issue for smaller operators and that this would be disproportionate.  The legislation is drafted the way it is in order that the penalties would have to be proportionate.  A provision is in the legislation for a company, if it considers this is disproportionate, to go before the courts.<\/p><p>The concern we had with the way this amendment is drafted is that the Deputy is going the other way.  He is creating the disproportionality by increasing the threshold.  The fear was that it would move out of the civil sanctions regime into the criminal sanctions regime by going over the 10% threshold.  I understand where the Deputy is coming from but the legislation as drafted allows for proportionate sanctions up to 10%, which would not disproportionately penalise small businesses over large ones.  If the sanction was seen to be disproportionate, the courts could revise those penalties down.  The important thing to remember is that this is for a breach of the licensing conditions set down by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  We do not yet have those conditions.  There would be a very useful role for this committee in engaging with the Commission for Energy Regulation to ensure the conditions on those licences clearly reflect the concerns the public has about the operation of energy companies.  Perhaps, with respect to the Chairman and members of the committee, they may wish to bring the commission in here to discuss that before it finalises the licensing conditions to ensure that they clearly and accurately reflect the issues that arise and come up in constituency offices, that the public complain about to CER.  I think the concern the Deputy raises is accurately reflected in the legislation as it stands.  There is always the safety net of the courts to review that if it is deemed to be disproportionate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CCS2016071400002#E00900","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468483200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>It is a pity that we are bound by what Big Brother in Brussels decrees.

That is what we are trying to do.  We are trying not to go down the criminal sanction route.  This has nothing to do with the EU.  In respect of legislation for civil sanctions, the threshold across the regulators has been up to a maximum of 10%.  If we go over that threshold, we are very likely to find ourselves in a situation where the courts will interpret this in the criminal rather than the civil realm.  Instead of these being dealt with as administrative sanctions, they will end up in the courts.  The objective of this is to ensure we keep as much work out of the courts as possible.<\/p> <p>  The point I make about Europe with regard to this is that our thresholds across our regulators are 10%.  At EU level, the thresholds are 10%.  If it was the case that we were working at a higher threshold or if they were working at higher at European level, we could consider that in the context of the amendment but the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment is trying to deal with proportionality.  This legislation deals with that issue.  We are talking about the difference between 10% and 12%.  Going over 10%, whether to 10.1% , 10.5%, 11% or 12% is irrelevant, is likely to bring us down the criminal sanction route rather than administrative sanctions.  We are trying to keep these out of the courts and reprimand companies that are not complying with the conditions of their licences.  The &euro;50,000 cap is separate.  That applies where a decision is taken not to introduce a penalty but where there has been a cost involved in carrying out the investigation and the maximum that can be charged in that respect.  To protect businesses, and particularly smaller operators, a cap is put on any administrative recovery cost that would be imposed by the CER.  The way the legislation is drafted accurately reflects the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns about it.  The objective is the same as the Deputy&rsquo;s, namely, to keep these issues out of the courts at an administrative level and to ensure that the companies involved in this business are operated in a manner that reflects the conditions laid down in their licences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CCS2016071400002#G00200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1468483200,"counter":288,"content":"<p>The Minister said that if it goes over 10%, it is likely to go into the criminal domain.

Deputy Lawless is correct that the resourcing of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, is an important issue.  While I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue and fully agree with the intent of the proposed amendment, I must reject it for a number of reasons.<\/p> <p>  I am fully cognisant of the need to ensure the Commission for Energy Regulation is fully resourced to carry out its statutory functions.  This important issue was raised in the Green Paper on Energy Policy published in May 2014.  As a result of the Green Paper consultation process, the recent White Paper includes a Government commitment to review the legal and institutional framework for the electricity and natural gas markets.  The White Paper commitment specifically states that the review includes the Commission for Energy Regulation's mandate and resources.  The matter of how best to implement this commitment is a priority issue and part of my Department&rsquo;s immediate work programme.<\/p> <p>  The European Union's 2009 third energy package obliges member states to ensure their energy regulators are fully independent and resourced. In line with this obligation, the Commission for Energy Regulation is legally independent in the performance of its functions under legislation and is only accountable to the Oireachtas.  The CER must be sufficiently resourced to deliver on its existing and growing mandate and this matter will form part of the scope of the forthcoming review.  I would greatly welcome the opportunity to discuss the review of the commission's mandate and resources with this committee at an early date. <\/p> <p>  Under the regulatory legislation, the Commission for Energy Regulation is accountable for the performance of its functions to this committee.  In this light, I hope the review will be of interest to members and I have no doubt there is potential for Deputies and Senators to make a valuable contribution to the review.  Any issues relating to resources in respect of new powers and functions will be fully reviewed in parallel with both the forthcoming review and the development of the new administrative sanctions regime.<\/p> <p>  It would not be appropriate or practical to consider the Commission for Energy Regulation's resources in respect of one particular statutory function and thereby exclude from examination the wide range of other regulatory functions the commission undertakes.  It is vital that a holistic approach is taken in respect of any review of the CER's resources in light of all its energy regulation functions.  In line with the principles of independence, the allocation of staff within the Commission for Energy Regulation is a matter for the commission. As the CER has assumed new functions in recent years, it has shown it can flexibly reallocate and adapt resources as its roles and objectives change.<\/p> <p>  It is therefore proposed to reject the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment on the basis that the adequacy or otherwise of the Commission for Energy Regulation&rsquo;s resources will be reviewed holistically as part of the forthcoming review to which the Government committed in the energy White Paper.  As I stated, this review can be discussed with the committee. <\/p> <p>  I do not disagree with the amendment in principle but it is the wrong vehicle for achieving the objective the Deputy seeks.  I will be pleased to engage with the committee as part of the overall review of the Commission for Energy Regulation and its functions.  Such engagement would be appropriate given that the committee is the organ of the State to which the commission is accountable.<\/p><p>It would be useful to engage with the committee on the Commission for Energy Regulation's functions, as well as its resources.  It is important that the commission has sufficient flexibility to reallocate resources in response to changes introduced under EU directives or additional responsibilities that may be conferred on it from time to time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CCS2016071400002#H00700","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468483200,"counter":303,"content":"<p>How stands the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CCS2016071400002#J00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1468483200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>The Minister has provided a reasonable response.

The Bill offers us an opportunity to update section 9 of the 1999 Act which sets out the issues to which the Commission for Energy Regulation must have regard.  The Act is remarkably out of date as energy policy and the entire energy market have changed completely since its introduction.  For this reason, section 9 needs to be updated to ensure it is in tune with the latest thinking on how electricity markets work.  The Commission for Energy Regulation must be given a political direction that efficiency, demand management, self-generation and the balancing of a variable power supply with variable demand are the critical tasks on which it must deliver.<\/p><p>In the original legislation, the areas to which the Commission for Energy Regulation must have regard were primarily competition, meeting supply, financial prudence and so forth.  While these requirements remain, the energy market and system have changed completely and we should use this opportunity to reflect this change in the legislation.<\/p><p>The amendment sets out in simple terms some of the broad elements of the new and evolving demand management market.  These include self-generation and integrating heat and transport and not only electricity in the markets.  This would completely flip the market model.  Rather than simply measuring as much flow as one can get through the system, we must start to pay the utility, distribution and transmission operators not for the amount of power they distribute but on the basis of how little power they distribute.  We should pay more for using less, as provided for in the amendment.  This approach is very much in tune with what the European Commission has indicated will be part of its new governance and market arrangements, which we expect will be announced in the autumn.  It is also in tune with what all progressive new utilities are doing.<\/p><p>The provisions inserted in the Bill under the amendment would provide the political guidance the regulator needs.  Ireland is falling behind and is one of the few countries in western Europe that does not allow people to trade self-generated power.  We are also falling behind in the roll-out of small meters and the integration of demand management and efficiency.  We must make a political statement to the regulator in which we set out the areas on which we want progress to be made.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 8 is more specific and proposes to amend section 14 of the 1999 Act in respect of the issuing of licences.  I am conscious that the Minister will argue that we must be careful in this regard because of the North and the need to enact the Bill quickly.  The main purpose of the amendment is to signal the possibility that this jurisdiction will introduce a licence on a geographically limited area to allow a local community to generate power and manage energy efficiency such that it becomes a local energy community that is much more effective and active in how it uses and trades electricity.<\/p><p>It is important to signal that we can issue a geographic licence, rather than having to treat the entire market as a single market, while recognising that those local markets would also have to have the ability to synchronise or connect into the wider market and cannot be disruptive to the overall market.<\/p><p> Last but not least, there is a provision in the amendment to the effect that we should be able to allow consumers, third-party aggregators and energy service companies to provide demand-side resources in wholesale balancing and ancillary service electricity markets.  That is the way the markets will go.  We need to update our legislation to encourage it in this country and in our single electricity market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CCS2016071400002#J00900","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468483200,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Broadly speaking, I support Deputy Ryan's amendments but I want to flag a further amendment that I would like to make to this which specifically concerns allowing communities and local co-operatives access to the national grid.

There is huge merit in it.  We are engaged at European level at the moment with the Commission on these very issues and I hope we will sign up by the end of this year to a new market design for the electricity market right across Europe.  Many of the issues that Deputy Ryan has raised in his amendment are already included in the submission that we have made on this to the Commission regarding self-consumption of renewable energy, microgeneration onto the grid, storage, new customers, electricity networks, more flexibility, allowing customers to participate actively, facilitating flexible trading and so forth.  We will include the aspects Deputy Ryan has proposed in his amendment in that overall discussion.  We expect to have a decision on that by the end of the year.  The concern is that if we accept this amendment at this stage, we will probably have to come back and revise and amend it again by the end of the year.  It makes more sense to include it in the transposition of the directive that will come in at the end of this year.<\/p> <p>  I think there are a number of unintended consequences of what Deputy Ryan proposes in his second amendment and there are issues of cost.  However, that does not take away from the principle or the point that he raises and it comes back to the proposed amendment to be tabled by Deputy Smith on Report Stage.  I am very conscious of this but I do not think it requires provision in legislation.  There is huge merit in what she talked about.  I am actively considering it at the moment in the context of the replacement of REFIT.  The big problem is getting access to the grid, the cost of getting access and the delay in getting access.  Unless one has a lot of money to be able either to sit it out until one gets physical access to the grid or to buy quicker gate access to the grid, one is left high and dry.  I do not believe that legislation is the way to do this.  I think what Deputies Ryan and Smith are looking for can be addressed in other mechanisms.  We are very actively engaged with this at the moment with the replacement of REFIT and we will come forward with draft proposals for public consultation towards the end of this year.  I am quite happy for the committee to be involved in that public consultation or to have a separate discussion here at the committee, not just specifically on this, but also on the broader issue.<\/p><p>However, I see exactly where the Deputies are coming from and agree with the point they make.  I am also very anxious to try to address the issue.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the formal note, I will speak to amendments Nos. 4 and 8 together.  It is proposed to reject them.  I commend Deputy Eamon Ryan for his desire to promote demand-side participation in the energy markets and provide a mechanism for consumers to participate actively in the market through the production, sale and possible storage of electricity to increase flexibility in energy markets and allow for the aggregation of services in the market.  However, these services are already substantially provided for in legislation in the functions of the Commission for Energy Regulation, specifically in section 9(4)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  The detailed rules for the operation of the wholesale electricity market are being fundamentally altered under the integrated single electricity market, ISEM, project.  The project is being led by the regulators in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, overseen by the two Departments on the island and will deliver a flexible electricity market that will provide for the policies outlined by Deputy Eamon Ryan.  They include the explicit facilitation of demand units in the high-level design and detailed decision papers.  I can provide further information on this for Deputies if they wish.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, the policies advocated by Deputy Eamon Ryan are supported by the White Paper on energy published in 2015.  The White Paper acknowledges the crucial role of citizens in the transformation towards a decarbonised electricity sector.  It acknowledges community-level energy efficiency and renewable energy projects such as the Aran Islands project and the Marino schools project and the role they will play in the transition.  It also commits to supporting community participation in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  It also commits the Government to facilitating access to the grid for renewable energy projects and ensuring grid connection policy will have due regard to current and future renewable energy policy.<br\/><br\/>As the Deputy is aware, the European Commission is drafting the winter package of legislative proposals, including proposed legislation on electricity market design.  The Commission has consulted on this issue and my Department has responded to it.  We expect the Commission to publish its impact assessment later this year, in advance of the proposals for market legislation which is due in December.  The legislation will define how the new electricity market design should look in order to meet consumer expectations, deliver real benefits from technology and facilitate investment, especially in renewables and low carbon generation.  The market design legislation will facilitate decentralised electricity generation, including for self-consumption, and support the emergence of innovative energy service companies.<br\/><br\/>Given these developments and the requirement for national compliance with EU legislation in the energy sphere, I suggest that if there are gaps in legislative and regulatory provision, they be addressed in transposing the imminent EU legislation.  If we were to anticipate that legislation now in national primary legislation, it is quite possible that we would subsequently have to repeal the legislation if it conflicted with EU laws.  We would then have to set about developing and drafting further and compatible legislation.  It strikes me that it would be more efficient and prudent to await and influence the EU law as it is developed.  Devoting time and scarce legal resources to legislating now and a second time in repealing or amending the legislation when transposing binding EU legislation would not seem to be an efficient way to proceed.  Legislating prematurely could unintentionally generate infringements.  We are quite happy to keep the Deputy up to speed on how the talks are progressing and the feedback received.  I am also quite happy to receive his input on how we manage the process in the next few months.<br\/><br\/>On the matters pertaining to the regulation of the single electricity market for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, it has been the custom, since its inception in 2007, for legislation governing the operation of this cross-jurisdictional and all-island market to be amended in parallel in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in order that the substance of the legislation is mirrored.  That has been the case in making the amendment in the Bill to facilitate the evolution of the single electricity market.  The ministries in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland have worked closely together to ensure the amendments to the definition of the market will have the same meaning in both jurisdictions.<\/p><p>Along with other Deputies, I wish as far as possible to adhere to the approach of parallel legislative development and enactment of largely similar content for the single electricity market.<br\/><br\/>On a technical drafting matter related to the proposed amendment No. 8, section 14(1) of the Electricity Regulation Act provides for the issuing of licences by the commission.  Section 14(1)(<i>e<\/i>) and (<i>f<\/i>) of the Act enable the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, to license a transmission system operator and a transmission system owner.  Section 14(1) would not appear to be the appropriate location for the Deputy&rsquo;s proposals.  The proposal as worded by the Deputy would have the unintended effect of overwriting and removing the CER's function to license a transmission system operator or owner.  The White Paper provides for a commitment for a review of the legal and institutional framework for the regulation of electricity and natural gas markets, including the CER's mandate.  The review would be the more appropriate vehicle to develop proposals from the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CCS2016071400002#K00300","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468483200,"counter":316,"content":"<p>What has been said harks back to what Deputy Stanley objected to, which is the idea we have to be guided all the time, in advance, by what Europe might say about what we want to do.

The Minister said that we cannot legislate for this aspect without considering what Europe will say to us, which to me is putting the cart before the horse.  If I am wrong, please correct me, but we should legislate for our needs, desires and what we think is best for our market and people.

In terms of Europe, we are developing a single European energy market and are driving forward with a European energy union.  We need it more than anyone else in Europe.  I was talking to my Portuguese and Spanish colleagues earlier this week, and they are also very anxious about interconnectivity.  The reality is we import a substantial amount of energy.  The vast majority of our energy comes from abroad.  I would love to see us self-sufficient but we are not going to be for a long time to come, so we need this interconnectivity.  We need co-operation across Europe while Britain is in the European Union and we will definitely need it when Britain leaves the European Union.  We need to make sure that the system we have here in Ireland complies with what is happening elsewhere in Europe.  Remember that we have a fully open competitive electricity and gas market here and I want to see more competition come in through interconnectivity.  As I said at the outset, it is not just in terms of gas, and we are exploring the option of liquified natural gas in the Shannon Estuary which could provide competition to our gas interconnection with the UK.<\/p> <p>  Next week, President Hollande will come to Dublin to discuss the Celtic interconnector between Ireland and France so that we have electricity interconnection outside of these islands.  Last month, at the Council of Ministers' meeting, I signed a political declaration with the other North Sea countries about developing offshore, wind, tidal and wave resources in order that we can work together on them.<\/p><p>That will require interconnectivity and having similar laws across Europe in order to manage and operate that.  It will not work if we are at complete variance.  We cannot go it alone.  We are an island located off an island that will soon be outside of the European Union.

We do not need legislation to do so.  If it pointless to give communities access to the grid if they do not have the financial resources to connect to the grid or to build the renewable energy, whether it is biogas, wind, biomass or whatever the case may be.  We need a comprehensive approach that will assist communities in getting a co-operative up and running, developing the renewable resource whatever it is and getting access to the grid.  That is what I want to do.  It is not just about grid access.  We could provide grid access tomorrow morning but if we did so we will not see a rush of community groups developing renewable energy resources.  They cannot do so because they do not have the capacity or financial resources to do so.  What we are looking in the context of the review of the current supports is how can we actively support communities.<\/p> <p>  Last month, I spoke to my Scottish counterpart, Minister Cunningham, at a bilateral meeting of the Council of Ministers.  She said that the mechanisms that Scotland used to support energy generation by communities have not been as successful as hoped for and, prior to the vote on Brexit, we had agreed to have further engagement to see how Ireland could learn from Scotland in this respect.  For example, what have been the positive aspects of that?  How can we better develop that?  I am trying to do exactly what Deputy Smith wants me to do and that is to encourage communities to produce their own heat and electricity locally, not only to meet their own needs but to export it on to the grid as well.

It is just not fair.  We are a small island with lots of wind, solar and wave potential and we need to urgently move away from our reliance on fossil fuels.  The Minister contradicted himself by saying that we need connectivity with other countries through gas, etc.  I believe that we need to move away from that model and into sustainability.  The way we can do that is by encouraging local, community-based production of power and we can only do that through legislation.  If the Government does not legislate for this, of course, communities will say, \"Why bother?  The Minister does not give a damn and he is waiting to see what Europe does.\"  He must make decisions about this country not the entire European Union or the bit of it that has just \"Brexited\".  That is the problem with his approach.  He is saying leave the communities and leave the co-ops that exist on the Aran Islands out of the legislation and that he will think about them and talk to them separately.  That is not good enough.  They need legal access to the grid that does not force them to compete with the big players on the market.

If these amendments were on the issue of balancing payments, capacity payments, market closure rules or all of the complex aspects of that interconnection issue the Minister talks about, I would accept what he says.  However, this is nothing.  This is all about local markets and local demand management.  I can see no way where the amendments, and perhaps the Department will come back to the committee and highlight this, might interfere with regional electricity markets that will be developed.

I appreciate the Deputy's concerns about the need to review the possible impact of the biofuels obligation levy on indigenous producers and also her concerns about the bigger picture of the impact of the growth in the use of biofuels in the food needs of developing countries.  It is something very close to my own heart.  It is part of NORA's role to administer the biofuels obligation scheme.  Section 30(1)(a) and section 30(2) of the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 provide that the agency, \"If required by the Minister ... shall provide the Minister with information in relation to ... the performance of its functions ... in such form and within such period as the Minister may direct.\"  It would appear that the issue raised by the Deputy could be addressed via the existing legislation.  Furthermore, in section 31(2) of the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 there is provision for the chief executive of the agency to account to the Oireachtas and committee for the performance of the functions of the agency.  Therefore, a more user-friendly and immediate approach may be for the committee to request the agency to brief it on its functions and the administration of the biofuels obligation scheme, including the issues Deputy Smith has raised.  In turn, this could inform the format of the information the agency could be asked to provide to the Minister under section 30 of the Act.  During such discussions, information may emerge on what existing or future economic research, whether at national or EU level, will be undertaken or planned.  On that basis, I propose to reject the amendment.<\/p> <p>  I do not disagree with the principle of the amendment tabled by Deputy Smith.  I do not know if she has had an opportunity to look at the annual report of NORA on the biofuels obligation scheme.  I can give her a copy of it when the committee's proceedings end today.  There is a lot of very detailed information about where the biofuels come from and the percentages that come from different parts of the world.  The most significant percentage of our biofuels obligation, which is 18.5%, comes from the UK.  Denmark is a big supplier as well.  Quite a lot of them are developed countries.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if that addresses the issues the Deputy is talking about.  The difficulty is the bulk of what comes in comes from other EU countries.  Where does it come from before that?  Is it generated in those other EU countries or other developed countries?  Is it generated in third countries or developing countries?  It is not that easy to find that information.  We do not have country of origin information on biofuels like we have with beef.  It is very easy, at the press of a button, to find out exactly where beef is coming from and how much of it is being imported from specific countries.<\/p><p>I suggest the Deputy should have a look at the annual report of the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA.  She should ascertain whether there are insufficiencies in the detailed report it produces on the biofuels obligation on an annual basis and we then can consider how to best address that.  This committee could bring NORA before it and the agency could explain what it does and what information is available to it.  I honestly think this is a far broader issue.  While some people present are quite critical of the European Union, this is something that could be appropriately addressed at European Union level whereby the Union itself could ascertain what is the source of the biofuels coming in and what impact it is having on the communities involved.  I am conscious of this issue with regard to biofuels and the same issue could be raised regarding the wood chip and biomass being imported into both Ireland and the European Union.  It is not just direct imports but imports via second countries.  We may be purchasing either wood chip or biofuel that is coming in from another EU country but the issue is from where it is being sourced in the first place.  It is a complex issue and the capacity and resources are not available to NORA or any other agency in Ireland to deal with that.  The carrying out of a thorough investigation of what is going on probably would be more appropriately dealt with at EU level and there would be huge merit in doing that.  I suggest members should look at the contents of the NORA report that is presented annually.  NORA could be brought before the committee to establish whether there are other additions to the reporting mechanism that can be improved.  If the capacity is not available at an Irish level to provide whatever requirements there are, over and above what is being provided by NORA at present, then it can be looked at in a European context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CCS2016071400002#V01000","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468483200,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Just as the Minister appealed to me on the last amendment to give him time to consider it and come back to me next week, I ask him to give me time to look at the NORA report and to not oppose this amendment until I do some more investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CCS2016071400002#W00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1468483200,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Yes, that is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CCS2016071400002#W00300","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1468483200,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I point out, however, that despite importing biofuels, we still are not reducing our use of oil or gas.

The question is from where it is sourced before that, that is, whether it is indigenous production of EU countries or comes from somewhere else.  As the Deputy will see from the detail it provides, NORA provides as much information as it can but is not in a position to answer that.  It probably would be useful to have NORA appear before the committee and to ask it whether there are deficits in this reporting mechanism it could clarify in the next report it will present to me.  If there still is a void in information, I would be happy to work with this at European level and push it up the agenda because I seek the same result as the Deputy in this regard.  I already have discussed this with biomass providers to make sure that something like this cannot happen.  It is far broader than the biofuels issue.  While the issue of biofuels is to the fore at present, biomass will become a far greater issue in the future.

Rather than seeking to criminalise those caught up in addiction, we should be discussing a broader range of measures that seek to address the systemic and societal issues that lead to addiction.  Sinn F&eacute;in has already expressed its disappointment that, when pressed, officials of the Department conceded that this measure was not being sought by people who worked with those with an addiction, including therapeutic communities, and that it formed part the response to issues that had arisen within the north inner city.

I welcome the Bill, but I agree with Deputy Louise O'Reilly that it addresses only a tiny piece of a far greater problem.  I do not see it as fixing anything in a great way, but I also do not see it as doing major harm.  In my south Dublin pharmacy I have a file for forged prescriptions.  It is a serious issue.  As somebody working in the community, I am aware that when I receive a forged prescription, I am supposed to report the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, in reality it is hard to manage this and ensure there is a follow-on.  The legislation is good, but we need to address the bigger issue of why people end up in these situations and their lives are so bad that they want to get up in the morning and take a sleeping tablet.  There are people who have reduced their methadone intake over many years, but they still carry with them the criminal record that acts as a barrier to their re-engaging with society in the same way as the rest of us can.  As I said, this is a small piece of something far greater.  I am aware of the difficulties for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is important, however, that whatever we do in the health area, we first do no harm.  I do not believe this measure will do any harm.

We all live in communities, whether urban or rural, where drug addiction is a problem.<\/p><p>The Deputy is correct that more needs to be done about the scourge of drugs and the unfortunate people who use them, as well as the drug trade and gangland criminals.  I intend to do more as part of the ongoing process and, as I stated in both the Seanad and D&aacute;il, this legislation is only a small piece of a large jigsaw.  We will look at all the pieces and I am sure all members will participate in the public consultation process.<\/p><p> The national drugs strategy must address the issue of people who get into trouble at a young age and are left with a criminal record for the rest of their lives.  Even if they stop using drugs, they will probably not have any prospect of finding employment or returning to education and may find it impossible to travel abroad, even on holiday, which most young people like to do.  This issue needs to be addressed.  It is not my role to criminalise anybody, particularly young people who get into trouble with the law, whether as a result of their background or social environment, and end up in a sad state as a result of taking legal or illegal drugs to get a high.  I am open to any suggestions that emerge from the public consultation process to progress this issue as part of the national drugs strategy. <\/p><p> I do not have all the answers, which is the reason we have a national drugs strategy and a public consultation process.  However, I have lived and worked in a community that has been destroyed by drug addiction.  Young people I knew have taken their lives and died of terrible diseases, some of which I cannot even pronounce.  We have an opportunity to make a difference to people's lives and I have not ruled anything in or out in that respect.  I will do my utmost through the public consultation process and in the national drugs strategy to address the issues Deputies have raised. <\/p><p> Criminalisation is a complex issue and we must be very careful about how we approach it.  Senators and Deputies referred to the Portuguese model.  I visited the Ana Liffey drug project on Abbey Street the other day where I met people with chronic drug addiction problems, including homeless people.  These individuals need help.  As part of that process, we must address the issue from every angle.  I am willing to listen to people's concerns, provided they are rational and change is possible.  However, we cannot accept amendments that would result in decriminalisation tomorrow morning as to do so would return us to the position in which we found ourselves last year when our streets, neighbourhoods and communities were flooded with drugs of all shapes and sizes. <\/p><p> I read a newspaper report yesterday on a sad case involving a young boy and girl aged 12 years who took tablets in England that left one of them critically ill in hospital.  As responsible citizens and public representatives, the onus is on us to do our utmost to tackle this issue in a competent and reasonable manner that helps people.  We must not use the drugs issue as a political football because people are dying.  I read statistics the other evening which indicated that more people die of drug addiction and overdoses than in road traffic accidents.  We will consider ways of encouraging people not to get involved in drugs.  They become involved for a variety of reasons and the people who do so do not always live in poorer communities.  Some are at the top of society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2016071400002#E00500","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468485000,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State on her first appearance before the select committee.  This is the first meeting I have attended in a long time.  I also congratulate her on introducing the Bill.  I agree with the sentiment expressed by previous speakers that this is not the final answer to the problem as it is a highly involved, complicated and broad-based issue that affects the lives of many people and communities in a very serious way.<\/p> <p>  In a previous incarnation, I was involved in a ministerial drugs task force which had access to what became known as the Zurich and Amsterdam experiments, the St. Gallen exercise and other similar approaches.  Over the years, everybody has tried in various ways to identify how best to deal with this growing problem which is having a much more serious impact on society than was first thought.<\/p><p>Significant resources have been used in attempting to apply the law.  I am still in favour of trying to ensure as best we can that we do not legalise illegality.  This proposal is a controlling exercise and it is absolutely necessary for the reasons stated by the Minister of State.  That in itself will not solve the problem but I agree with Deputy O'Reilly and my colleague that our society has been damned by the extent of the abuse of drugs over the past number of years.  It has increased and continues to increase and many people make significant money out of other people's misery.  As the Minister of State said, many young people have lost their lives ridiculously chancing their arm in social situations following which they end up either seriously injured or dead.  Everybody talks about it at the time and everybody is appalled at what has happened.  However, this happens throughout society and it is not restricted to one sector of society.  People who should know better find themselves in this situation.<\/p><p> I welcome the Bill in the sense that it is the first step to deal with, and control, this problem.  It will also be the conduit whereby there will be ongoing focus on the issue.  There will be a continuous public review and internal review through medics working in the business, through GPs and through the Department to check how the legislation is being applied and whether it is working in the way it is intended, to embrace the beneficial aspects and to review the aspects of it that do not appear to work and do not prove to be beneficial.  The review is important.  It needs to be continuous and updated on a regular basis.  Unlike reviews, which, for example, in the European context can be undertaken after ten years when officials suddenly discover that a scheme did not work, this review should be conducted annually and the legislation updated accordingly in order that one is always ahead of oneself.<\/p><p> I compliment all involved in the introduction of the Bill, and particularly the Minister of State for bringing it to the House.  I hope it will deal with the issue it is intended to deal with.  As Deputy O'Reilly said, we have to deal with the underlying societal effects of deprivation that lead to young people, in particular, becoming reliant on drugs.  It is not good for society.  It is devastating for the economy, the health service, the well-being of individuals and those who are directly affected by drug abuse.  Like all addictions, efforts made to control this are welcome and I hope as a result of the legislation we will be able to evaluate on a regular basis its beneficial impact and, if required, make changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2016071400002#F00200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468485000,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and I commend her and her officials on the work they have done on this legislation.  I agree with previous speakers that even though it is good, it only represents a small part in addressing a huge problem.  Going forward, I would like funding to be invested in the education sector, particularly primary schools, because drug abuse is affecting people at a younger age.  If we got into national schools and highlighted the effects of drugs, it would help.  There seems to be an acceptance about people using drugs, which was not the case when I was young.  When I was young, if one had a few pints one was considered to be cool or in the gang or whatever but, unfortunately, drug abuse is affecting people at a younger age.  It used to be a Dublin problem but now it is rife everywhere.

I am struggling to understand if we are all in agreement why there is such a rush to introduce this tiny measure that may leave people struggling with addiction, as Deputy O'Connell pointed out, having to get over the hurdle of a criminal conviction and increase the likelihood of them ending up with such a conviction.  Nobody is looking for this legislation.  Therapeutic communities are not looking for it.  Why the rush to do this and not address all the other work that has been done?  There is broad agreement among committee members on what is needed for communities that have been ravaged by the scourge of drugs.  I am at a loss to understand why there is a flashing blue light emergency for this small adjustment, which has the potential to do nothing except criminalise people who are struggling and suffering, but there is none to address the systemic problems and the underlying reasons for addiction or even to consider the minor actions that could be taken such as counting the number of prescriptions issued by GPs by talking directly to them and to pharmacists and using whatever controls that exist, which are not utilised to their full extent.  This would make a significant contribution to controlling the illicit or illegal sale of prescription drugs.  First, I am struggling to understand why this legislative measure is being pushed when we are all in agreement that systemic issues need to be addressed.  Second, we are not utilising the mechanisms that exist to control or monitor the sale and supply.  More could be done in the context of talking to GPs and pharmacists to make sure access to these drugs is not as easy.

Deputy Murphy O'Mahony clearly highlighted that the prevention pillar of the national drugs strategy has not worked.  There is no awareness among our younger generation, in particular, about the dangers of drugs consumption.  We are discussing the criminal element of this issue but how are we educating young people about the dangers of all the substances they are using and abusing?  We have failed at both primary and secondary levels.  SPHE is dysfunctional as a subject.  It is often used by teachers of another subject to teach that subject.  SPHE needs to be properly audited and reformed.  We are not enriching our young people through education about the dangers of drugs.  We have failed to make them aware.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste earlier this week about the road traffic Bill, which will address drug drivers who consume a multiplicity of drugs.  They can be convicted of drink driving but not drug driving.  The Bill is being delayed until the autumn.  The Minister of State needs to accelerate that legislation.<\/p> <p>  I agree that prevention and treatment are the key in order that drugs policy reform be dealt with in a holistic way.  The Minister of State mentioned she will consider Suboxone as part of the new national drugs strategy.  Does she agree that given the current licensing arrangements, its approval could be delayed for a year or two?  Medical, pharmaceutical and drug treatment professionals want this medicine to be approved.<\/p><p>By delaying it, we are not going to see the initiation of the treatment.  If we put it on a legislative footing, it could then be licensed and allocated accordingly.

She is right and so is Deputy Chambers.  I have my own views on SPHE and how it is taught in schools.  I totally agree with the Deputy and I have spoken to this committee before, when I was on the opposite side of the room, about how teachers who are teaching mathematics and English one minute are in another room teaching SPHE the next minute.  I am not fully convinced that that is what should be done.  I believe that it is too important to have SPHE as just a subject in between everything else.  There should be somebody in there teaching young people.  It is about well-being and self-confidence because all of that builds who one is.  I agree with the Deputy on that.  As a mother who was involved for many years in schools and on parents' councils, I always felt that even though the teachers did their very best, sometimes it was difficult for teachers who had been in a classroom teaching Irish, English or whatever subject, to then go in to children and talk to them about their well-being, their sexuality, drugs and everything else.  In my opinion, some teachers felt at the time that it was not really their job.  I spoke to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, the other evening about this whole aspect and I have asked him to have a look at it as well.<\/p><p>Deputy O'Reilly and I know very well the reason this legislation is being introduced.  It is to assist and to help An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other services in situations where somebody is on a street and has a quantity of drugs in their possession, even if the drugs may be legal.  We all know the situation.  Deputy O'Reilly knows better than I do, as does her party colleague Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, who is part of the north inner city forum and is aware of the complex needs that are out there, particularly in certain parts of the city.  Deputy McDonald said it herself at a meeting we attended that it is unlikely that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is going to target the people who are unfortunate enough to be caught with maybe one or two tablets in their pocket.  The people out there now who are selling drugs are very clever.  I have every confidence that on the streets on which they walk the beat every day of the week, the garda&iacute; know the people they are targeting.  This is not about targeting addicts.  It is about targeting people who are at the top end and the criminal end of the scale.  From listening to Deputy McDonald in the D&aacute;il and in others areas, I believe that this is only a small part of what needs to be done.  In saying that, it does give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the customs officers the opportunity to be able to seize those kinds of drugs.  That is the reason for the Bill.<\/p><p>Regarding Suboxone, I do not mean to be dismissive of Deputy Chambers because I know where he is coming from.  The introduction of Suboxone requires amendments to the regulations.  This Bill unlocks the regulations so that Suboxone<b><\/b>can be made available.  As I said, from talking to medical professionals in the Department, Suboxone is not going to be the answer for everybody on methadone.  There are some people who just cannot take it for medical reasons.  However, it is not off the table.  It is very much on the table.  We will come back to it.<\/p><p>In response to Deputy O'Connell, I am very aware in the parish I live in of the role the pharmacist plays in educating people about drug addiction, in providing methadone treatment and, in general, being the eyes and ears of people who have addiction problems who come into the chemist on a regular basis.  I have the greatest of praise for those people, who, like the Deputy, have had to deal with people coming in with forged prescriptions on a daily basis.  I know it takes time, but if we want to tackle the sources and the big players, everybody has to play a role in it.  I can only stand over the role that I know the pharmacist in my own community plays, even in identifying people.<\/p><p>Pharmacists do not send people away because they have a problem.  They help them.  I believe that is very much the role that most pharmacists play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2016071400002#J00200","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468485000,"counter":487,"content":"<p>In reference to the comments of Deputy O'Connell, the purpose of the meeting was to agree the Bill.

I have a sister who is ten years older than me who is a psychiatrist.  I remember when we were young at home her showing us brain scans of people with drug dependency.  That fairly educated us.  There is huge scope to inform younger people at a very early stage of the effects of drugs but also to inform them that these drugs are not manufactured in a controlled environment anywhere.  They are produced in a portakabin out the back of somewhere.  There is a danger that somebody will put the decimal point in the wrong place.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Suboxone, there are very few countries that have not licensed it.  From the evidence I have read, it seems to be particularly useful to young addicts who have not entered a methadone programme.  It has a two-pronged approach to dealing with dependency and overdose at the one stage.  It is something we need to keep on the table.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Deputy O'Reilly's point about monitoring prescriptions, the prescription situation in Ireland is very unusual.  The Chairman could write a prescription on the back of a piece of paper today and present it down the road.  It is very difficult to track.  Until we get to a situation in which we have the unique patient identifier and we can say, \"That is Louise's number\", and track it, with the way things are at the minute, it is very difficult to monitor all of that scientifically.  My only concern is that when this legislation is enacted, the market will still be there.  We may cut off one stream.  Ninety-five mg of diazepam, one of the benzodiazepines, costs about &euro;20 on prescription.  Its street value is about &euro;450.  It is a lucrative business.  Once we cut it off with this legislation, we are probably going to open up some other avenue because the people who are taking these drugs are not going to wake up in the morning and think they could get in trouble.  They are going to go to the other guy.
