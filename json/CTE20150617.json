I thank you for allowing me to make this opening statement and I'll draw on my witness statement and summarise a number of points - the international and domestic background, the system of financial regulation, fiscal policy and the risks as they were seen in 2005 and 2006.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the international and domestic background, by 2006 financial markets had become increasingly globalised.  They had become accustomed to readily available credit, significant product innovation, greater financial integration in the euro area, large current balance repayments in balances and lower risk premiums.  Technology had transformed the efficiency, speed and complexity of financial instruments and transactions.  This was supported by a strong belief that new modes of finance had reduced systemic risk.  Against that background, Ireland experienced an extended period of strong economic expansion, interrupted only by lower growth rates in 2001 and 2002.  Consequently, Irish expectations were high that living standards and assets ... asset prices would continue to advance.  This, in turn, was reflected in strong demand for credit in housing.  The Department's statement of strategy, particularly fiscal policy, was strongly influenced by the provisions of the programme for Government published in June 2002.  The Social Partnership Agreement 2003 to 2005, entitled Sustaining Progress, also had a strong influence on fiscal policy.  Fiscal policy, incomes policy and regulation were the key policy instruments available to the Irish authorities to manage the domestic economy within the euro area.  This was recognised from the outset of our EU membership.  The Department of Finance established an internal working group to examine the implications of EU membership.  The report, entitled The Implications of EMU Membership for Various Aspects of Public Policy, was approved by the Minister of Finance for publication in October 1999 on the Department's website.  And at page 10 that report states:<\/p><blockquote>The &ldquo;Celtic Tiger&rdquo; economy is already having a major effect on expectations in terms of income, taxation and expenditure policy and it is clear that, far from moderating, these pressures are likely to continue to grow.  In the circumstances, it will undoubtedly prove extremely difficult to persuade the social partners, interest groups and the public in general to accept a prudent fiscal stance.<\/blockquote>  <p>Being a euro area member state, the Irish Government had no function in relation to official interest rates or the euro exchange rate.  During the period 2002 to 2006 Ireland had a AAA credit rating and Irish banks were able to borrow wholesale funds at competitive rates.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the system of financial regulation, in October 1998 the Government agreed in principle to establish a single regulatory authority and established an implementation advisory group chaired by Mr. Michael McDowell, senior counsel.  The group reported on 19 May 1999 and recommended that the single regulatory authority, or the SRA, should be an entirely new, independent organisation.  As a member of the implementation group, I proposed an alternative model on behalf of the Department of Finance.  This model located the SRA within a restructured Central Bank and provided for increased autonomy for the regulatory function but under the direct control of the Central Bank board.  This alternative model is at appendix II of the report, page 79.  In the event the Government legislated for a model with a separate board for regulation but within an overall Central Bank and financial services authority framework.  The new model came into operation on 1 May 2003.  The Government's White Paper, Regulating Better, was published by the Department of the Taoiseach in January 2004.  It identified what the Government saw as the principles of good regulation, namely, necessity, effectiveness, proportionality, transparency, accountability and consistency.  The White Paper advised, &quot;The recommendations and actions in this White Paper are best seen in the context of the continuing drive for competitiveness and people's expectations of high quality public services.&quot;  <br\/><br\/>The 2006 annual report of the Irish Financial Regulator, at page 26, refers to its approach to regulation in the following terms, &quot;In order to ensure that our regulatory requirements do not become a barrier to competitiveness and innovation, we apply the Better Regulation principles which the Government published in January 2004 [...] and are an active member of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Better Regulation Group.&quot;  <\/p>  <p>         This approach in turn appeared to be aligned to the prevailing EU and wider international belief in the economic benefits of rational self-correcting markets and the merits of financial intermediation.  <\/p> <p> On fiscal policy, over the four years 2002-2006, each year the Department of Finance engaged with the Minister on the preparation of the budget strategy memorandum that was submitted by the Minister to the Government at mid-year.  The Government decision, based on that memorandum, formed the basis for the preparation of the spending, taxation and borrowing ... and deficit-surplus framework for the upcoming budget.  Government Departments were required to submit their spending proposals by early autumn, based on that Government decision.  The Department of Finance would also prepare an estimate of the cost of funding the existing level of public services during the following year and this would be used as a reference point in discussions with Departments-Ministers in the lead-up to the budget.  The budgets for 2003 and 2004 were difficult because, in each case, Departments were required to prepare their pre-budget expenditure figures at a level significantly below what the Department of Finance estimated it would cost to fund existing service levels during the following year.  For the 2003 budget, the required reduction was &euro;900 million and, in the case of the 2004 budget, the corresponding figure was &euro;500 million.  In the case of the 2004 budget, line Departments contended that the Department of Finance base was &euro;2.1 billion too low.  These two budgets were naturally unpopular and subject to criticism.  <\/p> <p> When it came to preparing the 2005 budget, the political pressure to ease up on what were seen as expenditure cuts was very strong.  In addition, the pressure was more difficult to resist because the economic recovery from the 2001-2002 downturn was more firmly established.  Against that background, Government decided, on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance, that Departments should prepare their Estimates for 2005 on the basis of the Department of Finance Estimates of the cost of funding the existing level of services in 2005 and that, in addition, &euro;900 million would be provided to cover the cost of the budget day social welfare and tax changes.  In the event, the budget strategy memorandum targets were exceeded by approximately &euro;1 billion in gross terms.  The budget day tax package accounted for almost &euro;580 million and gross public expenditure accounted for the remainder of the &euro;1.9 billion.  The year-on-year increase for gross voted public expenditure was just over 9%.  <\/p> <p> In preparation for budget 2006, the Department tabled a paper for the ministerial management advisory committee of 2 February 2005 entitled, \"Draft Framework for Developing the Budget Strategy Memorandum 2006-2008\".  I enclosed a copy with my witness statement.  That paper recommended that the target for capital expenditure be about 5% of GNP and that gross voted current expenditure be increased by 6.6% over its 2005 level.  In the event, the 2006 budget strategy memorandum was based on an increase of about 7.5% in gross current expenditure and gross voted Exchequer capital of 4.6% of GNP.  Post-budget, the gross voted current expenditure increase was 10.9% and gross Exchequer capital was 4.7% of GNP.  From a sustainability viewpoint, gross voted current expenditure is particularly important because of the difficulty in reversing welfare, pension and pay increases once granted.  The gross 2006 cost of the budget day tax package was &euro;763 million.  <\/p> <p> During each of the four years ending 31 December 2006, the general government was in surplus and these surpluses ranged between 0.4% of GDP in 2002 and 2.9% of GDP in 2006.  During the same period, the general government debt declined each year as a percentage of GDP from 32.2% in 2002 to 24.7% in 2006.  The European Commission recommendation on the Irish stability programme update of 22 February 2006 to the Council of Ministers stated, \"The fiscal position can be considered [as] sound and the budgetary strategy provides a good example of fiscal policies conducted in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.\"  <\/p> <p> On taxation of housing and property, the 2005 Budget Statement delivered by the Minister for Finance in December 2004 announced that the Department of Finance and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners would undertake, in 2005, a detailed review of certain tax incentive schemes and tax exemptions in the areas of property and housing.  <\/p>  <p>         Arising from the review, the Minister for Finance in his 2006 Budget Statement announced a broad range of changes including the ending of a number of property based tax incentive schemes, subject to certain conditions.  The main condition was that the period during which the qualifying expenditure can be incurred was extended to end July 2008.  This extension was limited to projects that had already satisfied the terms of the particular scheme.  The Minister also introduced with effect from 1 January 2007, a new measure to limit the use of tax breaks by those with high incomes.  <br\/><br\/>Turning to risks, publically acknowledged in 2005, the annual financial stability report was produced jointly by the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  The two boards came together to approve the document.  Despite this level of co-operation, I consider that the single board structure, recommended by a minority of the McDowell group, was the best option and in the aftermath of the crisis, the Government reverted to a single board structure.  The 2005 financial stability report published on 1 November 2005 identified the primary risk to be credit growth and indebtedness levels.  This risk was placed ahead of the risk in unanticipated and sudden fall in residential property prices because of a moderation in house price growth since the 2004 report.  However, the report notes the emergence of tentative evidence that this moderation may not have persisted and goes on to state that if house prices were to accelerate this would increase the risk of a sharp correction to house prices.<br\/><br\/>The report went on to conclude, &ldquo;The stability and health of the Irish banking system appears generally sound, according to the standard indicators of financial health such as asset quality, profitability, solvency, liquidity and credit ratings.&rdquo;  This view was broadly shared by the IMF and the OECD.  The IMF executive board published an assessment of the Irish financial system in August 2006.  That assessment stated, &quot;Directors welcomed the Financial System Stability Assessment Update, which finds that Ireland&rsquo;s financial sector soundness indicators are generally strong and that the major lenders have adequate buffers to cover a range of shocks.&quot;  In March 2006 the OECD economic review of Ireland had stated at page 118, &quot;The most likely scenario is that prices stabilise and the housing market stays flat for some years.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Regarding the fiscal situation, the 2006 budget material made clear that as a small open economy, Ireland was particularly vulnerable to changes in the world economic outlook.  Among the significant international and domestic downside risks highlighted was the following:<\/p><blockquote>Given the loss of competitiveness in recent years, the economy is vulnerable to any further deterioration.  In addition, the fact that the construction sector now accounts for a historically high share of economic activity and employment, implies that the economy is vulnerable to any shock affecting this sector.<\/blockquote> <p>In this context, the December, 2005 ESRI Medium-Term Review, 2005-2012, included an economic assessment of a housing shock.  The ESRI stressed that the assessment was not a forecast.  For illustrative purposes, it calibrated a housing price shock with a fall in house prices of approximately one third in 2007 and with house prices only beginning to recover after 2010.  They analysed the potential impact of these major changes on the economy over the period 2007 to 2010.  The study concluded that annual housing completions would not fall much below 40,000 and GNP would fall sharply in 2007 but remain above 1%.  Unemployment is shown increasing sharply and peaking below 12% in 2009 before beginning to ease back, with the rate of wage increases falling sharply to just above zero.  Considering a scenario where the Government allowed the deficit to rise without responding, the paper concluded that the impact on the public finances would be quite large, with a peak Exchequer deficit in the range of 4.5% to 5% of GNP in 2009.However, despite the acknowledged risks, the consensus view remained that the external environment was broadly positive, with international forecasting agencies projecting continued strong growth in the world economy in 2006 and 2007.  <br\/><br\/>In summary, against the background of the financial stress tests and the outcome of the ESRI assessment of the fiscal impact of a severe housing shock, the available safety margins seemed to be more than adequate.  <\/p>  <p>         In a budgetary context, this safety margin can be summarised as follows: in 2006, the general government surplus was 2.9% of GDP and the general government debt was the second lowest in the euro area at less than 25% of GDP when the Stability and Growth Pact reference point was 60%.  Ireland had a AAA credit rating, was financing a major capital programme from current revenue, and, by end-2006, the National Pensions Reserve Fund had a balance of &euro;18.9 billion.  The then consensus view of economic commentators, including the EU Commission, the IMF and OECD, was that the domestic and international economic outlook was broadly favourable.  The Government's 2006 budget had included measures designed to help ease pressure in the property market and these pressures were further eased by increasing interest rates and the requirement on banks to hold higher capital against some higher risk loans.  Measured by reference to 2006 GDP, the safety margins I have outlined above had a value of up to &euro;95 billion.  However, that safety margin and the measures taken in 2006 proved to be inadequate in the face of the crisis that reached seismic proportions in September 2008.  In this regard, I note a conclusion of the US Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission report of January 2011:<\/p><blockquote>...the ... inconsistent handling of major financial institutions [by the US Government] during the crisis - the decision to rescue Bear Stearns and then to place Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, followed by its decision not to save Lehman Brothers and then to save AIG - increased uncertainty and panic in the market.<\/blockquote> <p>We now know that Ireland did not have a sufficient safety margin in place to withstand the domestic and international pressures that emerged in September 2008.  In the event, our exposure to private sector debt and the direct and indirect impact of the property crash on the Exchequer were more than we could manage without outside assistance.  I very much regret that I did not see that as a likely outcome in June 2006 or earlier.  Thank you for your attention.  I am happy to assist the committee and to answer your questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061700002#C00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Considine","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434495600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Thank you very much for your opening comments, Mr. Considine.

And the two boards came together to decide on the content of the annual stability report.  So, I think when you look at the membership of the boards, I mean, including, say, you know, the Financial Regulator, there were people there with significant financial experience ... insurance, markets, banking, NTMA, and so on.  So ... I mean, given my experience of boards down through the years, I wouldn't say that that was an issue.  The issue was, really, how to evaluate the information that was coming.  And that information included assessments by the IMF and others and, say, in 2005, the last one I was there for ... I mean, the conclusions that were reached on that were based on the belief that a lot of the increases in Irish house prices could be explained by the rapid growth in population.  The large numbers of additional people who were on the labour force, in the previous ten years, it was something like 600 and ... if my memory tells me right, 650,000 or something like that.

Thank you for the opportunity to make these opening remarks to the committee.  May I say that my objective at all times during the banking crisis and today has been and is now to serve the public interest.  I will limit myself to comments on the guarantee, nationalisation, the ECB, Central Bank, regulator, while also dealing briefly with fiscal policy.<br\/><br\/>Fiscal policy in the decade up to 2008 should have been more conservative and the crisis was caused by a dramatic escalation in lending by the banks.  The banks created the banking crisis but the Financial Regulator and others might have done more.  The Department was concerned about the over-reliance on the property market as a component of economic growth and, of course, about pro-cyclical fiscal measures and Ireland's lost competitiveness.  However, the Department did not anticipate the severity of the property crash and the international financial crisis.  It accepted the consensus view of the Central Bank, the ESRI and others that the construction sector was facing a soft landing.  At that time, it was generally thought that there would be a significant reduction in levels over a number of years and not a sudden crash.  The Department was wrong to take, without challenge, the assessment of the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the banks' reassurance about the state of the financial sector.  Such a reliance on consensus forecasts and the assessment of the Central Bank, the regulator and the banks was a mistake and I regret it.  In the decade up to 2008, the demand from virtually all sides of the political and lobbying spectrum was for greater expenditure on more public services and for a reduction on taxation.  The typical response to increased levels of spending in many quarters was that it wasn't big enough. <br\/><br\/>Before dealing with fiscal and taxation policy matters in more detail, I'll just run over quickly the guarantee decision itself and the decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank.  You are all familiar with the fact that funds were flowing out of the country and that there was huge public concern about the safety of savings, which led to the introduction of the &euro;100,000 guarantee.  That assuaged the ordinary customers of banks but not the wholesale money market and larger depositors.  Intensive discussions took place between the day of that decision around the middle of September and the end of the month about what further measures might need to be adopted.  Matters came to a head on 29 September.  The Minister had detailed advice from Merrill Lynch with the input from the Central Bank, the regulator and the NTMA also.  Merrill's document, that was considered on the night of the guarantee, was that you could not ... they recommended you should not allow any Irish bank to fail because of the state of the market and the impact of that would be so damaging.  They went through a number of options, liquidity provision, taking Anglo and Nationwide into protective custody, consolidate some of the banks and introduce a guarantee.  Their conclusion was: <\/p><blockquote>Even if the situation stabilises the immediate outlook for monoline single asset ... lenders is increasingly uncertain.  In this context it is important for the Government to act quickly and decisively to step in and prevent a systemic problem.<\/blockquote>  <p>Turning to the guarantee night, on the night of the guarantee, the Financial Regulator was of the view that while Anglo was illiquid, it was profitable and solvent.  All of the banks were suffering from liquidity pressures but Anglo had no access to liquidity and was facing imminent collapse.  The question of emergency liquidity assistance was considered for Anglo that night and stand-by arrangements were put in place for it.  But there was a major concern that if word got out into the market that ELA had been put in place, that this would have leaked, inevitably it would have leaked, and lead to the sort of consequence that you had with Northern Rock which has, if you recall, the BBC running the story, ELA had been extended, massive queues outside their branches, including in Ireland, and a decision then to guarantee their deposits and ultimately nationalise it.  On the night, concern about the sustainability of Anglo and Nationwide models were heightened.  The two major banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, emphasised those concerns and argued that they should be addressed by nationalisation, which should also be accompanied by a guarantee for all banks.  The regulator continued to assure the Government on the night that all the banks were solvent.  Nationalisation of the organisations was considered on the night of the guarantee.  The case for nationalisation was that the business models were regarded by the major banks and indeed, by the Department and the NTMA as suspect.  <\/p>  <p>         There was a real concern that there could be a serious problem with their loan books, regardless of what the boards of management were saying.<br\/><br\/>An involuntary liquidation at that time of a bank would have created a real danger of a complete collapse in the banking system with all that would entail for the economy as a whole.  An orderly nationalisation, given the conditions at that point, would have taken over all the assets and liabilities, as occurred in January 2009.  The reservations that night about nationalisation centred around a number of key questions.  The first was whether nationalisation was warranted.  There were concerns about the business model but no quantified evidence had been produced which showed insolvency.  There was some theoretical stress testing but no bottom-up examination of the loan books had been carried out.<br\/><br\/>On a second question, whether nationalisation could be undertaken without having a domino effect, one view was that nationalisation might lead to the undermining of the other banks even with a full guarantee.  This is because it could give rise to the idea well if Anglo was that bad, the others could be equally exposed.  So in that case, the guarantee might not have been convincing from day one and might have failed.<br\/><br\/>On the third question, whether nationalisation would avoid the need for a guarantee, the view was that, nationalisation or not, a guarantee would have to be given to save the banking system and in strong conditionality terms.  On a fourth question, whether the ECB would allow a bank failure, the view of the ECB as quoted to the meeting by the Governor on the night was that Mr. Trichet had advised him that no bank failure could be allowed, or words to that effect.  On this point, the domestic and international market turmoil at that stage was such that this view was shared by all concerned at ministerial, Central Bank and Department of Finance official level.  Nationalisation would not, of course, have been a bank failure as such, but it might have been regarded in the panicked market conditions as tantamount to a failure, and indicative of greater dangers.<br\/><br\/>Throughout the night of the guarantee the pros and cons of (a) nationalising Anglo and having a guarantee, or (b) having a guarantee, were debated several times and late into the night.  The two main contending viewpoints in the debate were: there was a strong case for immediate nationalisation; and the nationalisation at that point could lead to an undermining of the banks and the guarantee.  Whatever about those contending viewpoints, the simple fact was that if emergency measures were not taken that night to address the problems created by the banks, there was a very real danger of a collapse in the domestic banking industry, not just in Anglo but quickly in the rest of the banks, through a widespread loss of confidence.<br\/><br\/>The damage to individual depositors, large and small, both personal and business would have been extreme.  The potential reputational damage would have undermined consumer business confidence, domestic and international investment, existing and future.  A collapse in the banking industry would have led to Ireland's sovereign borrowing reputation and capacity being irretrievably damaged.  A collapse on this front, combined with impacts on revenue, would have resulted in Government services and investment across the board being summarily cut or suspended.  No one was prepared to countenance this.  The Taoiseach and the Minister left the room for a private political discussion late in the night to review the debate.  On their return, my recollection is that the Taoiseach said they had decided to recommend a guarantee to the Cabinet and that Anglo would not be nationalised for the present.  The Minister did not in decree, indicate any disagreement on this approach.<br\/><br\/>Turning to nationalisation of Anglo in January of 2009, very quickly after the guarantee, there were a series of meetings with Anglo which didn&rsquo;t generate a lot of confidence given their business model, one aspect of which was they paid more for deposits and charged more for loans.  They very assertively stressed their profitability, their liquidity and their positive future but it was received with some scepticism.  A report by PwC after the guarantee pointed to end September transactions with another bank and this raised serious questions.  That matter was referred immediately to the Financial Regulator.  Subsequently, further corporate governance issues regarding directors' loans and the nature of certain other loans also raised serious concerns.<br\/><br\/>It also became clear over the following months that new or existing shareholders were not going to emerge and a &quot;white knight&quot; who some people were expecting to emerge, wasn&rsquo;t going to emerge either.  The banks, the domestic banks had enough of their own problems to address without getting involved in Anglo.  All of that undermined confidence, despite the appointment in December of 2008 of a new chairman and public interest directors.  The loss of confidence culminated in early 2009 and led the Government to decide the close control of the bank had to be taken to ensure confidence in the banking system for the same reasons I referred to earlier, that a bank closure had to be avoided. That decision was taken after consultation with both the Central Bank and the regulator.<br\/><br\/>Turning briefly to the ECB.  The ECB is an independent body and it pursues its treaty-mandated primary role which is the maintenance of price stability through interest rate policy, and that policy takes account of the average conditions across the eurozone, not in individual countries.  Credit growth in Ireland to households and non-financial businesses in the ten years 1998-2008 increased by an average of nearly 20% each year.  Interest rate policy over much of the early 2000 period operated to boost borrowing and lending in the Irish context.  Those low rates encourage inappropriate lending by the banks.<br\/><br\/>The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that the European system of central banks, which consists of the ECB and the national central banks of all member states, &quot;shall contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system&quot;.  The ECB, as you know, is completely independent of Governments and so is the governor.  It&rsquo;s a matter for the Central Bank to say whether the ECB ever advised the Irish Central Bank and any others experiencing excessive growth rates that specific measures needed to be taken to curb this.  My view is that they should have.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the Central Bank.  When the Central Bank was being amended following the Government decision in 2001 on financial regulation, there was express powers included in the legislation to give authority to the Governor and the board to issue guidelines to the regulator.  I might just read that out:<\/p><blockquote>'Either [the Government] the Governor or the Board may, with respect to the functions of the Governor or the Board, issue to the Regulatory Authority guidelines as to the policies and principles that the Authority is required to implement in performing functions, or exercising powers of the Bank ... The Regulatory Authority is required to comply with guidelines issued to it under this section.<\/blockquote> <p>The financial stability analysis produced by the Central Bank in 2006 and 2007 suggested that while concerns were heightened about escalating house prices and associated banking exposures, this would not lead to any insolvency issues.  The Central Bank placed undue reliance on their reports of the banks and assessment of the regulator in arriving at this conclusion.  That was a mistake.  The regulatory regime also imposed ... the legislation also imposed obligations on the regulator in relation to financial stability.  It provided that if a matter relating to the financial stability of the State&rsquo;s financial system arises in the connection with the performance or exercises by the regulatory authority of its functions, that authority shall consult the Governor.  It goes on to say then if that arises, they may give a report to the Minister.  The Department has told me there was no ... they could find no record of such a report.  I do recall the financial sector having deep concerns about the credit union sector.  <\/p>  <p>         The combination of the express authority given to the Central Bank, together with the requirement on the Financial Regulator to put any financial stability issue to the Central Bank, and the fact that there was some common membership of the board did provide for an effective corporate governance structure if properly operated.  While somewhat cumbersome, it was an appropriate regime.  I'll just mention briefly an IMF report into the regulatory system in 2006 more or less gave it a clap on the back and said it was amongst best practice and that they had ... conclusion was that the results of stress tests undertaken through the Central Bank and the regulator and the major lending institutions confirm that the major domestic lending institutions have adequate capital buffers to cover a range of large but plausible hypothetical shocks.  The Financial Regulator operated a principles-based regulatory system, which obviously took at face value the assessment of the banks and did not exercise independent judgment on their exposures and the quality of their loan books.  This, too, was a mistake.<br\/><br\/>Turning to fiscal policy, in the decade up to 2008, Government programmes, combined with the pressures ensuing from social partnership, as well as the need to address both infrastructural deficits and demographic pressures on various sectors, drove expectations of public expenditure higher.  The outcome was that from 1998 to 2008, total Government current and capital spending, excluding the Central Fund, increased from &euro;20 billion to about &euro;60 billion.  Total current spending increased from &euro;18 billion in 1997 to &euro;53 billion by 2008, an average increase of 11%.  That was clearly an excessive increase.  The Department did recommend a much tighter control of current spending.  Total capital spending increased from over &euro;2 billion in 1997 to &euro;9 billion in 2008, an average increase of 15%.  A good deal of this increase was supported by the Department, as it felt that major infrastructural deficits such as our core interurban transport corridors - motorways - had to be tackled before demographic pressures crowded out investment.  In general, prior to 2008, and as result of the pressures exerted by the social partners, individual Ministers and the Cabinet, the annual budget day packages ended up significantly higher than those recommended in the budget strategy memoranda put forward by the Ministers for Finance.  The fact that revenues were buoyant in that period added to expectations.<br\/><br\/>Taxation, just to touch briefly on that, Chairman, the reduction in the top tax rate from 48% in '98, to 41% by 2006 increased disposable incomes significantly and that added to the appetite for fixed assets.  The pressure from all sides were for less taxation over that period and, as I noted earlier, for more public services.  Tax incentive generally in relation to housing and the incentives for commercial development did contribute to pressures in the construction sector.  Other factors driving activity were reduced interest rates, the availability of loans and easier terms and the expectations that investing in property was always going to be a winning formula.  Loose and unco-ordinated planning development controls contributed to the problem.  On foot of recommendations from the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance progressively moved from 2005 onwards to reduce and terminate tax incentives associated with building and tax minimisation by high earners.<br\/><br\/>Uncontrolled lending: the accepted analysis after the establishment of the ECB and the transfer of monetary policy from Irish Central Bank was that the only tool available to Government to control economic activity in the economy was through taxes and spending.  The Department of Finance placed too much store on this conclusion.  Greater consideration should have been given to the impact of uncontrolled lending.  The Department should have adopted a more critical stance on monetary and regulatory matters in the decade ending in 2008.  As Secretary General between July 2006 and January 2010 I was an <i>ex officio<\/i>member of the board of the bank but not of the regulator.  I do not recall any proposals being advanced by the management teams of either the Central Bank or the regulatory side on foot of any identified imminent threat to financial stability or to the solvency of any particular institution. <br\/><br\/>As I said earlier, the analysis that was done was insufficiently critical of the realities behind the financial reporting of the banks.  Some of the factors involved in pushing growth in the economy over the decade ending in 2008 include increased wages and changes in Government spending and taxation.  However, increased bank lending was by far the biggest factor.  The average annual increase in spending already touched on was about &euro;10 billion - sorry - &euro;4 billion a year, average of about 10% a year.  The tax package cost about &euro;1 billion a year, increased costs of wages and salaries in the economy, all adding fuel to what was going on, was about &euro;6.5 billion.  Unit labour costs in the economy increased by more than 55% in Ireland between 1997 and 2008, remained static in Germany and increased by 26% in the USA and 36% in the UK.  The average increase in lending to individuals and non-financial business was almost &euro;25 billion per annum or an annual average of more than 20%.  The total increased from &euro;40 billion in 1997 to over &euro;300 billion in 2008.  The reality is that it was this huge increase in lending that drove excesses in the property market.  A more moderate approach to spending and taxation would have been better.  Even with such moderation in spending and taxation, the uncontrolled explosion in credit by the banks would still have created much of the problem which crystallised in 2008.<br\/><br\/>I might conclude, Chairman, the guarantee decided in September 2008 was essential to avoid a complete collapse of the banking system and the economy.  Ultimately, Anglo Irish Bank had to be nationalised in January 2009 to stop it collapsing and triggering a wider banking failure.  The ECB set interest rates at a level that it judged appropriate to the whole of the euro area.  The question of ensuring that credit growth was appropriate to the particular conditions in each euro country was left to the domestic central banks.  Measures to control credit should have been taken.  The Central Bank placed undue reliance on the regulator's assessment of the financial reports of the banks - that was a mistake.  The regulator took the report of the banks at face value and did not subject their loan books to any meaningful scrutiny - that was a mistake.  The Department of Finance was wrong to rely on consensus forecasts for a soft landing.  It was also wrong to take at face value the assessment of both the Central Bank and the regulator of the state of the financial sector.  I regret this.  Fiscal policy in the period 1998 to 2008 was pro-cyclical.  The pressure for more spending and less taxation came from all sides.  The average increase in lending by the banks to individuals and non-financial business, in the period 1998 to 2008, was &euro;25 billion per annum.  That is what really caused the banking crisis.

And the read at the time was that if you got into a liquidation situation, certainly an involuntary liquidation, where a deficit ... whoever was driving the liquidation saying there aren't enough assets here to discharge the liabilities, an involuntary liquidation would have been seen as a disaster for the rest of the industry.  A voluntary liquidation, where the shareholders or the promoter of the liquidation was saying that all the assets will be realised and all the liabilities of that company would be discharged, that would be a totally different question of thing ... different question.

If you appoint an examiner to a bank, the first thing that happens is that a red card goes up around every money desk around Europe and the world, and no ... and funds are called and there's no fresh funds made available.  So you instantly trigger a financial crisis with that institution.  So an examinership wasn't judged, at that point, to be an appropriate approach.

But I've no problem giving it over to you: <\/p><blockquote>I believe it's important to include dated subordinated debt under the guarantee as the problems we are dealing with here were caused by the financial institutions having too great a mismatch between their assets and liability profiles to such an extent that they were funding long-term assets with too much reliance on short-term funding, be it commercial paper, interbank deposits and corporate deposits.  Surely the objective of the guarantee of this dated subordinated debt from our point of view is to give the covered institutions the ability to access at least two-year term funding to reduce their reliance on short-term funding, thereby avoiding the liquidity squeeze.  If any covered institution was to issue term debt with a maturity longer than two years, then the market would want to be compensated for that by an appropriate step up in the interest rate pricing.  The investors in dated subordinated debt, while receiving a reasonable return commensurate with the risk, are not equity-type investors and invest on the basis that they expect their original principal to be returned at maturity whereas equity investors take the risk of losing their equity, but also with the very real possibility of receiving a multiple of their equity investment through dividend income and capital appreciation, in theory.<\/blockquote>  <p>So that was the, that was the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>I saw on the documentation after the event.

It could have advised the ECB and the European Commission that it intended to liquidate these banks, protecting only insured depositors.  European officials would have been shocked, they might possibly have agreed to some risk-sharing arrangement to induce the Government to refrain from the bail-in and absent from such a risk-sharing agreement and notwithstanding the associated significant reputational damage, on balance, some bail-in should have been applied.

The reference to &euro;110 million nationalised bank is a separate issue.  That was hypothetical and if it had been nationalised, in fact, it wasn't going to be on the basis of the State writing cheques to make up for the borrowing of those nationalised banks, so it's ... I don't think the read ... I can see where he was coming from, but it was going to be, we were going to be underwriting ... the nationalisation would have meant that we would have been standing behind the borrowing of the banks, not actually, borrowing the money.

It's just to note that, it's not an agreed report.  It's their note of the meeting.  The statement there is still the same statement I made in my opening statement today, in my written response to you and my oral statement today.  I don't know what the workings between the European Central Bank and the Central Bank are because they're shrouded in secrecy and, you know, if you want to know - from an authoritative point of view - as to what ... how that worked, you'd have to get it straight from the Governor, who's a member of the ECB.  In relation to my ... my, just, external observation, when you had credit growing throughout the early part of the 2000s, at phenomenal growth rates, 30%-35%, I'm just staggered that no intervention was made.  Now the European Central Bank, its core function or its principal function, I think, is the word, is inflation; but it's also, as part of the ESCB with the central banks, charged with the task of contributing to financial stability.  Now, throughout the 2000s, you had a significant drop in interest rates, which reflected the economic conditions right across the eurozone, particularly some of the bigger countries where the growth rate was very low.  In our case, it was extremely high, so the interest rate regime applicable throughout the eurozone was not appropriate to Ireland, and my point ... my criticism is that, given that excessive growth rate and what that was doing to the economy, there should have been an intervention.  I don't know whether the ECB ever advised the Irish Central Bank that they should make an intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061700002#GGG01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1434495600,"counter":1172,"content":"<p>Thank you.

There was more and more concern in the international market about the real position of the banks.  They were regarded as having a lot of deadweight loans, which was dragging them down.  The Minister decided to bring in Dr. Bacon to look at the options.  The two principal options that were identified was, one, an insurance-based approach where you would write out an insurance policy, charge the banks an appropriate fee, let them work out the facility over the following ten years, say, and at the end of that period, if there was a deficit on the loan portfolio, it would be made good by the policy, for which they would have paid a significant premium.  And the understanding on that particular option was that if there was a deficit from that arrangement, there would be a levy on the bank in subsequent years.  However, the analysis that was done was concerned that that approach would still leave the market very uncertain about what, in reality, was going to emerge.  So, the recommendation was that the cleanest thing to do was to take the loans off the banks for a discount and take it off their balance sheets, remove the doubt about their underlying financial position.

Members may recall that the joint committee subjected the general scheme of the Bill to pre-legislative scrutiny and produced a report in January 2014.

The amendment will remove the requirement for a supporting statement from a medical practitioner.  We have listened carefully to the views of individual citizens, representative groups and public representatives as the Bill has progressed.  In moving to a self-declaration model we are ensuring the legislation is in line with international best practice and the approach advocated by the Council of Europe and others.  This change will have no impact on the treatment pathway for transgender people, which remains completely separate from the civil registration process.  The amendment provides for self-declaration by an individual aged 18 years or older who applies for a gender recognition certificate and removes the requirement for a supporting medical statement from a medical practitioner.  The requirement is also removed from the advocacy process.  I am confident that these amendments, with consequential technical amendments, will be welcomed by members as a major improvement.  <\/p><p> On the requirement for a medical statement for persons aged 16 or 17 years, section 12 deals with applications to the court for an exemption to allow such individuals to apply for a gender recognition certification.

The recommendations of the original committee were softened in the first draft of the Bill, but we have come a long way in the second draft.  The reason I have tabled amendments to remove medical practitioners from the picture entirely is the Government has removed the requirement for a medical certificate only in respect of a person aged 18 years or older and I am anxious to provide the same concession for somebody aged 16 or 17 years.   A recent study in the United Kingdom found that in only 4% of cases did individuals realise they belonged to a different gender after they had reached 18 years.  In 76% of cases individuals were aware of it before they had left primary school.  The absence of an age requirement in Argentina did not lead to dire social consequences.  The organisation BeLonG To which represents bisexual and transgender young people in Ireland has expressed grave concern about this provision.  Its transgender youth group, Individuality, has been offering support to young people and their families since 2007, but in recent years it has experienced a significant increase in the number of young people accessing the service, many of whom are under the age of 16 years.  While I recognise that the Government has come a great distance, I urge it to go the extra mile by removing the requirement for a medical certificate for people over the age of 16 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015061700002#C00200","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1434542400,"counter":1631,"content":"<p>Some of the people in the Visitors Gallery were here two years ago when we began to discuss this legislation with departmental officials and medical experts.  There was a hope at that stage that we would see sense as legislators.  We have progressed more quickly than I expected in adopting best practice and becoming a torch bearer for other countries.  However, while the Government's amendments are progressive, a number of issues remain to be addressed in the Bill.  It is appropriate that the amendments move us away from the medical model because this is not a medical phenomenon.  For many years people lived with what they felt was the wrong gender assignment, but with the issue now being seen from a human rights perspective in an increasing number of countries, we are hearing more positive stories across the globe about the treatment of transgender issues.  In western countries there is no longer the same stigma attached to people who announce that they are of a different gender to the one assigned to them by their parents, the medical profession or schools.  In the context of the recent referendum, it is a logical step for Ireland to enter the modern world by recognising such individuals.  I agree with Deputy Willie O'Dea that if it is good enough for adults aged 18 years, it should be good enough for those aged 16.  Society determines that 16 year olds are adults in certain ways, even though the courts treat the age of adulthood as being 18 years.  A 16 year old should be allowed to make the same decisions an 18 year old can make under the Bill.  While it is difficult to keep track of the amendments because they are spread across three lists, for the most part I am happy with the Government's amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015061700002#C00300","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1434542400,"counter":1632,"content":"<p>I welcome the progress we have made on the Bill.

It is ironic that 16 and 17 year olds are not able to make these decisions, given that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has just launched a strategy to give children and young people a voice in decisions that affect their lives.  That is a welcome strategy, but why are we not listening to children in this debate?

The information obtained is quite sensitive and we have discussed the need for confidentiality.  Recently, we saw a case of cyberbullying involving a group of people threatening a young fellow with disclosure.  We have also heard of other cases and we probably know people who ended up very stressed or who took their own lives because their personal details or lifestyle were exposed through social media or newspapers.  It is additional stress for them.  I am trying to make the disclosure of information obtained about a person who has managed to obtain recognition of his or her gender an offence.  It is quite an intrusive process at the end of the day and someone should not end up being abused because of the information.  This information is very technical and this is the way it should be.  It is between the person and the registration body and that is where it should stay.  Nobody is entitled to get my birth certificate as far as I know.  I must apply for it myself.  Nobody should be entitled to disclose information.<\/p> <p>  Other legislation probably covers this, but it is appropriate to outline somewhere in the Bill that this is an offence.  The gender indicator on a form or passport is the business of the person involved, and nobody else is entitled to go into the background and disclose what one has put in any previous documentation and use it for a wrong purpose.  The Official Secrets Act covers many of the people I have mentioned, but I am not sure whether that Act fully covers everything in the Bill.  If it does, then perhaps rather than this amendment, all that is needed is a reference somewhere stating the Bill is compliant with the Official Secrets Act or that it falls under its guidelines.  If the amendment goes too far, perhaps the Minister can look at something else on Report Stage.  In this day and age, when information can be obtained with the press of a button, we have seen too often how quickly material goes around and how people have lost information.

My hope is that the Minster would allow a little more than two years in which to carry out a proper review of the legislation.<\/p><p>The Minister of State mentioned that he hoped to have all this up and running by the summer, the end of the summer or, perhaps, the end of the year.  Sometimes that does not happen.  It can sometimes be months or years after enactment.  We should give ourselves a little breathing space to ensure the review will be carried out in the fullest sense and that it will not be a short one just to tick a box with the sole purpose of being able to say a review was carried out after two years and that certain issues arose.  I would be happy if the Minister made a commitment to ensuring the measures we have identified in respect of international best practice, towards which we are moving in part, are in compliance with the human rights standards abroad.  In some ways, they are.  Is the Minister happy that the two-year period is not too onerous to capture what I propose?<\/p><p>We have talked about an annual report.  That report should capture the issues and not just be a one-off review after two years.  It should not be a matter of simply identifying three issues and saying everything is hunky-dory.  The report should be able to identify all the relevant issues.  I have seen reports concerning other legislation that were very black and white.  For example, they might state a certain section was applied ten times and another five times.  However, such reports do not necessarily identify the problems, difficulties or areas of concern.  My references to two years and five years are to address this.  If the Minister of State is happy with the period of two years, I still want the annual report to highlight concerns.  This legislation has not gone far enough because we will come across practical issues and problems.  When they arise, the Department and Deputies at the time will need to be in a position to address them quite quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015061700002#G00400","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1434542400,"counter":1684,"content":"<p>The section concerning the review of the operation of the legislation is very important.

We have had discussions on the need for reviews.  The charities legislation was passed circa 2005.  My problem is that parts of it were commenced only last year.  This meant it was very difficult to review legislation that was not in operation.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State is committed to ensuring that this Bill, when passed, will become operational.  This is all I am trying to capture.  I hope that, in the two-year period, as many of the legislation's problems as possible will have been identified.  Thus, after the first review, we will be able to produce amending legislation to address the problems.  I realise how slowly the courts and other institutions work and therefore believe that, at the end of the two-year period, we will not have fully identified all the relevant issues.  However, the Minister's existing wording does not prevent us from having our own review.  I have outlined what my amendment is intended to capture.<\/p> <p>  I will examine this again.  Deputy Ryan proposed that the committee be central to the process.  Perhaps it should be.  Deputy Humphreys is the Minister of State at present but one could end up with the Minister who wants everything for himself in respect of the review.

We have proved ourselves at this committee.  Everybody here and all those who have made a presentation to us have proven that the committee system works for legislation.

So far we have not been able to persuade him to change the age from 18 to 16.  As a result, the people in question would not need parental consent and it would not be as onerous.  It would be a recognition of the change in society and, in some ways, its maturity.  Even the Minister is looking at reducing the age to vote, but can we ask people to vote at age 16 or 17 if we do not recognise who they are?  That is a very big statement to make and something about which we have had a big debate over the past two years. <\/p><p>There was a bit of lobbying, not just from those with a vested interest but from young people's organisations, who told me that 18 was too high a threshold for quite a number of rights to kick in.  They asked that we advocate that it be reduced to 16, given the maturity that many young people have expressed.  Many people who are over 18 are immature, but the key part is that, at the age of 16, the vast majority of people who might benefit from this have already gone through life being recognised in a gender that is not their own.  As things stand we are compounding that for an additional two years.  Many of them will have struggled against what their bodies are telling them and it is only in their teenage years that they start to understand fully and become able to express to the adults around them that they are not of the gender that was prescribed to them.  At the age of 16, most will have become aware, and if we allow them to do many other things at the age of 18 and grant them a whole range of rights and entitlements at 16, another one should be to decide on these issues.  It is an onerous decision for a person to make - that this is not who they are but that they are of a different gender.  They do not wish to hide it any longer and they want formal recognition by society that the gender on their birth certificate is wrong.  <\/p><p>I know Deputies have strongly held opinions.  I have received lobbying on this legislation from both sides, in Irish and English, and there are very strong views, but the vast majority of people who have contacted me have gone through the trauma of living their teenage years in a gender that is not their own.

We have been given examples of this.  I ask the Minister to bear this in mind in his discussions with the various groups over the next couple of weeks.  It would not damage the Bill to bring the age down to 16.

A serious body of work needs to be done on that.  Deputy O'Dea has had the experience of being in government, so he knows it would take a considerable amount of time to re-examine this matter.  It would probably knock it back to the autumn if we were to examine the age issue as the Deputy has sought.  I will have ongoing discussions and considerations concerning the different groups.

We have a number of months left in this D&aacute;il term, but that is not to say that the next Minister will not be as proactive as the current one.  It is our duty to ensure that whatever legislation comes before us to be passed is as robust as possible.  We had a discussion concerning 16 and 18 year olds two years ago.  In 2014, the Equality Authority said that we needed to revisit that area.  The authority was glad that we had moved from one of the earlier positions to where we are now.  The fact that the Bill is here now is progress.<\/p> <p>  I still think we should examine this further, however.  At the end of the day, it is not just about this Bill; it is about rights for young people.  In this case, we have not granted them the full right to be of their preferred gender under the laws of the State.  It must be onerous for somebody to be denied that gender by the State.  We need more discussion on how to fully address those who are under 16.  I do not have a problem with the cut-off of 16 because it is quite onerous asking them to get parental consent and jump through the hoops we have put in this Bill.<\/p> <p>  At this stage, society needs to increase the responsibilities on young people and make them suffer the consequences if they break those responsibilities.  At the same time, we must recognise that they are not necessarily as mature as we would like.  However, there are 25-year-olds and older people who are not as mature as we would like either.  Therefore, we should not always put an old head on every 16 year old.  The same might apply in this case.<\/p> <p>  Society is moving towards increasingly recognising the rights and responsibilities of young people.  In many ways we are out of sync regarding the rights and responsibilities we give to 16-year-olds compared to other countries.

There is no provision in the amendment, for example, in regard to whether the interim certificate should be used after the age of 18.  The amendment is a recipe for confusion in many ways.

Sometimes it may take many years before a person discovers that he or she has a complicated DNA system.  In recent years I have read more and more about cases where a man, in one case, discovered he had full operational female genitals.  He had a womb and it was conceivable that he could give birth, if he was lucky enough.  He had lived as a man for many years.  The anomaly was spotted during a medical procedure.<\/p><p>I recall the presentations on the Bill and the observations in the first instance in the case of some very young people, not many, where there are incidents in which it is more complicated for the medical profession to make a determination.  This small amendment would allow us to capture those who do not have a male or female gender.  The Minister may be correct in saying that in some ways we do not know enough.  If we do not know enough, the easiest thing in the world would be not to allow that gap.  It was one of the points that had been highlighted that most of the Bill deals specifically with transgender, those who have transitioned to their preferred gender, but in the case of intersex sometimes there is a complication that it is not necessarily the preferred gender, it is trying to be specific in terms or either of the genders that is being prescribed here.  It is a minor technicality.  I will not delay the House on it.  If the Minister of State cannot take it on board, I hope he would reflect on it and see whether there is another mechanism which would allow us, with all the legal implications this would have, to have that extra box ticked on the certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015061700002#O00300","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1434542400,"counter":1778,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  If it is the same case which I read about, when that gentleman discovered his situation he said he had no intention to trans because he saw himself as a man and as a male.  I read the case with interest and how this whole area can become very complicated in the future.  The purpose of this Bill is to address the need for provide a legal recognition for the position of transgender people and to cater also for intersex people who may wish to avail of the arrangement provided.  The Bill is based on the principle set out in section 18.  It will not provide for a third character alongside side male and female.  I am aware that a small number of countries have made some changes to allow for the registration of a person of indeterminate gender.  This is a very complicated area and any changes proposed in the amendment would need to be examined carefully and could have severe unintentional consequences that would also have to be considered throughout legislation.  Just for one instance a third option, which is neither male nor female, could potentially accept the concept of guardianship children and several pieces of legislation would have to be considered carefully and examined.  It would be unwise to accept what Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said is a minor amendment, which could be quite radical when considered in terms of the legislation on the Statute Book.

It challenged the pigeon holes we create as a society.  In this amendment I am seeking, at the very least, a recognition that there are those in society who are intersex.  In the case of the article which the Minister of State also read, the first step by the person in question, on medical advice, was to remove those organs because they might cause problems in later years.  This individual was in his late thirties.  He is not the only person in that position.  It is a particular problem in some cases at a very young age.  Sometimes the medical profession intervenes and sometimes it does not.

I commend the Department on its initial response.  The Department, its emergency consular response team and our consul general, Mr. Philip Grant, and his team in San Francisco were all off the mark quickly in respect of this matter, as was the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  This has been a very difficult time for those in Berkeley.  Approximately 8,000 J1 visas are issued every year and approximately 35% of those who obtain them travel to Berkeley.

The families of those who were killed are grieving in exceptionally difficult circumstances and I am glad that the State's services have been placed at their disposal.

The young man, who was highly talented, had his whole life ahead of them.<\/p> <p>  Young people have had their lives cut short so tragically and suddenly.  The dead could have been any of the 7,000 young people with J1 visas this year.  It is at times like this that we appreciate the work officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our consular representatives do.  They are to be applauded and complimented on the swift action they took to help people and their ability to bring the community on the ground in Berkeley with them.  It appears an enormous amount of help, assistance, counselling and support are available for the young people, who are obviously highly traumatised by what has happened.

We are pleased to accept the joint committee's invitation to meet on the progress in the negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda and on any aspects of the Irish Aid programme and policy they may wish to raise with us.  This year has the potential to rank as one of the most critical in global development in generations.  Three major interlinked processes are due to conclude in 2015 with the International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa from 13 to 16 July, the post-2015 sustainable development summit in New York from 25 to 27 September and the climate change conference of the parties in Paris in December, which should agree a legally binding and universal climate agreement.<\/p><p>With success in the negotiations and strong political will to implement the agreements reached, this can mark the start of a clear transformation of our concept of global citizenship and responsibility.  This will involve a move from a north-south, donor-recipient model of development and poverty reduction towards a new multi-layered concept of sustainable development based on universal goals, to replace the MDGs, millennium development goals, and a shared responsibility for the planet, its people and its natural resources.<\/p><p> Ireland has been playing a leading international role in the work to design and negotiate a framework to replace the MDGs adopted in 2000.  This role arises from the effectiveness of our aid programme and our record as a member of the United Nations.  Ireland led the EU&rsquo;s consideration of the shape of the new agenda during our Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013.  Ireland co-facilitated the international meeting on the MDGs at the UN in September 2013.  We were members of a team, along with Denmark and Norway, in the UN open working group which adopted draft sustainable development goals, SDGs, and targets last year.  Ireland was honoured to be appointed, with Kenya, to co-lead the intergovernmental negotiating process at the UN, with the aim of reaching agreement in July for adoption at the September summit.  This has involved a major commitment by our ambassador in New York and his team at the UN, colleagues in Dublin and Limerick, and our mission network worldwide.<\/p><p> Throughout the process of the past two years, Ireland&rsquo;s key priority for the new goals has been to ensure the goals build on progress made over the past 15 years in fighting poverty in all its manifestations under the MDGs.  We have focused in particular on the need to galvanise action to end extreme poverty, hunger and under-nutrition by 2030; ensuring a single strong goal on gender equality and the empowerment of women; and the critical role of good governance and the rule of law in building sustainable, prosperous and equitable societies.  We have emphasised the need to incorporate human rights in the new framework, reduce inequality and protect the role of civil society.  We believe these priorities will be well reflected in the outcome.<\/p><p> The new SDGs will build on and differ from the MDGs in three fundamental ways.  First, the SDG agenda is broader and addresses a wider range of issues.  Its aim will be the ending of poverty through sustainable development while addressing social, economic and environmental challenges.  The scope of the framework will recognise the interlinkages between issues such as climate change, poverty eradication, peace and security and inequalities.  Second, the goals have been drafted and negotiated in a radically more inclusive way than the MDGs.  They may, therefore, initially seem more unwieldy, but they are comprehensive and address the complexities of development as it is experienced by people and communities, especially by those in the poorest countries.  This insight was a priority outcome of Ireland&rsquo;s Hunger, Nutrition and Climate Justice conference, held during our Presidency in April 2013.  The MDGs were drafted by a group of experts working with the former UN Secretary General.  The SDGs will be the product of a global consultation, involving millions of people across the world, civil society organisations and intergovernmental negotiations.  Third, the post-2015 agenda will be a universal one.  All countries will have a role in implementing commitments domestically and internationally, with strong mechanisms at national level to monitor progress and report back.<\/p><p> This issue of monitoring and review remains a difficult and contentious one in the negotiations.  The process will be voluntary, but review will be needed at national, regional and global levels.  A strong monitoring and review process is a priority for the EU.  We have emphasised the need for government progress reports to be complemented by contributions from civil society, academia, local government, the UN system and the private sector.  We need to examine also the crucial role that parliaments should play in review processes.  These issues are still under strong discussion in the process in New York and Addis Ababa.<\/p><p> Agreement on the financing of the SDGs will be critical to the success of the agenda.  The forthcoming conference in Addis Ababa will aim to reach agreement on financing, extending significantly beyond official development assistance, ODA.  It will cover the financing of infrastructure and climate policies, domestic resource mobilisation, including taxation and tackling illicit financial flows, the role of the private sector and the need to boost world trade in a fair and equitable manner.  Ireland has been working to ensure coherence between the Addis Ababa and New York processes.<\/p><p> ODA will be a vital element, especially for the least developed countries.  It will, however, be only part of the picture.  To illustrate, total ODA last year amounted to some $135 billion, but UNCTAD, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, has estimated that global investment requirements for the achievement of the SDGs are of the order of $5 trillion to $7 trillion.  The needs of developing countries alone will be between $3.5 trillion and $4.5 trillion annually, mainly for basic infrastructure, food security, climate change, health and education.  The challenge in Addis Ababa is to see how the international community can mobilise resources from the billions to the trillions of dollars.  If there are some 30 donor countries, including Ireland, and just over 30 low-income countries still dependent on aid, there are some 130 emerging middle-income economies that have achieved higher levels of average prosperity.  The central issue in Addis Ababa must be how to unlock finance from different sources, including, but not exclusively, aid to finance sustainable development.<\/p><p> ODA will remain essential for the poorest countries under the new framework, including many African countries and fragile states where Ireland focuses its assistance.  The Government, therefore, remains committed to the aid target of 0.7% of gross national income and to making further progress towards it as Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery consolidates.  It is significant that the meeting of EU development Ministers in Brussels on 26 May was able to reach agreement on a recommitment to reaching the 0.7% target within the timeframe of the post-2015 agenda, as well as directing more assistance to least developed countries, especially the poorest countries in Africa where progress has been slowest on the MDGs.  Ireland played a crucial role in brokering agreement at the Council.  It is important to note that Ireland is also a world leader in the proportion of our assistance that we provide to the least developed countries and is committed to maintaining this approach.<\/p><p> Our priorities will be well represented in the 17 goals and 69 targets which seem likely to be agreed, with some minor technical adjustments, in September.  Implementation will be voluntary but the scale of the ambition and of the summit in New York will aim to generate strong political will to do so.  The Government&rsquo;s development programme, Irish Aid, will continue to focus on the priority areas identified in its policy for sustainable development, One World, One Future, which sets out a whole-of-government approach to development policy.<\/p><p> Many countries, including several of our EU partners, are examining new institutional frameworks at the national level to translate the universal goals and targets into national actions, commitments, responsibilities and accountability which will respect national priorities and circumstances.  These would range beyond the traditional development ministry approach in their focus on domestic implementation.  Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in the process has been guided by strong interdepartmental co-ordination, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We are now giving consideration to the nature of the institutional framework for national implementation of the SDGs.  Through our aid programme, we are committed to providing comprehensive support to governments, parliaments and civil society in our key partner countries to facilitate their implementation of the new development agenda.  We will retain our focus on the least developed countries and communities in Africa on the basis of the realistic objective of ending extreme poverty and hunger in the world by 2030.<\/p><p> This year, we face a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fashion and implement a truly transformative agenda with the shared commitment to leave no one behind and ensure no goal will be decried as met until it is met for all.  The summit in New York, along with the critical meetings in Addis Ababa in July and Paris in September, are interlinked and co-dependent.  They can mark a real shift in the way we interpret our world and our role in it.  They must also challenge us all - government, civil society and citizens - to examine and redefine how we live and do business.<\/p><p> My colleagues and I look forward to hearing the views of the committee and to answering any questions from members on the development agenda and programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015061700002#C01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Gaffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434531600,"counter":1859,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gaffey for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015061700002#D00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1434531600,"counter":1860,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gaffey for his presentation and welcome his colleagues to the committee.

The resolution of the UN General Assembly which established the conference indicated that representation at Addis Ababa would be at the highest political level, including Heads of State and Government, along with foreign affairs and finance Ministers.<\/p><p>I understand from the previous presentation that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Sean Sherlock, will attend the Addis Ababa conference, but will any of his Government colleagues be attending?  Mr. Gaffey referred to the European recommitment to reaching the aid target of 0.7% of gross national income.  That is welcome, but will Ireland outlining a roadmap at the Addis Ababa conference on how it intends to achieve that target?  Emphasis has been placed on the need to leverage private investment to complement public financing.  Is that what Mr. Gaffey means when he refers to unlocking finance from other sources?  Is this from State sources or from other countries whose contribution to ODA has been very poor, or is it to be from a combination of State and private sources?  <\/p><p> Policy coherence in development was one of the few areas highlighted as needing improvement in Ireland's 2014 OECD peer review.  We touched on this when discussing the departmental Estimates at an earlier meeting.  How much has Irish Aid engaged with the Department on issues of shared concern such as taxation, financial flows and debt, which affect human rights and development goals?  How much discussion has taken place between both Departments on these very important issues?  Mr. Gaffey also referred to the One World, One Future strategy which was published in May 2013.  This committed to a biennial report on Ireland's progress on policy development which would be prepared specifically for this committee for consideration.

With the support of Government, Irish Aid has been particularly effective in ensuring the maximum possible was delivered in the most efficient and effective way to those for whom it was intended.  That is hugely important, given the climate of recession in which we have had to work, and it will remain important in the future.<\/p> <p>  Climate change will become a greater issue as time proceeds.  Two issues emerge from that.  One is the extent to which Irish Aid can explain to the people in the donor countries the implications of climate change, recognising that there will be some sceptics on the subject.  There is a need to ensure that climate change scepticism is addressed in a way that conveys the message without confrontation while alerting everybody to the need to ensure we plan our programmes with this in mind into the future.  Otherwise, it might be seen as a weapon to inhibit development in donor countries and it could be seen as a threat.<\/p> <p>  It is important that the Government and Irish Aid continue to support and encourage other donor countries to make the maximum effort at all times.  During the past number of years it was not always popular to adopt this stance in most donor countries, and it was not easy to explain that particular countries required aid to a far greater extent than anybody could explain without a visit to those countries to illustrate it.<\/p> <p>  Aid for trade is becoming increasingly important.  While everybody is endeavouring to ensure the maximum amount of aid goes to those for whom it is intended - in the case of Irish Aid, this is without any condition other than to meet the needs of those who require it - this is not the case in all countries, and there are an increasing number who are using the situation to ensure their aid is responded to with trade.  This is, in fact, becoming a precondition in some cases, particularly for some of the larger countries and economies.  This should be borne in mind and brought to the attention of those concerned, and it should be recognised that countries such as Ireland make direct contributions without any conditions other than to ensure the aid is spent in the most effective way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015061700002#E00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1434531600,"counter":1863,"content":"<p>It is always a pleasure to have Mr. Gaffey before the committee to make the case on behalf of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Irish Aid, because we play a very important role, which has been recognised internationally.  The respect among the international community for Ireland's ability to deliver effective aid is illustrated by the fact that David O'Donoghue and his Kenyan counterpart have been given key roles.  How do two people engage with the United Nations, which as far as I am aware comprises at least 162 countries?  One would imagine that two people would require a huge team of civil servants to be able to engage with so many different countries on formulating a framework.  Having said that, the goals are fantastic and nobody could suggest that we should not be dealing with poverty education, food nutrition, health education, gender equality and women's empowerment, which are all spectacularly important.<\/p> <p>  It is one thing to create the new bible or some other book under which the world should act, but it is something else to extract from these countries a commitment to sustainable development, something which will be a crucial part of the programme of the Addis Ababa conference.  For example, how does Irish Aid engage with so many countries that are clearly politically corrupt and where corruption is rife?  I just learned that the economy of Brazil, which we used to aspire to mimic, is now in decline and that part of the reason for its decline is that the political system is endemically corrupt.  One must also question the major world power, China.  How would our team engage with China on the very important developmental goals?  They have a fundamental difference of opinion on how to hand out aid, particularly in Africa.  <\/p> <p>  Then there is the thorny subject of our recipient countries.  Uganda tried to steal money from the Irish Aid programme and other programmes, and I am tragically disturbed to read that Moldova, which has just come out of a general election, is now in the throes of imploding again because of &euro;5 billion that has gone missing.

There is general satisfaction that they are much stronger than what went before.  The goals and targets are there and, hopefully, the indicators will be there before we wrap up in September.  Addis Ababa is crucial in delivering what is necessary in terms of money, and the fact that what will be required is perhaps five times what the international community is currently delivering in aid means it will be a big ask, and it is important that we have a strong team there.  It will not necessarily just happen in Addis Ababa.

I am afraid there is little evidence of a global sense of citizenship there.  While money is important, I wonder about whether the will is there, and I sense that what is happening in Africa and other parts of the world is everyone's responsibility.  This cannot be left to the countries directly affected.  I am also thinking of Italy, which we have pretty much abandoned, and I am not surprised that they are about to abandon us as well.  It is not just about aid, although money is desperately important; it is about tax, investment, trade and governance.  I was quite despondent on my return from my trip to Turkey, having witnessed the scale of the problem, which will grow.  Our lack of success despite all the aid that has been given to Africa over the years is evidenced by the wave of migration, and there is no sign of that stopping as the population grows on the continent.<\/p> <p>  I am glad that gender equality is high on the Irish agenda.

I welcome the fact that there are three fundamental ways in which the sustainable development goals will build on what has been achieved, but perhaps I take a simplistic view that it will be difficult to make much progress unless the issues of peace, security and political stability are addressed in some of the poorer countries we are discussing.

I have witnessed the effectiveness of the delivery of aid, especially in Africa, but it is one thing to contribute money and another to effect change, because I have also seen ineffective programmes.  Perhaps the programme is more effective now than it was, but during the Cold War awful stuff happened, with Irish aid being politicised.  I compliment everybody involved in ensuring the maintenance of the level of aid Ireland contributes during the recession, because pressure did come from political and other groups regarding the level of ODA.

An important point to make here is that Irish Aid is the Irish people's development programme.  If it does not connect properly with the Irish people, as well as with the people with whom we work in poor countries in Africa, it will not succeed.  We feel a great sense of responsibility to work with the committee, civil society and the Irish people on ensuring that we can explain the programme, that it is responding to the right needs and that we are explaining those properly.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday we had a big event in Dublin Castle, the Our World Irish Aid Awards, where primary schools won prizes for their projects in explaining sustainable development.  Some of those primary school children did a really good job, which was better than some of us have been able to do, of explaining the importance of sustainable development and the sense of global citizenship and interdependence in the world today.  This is exactly the point Deputy Bernard Durkan was making that our attitude to climate change in our own lives is directly linked to the effects of climate change on some of the poorest people in Africa.  That was very positive and hopeful from the point of view of Ireland and the engagement by young Irish people with this agenda.<\/p> <p>  Let me go through the questions raised, and if I miss any please remind me.  I will try to cover them all.  Deputy Brendan Smith referred to the level of our representation at the Addis Ababa conference.   The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Sean Sherlock, will be on the delegation.  The final composition of the delegation is still being discussed.  While the UN mentioned the attendance of finance Ministers, it is not a pledging conference.  I do not think there will be many finance Ministers from the European Union present.  The design, work and negotiation are taking place now.  I will be able to inform the committee of the exact level of representation at the political level as soon as that is decided, but definitely the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and all of his development ministers across the EU will be present.<\/p> <p>  The Foreign Affairs Council of development Ministers which met on 26 May reached agreement on reconfirming the ODA target of 0.7% of gross national income within the timeframe of the post-2015 agenda.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, had to do quite an amount of work to help get that agreement.  To be honest, the environment in the European Union has changed a little bit in that different member states have different priorities.  The focus we have on ODA and its important role in Africa and in the least developed countries in Africa is not necessarily shared by all member states, because some of them have other priorities.  Some of the newer member states have their own concerns about the level of development in their region and also the fragility and conflict in their regions.  It is a different debate within the European Union from what it was in 2004 and 2005, as the shape of the European Union is different.  It is significant that we have that commitment to 0.7% of gross national income.  The question of how Ireland makes progress towards that target, having stabilised the programme in recent years, will be a major issue for the October budget, because that is the context in which decisions on our aid budget are taken. <\/p> <p>  I have emphasised the importance of ODA and its importance in the work Irish Aid is doing and in the context of the work we are doing with the poorest countries in Africa, but the broad agenda requires the generation of a much greater amount of funding.  The private sector is important and has a role.  It is clear from the agenda that the really critical element will be domestic resource mobilisation and taxation.  The changes and the work that is necessary can only be achieved through proper taxation policies.  Here the linkages become clear in the SDGs.  Taxes cannot be raised effectively without the consent of the people, good governance, democracy and peace and security.  While the SDG agenda is challenging in the sense of being so broad, it is bringing the whole context together.  It would not really work by stating that one must raise more taxes without looking at governance issues, because it would not be achievable.  However, it raises challenges in the negotiations because it is difficult for some of the countries and some of the governments involved to address these issues as openly as others.  It has been challenging to negotiate some of these goals.  It will be even more challenging to implement them, but at least if they are negotiated there is good governance and peace and security in the goals, and the next challenge is out to implement that.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, there was resistance to including some of those elements.  The question of taxation will be huge.  We have made much progress with some of our partners in developing countries on increasing the level of taxation they can raise for development, but much more work needs to be done.  The question of illicit flows is massive.  It was estimated that the amount of money lost in illicit flows out of Africa last year was of the order of $50 billion, yet total ODA provided for poverty reduction across the world was $135 billion.  That shows the scale of the challenge of illicit flows and corruption.  The attempt here is to start a process whereby we have a comprehensive development agenda which takes account of these challenges. <\/p> <p>  The summit takes places from 25 to 27 September.  We will not wake on 1 October in a new world, transformed to the agenda of sustainable development.  That will take time and strong political will.  It is a voluntary process.  The vital element will be the political will.  The summit in September will be incredibly important in starting the process.  Often it takes a generation to make these changes.  We have done much in the past decade under the MDGs.  More was achieved than predicted.  When the MDGs were first adopted there was not the same sense of ownership that they have now.  They came out of an experts' group with the Secretary General.  In the first year or two there was much criticism that they were not being translated into policies, and it took a few years for governments to realise that this was an agenda that they could work on and deliver on.  The progress made is significant, but still the gaps remain.  There are certain particular issues where progress has been slower than we would have wanted.  Large numbers of people have been lifted out of poverty, yet nearly 800 million people suffer from hunger.  That 300,000 women still die every year in childbirth is unacceptable.  Yet much progress has been made.       <\/p> <p>  One of the really important things about the sustainable development goals is that if we are to work with them we have to be much more coherent in our own policies.  That term, policy coherence for development, is an ugly one but a really important one.  What it really needs is a whole-of-government approach to our development policy.  <\/p> <p>  The OECD recognised that we need to make more progress.  In fact, it recognised that every donor needs to make more progress.  One of the most useful things we can do development-wise is to achieve coherence in development policy.  We have made progress.<\/p><p>The meeting we had with the review team, which involved representatives of a wide range of Departments, is one which they said they had not experienced before when they reviewed a donor country.  One of the Departments which has become much more engaged is the Department of Finance.  Again, the role of taxation is really important.  The Department of Finance has commissioned a spillover analysis of the effect of Ireland's taxation policies on developing countries.  We, in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, are on the steering committee on that and I hope that report will be completed and published in the near future.  <\/p><p> We are making progress on a whole of government approach but we have a long way to go.  The One World, One Future has been important in that regard and the commitment to give a report to Parliament through this committee stands.  We will prepare a report but the precise timing of which, to be honest, I cannot say.  The Minister answered a parliamentary question on this recently and I can come back to the committee with information on when we will have the report.<\/p><p> The whole process of developing positions for the intergovernmental negotiations on the SDGs has been really important in helping to build coherence across government.  We have led an interdepartmental committee on that which meets very regularly.  That committee has been developing Irish positions and has helped bring together the sense of coherence that we have worked on for several years<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015061700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Gaffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434531600,"counter":1872,"content":"<p>Is there any programme country where Mr. Gaffey believes the millennium development goals have made a big difference over its 15 years?

The first country that would come to mind is Ethiopia.  If one looks at the real progress that has been made in Ethiopia, and it is a bit of a cliche, but we always can draw attention to the situation in Tigray.  Irish Aid has been active for the past 20 years in Tigray and has worked closely with local communities and government.  Tigray was where the 1984 famine happened.  Its people were completely devastated and there was a vast number of deaths from hunger.  We, working with the Ethiopian Government, have been very active in helping rebuild life there in terms of education, essential services and in moving to the next phase of economic opportunity.  Huge progress has been made in Ethiopia.  The big challenge is that as one proceeds with progress, as Ethiopia has overall growth rates of between 9% and 11%, there is also the issue of population growth.  In many cases, the progress in basic numbers, made under the MDGs, is challenged by the ever rising population.<\/p> <p>  The other issue in Africa is that quite a number of countries have very high GNP growth rates that are sustained but the question of inequality remains, that is, income inequality and inequality between different sectors.  That is a huge agenda for the SDGs and inequality is at the heart of it.  We have recognised that inequalities have to be addressed rather than sheer basic numbers.  In case anyone thinks I have singled out Ethiopia, I would say that in virtually all of our key partner countries, if one looks back at the statistics and life on the ground over the past ten years, one can see that the MDG process helped to generate resources specifically directed at poverty reduction and the provision of essential services.  MDGs have made a very big difference to the lives of people and that situation is reflected in the statistics for Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia and Tanzania.<\/p> <p>  The challenge that we face more now in some of the big countries, where we have worked for 20, 30 and 40 years as Irish Aid, is not so much how we work to address the provision of essential services like health and education, but how we work with countries that now have high growth rates, that have businessmen and prosperity in the cities and where people drive Mercedes.  They have a lot of progress but they also have a lot of extreme poverty.  All of that brings to the fore the question of inequalities and how we work with countries to ensure that this term that will be used - we are determined it will be used and will appear in the outcome document for the SDGs in September - is that no one is left behind.  We must ensure that we do not measure development on the basis of just overall statistics and that they are disaggregated.  <\/p> <p>  There is a data challenge because we do not have good statistics in Africa.  We have better statistics than we had but there is still a data challenge and it is one that was recognised by the high level panel last year.  The data challenge is one issue on which we want to work on with a number of partners.  When the President Higgins visited Ethiopia last November, we had some very good discussions with the UN Economic Commission for Africa on the challenge of getting good statistics in Africa.  I will now quickly run through some of the other issues raised.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan mentioned the challenge of explaining climate change at home and in the developed world.  We agree it is a challenge for us all.  The SDG agenda is trying to incorporate the effect of climate change across the world and the co-responsibility that we all share.  We, through our programme, can see very clearly the effect of climate change on the poorest countries in Africa and in the poorest communities.  That aspect was brought to Ireland in our conference in April 2013.  Irish Aid provides between &euro;33 million and &euro;35 million annually specifically for climate change actions, working with communities in Africa.  I agree that there is still a job to do in explaining this and the linkages to our own practices at home.  I understand that the Pope will join in the effort to explain climate change in the next day or two, which will be an important intervention in the debate.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan also mentioned the Irish role and how we explain it to other donors.  It has been recognised clearly in the EU, and the OECD, the role that Ireland has played in how the Government handled the protection of the aid programme and how it kept the aid programme alive while under a serious economic challenge at home.  In the initial years of the crisis we still were lectured a little bit by others on what we should be doing until they looked across the board at how Ireland's performance contrasted with some others.  Ireland is held out as an example to those developed countries that face their own challenges and economic crises on how to make the aid or development programme still relevant and how to maintain same.  I concede that the challenge now is not so much the protection but it is how we strengthen the aid programme as our economy strengthens.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Byrne asked how two co-facilitators engage at the UN which has 193 members that all want to have their say and negotiate.  I understand the committee will have an opportunity to discuss this point with Ambassador Donoghue when he appears before the committee in advance of attending the conference in Addis Ababa.  The co-facilitation, or co-chairing, role is a really important diplomatic role.  Crucially, it gives the co-facilitators what is called an opportunity \"to hold the pen\".   They are able to drive the drafting, not so much of the goals which were agreed by the Open Working Group, but of the declarations and the way they are presented.  That is crucial work that is under way at the moment and that is the crucial role that co-facilitators will play.  It is important that the co-facilitators be allowed to maintain that role because if one starts trying to negotiate the actual declaration, which is to give political will and explain what we are doing here to 193 people, no matter how brilliant and diplomatically experienced they might be, one will not get a very coherent text.  Ambassador Donoghue will look forward to explaining the details of that role to the committee.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Byrne also mentioned the issue of corruption.  The issue is absolutely critical.  A public opinion survey on attitudes to development was carried out in Ireland in recent years which showed that Irish people are very supportive of the provision of development assistance and understand our role as co-global citizens with the poor in Africa.  The one question that Irish people always ask is how can one be sure that aid will be delivered due to corruption.  Therefore, corruption is the challenge and we saw it with what happened in Uganda.<\/p> <p>  The framework of the SDGs is designed to be able to deal with corruption, to build societies where corruption becomes intolerable, to strengthen the role of parliaments and to strengthen the role of oversight institutions and audit, which we are clearly doing.  The Uganda fraud came to the fore because the Auditor General of Uganda discovered it and he had received a lot of his support from Ireland.<\/p><p>It is a big problem and it is really important therefore that the goals address issues of governance, accountability and the role of parliaments.  The role of parliaments is absolutely critical in the fight against corruption.  The role the Oireachtas and parliaments in other developing countries in co-operation with parliaments in Africa is absolutely critical because we will not be able to bridge the gap of what funding is needed for sustainable development if governments are not able to raise taxes from their people which will go towards development.  Overseas development aid, ODA, will never do that but it can help.<\/p><p> Deputy Mitchell drew attention to a really important issue, namely, that we have a document which is full of good words and good intentions, including goals, peace and security and governments but let us look at the real world.  The Deputy has just come from the Turkish border.  That is always the challenge; that one negotiates one's framework and then one has to implement it.  Senator Mullins mentioned that if one does not have peace and security, one will undermine all of the gains one makes.  Not one of the countries that we call fragile states, countries in conflict, has achieved the millennium development goals, and they will not achieve sustainable development goals.  Let us look at the situation in Syria.  There has been a failure of analysis in the international community.  Ten years ago, we would have all classified Syria as an authoritarian but stable state in an unstable region.  Since the start of the crisis in Syria four years ago to the end of this year, Ireland will have provided approximately &euro;41 million in humanitarian emergency assistance, including to the work GOAL is doing on the Turkish border.<\/p><p> One of our statistics from last year showed that approximately 15% of our emergency humanitarian budget went to Syria.  Nobody would have predicted that ten years ago.  There are massive needs in South Sudan, Somalia, the Central African Republic, and across the Horn of Africa and 15% of the funding available in emergency assistance went last year to Syria because of the need and the suffering.  That is a global political failure because the regional solution in the Middle East will have to be a political solution and when that happens it will obviate the need for emergency humanitarian assistance.  It really highlights the absolutely critical role of peace.  There was resistance to the inclusion of a goal on peaceful societies and well-governed societies in what was seen as a development agenda because in the past there has been a tendency, first, to define development as aid, but second, to define development as something that is separate from politics and governance.  Unwieldy as it may seem at times, the benefit of this new sustainable development agenda is that it attempts to bring these factors together because without peace and security one just cannot have development.  If we have to devote more of our development funding to emergency humanitarian assistance we will not be able to help with the long-term development of society.  That kind of explains why this agenda has to be so complex, but the real challenge for all of us is going to be how we work together to implement the agenda when the summit adopts it in September so that it does not become another document on the shelf.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015061700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Gaffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434531600,"counter":1875,"content":"<p>What about population movement in those circumstances?

Deputy Neville raised exactly that point, that what we are seeing at the moment in the migration crisis in the Mediterranean is multidimensional.  It is sometimes presented simply as a question of how we can cope with the migrants landing or how can we save them from the appallingly crowded boats and the traffickers.  We have to see it in a much broader context because initially when people asked who all the people were arriving from North Africa it turned out that most of the people are from places such as Somalia, Eritrea and west Africa.  When we look at where much of our emergency assistance and long-term development assistance is going, it is going to the countries where those people are originating from.<\/p> <p>  In the sustainable development goals, SDGs, there is also an attempt to take that much more comprehensive approach whereby we do not just look at a problem when it presents itself literally on our doorsteps.  I emphasise the role of long-term development.  Sometimes there is a tendency to say the needs are greatest in emergency situations and that one needs to put one&rsquo;s money there, but it is all linked.  Long-term development strategies owned by governments themselves are the only way to really tackle migration flows.<\/p> <p>  Some migration is inevitable and is a natural human phenomenon and it can be of benefit both to the people migrating and to the societies in which they settle.  However, what we are seeing at the moment is mainly the result of conflict and under-development.  Eritrea is a difficult country in which to operate.  We have had great success with our partners in neighbouring Ethiopia in helping them to build up society and neighbouring Eritrea is the source of so many of the people on those boats in the Mediterranean.  If one happens to google Eritrea at any point over the last year, all one finds is endless cases of people dying trying to leave the country and dying in the Mediterranean Sea, which is our European sea.  What it really highlights to us is the importance of this integrated approach to emergency humanitarian assistance and long-term development and then policy on migration.  None of them can be taken alone.  That is another example of an area we might not have considered two years ago for a whole-of-government policy and policy coherence for development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015061700002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Gaffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1434531600,"counter":1877,"content":"<p>Do members have any more questions?

The incorporation of these provisions into the Bill represents the culmination of a process that was agreed by the Government in March 2013.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 provide for the Minister for Health to commence the provisions on advance health care directives, in consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  It is standard for the commencement order to be made by the Minister who has policy responsibility for a specific Part.<\/p><p>I propose to discuss the remaining amendments in this grouping somewhat out of sequence in order that the consequential amendments will make sense when I discuss them.  As amendments Nos.  253 to 264, inclusive, encompass the new Part on advance health care directives, I will discuss these amendments together.  An advance health care directive is a statement made by a person with capacity setting out his or her will and preferences regarding treatment decisions that may arise in the future, in the event that he or she lacks the capacity to provide consent to or to refuse those treatments.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill was considered the most appropriate vehicle for providing a legislative framework for advance health care directives.  This is an efficient and practical method of consolidating the law in this area.  Officials in the Department of Health published the draft general scheme of the advance health care directive provisions in February 2014 and conducted an extensive public consultation process on those provisions. <\/p><p>I will now provide a brief overview of the main provisions relating to advance health care directives encompassed by amendments Nos. 253 to 264, inclusive.  Amendment No. 253 defines key words and terms used within the advance health care directive provisions.  Amendment No. 254 outlines both the purpose of providing the legislative framework for advance health care directives and the guiding principles that underpin the provisions in Part 8.  Amendment No. 255 sets out the various practicalities required to make an advance health care directive - for example, in order to make such a directive a person must be an adult, that is, be over 18 years of age, and must have capacity.  In addition, a directive must be made in writing, signed and witnessed accordingly.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 255 also states that in order for a refusal of treatment in an advance health care directive to be considered legally binding, the person must lack capacity to consent to the treatment at the time in question, the treatment being refused must be clearly identified and the specific situations in which the treatment refusal is intended to apply must also be clearly<b><\/b>identified.  These provisions also enable a person to outline specific treatment requests in his or her directive.  These requests would not be legally binding but would have to be taken into consideration during the decision-making process relating to that person's treatment.<\/p><p>A directive would not be considered applicable if at the time in question the directive-maker still had capacity, or if the treatment in question and-or the circumstances that had arisen were not broadly recognisable as those specified in the directive.  A directive would not be applicable to life-sustaining treatment unless it included a specific statement from the directive-maker to that effect. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 256 also outlines the approaches to be adopted when considering the applicability of advance health care directives during pregnancy.  Where the directive does not specifically state that it was intended to apply even if the woman is pregnant, there would be a presumption that treatment would be provided or continued.  Where the woman specifically stated in her directive that she wanted her refusal of treatment to apply even if she was pregnant, an application would automatically be referred to the High Court to resolve the case.  <\/p><p>In addition, an advance health care directive would not be legally binding where a person&rsquo;s treatment is regulated under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 or where a person is the subject of a conditional discharge order under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  However, these restrictions would not apply to such individuals where the treatment refusal outlined in the directive pertains to a physical illness, which is not related to the amelioration of that individual's mental disorder.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 257 sets out the effect of an advance health care directive and also includes considerations regarding liability matters.  For example, it clarifies that a treatment refusal outlined in a directive would have the same effect and autonomy as a similar refusal made contemporaneously by the directive-maker when he or she had capacity.  This amendment offers protection from liability to health care professionals in their dealings with advance health care directives, provided certain conditions are satisfied.  Amendment No. 257 also clarifies that these provisions do not pertain in any way to euthanasia or assisted suicide and they do not alter the existing legislation on homicide under which both euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 258 introduces a mechanism through which an adult with capacity may nominate in his or her directive a legal representative to be involved in the health care decision-making process on his or her behalf, if he or she was to subsequently lose capacity.  This nominee is known as the designated health care representative.  This amendment also outlines the specific safeguards and conditions that apply in relation to who may or may not be nominated as a designated health care representative.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 259 encompasses the functions and powers of designated health care representatives.  Under the provision a designated health care representative will be authorised to ensure that the terms of the advance health care directive are upheld.  The decision-maker may, if he or she so wishes, confer additional powers on the designated representative, which would include advising on and interpreting the decision-maker's will and preferences regarding treatment as outlined in the directive.  The designated health care representative could also be given the authority to consent to or refuse treatment, which could include life-sustaining treatment on behalf of the directive-maker.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 260 sets out the role of the courts and clarifies that an application can be made to the court to decide whether an advance health care directive is valid and applicable or whether or not a designated health care professional is acting in accordance with his or her relevant powers.  Such an application might arise where there is doubt or disagreement about the validity and applicability of a given directive.  If the application involves consideration of life-sustaining treatment it will be made to the High Court, rather than the Circuit Court.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 261 relates to offences arising under this Part.  It would be an offence for a person to use fraud, coercion or undue influence to force another person to make, alter or revoke an advance health care directive or to knowingly create, falsify, alter or try to revoke a directive on behalf of somebody else without the person's written consent.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 262 clarifies that the Minister for Health will convene a multidisciplinary expert group to assist with the development of a code of practice to provide advice and guidance in relation to the advance health care directive's provisions.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 263 outlines certain practical and procedural matters relating to court applications under the advance health care directive's provisions.  Amendment No. 264 clarifies that the Minister for Health will conduct a review of the functioning of the advance health care directive provisions before the fifth anniversary of the commencement of this Part of the Bill.<\/p><p> The remaining amendments in group one are consequential amendments arising as a result of the incorporation of the new Part on advance health care directives.

Whereas the published Bill provides for a court order approving a co-decision-making agreement made voluntarily between two persons, an appointer and a co-decision-maker, on the basis of a court order finding that the appointer lacks capacity but with the assistance of a suitable co-decision-maker or makers, the new proposed system essentially transfers the responsibility for the approval of the decision to the decision support service.  Under the new approach the relevant person will choose a trusted co-decision-maker and can receive advice and support from the decision support service.  On drawing up the co-decision-making agreement, the service will verify that everything is in order and that the relevant person is making the agreement freely.  It will then register the agreement whereupon it will come into effect.<\/p><p>The service itself will not make the finding that the appointer lacks capacity, without assistance.  That assistance is provided by a medical doctor and another health care professional, to be identified in ministerial regulation.  The advantages of the new approach will be that the entry procedure will be undertaken in a non-intimidatory and non-adversarial environment which will be less stressful for the person with capacity difficulties.  The person will retain greater control over the process as the only action available to the decision support service will be to register the agreement or not to register.  It will not be possible for the service to force the person into a more intrusive option as the court can do under the provisions as published.  There will be less pressure on court resources.  In terms of the ongoing input of the courts, legal advice to the Department has been that the director's discretion in assessing applications must be confined to straightforward situations which will be the majority of cases and that questions such as the appropriateness of a co-decision-maker or the capacity of the relevant person must be referred to the courts.  Determination of whether a person has capacity is a judicial function and where there is an objection or dispute relating to the person's capacity for entering into co-decision-making, it is not appropriate for the director to make such a decision.  Similarly, allegations of fraud in certain contexts which is a criminal offence, are not suitable for a non-judicial person to make a finding on.<\/p><p>The policy decision has necessitated a great number of textual changes and it has been considered that the best way to do this is by means of inserting a new Part, new sections 13 to 28, and deleting Chapter 4, sections 16 to 22.  Additional consequential changes elsewhere throughout the text of the Bill are also addressed in this grouping.  The new Part is inserted by means of amendments Nos. 86 to 101, inclusive.  The consequential changes are addressed here by amendments Nos. 7, 9, 10, 28, 36, 105, 113, 120, 122, 123 and 202.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#C00400","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":1917,"content":"<p>I am speaking to amendments Nos. 122 and 123.

The director's office will operate independently and will provide a protection by means of its analysis of any co-decision-maker and the registration of the agreement will also provide a protection. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#C00900","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":1922,"content":"<p>I am not convinced that the Minister of State has addressed the concerns, so I will press the amendment when we deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#C01000","speaker":"998"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":1923,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":1924,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<\/p><blockquote>In page 10, line 29, to delete &ldquo;<i>section 16<\/i>&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;<i>section 13<\/i>&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#C01200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":1925,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":1926,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 9:<\/p><blockquote>In page 10, line 31, to delete &ldquo;<i>section 16<\/i>&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;<i>section 13<\/i>&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#C01400","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":1927,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":1928,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 10:<\/p><blockquote><b><\/b>In page 10, to delete lines 32 and 33.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#C01600","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":1929,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":1930,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 11, 16, 20, 26, 35, 65, 104, 118, 128, 151, 153, 156, 165, 166, 168, 187, 199, 209 to 229, inclusive, 267, 272, 278 to 287, inclusive, 289 to 294, inclusive, 296, 301 to 303, inclusive, 305 to 307, inclusive, 310 to 312, inclusive, 316, 318, 319, 321 to 334, inclusive, 337, 404, 406 to 409, inclusive, and 417 are consequential on amendment No. 265 and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#C01800","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":1931,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 11:<\/p> <p>In page 11, line 2, to delete &ldquo;Public Guardian&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Director&rdquo;.<\/p> <p>These amendments propose to replace all references to public guardian with that of director.

At this stage people will know that we have gone probably wider on this Bill than on any other legislation.  There were certain pieces where we could simply not get over that legal hurdle but I assure the Deputy that we will take another look.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 161 proposes the deletion of the provisions of section 26(1) as the definition of property and affairs, and it has been moved to section 2 in order to make clear that it applies to any decisions relating to property and affairs under the Bill, not just to decisions made by decision-making representatives.  No changes are proposed to the existing definition.<\/p> <p>  The proposed new section 26(1) is intended as an additional safeguard to prevent a decision-making representative from making gifts using the property or income of a person with capacity difficulties, unless specifically authorised to do so, by the court in the decision-making representation order.  It is intended as a protection against potential financial abuse by the decision-making representative. <\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 163 is intended to tighten the provisions concerning gift giving by a decision-making representative on behalf of a person lacking capacity.  It is intended as an additional safeguard to prevent a decision-making representative from considering himself or herself permitted to engage in extensive gift giving from the person's assets or income.  The circumstances in which gift giving is authorised are limited to customary occasions in which gifts are given to persons related or connected to the person lacking capacity.  The provision for gifts to be given to charity has been retained.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 164 is intended to ensure that account must be taken of the financial obligations of the person lacking capacity, as well as of that person's assets, when deciding whether it is appropriate to give gifts.  If the person were to have extensive financial obligations, for instance, it would be important that such obligations would be honoured first before engaging in gift giving.  <\/p> <p>  The aim of the proposed amendment No. 167 is to tighten the conditions in which a court can confer management of the property of a person lacking capacity on the director of the decision support service.  As the aim is that decisions on that person's property and assets would be made by a person who knows the person lacking capacity, and preferably that person's will and preferences, it is important that decisions on the person's property and affairs should be made by a decision-making representative.  The option of having decisions made by the director of the decision support service should be a last resort option.  As a result, the amendment proposes a new provision, subsection (b), whereby the court could confer the role, on the director of the decision support service, only where there is no person suitable or willing to act as a decision-making representative in regard to the property and affairs of the person lacking capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#D00600","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":1937,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":1938,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 13, 29, 110, 131, 133, 135 to 137, inclusive, 139, 149, 150, 155, 157 to 159, inclusive, 162 and 185 are cognate and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#D00800","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":1939,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 13:<\/p><blockquote>In page 11, line 17, to delete &ldquo;decision-making representative order&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;decision-making representation order&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>As a group, these amendments propose that the title of the order that will apply, when a decision-making representative is appointed, should be changed to decision-making representation order rather than decision-making representative order, to make the title consistent with the titles of the other support options which are co-decision-making agreements and decision-making assistance agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#D00900","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":1940,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":1941,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 14:<\/p><blockquote>In page 11, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:&ldquo; &ldquo;designated healthcare representative&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by <i>section 55<\/i>*;<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;Director&rdquo; has the meaning given to it in <i>section 55<\/i>;&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#D01100","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":1942,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":1943,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 15 and 338 to 342, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#D01300","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":1944,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<\/p><blockquote>In page In page 11, to delete lines 24 to 27.<\/blockquote> <p>Amendments Nos. 15, 338, 339 and 342 propose to remove the specific reference to the European Convention on Human Rights in the provisions of the Bill.

Mental Health Reform considers it imperative that measures would be included in the Bill to protect against the inappropriate and-or persistent use of informal decision-making, in particular with regard to persons who are resident in mental health facilities and-or in respect of patients in approved centres.  In its submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, Mental Health Reform also drew particular attention to the issue of over-prescription of high dosage medication and anti-psychotic medication as well as the overuse of polypharmacy for people with mental health conditions.  Mental Health Reform is concerned to ensure the legislation does not permit informal decision-makers to take decisions that involve the administration or authorisation of prescription medication to persons who are not consenting or lack the capacity to consent to the administration of such medication.<\/p><p>This amendment seeks to address these concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#E02600","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":1972,"content":"<p>On Deputy Mac Lochlainn's amendment No. 250, section 104 already provides that this Bill does not authorise a person to take a decision to give a patient treatment for mental disorder or to consent to that treatment where that is regulated by Part 4 of the 2001 Act.  The Department of Health is currently developing its policy approach regarding the review of the Mental Health Act.  This will include considering the specific situation of persons who lack capacity and who require treatment for mental illness.  In this context, it is not appropriate to include a specific provision in this Bill relating to informal decision makers and decisions regarding the admission or detention of a person in a mental health service.  My view, in any case, is that the provisions concerning informal decision makers should be as limited as possible as the aim is that any decisions needing to be taken on behalf of a person lacking capacity should be taken by those who are subject to oversight under the Bill.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment No. 250 or the consequential amendment No. 243.  I would ask the Deputy not to press his amendments.  We have already had a detailed discussion on this subject.  I understand the worries about mental health reforms but this element needs to be dealt with and would be dealt with much better under the review of the Mental Health Act 2001, where we will put in the necessary safeguards.  I am not certain that the Deputy read the recommendations of the review panel but they are quite comprehensive and deal with a range of issues including capacity.  If the Deputy were to take a look at those recommendations he will see that we are dealing with the issue under the review of the Mental Health Act.

They change how we deal with mental health and how we look at capacity within mental health.

The proposed definition of personal welfare has been significantly recast in the light of concerns raised by stakeholders, particularly in relation to the explicit inclusion of provisions enabling the intervener to decide the persons with whom the relevant person may have contact.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has raised concerns regarding the provision that the intervener could decide whether or not the person may travel outside the State.  This provision may also contravene Article 18 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which stipulates that the relevant person should be free to leave any country, including his or her own.<\/p><p>The recast definition adapts the provisions of the British Columbia Representation Agreement Act 1986, which is considered to constitute good practice in terms of compliance with the UN Convention, and the Ontario Substitute Decisions Act 1992.  The definition focuses more on the likely decisions that an intervener would have to make, such as whether the relevant person might have to move to a nursing home or whether the person would participate in employment, training, education or social activities.  The issues of diet and dress are encompassed within the general provision enabling the intervener to take decisions relating to the person&rsquo;s well-being.  It is considered preferable not to refer to these issues explicitly, as these are issues on which the relevant person may continue to have the capacity to take his or her own decisions, even when the capacity to take other decisions is seriously diminished.

Amendment No. 124 proposes the first of the changes consequent on co-decision-making being moved out of the courts.  As co-decision-making is now a voluntary option, a person cannot be forced to enter a co-decision-making agreement.  The amendment sets out the provision that a decision-making representative can be appointed only where the court is satisfied that there is no co-decision-making agreement in place and that the court has made a declaration that the person lacks capacity to make a decision or a class of decisions. Consequently, it allows the feasibility of co-decision-making to be considered for the person with capacity difficulties before proceeding to a decision-making representation agreement in line with the ethos of the Bill that the least intrusive options should be considered before proceeding to more intrusive options.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 125 is intended to clarify that the court can make an order appointing a decision-making representative to take decisions on property and affairs, on personal welfare, or on both property and affairs and on personal welfare on behalf of a person with capacity difficulties.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 126 proposes the factors that should guide the court when determining whether a person is suitable to act as a decision-making representative for a person with capacity difficulties.  The most important factor is that of the will and preferences of the person with capacity difficulties, in line with the ethos of the Bill that the mechanisms being put in place are primarily to express the person&rsquo;s wishes when the person no longer has the capacity to do so.<\/p><p> As the support of family members can be important for many people in this situation, the next factor enables the court to prioritise a family member for appointment as a decision-making representative provided that the person is otherwise suitable.  The person being selected has to be compatible with the person with capacity difficulties and a factor is proposed in this regard.<\/p><p> The final factors require the court to assess whether the proposed decision-making representative will be able to perform the functions to be vested in him or her.  There is no point in appointing a decision-making representative who may be compatible with the person but unable to perform what is a responsible and often onerous role.  The final factor is that of assessing any potential conflict of interest.<\/p><p> Where a decision-making representative will have responsibility for decisions on the person&rsquo;s property and affairs, these decisions will often be more complex in nature than those relating to personal welfare.  An additional set of factors are proposed requiring the court to assess whether the proposed decision-making representative will have the competence to perform the role, taking account of the size and complexity of the person&rsquo;s affairs.  It allows the court to take account of potential supports available to the proposed decision-making representative when assessing that person&rsquo;s competence for the role.  A family member, for instance, might not have extensive expertise in managing the business of a person with capacity difficulties.  However, if the family member could show that she or he had access to accountants or business experts to support him or her in her role, that could be taken into account by the court. <\/p><p> Amendment No. 127 addresses the situation where there is no suitable person to perform the role of decision-making representative.  As the definition of suitability includes whether the person has the capability to perform the role, it is not considered necessary to include the phrase \"or able\" in this provision.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 37 proposes to correct a cross-reference.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 130 proposes that the director of the decision support service must comply with the court&rsquo;s request to nominate two representatives from the panel of decision-making representatives maintained by the decision support service where the court seeks to appoint a decision-making representative from that panel.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 129 is a consequential amendment arising from the insertion of the new paragraph (b) into subsection (3).<\/p><p> Amendment No. 132 proposes to require the court, when appointing a decision-making representative, to decide also on the powers to be conferred on the decision-making representative, the duties and-or any conditions to be imposed.  The existing provision leaves this at the court&rsquo;s discretion.  The purpose of the amendment is to restrict the room for manoeuvre of decision-making representatives in order that the functions they exercise will be limited to those set out by the court.  This is intended as a safeguard against a decision-making representative acting beyond his or her functions because duties and conditions were not clearly ordered in advance by the court.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 134 proposes that the court would require a potential decision-making representative to sign a statement indicating that he or she understands and agrees to act in accordance with the duties and powers conferred by the court and with the Bill&rsquo;s guiding principles.  By requiring a decision-making representative to make a commitment to the court at the time of appointment to abide by the obligations arising both from the court&rsquo;s order and from the Bill, this is designed as a safeguard to prevent a decision-making representative from acting beyond the scope of his or her powers due to lack of knowledge of the obligations underpinning the role.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 138 is a safeguard which expands the circumstances in which a court can determine that a decision-making representative is acting outside the scope of the decision-making representation order.  It allows the court to determine that the decision-making representative is acting outside the scope of the order if the representative is acting in a way that is not in accordance with the Bill&rsquo;s guiding principles.  The obligation on the decision-making representative is to act not only in accordance with the person&rsquo;s best interests but also in accordance with the range of obligations set out in the Bill&rsquo;s guiding principles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#G03900","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":2034,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":2035,"content":"<p>Section 2, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":2036,"content":"<p>SECTION 3<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":2037,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 38 to 47, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together, by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#H00500","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":2038,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 38:<\/p><blockquote>In page 14, lines 21 and 22, to delete &ldquo;decision-making assistance agreement,&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>Amendment No. 38 proposes to remove the reference to &quot;decision-making assistance agreement&quot; as a person will not have to undergo a capacity test to enter a decision-making assistance agreement.

The Bill contains a presumption of capacity unless the contrary is shown.  My objective in this section is to ensure the vast majority of persons will be able to meet the capacity test and be deemed to have capacity.<\/p><p>The aim of the capacity test is to ensure a person has the capacity to make a specific decision.  It is not a mechanism for declaring a person to lack capacity for ever more.  The first amendment is that the person needs to understand information relevant to a decision at the time a decision is to be made.  This amendment is intended to ensure a person is not expected to understand and retain information for months in order to be deemed to have capacity.  The test is directly linked to the type of decision and the time when it has to be made.<\/p><p>In a similar vein, amendment No. 41 seeks to make clear that the test relates to a particular decision rather than to decisions in general.  A person may be found to need support to make a specific decision.  That may not have implications for the person&rsquo;s ability to make other decisions.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 43 proposes that the person needs to have capacity to retain information long enough to make a voluntary choice.  This is to ensure a person could not be deemed to lack capacity if he or she could not retain information relevant to the decision for a significant period.  The aim is to tie the test directly to the demands of the decision needing to be made, in line with the functional approach being adopted.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 44 is to correct a typographical error.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 45 proposes a change of terminology recommended by disability stakeholders.<\/p><p>As members know, we have always proposed that the capacity test should be a functional test whereby the person&rsquo;s capacity is assessed against the demands of the decision or decisions needing to be made.  Amendment No. 46 seeks to make even clearer that this is a functional test which is not based on whether a person has a particular condition.<\/p><p>The new provisions make clear that the capacity test is time-limited and issue-specific.  A person, even if found not to have the capacity to make a particular decision, will still have the possibility to make that decision or category of decisions at another time.  Similarly, even if the person is found not to have the capacity to make a decision on a particular issue, such as on a complex financial matter, for instance, that person still retains the capacity to take other decisions, such as on personal welfare.  These provisions illustrate the difference between the capacity test as proposed and the on-or-not regime in operation under the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 which removes the person&rsquo;s capacity to take all decisions once declared a ward of court.<\/p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 47 is to remove the test in order that matters can be decided on the balance of probabilities.  As there is a presumption of capacity in section 8(2), the starting point is that the person has capacity unless that is demonstrated otherwise.<\/p><p>The test must, therefore, be that the person has been demonstrated not to have capacity on the issue on which a decision is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#H00600","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":2040,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":2041,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 39:<\/p><blockquote>In page 14, lines 22 and 23, to delete &quot;or enduring power of attorney&quot;

This is in line with the ethos of the Bill, namely, that any intrusion should be as limited as possible.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 54 proposes to set the obligation that a person who takes a decision on behalf of another person, either formally or informally, should act in good faith and for the benefit of the person in addition to being subject to the other requirements and safeguards outlined in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#J03600","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":2075,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":2076,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 52:<\/p><blockquote>In page 16, lines 31 and 32, to delete all words from and including &quot;his&quot; in line 31 down to and including line 32 and substitute the following:&quot;dignity, bodily intergrity, privacy, autonomy and control over his or her financial affairs and property,&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#J03800","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":2077,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":2078,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 53:<\/p><blockquote>In page 16, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:&quot;(c) be proportionate to the significance and urgency of the matter the subject of the intervention, and<br \/><br \/>(d) be as limited in duration in so far as is practicable after taking into account the particular circumstances of the matter the subject of the intervention.&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#J04000","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":2079,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":2080,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 54:<\/p><blockquote>In page 17, to delete line 17 and substitute the following:&quot;(e) act at all times in good faith and for the benefit of the relevant person, and&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#J04200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":2081,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":2082,"content":"<p>Section 8, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":2083,"content":"<p>SECTION 9<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":2084,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 55:<\/p><blockquote>In page 18, to delete lines 9 and 10.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#J04600","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":2085,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":2086,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 56:<\/p><blockquote>In page 18, to delete lines 11 and 12.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#J04800","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":2087,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":2088,"content":"<p>Section 9, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":2089,"content":"<p>SECTION 10<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":2090,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 57 and 77 are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#J05200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":2091,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 57:<\/p><blockquote>In page 18, lines 15 and 16, to delete &quot;who has also attained that age&quot;.<\/blockquote> <p>These are technical amendments.

It also proposes that the person with capacity difficulties and the decision-making assistant would have the possibility of varying the agreement provided that both agreed.  Both could, for instance, decide to extend or restrict the areas covered by the agreement.<\/p><p>The proposed amendment No. 60 would enable ministerial regulations to extend to procedures for varying or revoking agreements.  This would put in place extra safeguards to protect a person with capacity difficulties in a decision-making assistance agreement.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 61 requires that the information on drawing up an agreement must be explained to the relevant person by someone other than the proposed decision-making assistant.  This is to avoid any conflict of interest.  It is an extra safeguard to ensure that the person could not be persuaded to enter into an agreement by the person wishing to become the decision-making assistant without being fully aware of the implications of the agreement or, indeed, of the safeguards underpinning it.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 62 is intended to add an extra requirement for a decision-making assistant, namely, that he or she agrees to act in accordance with the functions of a decision-making assistant.  The aim is that the decision-making assistant would agree in advance of entering the decision-making assistant agreement that he or she was prepared to comply with all of the resulting obligations, including that of acting in accordance with the guiding principles that underpin this Bill.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 63 proposes that the signatures of the person with capacity difficulties and the potential decision-making assistant would be attested by a third party.  This is an extra safeguard against undue influence or fraud and is aimed at ensuring that the person with capacity difficulties voluntarily enters into the agreement.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 64 is to require that ministerial regulations should govern the notice procedures for varying and revoking decision-making assistance agreements.  This is an extra safeguard to protect the person with capacity difficulties and the decision-making assistant.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 70 proposes that a decision-making assistance agreement could be invalidated if it conflicted with the provisions of an advance health care directive, even if that directive did not result in the appointment of a designated health care representative.  This is because the Bill proposes that the advance health care directive would always take precedence over a decision-making assistance agreement for a number of reasons.<\/p><p>First, an advance health care directive can only be drawn up when the person has capacity while the decision-making assistance agreement is operational when a person has capacity difficulties.  As a result, the advance health care directive is an accurate reflection of the person's will and preferences when he or she has capacity.<\/p><p>Second, it relates specifically to health care matters and is a more precise reflection of the person's will and preferences on health care than a decision-making assistance agreement which can be more general in scope.  Third, the decision-making assistant is essentially an advisory role and should not extend to making decisions on the person's behalf.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 71 proposes to delete the provisions which restricted to the person with capacity difficulties the option of revoking or varying the decision-making assistance agreement.  This is intended as a safeguard for the decision-making assistant that he or she would not be forced to remain in an agreement against his or her will or that the agreement could be varied by the person with capacity difficulties without the knowledge of the decision-making assistant or against his or her will.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 72, 74 and 75 propose to delete the phrase \"or an appointer\" as unnecessary.  Amendment No. 73 proposes to re-order the functions of the decision-making assistant in the order of priority of the functions of the decision-making assistant.  The amendment seeks to make clear that his or her primary function is to assist the person with capacity difficulties to obtain information.  This is to avoid any potential confusion that a decision-making assistant is a substitute decision-maker.  Instead, the role is as an information support and as an adviser.<\/p><p> The purpose of amendment No. 76 is to make clear that a decision-making assistance agreement does not give a decision-making assistant the right to take decisions on behalf of the person with capacity difficulties.  The function of a decision-making assistant is to support a person with capacity difficulties when making decisions by sourcing information or by providing advice.  The amendment seeks to reinforce the principle underpinning the Bill that everyone is presumed to have decision-making capacity unless the contrary is shown.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#J05600","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434529800,"counter":2096,"content":"<p>Amendment

This is to ensure that the person with capacity difficulties is not prevented from seeing friends or family or potentially isolated from friends or family by a decision-making representative.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 170 is an additional safeguard to prevent unnecessary intrusion by a decision-making representatives into the decision-making autonomy of a person with capacity difficulties.  This is in line with the Bill's ethos to minimise any intrusion into the decision-making autonomy of a person.  The amendment would prevent a decision-making representative from taking decisions other than those conferred by the court, as specified in the decision-making representation order.<\/p><p>A decision-making representative authorised to make decisions in regard to the personal welfare of a person lacking capacity would not, due to this provision, be able to take decisions on that person's property and affairs.  For example, amendment No. 171 sets out the hierarchy of decision-making that would apply in situations where a person had made an advance health care directive.  An advance health care directive would take precedence on decisions relating to health care.  Amendment No. 172 prohibits a decision-making representative from being able to consent to the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment for a person lacking capacity.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 174,  175 and 179 propose to limit the circumstances in which a decision-making representative can use restraints or authorise the use of a restraint.  This is in order to align the Bill with Government policy that restraint should not be used where possible, or if necessary, only in very limited circumstances.  The amendments propose that restraints can be used only where there are exceptional emergency circumstances and where the decision-making representative believes there is an imminent risk of serious harm to the person lacking capacity or to another person.  They require that the restraint be immediately ceased when no longer necessary to prevent the imminent risk of serious harm to the person lacking capacity or to another person.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 176 and 177 distinguish between restraint and an action which may restrict a person&rsquo;s movement but which is intended to help the person, such as where a support is used to prevent the person from falling out of a chair, for instance.  Restraint is therefore defined as an action that is intentional and designed to restrict voluntary movement rather than to restrict involuntary tremors or spasms.<\/p><p> I believe my proposed amendments Nos. 174 and 175 limit the use of restraint further than is proposed in Deputy Mac Lochlainn&rsquo;s amendment No. 173.  I ask the Deputy not to press that amendment and to support our amendments.  <\/p><p> I am prepared to accept Deputy Mac Lochlainn&rsquo;s amendment No. 178, as it would enable chemical restraint to be added to the definition of restraint and I may bring an amendment forward in this regard on Report Stage.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 180 is technical and proposes to move the provision requiring the director of the decision support service to establish a register of decision-making representation orders from section 56 to this Part as it is more appropriate that the provision be included with other provisions relating to decision-making representation.<\/p><p> I propose to discuss amendments Nos 204 to 208, inclusive, together as the new provisions proposed for attorneys in regard to the use of restraint are the same as those to apply to decision-making representatives.  The intention, as for decision-making representatives, is to restrict the use of restraint in line with Government policy.  As a result, it is proposed that restraint could be used or authorised by an attorney only in exceptional emergency circumstances to prevent an imminent risk of serious harm to the person lacking capacity or to another person.   Amendment No. 208 requires that the restraint be ceased immediately on being no longer necessary to prevent an imminent risk of serious harm to the person with capacity difficulties, or to another person.  Amendments Nos. 206 and 207 distinguish the term \"restraint\" from actions taken to support a person affected by involuntary movement.  Restraint is defined as an intentional action intended to restrict a person&rsquo;s voluntary movement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#O09700","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":2355,"content":"<p>Can I have clarification in respect of Government policy in this regard?

The issue of restraint of relevant persons is addressed by reference to restrictions on decision-making representatives in section 27 of the Bill.  Following representations from Mental Health Reform, I understand it considers it is imperative that the provisions permitting restraint of a person by a decision-making representative should be strictly construed and should explicitly require that the decision-making representative acts in a manner consistent with the principles of the Bill.  The provision should only allow restraint where this is the least restrictive measure to prevent harm.<\/p> <p>  Mental Health Reform considers the definition of \"restraint\", as provided for in section 27(6), should be extended to include the use of chemical restraints and considers it necessary to ensure that a specific provision be included in section 54, dealing with informal decision-making to specifically prohibit an informal decision-maker from doing an act that is intended to restrain the relevant person.

In fact, what we propose here is so wide-ranging that it covers everything.  It mentions the exclusion of people from their friends and families, which I believe is a form of restraint.  What we propose is comprehensive and imposes obligations on the person assisting rather than the person with capacity issues.<\/p> <p>  The proposed amendments Nos. 181 to 183 remove the requirement that a person with capacity difficulties must have the consent of the court to seek a review of a declaration of incapacity.  In regard to restraint, we must accept that most of the people we are talking about here would be in a community setting.  However, what we seem to be talking about here is involuntary admission into a psychiatric unit.  This does not apply to them.  This applies to voluntary admissions or people in the community.  We have a much greater safeguard in terms of how people will be treated in this respect, but it is important we enshrine this in our legislation and make it clear there are consequences for people who engage in this type of activity.  I am not saying restraint does not happen or will not happen in the future.  It would be impossible to give that kind of guarantee.<\/p><p>There are robust restrictions in this legislation and there will be a specific office with a director to which not only the person who lacks capacity in certain instances or the assisted decision-maker but families, friends and community-based people can make complaints about treatment of individuals.

The proposed amendments set out these arrangements.  As they involve significant re-ordering of this Part, I consider it more appropriate to propose the deletion of the existing Part 5 and its substitution with these provisions.  No change is proposed in amendment No. 189 to section 33 as set out in the Bill as published.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 190 proposes to amend section 35(1) to clarify that a ward or a person with sufficient interest in the ward&rsquo;s welfare can apply to the wardship court, that is the High Court or Circuit Court as appropriate, to have the ward&rsquo;s capacity reviewed.  This provision is to allow for applications to be made by wards and their families, with the court's consent, at any time following commencement of this Part.  The proposed amendment to subsection (2) of that section clarifies that even if an application is not made by a ward or by another person on the ward&rsquo;s behalf, the court will review the capacity of all wards over 18 within three years of the commencement of this Part.<\/p><p>Where an existing ward is still under 18 years, three years following the commencement of this Part, the court is being required to review that person&rsquo;s capacity within six months of reaching 18.  This is to ensure wardship is abolished for all persons over 18 years.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 191 sets out the proposed transitional arrangements to apply in respect of wards.  They provide that where a wardship court finds that the ward no longer lacks capacity, he or she will be immediately discharged from wardship and have his or her property restored to him or her.<br\/><br\/>It is anticipated that some current wards will have some capacity difficulties which will require the appointment of a co-decision-maker to make decisions jointly with the former ward but that these wards will not require the more intensive support of a decision-making representative.  It is important that the less intrusive option be available to the court.  However, as co-decision-making is a voluntary process, rather than something which can be required by the court, the provisions in subsection (1)(b)(i) and (3) are designed to enable a court to advise the ward that he or she has the capacity to enter a co-decision-making agreement.  They provide that once a co-decision-making agreement has been registered, the ward&rsquo;s property can be returned to the former ward.<br\/><br\/>Many existing wards will not have the capacity either to be discharged from wardship immediately or to enter a co-decision-making agreement.  Provision is made for the appointment of a decision-making representative where the ward is declared by the court to lack capacity, even if a co-decision-maker were available to him or her.  The provisions allow for the ward&rsquo;s property to be returned to him or her once a decision-making representative has been appointed.  Once a decision-making representative has been appointed, the provisions of Part 4 and the additional safeguards just agreed to in respect of decision-making representatives will apply to former wards as to other persons lacking capacity for whom decisions are made by a decision-making representative.<br\/><br\/>Subsection (6) provides that the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 will be repealed, with the proviso in subsection (7) that neither its repeal nor these provisions will affect the validity of any court order in force prior to commencement of this Part.  The amendment is to ensure the system of wardship for adults provided by the 1871 Act is abolished. <br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 193 mirrors the existing section 36 of the Bill, other than the change of reference from the Public Guardian to the Director of the Decision Support Service.  It provides that the director may be assigned functions by the court in respect of individual wards or a class of wards.<br\/><br\/>The proposed amendment No. 194 mirrors section 37 of the Bill except for the change of reference from the Public Guardian to the director.  It provides that the court may assign the director's functions in respect of wards who are under 18 years at the time of commencement of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>The Bill sets out an ambitious timetable for abolition of the system of wardship that has been in place in Ireland since 1871.  It proposes that the system be abolished within three years following commencement of the Bill.  By then, every single ward over 18 years will have been reviewed by the court and either discharged from wardship or moved to the new support options.  This will take time within the courts system.  <br\/><br\/>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn seeks in his amendment No. 192 to have the process completed within six months of the Bill's commencement.  That is completely unrealistic.  There are some wards who are anxious to be discharged from wardship or who have family members or friends ready to act as co-decision-makers or decision-making representatives.  They will be free to apply for reviews by the court as soon as the Bill has been commenced.  However, there is a requirement to make arrangements to take over management of often large sums of money.  They will want to be properly prepared before making the application.  Six months would be much too early for these wards.  They could end up being pressed into arrangements, particularly financial arrangements, that might not be to their benefit.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment.  I, therefore, ask the Deputy not to press it because our solution is sensible.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I notify the committee that I plan to bring forward amendments to Part 6 on Report Stage to align the provisions on enduring powers of attorney with those proposed for co-decision-making and decision-making representation and to change the jurisdiction from the High Court to the Circuit Court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#Q07200","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":2438,"content":"<p>This is one of the issues the interest groups brought to our attention.

Separate provisions have been included in a specific section giving the director specific powers to undertake investigations.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 273 to 276 are technical in nature.  The provisions have been moved to section 57.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 269 is from Deputy Niall Collins, who will be aware that a new Part has been inserted into the Bill, Part 8, which sets out a legislative framework for advance health care directives.  The primary objective of these provisions is to promote personal autonomy by enabling an adult with capacity to make a legally binding advance health care directive.  The directive then serves as an expression of the person's will and preference regarding medical treatment in the event of their future incapacity.  Advance health care directives also serve to provide health care professionals with important information about the kind of treatment people would or would not wish to receive.  The addition of this new part means that Ireland is complying with the Council of Europe's recommendations 2009-2011 and 2014.  I thank the Deputy for drawing attention to these important international texts.  I will not be accepting the amendment on the basis that the principal issues raised have been addressed with the insertion of Part 8 in the Bill.<\/p><p>In respect of amendment No. 270, also in the name of Deputy Collins, Government amendment No. 255 states that the Minister for Health may make regulations requiring the director of decision support services to establish and maintain a register of advance health care directives.  There are, however, a number of practical and technical challenges which need to be overcome before such a register would be established and become operational. The roll-out of the individual health care identifier by the HSE is scheduled for the end of this year.  This development would facilitate the establishment of a register for advance health care directives, at which point regulations would be prepared.  Therefore I will not be accepting this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#T03400","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":2649,"content":"<p>I am tempted to withdraw the amendments.

This would include health care professionals, social care workers, community workers, neighbours, families and friends.  The categories of persons for whom guidance is to be prepared has been kept deliberately broad to ensure that the widest possible range of potential decision-makers is included within the amendment.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 314, tabled by Deputy Anne Ferris, I think we are both broadly in agreement as to the need for guidance for people undertaking roles, either formally or informally, in relation to persons with capacity difficulties.  I consider that amendment No. 313 addresses Deputy Ferris's concerns.  There are some issues with Deputy Ferris's formulation.  I do not think that health care professionals can be described as informal carers.  Furthermore, Deputy Ferris's amendment is restricted to family members or informal carers.  My amendment goes further to encompass any person who undertakes a role under section 53(1).  For this reason I cannot accept Deputy Ferris's amendment.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 315 proposes to provide for codes of practice to be produced for further categories of people who are likely to be involved with people with capacity issues.  We are proposing that codes of practice would be produced to guide advocates when acting on behalf of a person with capacity difficulties.  This amendment would cover advocates acting either in a formal or informal capacity, and would encompass advocacy organisations, family members or friends.<\/p><p>The following amendment would provide for codes of practice to be prepared for social care, legal and financial professionals, as well as for health care professionals.  The actions of professionals in these sectors can all have a major influence on a person's decision-making autonomy.  It is crucial that these sectors develop guidelines as guidance for members so that their practices can serve to support a person to exercise autonomy as much as possible in terms of decision making.  <\/p><p>The manner in which a bank engages with a person with intellectual disability can determine whether that person is able to manage his or her own affairs.  Equally, we need to ensure that these sectors have safeguards in place to guard against abuse of a vulnerable person by family members, friends or neighbours.  Codes of practice will be a crucial mechanism to provide guidance for these sectors and to build up their expertise about engaging with persons with capacity issues.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 320 provides for the National Disability Authority and the Citizens Information Board to be consulted when codes of practice are being devised.  The intention is that the National Disability Authority will provide assistance in the development of codes of practice generally.  The Citizens Information Board will provide advice on the development of the code of practice on advocates.  The other amendments are to ensure that professional bodies in the social care, legal and financial sectors are consulted when the codes of practice for those sectors are being developed.  This is to ensure that the codes of practice are grounded in an understanding of practice within those sectors.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 335 is to enable codes of practice to be published on the website of the director of the decision support service, or to be available electronically, so that they can be more easily available to people needing to use or to be aware of such codes of practice.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 336 is to provide that a code of practice will not be developed for advance health care directives under this section, as the code of practice on advance health care directive will be developed in accordance with the provisions of Part 8.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 317, as provided for by amendment No. 262, provides that the Minister for Health will establish a multidisciplinary working group to assist in the development and preparation of codes of practice with the Director of the Decision Support Service.  The codes of practice will provide advice and guidance on how the legislation will operate on a day-to-day basis, including providing examples of best practice for people interested in preparing their own advance care directive, but also for health care professionals, designated health care representatives and others who will have to deal with a person's advanced health care directive.  On that basis, it will not be possible to accept the Deputies' amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#V00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":2771,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Keaveney wish to comment on Deputy Niall Collins's amendment No. 317?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015061700002#V00300","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":2772,"content":"<p>Yes, a Chathaoirligh.

&ldquo;central authority in another Convention country&rdquo; means the authority designated by that country pursuant to the Convention;<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;central authority in the State&rdquo; means the authority mentioned in <i>section 74<\/i>;&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>Amendments Nos. 343 to 393, inclusive, are technical in nature and are intended to make clearer the provisions transposing the Hague Convention on the International Protection of Adults into Irish law.  The convention will apply where there is a transnational dimension to a case, such as if a person lacking capacity has property or affairs in another convention country or where a person living in another country has property and affairs to be managed here.  A definition has been proposed in amendment No. 343 of the &quot;central authority in the State&quot;.  This will be the decision support service and will be as set out in section 74.  A definition is also proposed of &quot;central authority in another convention country&quot;.  That will be the authority designated by that country under the convention.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 344, 346, 347, 361, 368, 375 and 390 propose to replace all references to &quot;protective measures&quot; by a reference to &quot;measures&quot;.  The Bill does not seek to establish a system of protection but instead a decision-making system which takes the person's will and preferences into account, where possible.  The &quot;measures&quot; to be taken will not always be protective but may, for example, be intended to enable a person to exercise decision-making autonomy.  As a result, it is more appropriate to refer to &quot;measures&quot; than to &quot;protective measures&quot;.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 345 provides that actions under this Part may be taken by the Circuit Court or by the director of the decision support service.  The amendment is to ensure that the Circuit Court or the director will have regard to the explanatory report on the convention by Paul Lagarde when taking action under this Part.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 348 is technical in nature arising from the change of name of the public guardian to that of the director of the decision support service.  It proposes that the director of the decision support service will be designated as the central authority and will have the responsibility to carry out the functions assigned to a central authority under the convention.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 349, 354, 356, 360, 364 to 366, inclusive, 374, 377, 380, 382, 388 and 389 are to enable the Circuit Court to have jurisdiction concurrently with the High Court in this area.  The option of giving the Circuit Court jurisdiction on these matters is intended for two reasons.  First, legal costs are likely to be lower for Circuit Court applications.  Second, the specialist judges who will handle these cases in the Circuit Court will have the necessary expertise, given that they will be dealing with similar cases regularly.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 350 to 353, inclusive, are technical in nature and are intended to ensure that section 75 directly transposes the relevant articles of the Hague Convention, namely, Articles 5 to 8, inclusive, and 10 and 11.  Amendments Nos. 355 and 358 are technical amendments to make the meaning of these provisions in section 76 clearer.  Amendment No. 357 is intended to give the court the jurisdiction to make a request of authorities in another convention country, such as in relation to a person or to the person's property if located in this other convention country.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 359 is a technical amendment which is intended to make the meaning of section 77 clearer.  It is intended to ensure that there is no break in continuity between measures put in place in Ireland for a particular person and those in operation in another convention country.  The amendment specifies that any measures taken by the High Court or the Circuit Court, as the case may be, will remain in effect until they have been modified, replaced or terminated by countervailing measures taken by the authorities in the convention country dealing with the particular case.  If a French person were to have an accident while on holiday in Ireland, for example, which left the person in a coma, the measures put in place by the court here would continue to apply until countervailing measures had been ordered by the French courts, such as to enable the person to return home.<\/p><p>Given that the amendment to section 77 now sets out that the jurisdiction of the Irish courts will apply until countervailing orders have been issued by the courts in the other convention country, no further provisions are needed in section 78 to supplement this provision.  Given that section 78 is now unnecessary, it is proposed that it should be deleted.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 362 and 363 have been proposed in the interests of clarity.  The reference to &quot;contracting state&quot; has been replaced by that of &quot;Convention country&quot; so that it is clear that the reference is to a country that has ratified the Hague Convention.  Similarly, the reference to &quot;the law of the convention country in which implementation occurs&quot; is intended to make clear that the law that will apply when a measure has to be implemented in a particular country is the law of the country in which the measure is implemented.  <\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 369 to 371, inclusive, are technical in nature.  They are intended to give greater clarity given that the intent is to provide for the court to be able to refuse recognition of a specific measure.  Amendments Nos. 367, 372 and 373 are technical in nature.  They are intended to make the intent of the provisions clearer.  Amendment No. 372 provides that a person can apply to the court for a declaration as to whether a measure taken in another Hague Convention country is recognised here.  Amendment No. 373 provides that any finding of fact by a court or similar competent authority in another Hague Convention country is conclusive for proceedings here.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 376 is a technical amendment in the interests of clarity.  Section 90 enables a person to apply to the court for a declaration as to whether a measure taken in another country is enforceable here.  The amendment specifies that the measure must be taken in a Hague Convention country.  Amendment No. 378 is a technical amendment changing a cross-reference to reflect the changes made to section 87.  Amendment No. 379 is a technical amendment to make clearer that the court can make a declaration recognising a measure taken in another Hague Convention country provided that the court has not refused to recognise the measure under the provisions of section 87.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 381 is a technical amendment to make it clearer that Part 10 applies to persons over 18 years where measures are taken before a person turns 18.  The protection applies from the point at which the person turns 18 years.  <\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 383 to 386, inclusive, are technical amendments which clarify that the communication is to be undertaken between Ireland and countries that are party to the Hague Convention.  These amendments and amendment No. 392 propose to amend the reference to \"central authority\" in lower case rather than upper case as there will not be an office called the \"Central Authority\".

We would be happy to keep the Chairman and committee fully updated and informed on this issue.  I thank the committee for inviting me to discuss the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the matter of requests to permit landings by foreign military aircraft at Irish airports and their passage through Irish airspace. <\/p> <p>  As a former member of the Committee, I am a strong supporter of its role and believe it has the capacity to make an important positive contribution to our democratic process.  It is with some alarm that I note that my replacement is only going before the committee today, which means that I have been marked absent from committee meetings over the past 12 months.  In terms of a league table of committee attendance, parliamentary appearances or otherwise, I certainly would not like to have a very poor attendance rate at this committee.  I am sure the Chairman would use his good offices to assure the appropriate clerk that I have not been active participant, nor indeed, I think, a member of the committee since May of last year.  I wish Deputy Anthony Lawlor every success as my replacement.  This is an important committee and, if I may say so, I feel my membership of, attendance at and contribution to it over the past years illustrated the high regard in which I held it and the Chairman's role.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been happy to co-operate fully with the committee&rsquo;s consideration of this petition.  In response to queries raised by the committee, written replies issued from my Department in December 2013 and May 2014.  The Department's Secretary General, Niall Burgess, met with the committee last December and subsequently sent a written response to a number of follow-up queries.  I trust that this intensive level of engagement has proven useful to the committee's deliberations.  It may be helpful if I offer some opening remarks, to set the scene and to touch on a few points which I understand are of particular interest to the committee.  Then we can open up the discussion, if that is in order.<\/p> <p>  As the committee members will be aware, responsibility concerning the regulation of aircraft is shared between a number of Departments.  My Department has the lead role in respect of foreign military aircraft.  In administering this role, it consults with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; the Department of Defence; and the Department of Justice and Equality.  Lead responsibility for the regulation of civil aircraft lies with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which consults as appropriate with other Departments, including mine, on applications concerning the carriage of munitions of war. <\/p> <p>  My Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, discussed the regulation of civil aircraft when he met with the committee on 18 February.  I shall therefore focus my remarks on the regulation of foreign military aircraft.  As members are aware from previous discussions, landings and overflights by foreign military aircraft are governed by strict conditions, including that aircraft must be unarmed and must carry no arms, ammunition or explosives. <\/p> <p>  The total numbers of requests for permission for landings by foreign military aircraft at Irish airports has not varied hugely over time.  Over the period 2010 to 2014, the average annual number of requests was 721.  This is broadly in line with the figure for 2004, over ten years ago.  The majority of requests originate from the US, with US aircraft accounting for an average of 85% of requests over the past five years.  Some 1,321 requests and notifications in respect of overflights by foreign military aircraft were made last year.  This represents a substantial reduction on the 2013 figure of 1,762.  Data for the first quarter of 2015 suggest a continuing downward trend.  Again, the majority of overflights concern US aircraft. <\/p> <p>  It is not surprising that the majority of flights arise in respect of US aircraft.  As the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, remarked when he addressed the committee in February, this is more a function of geography than policy.  I am aware that in the meeting with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, a number of members raised the issue of military neutrality and I understand that this may be among the issues that the committee wishes to discuss this afternoon.  The Government is committed to the long-standing policy of military neutrality, which is characterised by non-participation in military alliances.  This commitment was publicly reaffirmed in the major statement of foreign policy priorities that we published in January of this year, entitled &ldquo;The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World&rdquo;, which states that &ldquo;our policy of military neutrality remains a core element of Irish foreign policy\". <\/p> <p>  This policy document sets out values which guide our foreign policy.  They are drawn from Article 29 of the Constitution which refers to principles including the ideals of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations and the pacific settlement of international disputes.  They are drawn also from the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  The policy highlights the importance of international peace and stability for Ireland, stating that &ldquo;supporting greater peace, security and development is also in our interest as a small country with an open economy in an ever more interconnected and uncertain world\".  Accordingly, we prioritise activities in support of these objectives, including our unbroken commitment over five decades to UN peacekeeping; promoting and protecting human rights; and our long-standing commitment to working through the Irish Aid programme for the eradication of poverty and hunger.<\/p><p> Our policy of military neutrality, accordingly, forms part and parcel of an outward-looking and proactive engagement in the international community.  The long-standing practice of permitting US and other foreign military aircraft to overfly Ireland and to land at Irish airports has been considered by successive Governments to be consistent with the policy of military neutrality.  We have never withdrawn or suspended the use of facilities at Shannon at any stage in the more than 50 years since arrangements were first put in place.  Ireland has not entered into a military alliance with the US or with any other country or organisation.  <\/p><p> The long-standing arrangements relating to Shannon should also be seen in the context of our strong co-operative relationship with the US.  We make Shannon available to the US and to other nations with which we have friendly relations.  Our relationship with the US has evolved from and been strengthened by the personal ties that bind our citizens.  Our Governments co-operate closely on many fronts.  We should not confuse the concept of military neutrality with political neutrality.  The US has been a major positive influence over many years in bringing about and sustaining peace in Northern Ireland.  We have engaged constructively with the US administration on interim measures to address the needs of the undocumented in the US.  The strong economic relations between the two countries in investment and trade represent a major driver for jobs and economic growth in Ireland.<\/p><p> Before I conclude, I again acknowledge the value and importance of the committee's consideration of the issues raised by the petition.  The system of regulation for foreign military aircraft was put in place many years ago and the order under which I am assigned primary responsibility dates from 1952.  My Department keeps arrangements under ongoing review and has revised policy and procedures incrementally in response to specific changes over time.  It is important to ensure that our approach keeps pace with changing circumstances and technology and to ensure that we have in place a system which can be further adapted to take account of future change.  In this context, the committee's work is timely and will be particularly helpful in identifying issues to be addressed.  I will be happy to ensure that all due account is taken of the committee's conclusions and recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015061700002#B00500","speaker":"1055","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434553200,"counter":3093,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister back, albeit on the other side of the fence in this case.  It is a very interesting petition that called on us to visit Shannon Airport.  The petitioners appeared before us and the Minister of Transport, Tourism and Sport also appeared before us to discuss the different elements of this.  We seem to be focusing on neutrality, which is the major question.  A number of issues were initially raised by the petitioner.  The petition asked to investigate the fact that we are allowing aircraft that carry military personnel and hardware, albeit sometimes in the hold of the aircraft, to land in Irish airports.  This points to the question around neutrality and goes back to the old adage if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck despite the fact that the Government says that our neutrality is not affected.  The petition argues that if one asked an independent observer from outside to look at the fact that we are allowing military aircraft to land in a civilian airport like Shannon, they would decide that it makes us complicit in whatever actions are being undertaken by those armies or the troops travelling through the airport.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said that there is a difference between political neutrality and military neutrality.  Could he tell us the legal definition of neutrality this Government stands by?  Neutrality is a word that is bandied around quite a lot on these types of issues so we need to be very specific because the nub of the issue is what the Government regards as neutrality.  Where is it defined in international law?  Are we bound by international treaties in respect of that definition?  I believe the Government said previously that we basically depend on the word of those Governments that the planes that are landing are doing what is said on the tin and that if they say there are no arms on board, we take their word for that.  The petitioner raised the question as to how we would ever know that if we never board those aircraft and never check this out.  One could argue that if I was stopped at a road traffic checkpoint and somebody asked me whether I had contraband or drugs in my car, the Garda certainly would not take my word for it if I said I did not have anything.  There would be a check of some sort.  What is the basis in international law for not checking these planes when they come to Shannon?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015061700002#C00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1434553200,"counter":3094,"content":"<p>There are about three questions there so we will deal with them and let the Minister respond.

In the strict sense of international law and practice, the question of neutrality does not really arise during peacetime but only arises during a state of war or conflict when the neutrality of the state would be embodied in any attitude of impartiality or otherwise towards a belligerent or a nation involved in conflict.  Ireland is one of a number of states that pursues a policy of neutrality or non-alignment in peacetime.  It is a matter for each of these states to determine the nature and characteristics of such a policy.  Our traditional policy of military neutrality, which has been pursued by successive governments, is perhaps characterised more than anything else by non-participation in any military alliance.  We do not engage actively or positively in conflict.  The Government reaffirmed its continued commitment in the policy statement earlier this year to which I referred in the context of my opening statement.<\/p> <p>  I want to refer to political neutrality.  Political neutrality in international affairs has never been part of Ireland's foreign policy tradition.  Ireland's approach to international security is characterised by our commitment to achieving collective security, principally through our membership of the UN, our contribution to conflict resolution and peace building, our work for human rights and development and our efforts to promote disarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.  These values continue to underpin and motivate our long and distinguished record of support for and participation in military operations that are sanctioned only by the UN Security Council in the cause of international security and peace.  Our non-membership of military alliances strengthens our credibility in areas that are experiencing conflict.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of whether the use of Shannon Airport by the US military increases the risk that the airport might at some stage be considered a target, I am aware, as are the members, of media reports referring to a possible targeting of Shannon Airport.  I do not wish to comment on that nor do I wish to fuel any speculation or heighten any anxieties.  As the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport stated when he appeared before this committee earlier this year, he has primary responsibility for the security arrangements at Shannon and all Irish airports.  These arrangements are kept under constant review.  Issues relating to national security are a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality but I can safely say that any threat levels are kept under constant review and surveillance.<\/p><p>The appropriate measures are taken from time to time.  I have no evidence to suggest that Shannon Airport is at risk or that it is being targeted by anybody wishing to engage in any acts of aggression against our country.<\/p><p> I am aware that the matter of inspections has exercised the joint committee.  It is an issue of great importance.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh used the analogy of having his car stopped and being asked whether there is any contraband on board.  He said he would not be surprised if his answer was not taken at face value.  The answer would be considered by the questioners in the context of their suspicion or otherwise.  I would see no reason for him not to be waved on if there were no suspicious circumstances, if he had made a forthright statement that he did not have anything to declare and if he was not engaging in any activity of a suspect or illegal nature.  I suggest that the Senator's analogy might work against him, as much as he tries to illustrate it as a comparison.<\/p><p> I reiterate that permission for military aircraft to overfly or land in the State is granted at all times subject to certain conditions.  These strict stipulations provide that the aircraft must be unarmed, must carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and must not engage in intelligence-gathering.  The flights in question must not form part of any military operation or exercise.  In accordance with international practice, foreign military aircraft passing through Ireland with the permission of the Government are not subject to routine searches or inspections.  The principle of sovereign immunity applies automatically to foreign state or military aircraft in the same that it applies to Irish State or military aircraft abroad.  For many years, Ireland accepted the generally recognised principles of international law as rules of conduct in its relations with other states.<\/p><p> Bilateral relations between friendly nations are founded on an element of mutual trust.  Both parties have an interest in maintaining that trust and not undermining it.  Details supplied to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by diplomatic missions are therefore accepted in good faith as being accurate.  Information provided to other states by Irish diplomatic missions seeking diplomatic clearance for flights undertaken by the Air Corps is similarly accepted by those countries as being at all times accurate.  That is the position in respect of military aircraft.  It is very important in the context of all these discussions and deliberations that we identify clearly the distinction between military and civil aircraft.  There is often an element of confusion in the public press and in many debates regarding the clearly defined distinction between a military aircraft on the one hand and a civil aircraft on the other hand.<\/p><p> I assure the committee that civil aircraft are subject to the normal inspection regime, which provides for the inspection of aircraft in the interests of security and the safety of persons, among other reasons.  This is where I consider the car analogy used by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh to be quite appropriate.  If there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence has been committed, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has statutory powers of entry, search and arrest available to it.  In the circumstances set out by the Senator, we take the assurances in good faith.  We have done so in the past and we will continue to do so into the future unless we have clear grounds for believing otherwise.  We do not have such grounds at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015061700002#C01100","speaker":"1055","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434553200,"counter":3104,"content":"<p>I do not want to hog the available speaking time, as many other people are waiting to come in.  I suggest the people who made the petition would say they have provided a great deal of evidence of people who were tracked on flights that went through Shannon Airport and ended up fighting on behalf of foreign armies in war situations.  Many people, possibly outside this country, might see that as a form of aiding and abetting.  The Minister has said that Ireland is not actively engaged as a State in any war, but it is possible that people outside this country - the Minister has previously referred to them as \"belligerents\" - would see our willingness to allow airplanes to refuel and land here as aiding and abetting attacks on their compatriots.  That would be one of the things I would mention in that context.<\/p> <p>  We have been told that there are arms and explosives on some airplanes, albeit in the holds of civilian aircraft.  The details of that are logged and set out on the manifests for the flights in question.  It is not correct to say there are no arms or explosives on airplanes going through the airport.  Certain people, particularly the petitioners, would feel that the pure volume of soldiers on the flights that have come through the airport would make our neutrality questionable.  That is certainly the view of some people outside Ireland.  What is the benefit to us of allowing these airplanes to land?  If we want to copperfasten our reputation and make sure we are seen in the international arena as totally neutral, surely we could ask these airplanes not to land in Shannon Airport.  We were told in Shannon Airport that this is not a money issue as the amount of money involved is not huge.  One of the questions to be raised concerned whether the airport is making a fortune out of these airplanes landing there.  Why not let them land in other airports, such as military airports?  There are concerns about security issues, especially given that an 80 year old woman was able to breach the perimeter of the aircraft and get onto the runway.  As we know, questions have been raised about security in Shannon Airport.  If an outside grouping sought to threaten seriously the airport, or any of the people on the flights coming through the airport, it might well be able to do so.  I do not imagine that any of those groupings would ever indicate in advance that they intended to act in such a manner.  This issue needs to be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015061700002#D00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1434553200,"counter":3105,"content":"<p>The Minister does not need to address the Senator's comments because he has already responded to him.

I ask committee members to appreciate the clear distinction between civil and military aircraft.  In his earlier contribution, Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about military aircraft.  When he referred in his supplementary contribution to certain arms on board airplanes, he was speaking specifically about civil aircraft, which are prohibited from carrying weapons or munitions through Irish airspace unless an exemption has been obtained in advance from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  When the Department is considering requests for exemptions made by commercial carriers, it seeks the advice of other Departments.  As a matter of policy, the Department recommends against the carriage of items such as cluster munitions, anti-personnel landmines and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.  The Department generally recommends against the carriage of missiles, bombs and rockets.  Often it does not object to the carriage of items such as unloaded personal weapons, small arms and ammunition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015061700002#D00400","speaker":"1055"},{"type":"speech","time":1434553200,"counter":3107,"content":"<p>So there are arms on board some of these airplanes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015061700002#D00500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1434553200,"counter":3108,"content":"<p>Yes, there are times-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015061700002#D00600","speaker":"1055"},{"type":"speech","time":1434553200,"counter":3109,"content":"<p>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport made us aware of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015061700002#D00700","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1434553200,"counter":3110,"content":"<p>The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport would be fully aware of these arrangements as they occur from time to time.  The second point I would like to make is in response to the Senator's comments about the benefits to Shannon Airport of this activity.  I am casting aside for the moment the very important difference between the exercise of our military neutrality and the exercise of what can be described by the Government as political neutrality.<\/p><p>In that regard, let me say that in terms of our political neutrality or our politics, I accept there are members around this table with whom I will not reach agreement on this issue and I believe the Senator is one of them.  We have a different concept of our relations, for example, with the United States in terms of our political engagement and our important relationship.  I make no apologies for that.  It is very important having regard to the special relationship which exists between our respective jurisdictions over a long number of years, indeed over centuries. <\/p><p> There are aspects of this relationship on which some people would have a different view.  However, leaving those political considerations aside, and I am not underestimating their importance, I want to mention briefly the benefits in terms of the use of Shannon Airport.  It is important that we recognise that there has been a significant downturn in the numbers of troops transiting Shannon.  Nonetheless, the transit of military or civilian personnel contributes to the overall sustainability of the airport.  Last year, 70,000 troops passed through Shannon.  My Department has supported the efforts of the Shannon Group to increase the traffic and the revenue at the airport.  However, it has been made clear that the transit of any foreign military aircraft must be, and always is, in accordance with the strictest of conditions, which I mentioned in my opening remarks.  The Shannon Group employs almost 300 people and it is estimated that a further 1,600 people are employed by 40 aviation-related companies in the Shannon region.  There are benefits to Shannon and the region by the transit, as mentioned by the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015061700002#D00800","speaker":"1055","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434553200,"counter":3112,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending.

On the background explanation for that reduction, can the Minister advise us as to why that might be so?  The other question I was going to ask concerns the permission to land at Shannon.

Again, it is important that we retain a clear distinction between military overflights and landings, on the one hand, and civilian landings that may have military personnel, on the other hand.  In terms of the military overflights, which was the exact question, the numbers are falling.  The number of requests in 2013 was 50% below the total for ten years ago and there was a further reduction of 25% last year over the figures for 2013.  Approximately two thirds of notifications and requests for overflights received in 2014 related directly to flights and aircraft of the United States.  Some 12 requests to overfly Irish territory were refused in 2014 on the basis they did not meet the strict conditions that the aircraft was unarmed or carrying no arms or ammunition, as I stated earlier.<\/p> <p>  Annual numbers of landing requests fluctuate.  It would be unwise of me to speculate as to the reasons.  We deal with the numbers as they occur.  The average number of landing requests by military aircraft in the past four years, between 2010 and 2014, was something more than 700.  Of those 700, an estimated 85% of those related to aircraft of the United States of America.  From the latest figures we have, comparing the first quarters of 2015 and 2014, the total number of requests and notifications is down one third whereas the number of US overflights have more than halved over the same period.

We visited Shannon Airport and met the management of the airport and the senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na responsible for the security of the airport.  They were helpful in clarifying matters.  In terms of the civil and military aircraft, the point is that approximately 1.2 million US troops came through Shannon on mostly civil aircraft in recent years.  Some were going to Iraq and some were on their way to Afghanistan, no doubt to theatres of war.  In terms of the war in Iraq, that did not have UN sanction, which is something on which we would place heavy import in our deliberations.  The Minister mentioned political neutrality.  The difficulty with these 1.2 million troops, and some of them going to a theatre of war that was not facilitated or supported by the UN or a UN Security Council resolution, is that they all would have been carrying sidearms, perhaps not on their person but certainly on the plane, and all of them would have had at least a rifle.

It is important to state, as I have done but I will say it again for clarification, that civil aircraft are prohibited from carrying weapons through Irish airspace and airports unless an exemption has been obtained in advance from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p> <p>  Various issues require detailed consideration before a decision will be made.   As a matter of policy, the Department recommends against the carriage of such items on such planes.  In 2014, we recommended against approval of 19 applications for exemptions.  These related mainly to applications where there was a proposed carriage of munitions of war.  As far as the troops that the Chairman mentioned are concerned, in terms of the numbers it is clear that the vast majority of such transit arrangements involve civil aircraft transiting through Irish airspace or airports.  We do not regard that as being inconsistent with a policy of military neutrality.  The granting to the United States and its allies of overflight permissions and facilities and the provision of landing facilities at Shannon by no means constitute an act of participation or, indeed, any participation in war within the meaning of our Constitution, in particular Article 28.3 thereof.<\/p> <p>  It is important, again, to state that there is a clear distinction between the legality of Ireland granting these permissions and providing these facilities, on the one hand, and the legality in international law of the proposed armed conflict in Iraq on the other.<\/p><p>There are different and distinct legal issues involved here.  Legal opinion is divided and there are doubts as to the legality of a proposed armed conflict in Iraq in any event.  The Deputy mentioned a UN resolution, but the absence of a further UN resolution authorising military action does not determine the US legal position is not sustainable.  At all times, I want to keep the distinction clear between political and military neutrality and between civil and military aircraft.  Deputy Kirk raised an important point in regard to military aircraft, namely, the distinction between a military overflight and a military landing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015061700002#E00500","speaker":"1055","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434553200,"counter":3117,"content":"<p>I remind members there is a vote in the D&aacute;il, but as the Minister must leave in ten minutes, at 5 p.m., I would like to continue and complete the meeting.

I take a somewhat different perspective.  We are looking at the word \"neutrality\" in a simplistic fashion, considering world politics and world order.  It is like we are saying, \"but for this, we are neutral\".  We are quick to comment on what is going on all over the world.  We may not send out armies, but if we were a military power, we might do so.  Think of Libya and many other countries involved in what I see as a civil strife.  We took a particular view on these and to what was going on in Libya, where there has been a change of regime.  However, I do not know how much better matters are there.<\/p> <p>  Looking closer to home, there is a very close relationship between the US military and our Defence Forces.  There is considerable co-operation between them, with training classes and exchanges where best practice and techniques are exchanged.  Some of our Defence Forces study at the US Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas and some US army officers attend the military college at the Curragh.  There is also a US Defense Attach&eacute;, Lieutenant Colonel Sean Cosden, based in Dublin.  Therefore, we already have close ties with the US forces.  However, what we choose to do is to be involved in peacekeeping, while the Americans choose otherwise.  Therefore, the situation is nuanced.  It is not a question of saying we are not neutral because we work with the Americans.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said there are certain protocols in regard to inspections and that only where there is a suspicion that people are operating outside the permissions granted would there be an inspection.  I believe that is fair.  If people are entitled to carry certain hand-guns or other weapons, that is part of the permission granted.  Much of the consternation regarding Shannon stems from anti-American, anti-capitalist and anti-everything the US represents sentiment.  The idea has been expressed that Shannon Airport would be a prime target here, but perhaps it might be Google or somewhere else.  We do not need to focus on big names or large pieces of infrastructure.  One only needs to look to France, where a bakery was the target or to what happened at the Charlie Hebdo office.<\/p> <p>  We are living in a world where we must face the reality that it does not matter whether one professes to be neutral.  Think of what happened in the shopping mall in Westlands, Nairobi, where rebels connected with al-Shabaab, which is connected to al-Qaeda, shot people they believed were Christians.  Many white westerners fit the description of Christians, but rebels do not care whether or not they are churchgoers or believe in God.  If they say they are not Muslim, they are shot.  That is the reality of what happened in Nairobi and of the world we face.<\/p> <p>  I do not agree with the notion that the Americans are somehow to blame for attacks on the west, on Europe or on Ireland.  That notion ignores the evidence that in many countries where there is civil war and trouble among the people, the regimes in power, whether legitimate or unofficial kill their own people.  They are not just coming to the west and killing people for the sake of getting headlines, they are killing their own people.  Over 100,000 Christians were killed last year and I found the report on that very disturbing and wrote to the Minister about it.  Not just in the west, but in countries where Christians have lived traditionally, Christians are being killed just because they are Christian and much of this is happening in Muslim countries.<\/p> <p>  We are living in a world where in the comfort of our democracy we forget what it is like not to have rights and freedom.  Think of the sort of regimes there are, such as that in Palestine and of the sort of regime that purportedly represents Muslims who are being oppressed by the Israelis.<\/p><p>One would not write home about many of them and recommend them as a regime for anyone to live under.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015061700002#F02200","speaker":"1070","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434553200,"counter":3139,"content":"<p>I have given the Deputy a good run, but I just want to get a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015061700002#G00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1434553200,"counter":3140,"content":"<p>We have had three.

We have given 50 years of unbroken service.  Recently UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, visited our acclaimed UN training school at the Curragh.  That highlights the quality of our training.  There are many international participants in courses that are conducted there from time to time, including, on occasion, US personnel.  They learn about international law, human rights and best practice in the area of peacekeeping, all of which is important to Ireland and none of which impinges on our traditional policy of military neutrality.<\/p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised an important point regarding provisions for the inspection of civil aircraft and the issue of troops being carried, for the most part, on civilian aircraft rather than on military aircraft.

Section 66C(2) clarifies that section 6A of the Data Protection Act 1988, in other words, the principal Act, which relates to the processing of personal data that is likely to cause damage or distress, which is the issue Deputy Colreavy raises, does not apply where the processing is necessary to undertake a legitimate postcode activity.  This would cover, for example, a case where an owner or occupier of a property disagrees with the matching of his or her address to an Eircode, in particular, the routing key element of the Eircode, despite the accuracy of any such matching.  Section 66C(2) is, therefore, an essential provision in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  To address directly the issue raised by the Deputy, section 7 of the main Data Protection Act already provides that data controllers and processors owe a duty of care to data subjects, which duty relates to the collection of and dealings with personal data.  The provisions of the principal Act apply in respect of breaches of the rights contained therein.  Section 30 of the Data Protection Act provides that the Data Protection Commissioner may bring summary proceedings for an offence under the Act, while section 31 of the Act provides for penalties for offences under the Act.<\/p><p>It is neither appropriate nor necessary to provide for offences here, new offences as it were, for breaches of data protection rights when such provisions already exist in the Data Protection Act.  It is not a case that we are omitting enforcement provisions because what we are putting into the Act, if the committee agrees to the amendments, are new provisions, which will have, as it were, the protection of the enforcement provisions that are already in the 1988 Act.  We do not need new enforcement measures or new penalties to cover breaches of the new provisions we are putting into the legislation because breaches of those new provisions will still fall to be dealt with under the original Act.  Therefore, if a citizen is aggrieved in respect of some breach of these new provisions, they will still have the benefit of the enforcement mechanisms that are already included in the principal Act.  There have never been any issues raised, of which I am aware, in regard to the adequacy of the enforcement measures in the Data Protection Acts that made the principal Acts.  It is always open to the Oireachtas and to the Deputy to raise the issue of whether the enforcement measures in the general Data Protection Acts are sufficient and adequate.  That could be an issue in the future if the Deputy or anyone else believed they were not adequate but no one has ever raised the issue that the existing enforcement mechanisms are not adequate.  <\/p><p> In regard to the Deputy's second point, which relates to the contractor and the complaints procedure, a code of practice has been put in place and the contractor has had good contact with the Data Protection Commissioner about it and the commissioner has had an opportunity to have an input into the new code of practice dealing with the complaints procedure under this amendment Bill.  As I understand it and as I have been advised, the Data Protection Commissioner has given her input into that code of practice and on the basis and understanding that her input is incorporated into the code of practice by the contractor, the Data Protection Commissioner will be amenable to agreeing to that code of practice.<\/p><p> We are not supplanting the role of the Data Protection Commissioner,   Someone could still make a complaint to the Data Protection Commissioner under the Data Protection Acts.  We are not hollowing out any powers from the Data Protection Commissioner.  At the initial phase, if that is an accurate way of describing it, one will be able to make a complaint under this new complaints procedure, but that will not take away one's right to make a complaint in the normal way to the Data Protection Commission.  Those are my responses to the Deputy's comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015061700002#B00800","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":3180,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Colreavy pressing the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015061700002#C00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":3181,"content":"<p>May I respond to the Minister's points?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015061700002#C00300","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":3182,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015061700002#C00400","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":3183,"content":"<p>I understand what the Minister is saying but corporate lawyers will have great fun with this one.

There could be a potential mushrooming of unwanted data being sent to people's houses and the processing could take place in China or India rather than in Dublin or Mullingar.  The precedent of contractors making decisions that would normally be within the realm of the Data Protection Commissioner is a dangerous one.  It needs to be thought out much more.

That is not true.  It is simply not the case.  The Data Protection Commissioner's powers under the principal Act remain and they are considerable.  Absolutely nothing is being taken away or nothing is being done in this amendment Bill which will in any way reduce the existing powers that the Data Commission has under the primary legislation.  Arguably, one could say that this is an additional layer and provides an additional opportunity for an aggrieved person to make a complaint.  A robust complaints procedure is being inserted in the legislation which can be availed of by individuals who feel aggrieved for any of the reasons the Deputy mentioned or others, but they will also still have the right to go the Data Protection Commissioner in the event of a breach of the Data Protection Acts.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the extra-territorial effect of this legislation, it is a difficult issue as to whether legislation not only in this area but in any area could have extra-territorial effect.  If the breach is taking place within the jurisdiction, then the rights that an individual citizen has to make or pursue a complaint are there.  The Deputy is right in that if a breach takes place abroad and if it is in regard to data here, an activity here, or an address or personal data here, then all the rights that would be associated with any individual citizen are open to be exercised by him or her.<\/p> <p> I hesitate to say that I do not think the concerns the Deputy has raised about complaints procedures are valid because I do not want to criticise him in that sense, but I do not think there is an issue here.  A complaints procedure is being put in place for the protection of individuals but people still also have the right to go to the Data Protection Commissioner and that right is not being supplanted by this provision in any way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015061700002#C00700","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":3186,"content":"<p>Is the Minister specifying that within this legislation because that provision is not set out under the complaints procedure measure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015061700002#C00800","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":3187,"content":"<p>I do not understand the Deputy's point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015061700002#C00900","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1434529800,"counter":3188,"content":"<p>There is no section in the legislation that points out the right of a person to go to the Data Protection Commissioner.

The complaints procedure set out in the Bill refers to the process that owners or occupiers of property can follow with a postcode-related complaint.  The complaints procedure is set out in the postcode contractor's code of practice and, as I indicated earlier, the postcode contractor has consulted the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in the drafting of the code of practice, and that office has made a number of observations and recommendations, which the postcode contractor is happy to accept.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has stated that it will approve the code of practice once these changes have been incorporated.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, the Data Protection Act provides powers for the Data Protection Commissioner to investigate complaints and enforce compliance with the Act.  I made the point earlier about the powers of the Data Protection Commissioner.  The provisions of the Data Protection Acts apply to any postcode-related complaints which the commissioner may receive.  I emphasise that there is nothing to prevent persons complaining to the Data Protection Commissioner where there is a perceived breach of the Data Protection Act in the context of the postcodes project.  It is therefore neither necessary nor appropriate to set out investigative functions for the Data Protection Commissioner in this Bill, given that there is a statutory regime already in place.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has been consulted extensively during the drafting stages of the Bill and has at no stage indicated that the provisions set out in the 1988 Act are inadequate, as I noted earlier.

It is good to be back at the committee to answer members' questions.  I am very pleased to appear before the committee to discuss the outcome of the Transport Council in Luxemburg on 11 June.  I attended the meeting and represented our country and our interests at the session.  I will go through the main agenda items and mention the items covered at the Council meeting as any other business.  As the Chairman stated, the Council was dominated by discussions on air passengers' rights and on the fourth railway package.<\/p> <p>  The committee has previously discussed air passengers' rights.  The proposal aims to promote the interest of air passengers by ensuring air carriers effectively comply with a high level of air passenger protection during travel disruptions.  At the same time, the proposal intends to take into account the financial implications for the air transport sector.  At the Council, the Presidency introduced a progress report and referred to the significant progress that had been made on clarification of extraordinary circumstances and cabin baggage entitlements.  However, agreement was not possible concerning connecting flights and the threshold for compensation.<\/p> <p>  The thresholds for the payment of financial compensation to passengers for delayed or cancelled flights and how connecting flights will be dealt with are the two sticking points holding up the revision of the EU regulation on air passengers' rights.  Few member states intervened in the debate, but all the comments concerned these two areas.  As committee members appreciate, the overall challenge is to strike a balance between passenger protection and the interests of the industry.<\/p> <p>  Ireland considers the proposals for compensation for missed connecting flights as currently drafted are anti-consumer.  The focus should be on ensuring adequate care and assistance is given to passengers affected and on encouraging airline behaviour that will ultimately assist passengers in pursuing their original objective, that is, getting to their final destination.  Our concern is that focusing on compensation could result in adverse airline behaviour that would not be in the consumers' interest.  It is possible that airlines would either increase fares to compensate for the higher risk associated with such flights and-or significantly increase transfer times at hub airports, neither of which, in our view, would be in the passengers' interest.<\/p> <p>  Ireland along with Italy, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom spoke about the need for balance between industry and consumers.  I said that while Ireland is broadly supportive of the proposal, we continue to support the Commission's original proposal for five, nine and 12 hours as trigger points for compensation thresholds in cases of cancellation or delayed flights.  I informed the Council that Ireland does not agree that compensation should be payable after a three-hour delay and feels the shorter time would render it more likely that a carrier will cancel a flight.<\/p> <p>  As regards compensation for missed connecting flights, I advised that Ireland is against any such compensation and feels the focus should be on ensuring adequate care and assistance is given to passengers affected by missed connecting flights and on encouraging airline behaviour that will ultimately assist the passengers in pursuing their original objective, that is, getting to their final destination.  I also set out the Irish position on the question of the use of the term \"flights\" as opposed to \"journey\" in the new regulation.  Ireland supports a reference to \"flights\" to have a more balanced approach and make the payment of compensation for cancellation or delay specific to an individual flight and not a series of flights.  Austria and Spain spoke about the need to protect consumers' rights.  Luxemburg intervened to say it hoped to bring proposals to COREPER during its term of Presidency which commences next month.<\/p> <p>  The fourth railway package consists of six proposals aimed at removing the remaining barriers to the completion of the single European railway area.  They fall into two groups, namely, the technical pillar and the market pillar.  The technical pillar reinforces harmonisation of interoperability and safety arrangements and extends the role of the European Railway Agency.  The three proposals in the technical pillar have been politically agreed within the Council of Ministers.  The Presidency is engaging with the Parliament with a view to reaching a second reading agreement.  The technical measures of the fourth railway package do not give rise to difficulties for Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The essential elements of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals under the market pillar are the opening of the domestic passenger markets to competition by granting open access right to all EU railway undertakings; the introduction of mandatory tendering for public service contracts; and changing the regulatory framework for the governance of railway infrastructure with a view to legal separation of the infrastructure management and service provision functions.  While some member states see these reforms as an opportunity for growth, others, such as Ireland, have fundamental concerns that these reforms would have very negative impacts on the provision of rail services in their countries.  We have aligned with seven other like-minded small member states, namely, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Slovakia, Greece and Croatia.  This group maintains that member states whose rail markets form less than 1% of the EU rail market should be allowed to continue direct award of public contract services.  This is the most efficient way for Ireland, and other small member states, to provide rail services. <\/p> <p>  At Council, the Presidency introduced a progress report on the political pillar of the fourth railway package.  The Commission noted that the key outstanding issue on the public service obligation aspect was around exemptions from compulsory direct award of public service obligation contracts.  The Commission disagreed with an exemption based on market size, that is, 1% of passenger kilometres, but voiced support for a Netherlands proposal of a performance-based exemption which would allow all member states to continue direct awards based on the contract being performance based.<\/p> <p>  The group of small member states, including Ireland, which favour the 1% proposal spoke in support, with the exception of Luxemburg given its status as incoming Presidency.  I intervened in the discussions to record that Ireland along with other smaller member states have fundamental concerns that these reforms would have very negative impacts on the provision of rail services in some countries.  I pointed out the Irish rail sector is small and geographically isolated with low traffic densities and is operated under a single public service contract.<\/p><p>Given these features, Ireland continues to strongly support the so-called &ldquo;1% provision&rdquo; which would allow small rail markets to continue direct award of public contract services.  This is the most efficient way for us to provide our rail services and there is no evidence of the scale of benefits that may result from competitive tendering of PSO contracts in small markets.  I asked that these specific challenges for small markets be accounted for in any final compromise.  Luxembourg noted it will put in all efforts possible to reach agreement by October and I expect a solution will be found which will not pose risks to the rail sectors of member states with small rail markets.<\/p><p> On governance, the key issue is for member states with separated structures not wanting additional burdens for their rail companies.  Member states see the governance problem as being restricted to those member states with integrated companies.  The Commission stated that ensuring equal footing of vertically separated and fully integrated structures was the challenge.  I intervened to say that our viewpoint is that with continued direct award of PSO services, functional separation of the railway undertaking and infrastructure manager, accompanied by strong regulatory oversight are sufficient to ensure fair play and transparency within the Irish market.<\/p><p> The inland waterways item dealt with a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels and repealing Directive 2006\/87\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.  The Council adopted a general approach on the proposal, which is a recasting of a directive currently in force.  The proposal was discussed in detail at the Council's shipping working party between January and May this year.  The aim of the proposal is to replace a previous directive with one that allows the annexes with technical parts to be referenced separately, so that they can be more easily amended, in order to aid progress towards a single, uniform set of technical standards between the EU and the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine.  The proposal will have no implications for Ireland, since Ireland is one of the member states not addressed by the proposed directive and will, therefore, not be required to transpose or implement it.  Ireland has deliberately chosen to stay outside the scope of the directive, given that there is no inter-connected commercial inland waterway transport in Ireland, and Irish inland waterways are not navigable for the purposes or scale of the commercial traffic envisaged in the proposed directive.  Although Ireland is not included within the scope of the proposed directive, Ireland operates high safety standards on our inland waterways.<\/p><p> Information was given on a number of items under any other business including: the main conclusions of the interim evaluation of the EU road safety policy framework 2011-2020; the transport infrastructure financing, including an update on the first call for proposals under the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF; the outcome of the Asia Europe, ASEM, transport meeting; the Shift2Rail joint undertaking; and the incoming Presidency's work programme in the field of transport.  Again, I thank the Chairman for the invitation to discuss the Transport Council and I welcome any questions that members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015061700002#B00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434535200,"counter":3231,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the presentation.  His approach to air passenger rights is appropriate.  He has set out a balanced approach to examine the needs of the passenger more than the compensation.  Compensation should be a last resort and only for the purpose of ensuring airlines do their best to ensure their services are on time and treat passengers appropriately in the event of an unavoidable delay.  We do not want airlines, as they did in the past, to cancel flights that do not having sufficient passengers and where there is a flight an hour or two later, in order to enhance their cost base.  I think and hope the Minister&rsquo;s approach deals with it and I hope the appropriate protections can be put in place to prevent lower cost carriers which are attempting to provide shuttle services in certain markets from using the hour cancellation to improve their cost base.  This is where the three-hour provision is important.  In principle, I support what the Minister is doing.  It is about the onward connection and ensuring people reach their destinations.  Nobody sets out on a journey with a view to claiming compensation, although I am often taken by the fact that, in the event of the overbooking of flights, some travellers, particularly in the US, are happy to stay an extra night in a city if the airline puts them up and they can take an early morning flight.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is right to push on the 1% in the railway package.  Unfortunately, we are small and burdened with high costs and very considerable subvention.  I see nothing in the fourth railway package that would be in any way helpful in addressing the challenges that already exist in our rail network.  It is for another day how we discuss it and continue to invest in our rail network.  Is the Shannon Estuary considered an inland waterway?  It is salt water, not fresh water.  It is the only one that might have a commercial entity.  On the basis that it is seen as an estuary, I guess it is probably not considered an inland waterway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015061700002#C00200","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1434535200,"counter":3232,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his points.  He is correct that we want a compensation programme that encourages airlines to continue to do their best to get people to destinations on time.  The original proposal from the Commission on a threshold of five hours and above strikes the right balance and we support it.  We share a common analysis on the railway package.  We do not have the interoperability concerns of markets that are located on the Continent of Europe.  Given our market size and structure, some elements of the proposal would not be positive or allow the development of our rail market in the way we hope and for which we are planning.  The answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the Shannon Estuary is, as he suspected, &ldquo;No&rdquo;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015061700002#C00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1434535200,"counter":3233,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  Regarding air passengers' rights, I see the issue of the time factor in terms of people hanging around airports.  I support the idea that looking for five, nine or 12 hours seems to be much stronger than a three hour gap.  We have all spent many hours in airports and for various reasons, things can happen.  If it were to change, prices would rise and I am very fearful of that.  Regarding the fourth railway package, the Minister is not in favour of mandatory tendering of the PSO.  There is a constant drive from Europe to take it away from different countries and it is very worrying.  It is a drive towards privatisation and it seems to be coming from the EU.  Although we have always argued that we want to be exempt from it, it is constantly pushed on us and it is very worrying.  The recent tendering of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann routes seems to be the result of this pressure from Europe.<\/p><p>Members of the European Parliament should be fighting our corner regarding where we are with this tendering process.  Most European countries use some type of PSO and we are among the lowest users of PSO.  Is it the case that other European countries are in favour of retaining the PSO and do not favour mandatory tendering?  I would have expected Belgium and other countries to have opposed this process.  They have huge rail infrastructure and if we were making that argument I would have expected to have received support from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015061700002#C00400","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434535200,"counter":3235,"content":"<p>I will begin with the Deputy's last question about the general views regarding PSO funding across Europe.  It would be fair to say that virtually all member states understand the role PSO funding can play in meeting transport needs, as there is wide acceptance that the private market will not deliver all the transport needs that societies have.  The diversity of views, however, is with regard to how organisations can apply for PSO funding.  There would be a body of thinking which contends that private sector companies should have the ability to apply for the use of PSO funding as much as any established state company.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy began by making the point about a drive to privatisation.  All of this is a consequence, and is a very large dimension, of the Single Market.  There are Irish companies abroad that are winning business and employing people, both at home and abroad, as a result of how they have made great use of the Single Market.  If we are seeking to benefit from the Single Market in other countries, and Irish companies do unbelievably well at that, there is an expectation, not only legal but political, that we should make that same Single Market available to organisations and companies within Ireland, just as Irish companies are able to benefit from it in other European countries.  It is the other side of that coin.<\/p> <p>  The question then becomes how we can manage that, and I realise we have a difference of opinion on this.  This is where national governments of member states can play a big role, by making sure it is managed in a way that still reflects the circumstances of the transport system within a country.  That is the reason we are not opting for a tendering of the entire bus market in a mandatory fashion.  We are making it open to the National Transport Authority to determine what percentage of the bus market should be tendered and it has determined that at this stage it should be only 10%.  With regard to the rail market, we are taking a very strong approach which reflects the fact that our rail market is fundamentally different in size and structure from those of other European countries.<\/p> <p>  While we accept that we have an obligation to comply with the Single Market, and it is in our interest to comply with it because it is one of the reasons our economy is beginning to recover so strongly, alongside that, through the work that I do, we try to ensure that our participation in that Single Market reflects the fact that our transport markets are very different from other transport markets across Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015061700002#D00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1434535200,"counter":3236,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement.  The brief we have received indicates that there was much debate about very important issues.  I wish to focus on two.  One is slightly related to the main one about rail transport.  I assume this is the TEN-T package.  To put it in context, a directive relating to rail transport was brought before the committee a couple of months ago and I asked for a clarification of it.  If memory serves, the clarification I received said that it was to encourage further development and investment in rail infrastructure across member states.  I am sorry I do not have the directive with me and I appreciate that I am throwing this at the Minister when there are so many directives coming forward.  However, the reason I raise it is to give a context for a question which relates to a submission the committee received some months ago from the promoters of the western rail corridor.  That corridor is an ongoing topic for the committee.<\/p> <p>  The Minister will be well aware that there are competing interests in respect of that rail corridor.  On the one hand, the group we met is promoting, initially at least, an expansion of the rail corridor to accommodate increased freight traffic.  The group showed us a map of Ireland which indicated that if the rail corridor were to be developed for rail freight from the north west down to Limerick and then to link up with Waterford, it would be more efficient than the current transit process which obliges one to transport freight across the country to Dublin and then take it from Dublin to the southern and south-eastern ports.  We received a reply from the Minister that due to lack of funding, rather than lack of interest, there were no plans to develop the rail corridor.  In light of what appears to be an ongoing promotion of the usage of rail transport, does the Minister have some thoughts on that?  For example, a meeting is due to take place and Luxembourg has indicated that one of its priorities will be to meet the common objective of promoting rail transport throughout the Union.<\/p> <p>  I believe the development of the western rail corridor for freight, initially, is at least an answerable cause.  I am sure the Minister is very pleased that the most recent figures published by the national transport company show a significant increase in user traffic on Dublin Bus, the Luas, the DART, on the bus expressways across the country and also in rail traffic.  Those who use our rail system at present will agree that it is generally an excellent service, despite some glitches at peak times for the commuter system.<\/p> <p>  Bearing all of that in mind, perhaps the Department should give serious consideration to that and whether Europe would be able to help out financially, if it is keen on promoting the use of rail.  In view of the Luxembourg priorities, there might be some way through the Minister's ongoing discussions at European level that the EU could assist the Irish Government if it were to embark on the development of the western rail corridor, for example.  I am not referring to passenger traffic in this context but to freight traffic.  The case that was made to us was unanswerable in terms of efficiency, cost effectiveness and usage.  I do not wish to labour the point but I have a specific interest in that.<\/p> <p>  My final point is brief.  Tomorrow we are meeting with a Northern Ireland Assembly committee on tourism development in the country.  While great strides have been made in ensuring there is access across the island, there is a black spot in the west and north west in terms of the road infrastructure.  The road from Galway through Mayo, Sligo, into Enniskillen and then north requires more funding.  In fairness, this Government and the previous Government provided funding on a piecemeal basis.  I do not suggest it should be a dual carriageway, but there certainly should be continuing funding for it.<\/p><p>I would hope that in the North-South Ministerial Council meetings he would also press for the Northern authorities to try to extend their road network from Belfast going west into Enniskillen.  Until it hits the Ballygawley roundabout, the route from Enniskillen leaves a lot to be desired and the Northern Executive appears not to have spent any money on that.  I appreciate that the Minister cannot say at the North-South Ministerial Council meeting that we want Northern Ireland to spend more money only for them to ask why we are not spending more in the South.  I refer to that particular section of access from a tourist point of view because much of the tourist traffic going to the west goes to Galway, Mayo and Sligo, and then to Donegal.  If there was an improved network, particularly the Sligo to Enniskillen route, it would be helpful in terms of increasing tourist traffic North and South.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015061700002#D00300","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434535200,"counter":3238,"content":"<p>With regard to the road and rail freight points Senator Mooney has put to me, I will begin by dealing with the point about the upgrade of the roads to which he refers.  We are constantly working on that to try to make an increase in the funding available for the upgrading of our existing road network.  I accept that, due to the cutbacks in maintenance in recent years, many parts of our road network are creating difficulty for tourism.  We also know that continued investment in our road network is an important element of road safety.  While I cannot give the Senator a specific commitment on the road to which he refers, I can assure him that in terms of the work in which I am involved in my Department, we are looking to maintain and then increase the funding available for road maintenance and road network improvements.  My choice would be to work to upgrade existing roads as opposed to building new roads and other pieces of infrastructure only to find out a few years from now that we do not have adequate funding to maintain them.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's point about freight, I will respond by making three specific points.  TEN-T funding is, and has been, an important and helpful source of funding for our rail network.  It has also played an important role, as I am sure the Senator is aware, in regard to our port development but in terms of rail development, it has played a role in signalling works we are looking to do across the city centre and also how we would upgrade existing parts of our rail network as part of the entire DART underground project, which looks to increase our ability to pull more carriages into Dublin at higher frequency, thereby providing an increase in the performance of much of the national rail network.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's point about the western rail corridor, the real challenge I have is trying to fund the rail network currently open.  We have the funding in place for that but it is extremely unlikely that in the near future, we will be able to fund new rail lines for which there is demand.  However, in the interim, in terms of those areas in which there is an interest, I am committed to not to doing anything on those parts of land that would stop us at a point in the future turning it back into a rail line if there was a demand for that rail line to be used.<\/p> <p>  That leads me to the third point.  In terms of the freight opportunity to which the Senator refers, Irish Rail is currently looking at the freight capacity that might be needed in our economy in the future to determine the role rail could play in that regard.  Irish Rail's freight business has changed hugely in recent years.  The Senator will be aware of the reasons for that, one of which is that our road network has got so much better and has provided an alternative way of moving the same material around, but Irish Rail is now examining the freight opportunities that could be there in the context of an economy that is changing.<\/p> <p>  For example, and this is something Deputy O'Donovan will be aware of, one of the aspects it is considering is whether anything could be done that would link up our ports network with a rail network, specifically in regard to freight.  That comes back to a question the Senator asked me.  That is the kind of work we would then be applying for support for under the European Union's TEN-T programme.  That is broadly where we stand on the rail network, the freight opportunities for it and for the western rail corridor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015061700002#E00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1434535200,"counter":3239,"content":"<p>I am very grateful to the Minister for his clarification and I appreciate the demands on funding.  I have no doubt whatsoever that most of us would agree there is a need to maintain our existing road network.  Representatives of the National Roads Authority appeared before this committee and told us there is something like a &euro;300 million shortfall in terms of maintenance funding alone, and I appreciate the challenges facing the Minister, but the submission made by the representatives of the western rail corridor addressed that issue.

Ultimately, we will have to examine how best moneys can be spent on different parts of our infrastructure to ensure at least some of those needs are met.

As an island country, we are totally dependent on our ports.  In the context of our earlier discussion around TEN-T, in my estimation three Departments have responsibility for ports to some degree or another.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government deals with foreshore issues, on which legislation has been promised but in respect of which nothing has yet happened.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine deals with issues around pier and harbour infrastructure development and marine activities.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport also has particular responsibilities in this area.  The result is a disparate set-up, which may be a throw back to how governance in relation to ports was dealt with previously.  If we are serious about the creation of hubs of employment, this issue needs to be addressed.  Dublin Port Company, which is in the Minister's constituency, is probably the most obvious example in this regard.  Port of Cork Company and Shannon-Foynes Port Company, which is my constituency, are very successful.  However, management at these companies, in terms of the infrastructural issues with which they are faced and the plans they have at arms length from Government, are pulling their hair out.  <\/p> <p>  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, in terms of the flora and fauna which we are very fortunate to have, also has a remit in this area.  Other unelected organisations such as An Taisce also have a remit.  The Department of Transport did a very good piece of work on the categorisation and identification of ports in the context of funding under TEN-T.  Another piece of work now needs to be done on how we can utilise our key pieces of infrastructure, namely, the ports, to develop industries.  In places like Antwerp and Rotterdam, swathes of industry have grown up around the servicing of ports yet in Ireland, which is an island country totally dependent on its ports, there is not the same degree of focus in that regard.  There is massive potential in the independent port companies being a little more empowered and under the remit of one Department.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on where are we at in terms of TEN-T funding for infrastructural projects such as the development of Foynes and the rail network.  <\/p> <p>  I have previously raised with the Minister the major disappointment in relation to the M20 project, in particular, the corridor between Limerick and Cork, which are the second and third largest urban centres in the country.  While I welcome that we are finally going to have a continuous motorway from Galway to Limerick, the worst national primary road in the country linking any two urban centres, with the exception of the Limerick-Waterford road, is the Limerick-Cork road.  It is a disgrace.  The stretch of road from Buttevant to Charleville and from the Limerick county bounds to Macroom is a death trap.  The fact that this issue has fallen off the radar is of major disappointment.  Perhaps the Minister would update me on what is happening in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015061700002#F00300","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1434535200,"counter":3251,"content":"<p>As the Minister has to leave at 12 p.m., I will allow a brief supplementary from Deputy Fitzmaurice and Deputy Ellis before calling the Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015061700002#F00400","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1434535200,"counter":3252,"content":"<p>I note the main issue arising today appears to be the European rail network.  In the context of TEN-T, funding is to be provided to develop the ports, rail and road network along the route from Foynes Port to Limerick, Limerick to Dublin and from Cork to Dublin and on to Newry .  All of the road and rail networks in the west, from Derry to Galway, which up to 2011 were eligible for this funding, are no longer included.  As stated by Deputy O'Donovan, this funding could have been used constructively to develop the rail and road network from Cork to Limerick, Limerick to Galway, Galway to Sligo and Sligo to Derry.  Lest people are not aware of it, there is no rail infrastructure along the route to Knock Airport.  It has been forgotten about.  The proposed route to be developed, as per the map provided, is alarming.   <\/p> <p>  Reference was made to bringing more carriages into Dublin, which is good and everybody welcomes that.  However, to make a pound one has to spend a pound.  If we do not utilise this funding to develop the rail corridors in the west and to develop the road infrastructure from Castlebar to Dublin, and dissect the country with another road from Derry to the south, this country will not be accessible for businesspeople wishing to locate outside Dublin.  We need to ensure this is done.  I accept there will be no return from this on day one.  There was no return from the gas pipe network from day one.  The reward will come down the road as the volume of people doing business here increases.  I urge the Minister to rethink this proposal.<\/p> <p>  I have examined all of the TEN-T proposals for Ireland.  In my view, the west has been forgotten about.

In a recent incident on board a plane, a person died during a short haul flight from Dublin to Spain.  I have been told that while it is a mandatory requirement that a defibrillator is available on all long haul flights, there is no such requirement in respect of short haul flights.  We have previously discussed the issues that can arise in the context of air travel, including lengthy waiting periods in airports and flights of up to six hours.  I understand from what I have been told that the availability of a defibrillator on short haul flights is not mandatory.  This is an issue we need to tackle urgently.

For example, there is so much complexity and law in the area of the foreshore issue that in my view it is best left in the Department with expertise in the area.  Similarly, areas relating to marine development clearly sit better within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This is why I believe the approach taken by my own Department offers the best way of trying to pull much of this together.  We will be publishing legislation soon on the tiering of the ports into national, local and regional significance.  This will give a framework in which choices can be made regarding who does what and it will define the structure and the relationship with the local authority.  Ultimately, this is the best way of ensuring that each port can play a role in the overall development of the country but it must also be recognised that not every port can carry out the same role.  For example, the needs of the Deputy's local port of Shannon-Foynes would be very different from the needs of some smaller and medium-sized ports.  The approach of tiering our ports offers the best way of pulling together all the resources that are needed in Government in an effort to develop the ports.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Deputy Fitzmaurice's point.  It is not in our remit to define which kind of projects are acceptable for funding for TEN-T.  The European Commission decides the kind and size of projects and we then apply for funding.
