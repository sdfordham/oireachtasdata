To give a short history of our group, Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland was formed by owners, breeders and trainers of track greyhounds who were becoming increasingly aware of a perceived drugging problem in performing dogs.  Members are predominantly but not exclusively from the south-east of Ireland.  There appeared to be a culture of altering the performance of certain greyhounds, that is, slowing them for trials and subsequently &quot;driving&quot; them for races.  There was widespread concern that cover-ups were the norm when certain dogs were tested and their samples proved positive for banned substances.  As the group grew, we established an excellent working relationship with Ms Geraldine Larkin, former CEO, and Ms Hilary Forde, head of racing and governance of the Irish Greyhound Board.  Ms Forde attended our AGM and also liaised on our behalf to have our committee included in discussions with Professor Morris, who gave us a very generous hearing and mentioned our proposals in his report.<br\/><br\/>We are delighted to say the IGB took on board the majority of our proposals, including out-of-competition testing, sales testing, publishing of analytical findings, increased security in kennelling areas and increased testing on all dogs of kennels where there have been multiple positive findings.  Sales of Irish greyhounds were suffering due to the perceived low image of our dogs, so much so that the Greyhound Board of Great Britain, the British governing authority, issued more or less an ultimatum stating <i>caveat emptor<\/i>, or buyer beware, and that if one is going to buy Irish dogs, one should proceed very cautiously.  To us, that truly was an insult and a slur.  In the past, Irish greyhounds enjoyed the respect of a worldwide sporting audience.  With a concerted effort from all stakeholders, they can soon resume their rightful place at the top of the racing world.  Latterly, real progress has been disappointingly slow, due perhaps to the fact Ms Forde can no longer meet with us, unless at a forum which is organised by the IGB.<br\/><br\/>The ordinary owner feels that the credibility of the current board is compromised as it is felt that it does not keep its own rules.  We appreciate the opportunity to come here today to meet with Oireachtas Members and we appeal to those in power to strive to provide a level playing field for all involved in this wonderful sport.<\/p><p> The following are our proposals.  Integrity is at the core of every successful sport, therefore, those involved at all levels must be people of the highest integrity.  Rules must be implemented with the welfare of the greyhound taking precedence, to the benefit of all, not just the few.<\/p><p> As regards the purchase of new equipment for the laboratory in Limerick, if tests are covered up, this purchase is a total waste of money.  Time-finding and time-losing dogs are to be tested and results are to be published.  Stud dogs are to be fully tested before a litter is sired and findings published.  Without this breeders are taking a shot in the dark, which is a very costly move in some cases. <\/p><p> As regards greyhounds that break track records, before the record is ratified that dog should be sampled and the results published.  The same goes for bitches who are going to retire to the breeding paddocks.  A case can definitely be made that they also need to have their full history logged publicly.<\/p><p> The control committee has to be truly independent without any conflict of Interest.  Is this currently the case?  Classic winners' and track record breakers' samples should be taken and sent to an independent laboratory, for example, in Newmarket.<\/p><p> Fines must be large enough to act as a deterrent.  Owners and trainers with multiple offences should be banned.  The minimum fine should be &euro;5,000.  The same should apply to those whose dogs test positive for steroids, cocaine, etc.  A red flag should appear by their names on the race card. <\/p><p> The administration of such substances is a highly serious breach of welfare.  Most greyhound people are horrified by these actions, which are clearly animal abuse.  If full confidence is to be restored to the sport, the IGB cannot tolerate or cover up such events.  There should be a full ban on a trainer's licence and no transfer of the same licence to a family member.  <\/p><p> All novice greyhounds should be tested in first round of major unraced stakes, as heat winners are quite often sold for large sums of money.  In the case of any greyhound returning from Britain testing positive for any performance altering substance, the person in whose care the dog is should be fined.  If the offence is found to have been repeated, a ban should be enforced until the dog tests clear.  It should be published when the dog is cleared to run. <\/p><p> Payment of fines should be published and owners or trainers should not be allowed to run dogs again until the fine is paid.  Prize money should always be aimed at the many and not the few.  We are looking for a fair distribution of the prize money pool.<\/p><p> The grassroots of any sport should be recognised for what they are  - the lifeblood and backbone of the sport.  The rules must be clear, concise and adhered to fully.  No exceptions should be made for anyone if a performance-altering substance is found.  The penalty must act as a deterrent.  Specific drug teams of up to ten independent people should be available to test greyhounds.  In addition, it is vital to have an independent laboratory to which samples may be sent.  Positive and negative results should be published to prove that all samples have been tested.  This is absolutely vital to restore trust and confidence.<\/p><p> All of the above points I have raised are representative of the views of members of the Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland Group.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017051600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eilis McCann","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494946800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Ms McCann.

The representatives of Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland are strong advocates of imposing strict penalties and sanctions.  Can McCann outline a range of sanctions that she feels would be appropriate?  Section 14 of the Bill is somewhat deficient in terms of sanctions, so Ms McCann could help the committee by outlining them.<\/p> <p>  Does she advocate the strict liability principle if, for example, a banned substance is found in the course of an investigation or test?  There could be a pre-race investigation or a test arising as a result of a race.  Whether a test if pre-race or post-race, a strict liability principle would presume that a positive result is an offence.  The onus would then shift to the owner or breeder, whoever is involved, to negative that and set out the reason a particular substance was found.  Is that what Ms McCann advocates and, if not, what system does she advocate as being the most appropriate?<\/p> <p>  Ms McCann mentioned absolute integrity in racing, which is very important for this committee as it considers the Greyhound Industry Bill 2017.  We all subscribe to the idea of absolute integrity and Ms McCann will not find anyone opposing that view in her presentation.  How can such a system be established, however?  It could become a legal quagmire unless a \"do and don't\" list is set out.  In the normal course of events things are black and white, but sometimes something may innocently appear.  If a dog is fed something which contains a contaminated substance, for example, then under the strict liability principle one is there.  As the saying goes: \"Once you're explaining, you're losing.\"  One is losing because one will have to explain that.<\/p> <p>  Could Ms McCann outline the type of sanction regime she thinks should be in place in order to ensure that the integrity of the dog racing industry is sacrosanct?  She made an important point that the British authorities seem to be very alert to things when all is not kosher.  Does Ms McCann have evidence that this has had a significantly negative impact in terms of the industry going forward?<\/p> <p>  I thought that a lot of money had been spent on a laboratory in Limerick which was the be-all and end-all.  In fact, the Morris report placed a lot of emphasis on that, as Ms McCann's presentation mentioned.  I am glad she did.  If significant funding went into that laboratory as a first step, why is Ms McCann saying it may well be important to refer some cases - for example, if a dog does a super, abnormal time and the result does not stand up - to an independent laboratory outside this jurisdiction?  Is that what Ms McCann is advocating?  Why is she saying that in regard to record-breakers?<\/p> <p>  Could she expand on the idea of bitches being tested before retiring to become broods?  Is there any level of offence that warrants a full-time ban?  For example, some steroids are well known as being massive stimulants, so does their use warrant a full-time ban or a graded ban?  I appreciate that the sanction must be proportionate.  <\/p> <p>  Ms McCann referred to red flags appearing next to a dog's name on a race card, but for how long would such a flag appear?  If my dog has a problem and is red flagged for one race, will the red flag be carried on to the next race?  Does it cover a season or two years?  Will it be for six months, a year or two?  <\/p> <p>  Sports Ireland may impose a two-year or four-year ban on athletes.  The European sports arbitration body can either uphold such bans, or not, on appeal.  I would like Ms McCann to indicate what she has in mind, including time limits for bans and the nature of offences involved.  Is a gradation system involved and is there any offence for which a permanent ban would be warranted?<\/p> <p>  I absolutely concur with Ms McCann when she said: \"Fines must be large enough to act as a deterrent.  Owners and trainers with multiple offences should be banned.\"  Why, however, is she referring to multiple offences?<\/p><p>In terms of multiple offences, anything more than two is multiple.  If three or four offences attract the maximum of the &euro;5,000 fine that is fair enough.  All penalties should act as a deterrent to make sure infringements do not happen.  It is very useful for the witnesses to come in.  I am interested in the reference to the independent laboratory.  It has been indicated that we must travel outside the jurisdiction.  Is that for specific areas or in general?  I thank the witnesses for the presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017051600002#E00300","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494946800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The witnesses are both very welcome.  It is useful to have people come in and give us a broad range of views on the Bill.  The greyhound industry has gone through much upheaval in recent years and we have been very aware of lobbies coming from all parts of the country to committee members and others in elected office on various issues, many of which have been raised today, especially in regard to doping and cheating the system.  I seek clarity on a couple of issues.  It was said that integrity is at the core of the group's focus, to the extent that it is included in the name of the organisation.<\/p> <p>  I am also interested in the new equipment in the lab in Limerick.  We have heard a great deal about the cost of the lab in Limerick, the total inefficiency, and its inability to provide any kind of useful service.  It does not seem to be able to test to the required levels and from what I have heard - the witnesses alluded to it in the opening statement - even if the best equipment was there if the people running it do not want to use the equipment properly or do the job properly it will not be done properly.  That seems to be the inference that was made by the witnesses and I would like them to clarify that.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned that the prize money should be aimed at the many and not the few and that there should be a fair distribution of prize money.  I would like to understand what exactly the witnesses mean by that.  Does it imply that there is some kind of golden circle or a little group that takes all and leaves the rest behind?  What exactly is meant by that?<\/p> <p>  I wish to follow on from what Deputy Penrose said.  What is the view of the witnesses on what can be done in terms of the level of sanction that is possible to deal with people who break the rules or consistently offend?  Witnesses from various organisations have come before the committee and one issue that has come up is the traceability of dogs and the position in that regard and the export of dogs to other countries.  I would welcome the views of the witnesses on that matter also.<\/p> <p>  Previous witnesses mentioned the number of litters a bitch can have and what is appropriate.  I would like to hear the view of witnesses from the point of view of breeders because we have heard the animal welfare perspective.  I do not suggest breeders are not concerned with welfare but I refer to the animal welfare lobby specifically.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017051600002#F00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1494946800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.

Could the witnesses expand a little on that?<\/p> <p>  I accept everything that has been said about integrity.  Head 21 of the Bill sets out the make up of the control committee and the criteria for people involved in it.  Do the witnesses think that is adequate in terms of providing for the integrity of the control committee and the work it does?<\/p> <p>  Reference is made on the second page of the presentation to an independent laboratory for sampling.  Is that independent of the Limerick laboratory and if that is the case why is the Limerick laboratory even there?<\/p> <p>  Head 14 proposes to remove the criminal sanction for breaches of the racing code and the intention is to replace it with financial penalties.  How do the witnesses feel about that?  Do they believe penalties are adequate or that the criminal sanction should be retained for people who interfere with dogs?<\/p> <p>  Last week when it was before the committee the ISPCA said its recommendation is that a bitch should have no more than five litters and the legislation proposes nine.

He asked a single question but he had about 12 different questions in it.  I will try to give him as brief a r&eacute;sum&eacute; as I can.  The first part of the question was about the type of substances, how they should be managed and if they should be managed differently.  It is important for the committee to know that we are owners and breeders and we represent owners and breeders who are focused on bringing transparency and integrity to the industry.  If the IGB had published all the negative tests it would be really helpful because people would understand that more than 99% of all tests that are taken are negative.  That is very reassuring to most people and it is very reassuring to us but that is a message that it not coming out.  It is the 1% of tests that are not negative that is the problem, and it is how those tests are managed.  Overall, 99% of dogs that are running and being tested are being run fair and square and you should know that the dog running next to you has tested negative but a small number of dogs are testing positive and they are undermining the integrity of the whole industry and that is a problem.<\/p> <p>  The first question Deputy Penrose asked was about the type of substances.  There is an attempt in the Bill to differentiate between prohibited substances and controlled substances.  Essentially, prohibited substances can never be present in the sample.  An example might be stanozolol, which is an anabolic steroid, a Ben Johnson-type anabolic steroid or cocaine.  They would be two very straightforward examples.  Neither of those drugs is licensed in Ireland in any veterinary situation so if stanozolol is used in a greyhound as an anabolic steroid it means it came into the country illegally and then it was administered to a dog.  It is not licensed by any medical or veterinary agency in Ireland.  We have to go back and say there is a small number of such cases but they undermine the integrity of the whole industry.  That is a very serious incident and from the point of view of our committee members any dog that tests positive for stanozolol should get a lifelong ban because that is an anabolic steroid and it gives an unfair advantage to the dog compared to any other dog and it cannot have got into the dog by any other method than being imported into this country and given to the dog.  The same is true of cocaine.  How else could cocaine have got into a dog other than it being imported illegally into the country, procured through some illegal source and given to a dog, horse or whatever it is?  It seems really clear to us that use of those prohibited substances should result in a lifelong ban for the greyhound running and it is also a serious issue for the person who administered it.  That is the serious end of the spectrum.<\/p> <p>  The Bill identifies the other group of substances as controlled substances, which may have got into a greyhound through any number of ways.  A greyhound might have had tonsillitis and been put on an antibiotic.  We can all understand that.  With advanced testing, maybe six weeks later a minuscule level of the antibiotic might show up in a specimen.  We could all understand and accept that is not going to affect the performance of the dog.  Similarly for anti-inflammatories, if a greyhound had an injury and was treated by the vet with an anti-inflammatory several weeks down the line that might show up at a very low level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017051600002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. David McGrath"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1494946800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The board have now made an attempt to regulate this and make it more transparent.  It has introduced a medication booklet which is greatly appreciated.  Any vet who sees a dog now will be asked to fill in the medication that was prescribed on that day.  If a dog were tested six or eight weeks later and that came up in a hearing, it would be reflected in the hearing that the vet had prescribed the medication for a good veterinary reason.<\/p><p>There are two different situations: the prohibited substances and the controlled substances.  The member alluded to things coming through the feed chain.  There is some evidence that tiny residues of certain drugs can come through the food chain.  That is similar in horse racing.  As far back as the 1980s, Tied Cottage won the Cheltenham Gold Cup and he lost it subsequently because of a food contamination issue.  That is common across many sporting organisations.<\/p><p>The way to manage that is to have very low thresholds for these contaminants that can come into the system.  The issue is that certain contaminants have been found in greyhounds.  One was procaine four or five years ago.  Procaine is a local anaesthetic but it is also a cocaine-type analogue.  It can be prescribed as a local anaesthetic and in theory it could have come through the food chain.  Many dogs tested positive for procaine, however, details of the levels of procaine in the samples were never published, which was the critical thing.  One could imagine that very low levels of procaine could be residues of feeding or something like that, whereas one would not expect very high levels to come through the food chain.  One would expect the sanction to reflect the levels.<\/p><p>The member asked about strict liability.  We have a slightly different way of managing it than the GBGB does in the UK.  In the UK a person running a dog as a trainer or owner essentially becomes a member of a club and accepts the rules of the club when signing.  At the moment that is not how things are managed here under the 1957 Act and there is an opportunity to change things now.  There are many more legal-type sanctions involved.<\/p><p>Obviously, there should be a gradation of sanctions depending on the severity of the substance and the level and the number of offences.

They have been extremely professional in any dealings we have had with them.<\/p> <p>  A laboratory can only process the samples that arrive there.  It can only process samples in a way that they are advised by the board.  Laboratories do not devise tests.  The board issues to a laboratory the list of drugs to be tested.  That is how it should happen in any organisation; the governing body should inform the laboratory that is doing its testing as to what it should be looking for.<\/p> <p>  I do not think there is any issue with staff in Limerick, who are very professional people.  The issue really is with the sampling itself.  Even now if a sample is taken at a track we have no idea whether it is ever processed, which is a big issue.  People read of positive findings but never hear of the negative findings.  The only way to know that all the samples are processed at a track is for all samples taken to be reported as positive, negative or not processed.  It would be a great bonus to the integrity of the industry if all negative samples were published.  It is a really simple thing to do.  On most race nights, at least two dogs are sampled.

In terms of the board being compromised, what we are saying is that it is important that the board lead from the top in terms of integrity.

If the board itself is not implementing the Greyhound Act 1957 then it is difficult for it to police that Act.  Another big issue in terms of that Act is separation of the operation side of the industry from the integrity side.  In terms of horse racing, there are two separate organisations in the form of Horse Racing Ireland and The Turf Club.  There is a glaring anomaly in one of the heads of the Bill in relation to the definition of \"club\".  Head 15 deals with investigations by Greyhound Racing Ireland.  It provides that where Greyhound Racing Ireland considers that there are matters of concern to the club it may notify such matters to the club.  That, to me, appears to be a provision lifted from measures related to Horse Racing Ireland or The Turf Club.  It is similar to the dual control system in the UK.

The attendance of the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, at the last forum gave the the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation, IGOBF, Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland, GRII, and other stakeholders a chance to communicate directly with the Minister, which was very helpful to us and, I think, the Minister of State.<\/p><p>He stayed for two and a half hours at that forum.

I am very pleased to present the Inland Fisheries (Amendment) Bill for the consideration of the select committee.<\/p> <p>  As Members will be aware from the debate on Second Stage, the main purpose of this Bill is to confer an explicit power on Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for inland fisheries offences.  It achieves this by amending the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 by the insertion of a specific provision that provides for the IFI to have the power to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for offences under the Acts specified.<\/p><p>It will ensure that Inland Fisheries Ireland can fully enforce the inland fisheries Acts.  The Bill also makes some additional corrections to the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 to ensure that minor omissions in that Act are fully resolved.<\/p><p> Before we discuss the individual sections, I wish to share the background to the Bill.  Inland Fisheries Ireland is the State agency responsible for the protection, conservation, development and promotion of Ireland's inland fisheries and sea angling resources.  Inland Fisheries Ireland was formed on 1 July 2010, following the amalgamation of the Central Fisheries Board and the seven regional fisheries boards into a single agency.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment received advice from the Office of the Attorney General in February 2017 to the effect that Inland Fisheries Ireland does not have the power to bring prosecutions under the inland fisheries Acts.  It was advised that an explicit power to prosecute should be inserted in the 2010 Act as a matter of priority.  The impact of this advice is that until the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 is amended, prosecutions brought by Inland Fisheries Ireland for which proceedings have been initiated cannot be proceeded with.  There are approximately 150 cases that fall into this category.<\/p><p> In light of the advice received, the amendments to the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 are being pursued as a matter of priority.  There are no amendments to the Bill.  The Bills Office advised that the single amendment tabled has been ruled out of order as, in the context of Standing Order 1793, it would involve a potential charge on the Revenue.<\/p><p> I look forward to a constructive debate and to the assistance of members in facilitating the Bill's early passage into law to safeguard our valuable fisheries resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12017051600002#A00500","speaker":"1314","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494928800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12017051600002#B00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1494928800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 4, inclusive agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1494928800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Deputy Pringle is offering.

The original legal advice in 2015 was that Inland Fisheries Ireland's powers to prosecute were susceptible to challenge and that the Department should introduce amending legislation to confirm the powers of the organisation.
