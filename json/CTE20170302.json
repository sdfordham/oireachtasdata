I have received apologies from Deputy Alan Kelly, who was a Minister in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government until quite recently.  He has asked for his apologies to be recorded here today rather than participating directly in the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Are the minutes of the meetings of 22 and 23 February agreed?  Agreed.  There are no matters arising that will not come up in the correspondence.  <\/p> <p>  We will move on to correspondence.  No. 315A is a briefing document from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for today's meeting.  We will note and publish it.<\/p> <p>  No. 319A is an opening statement from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We will note and publish it.<\/p> <p>  The next items are category B correspondence.  The first item is correspondence dated 16 February 2017 from Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE.  The letter recommends that, before the Department and the HSE appear before the committee on 9 March 2017 to discuss the fair deal scheme, the committee visit a public residential community hospital.  We discussed this last week and I do not think a visit is feasible before 9 March.  However, following the Easter recess I propose that the secretary identifies a Tuesday morning to visit to a public residential community hospital and liaises with the members regarding their availability.  We will make some preliminary inquiries but we will hold over a definite decision.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 300B, 1 to 3, inclusive, is correspondence dated 17 February 2017 from Mr. Maurice Quinn, Secretary General of the Department of Defence.  This is a follow-up to an appearance by the Department before the committee on 26 January and a subsequent information request.  This was held over from last week and I propose that we hold it over again.  There is quite a lot of documentation, some of which deals with the sale of the Government jet and the health and safety issues in Baldonnel.  I have received some correspondence directly, and perhaps other members have also, in the past day or so from people who do not fully accept what they understand the Secretary General to be saying so I would like another week to consider the matter.  Can we hold that over and give people an opportunity to look at it?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Further correspondence, dated 20 February, is from the HSE with a briefing note for the committee on the High Court case relating to consultants pay.  We will note it.<\/p> <p>  No. 313B is correspondence dated 22 February from Noel Waters, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, in follow-up to his appearance before the committee on 2 February.  We can note and publish it, but perhaps it would be better to hold it over as we have been very busy with Project Eagle in recent weeks.  Will we hold it over as it is a voluminous document with 13 pages.  The reason we are holding some of these items over is that we have been having meetings on Project Eagle in private session and we did not get an opportunity to review them.  We will hold it over for another short period.  <\/p> <p>  Further correspondence, dated 22 February, is from the Central Bank correcting information that was sent to the committee regarding retention payments.  It is a minor correction of &euro;730.  That is in relation to the retention of staff.  We dealt with this issue at some point last summer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#B00100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Have they come back to us on the other issue that they were written to about?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#B00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>It must be a month since we wrote to them on that issue.

In 2015, the Vote recorded gross expenditure totalling &euro;1.2 billion, while the fund recorded expenditure totalling &euro;1.8 billion.<\/p><p>There are some transfers between the Vote and the fund but a consolidated statement of the Department's receipts and payments is not prepared.  While the Vote is mainly Exchequer-funded, the local government fund is mainly financed by motor tax receipts, approximately &euro;1.1 billion in 2015, and local property tax receipts, which amounted to &euro;469 million in 2015.<\/p><p> The breakdown of the Vote 34 expenditure in 2015 is indicated in the figure on screen.  This uses the programme structure as defined in the Vote.  The housing programme accounted for over half of the Vote expenditure in 2015.  Expenditure on this programme was &euro;646 million, which represented an increase of &euro;52 million year on year.  Almost all of this increase related to additional provision for local authority housing programmes.  The most significant increase in the Vote year on year was in respect of the local government programme.  Total expenditure in 2015 was &euro;275 million, compared with &euro;36 million in 2014.  The 2015 expenditure included a payment of &euro;241 million to the local government fund to provide a contribution towards the transfers from the fund to local authorities and a subvention of &euro;92 million paid to Irish Water.  Vote expenditure on the water services programme 2015 totalled &euro;131 million, an increase of &euro;94 million year on year.  The increase was due to the payment of household water conservation grants in 2015.  The grant scheme was administered on an agency basis by the Department of Social Protection but the related grants and agency administration costs were borne on Vote 34.  After appropriations-in-aid totalling &euro;46 million, the net surplus on the Vote at the end of 2015 amounted to &euro;84 million.  With the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, capital funding of &euro;41 million not spent in 2015 was carried over to 2016.  The remaining &euro;43 million was surrendered to the Exchequer.<\/p><p> Chapter 4 of my report aims to present an overview of the level of funding provided by central Government to local authorities and the purposes for which that funding is provided.  Relevant information is drawn together from a number of accounts to get a full picture of the complex financial transfers and of trends over time.  Central Government transfers to local authorities of almost &euro;2 billion in 2015 represented just over 34% of the 2008 level of those transfers when they peaked at around &euro;5.8 billion.  The decline reflects the general reductions in public expenditure since 2008 and the transfer of certain responsibilities away from local authorities.  As evident from the figure which can now be shown on screen, the reduction in transfers has impacted most on local authority capital spending.  This impacted especially in the areas of social housing and roads.  In 2014 the Department provided general purpose grant funding to local authorities mainly for their day-to-day activities.  General purpose grants were discontinued in 2015 and were replaced by annual local property tax allocations.  This resulted in adjustments of funding for some local authorities.  Under the 80% retention rule provided for in the local property tax regime, 19 local authorities would have been allocated less funding in 2015 than in 2014.  However, equalisation funding of &euro;102 million from the residual 20% of the tax was utilised to bring those local authorities to the same level of funding that they received in 2014.  The retention based allocations for 12 authorities and these were mainly large urban authorities in commuter belt counties were some &euro;177 million higher than the amounts they received in 2014.  Total funding of &euro;239 million was provided to those local authorities in 2015 but they were directed to allocate &euro;131 million for housing services and &euro;22 million for road services, with the balance of &euro;86 million available for general or discretionary purposes within those local authorities.  In addition to the &euro;2 billion funding provided by Departments and agencies in 2015, an amount of &euro;427 million was transferred directly from the Exchequer in the form of once-off payments to local authorities.  This was to allow the local authorities to repay borrowing from the Housing Finance Agency that had been used in the past to fund local authority water supply and treatment infrastructure that had since transferred to Irish Water.<\/p><p> Chapter 4 also provides a brief overview of the key structures in place for the oversight of local authority finances.  These are the local government audit service and the National Oversight and Audit Commission.  I previously reported on the Department's implementation of the land aggregation scheme and this was examined by the committee on 5 February 2015.  Under the land aggregation scheme, local authorities could transfer to the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, referred to as the Housing Agency, surplus residential development land on which there were outstanding loans.  The loans were due for repayment to the Housing Finance Agency.  Between 2010 and 2013, the Department approved 73 sites for transfer with a total land area of 247 ha.  My previous report, which was completed in mid-2014, found that there were very significant delays in effecting the transfers of many sites to the Housing Agency.  By July 2016, however, we found that all but six of the approved sites had transferred.<\/p><p> The focus has consequently now shifted to a strategy for the management, utilisation and ultimate development of these and other sites.  Progress in developing and utilising the sites as at mid-2016 can be summarised as follows: no housing units had yet been completed but development had been approved in respect of 185 homes on seven sites and proposals were being worked up in the context of another 180 homes across five sites; and 1.6 ha of land on two sites had been transferred to the Department of Education and Skills for a school and to a community organisation for a children's recreational facility to promote sustainable communities.  However, 93% of the sites had either no proposed development in place or had not yet been transferred to the Housing Agency.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee on developments in regard to the acquired land since the reporting date.<\/p><p> The key agencies in respect of 2015 would have been the Environmental Protection Agency, Pobal, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, the Western Development Commission and the Residential Tenancies Board.  There are a couple of other non-commercial State bodies which do not fall within my remit, namely, the Housing Finance Agency and the Local Government Management Agency.  I thought that might be useful to the committee in its deliberations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#D02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488445200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be here this morning as Accounting Officer to assist the committee in its examination of Vote 34 and Chapters 4 and 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report for 2015 dealing with central Government funding and local authorities and progress on the land aggregation scheme, respectively.  As requested, I have provided some advance briefing for the meeting and will keep these opening comments short.<\/p> <p>  The State's public finances moved further along the pathway to sustainability in 2015 and, in that context, the Department's gross expenditure for the year totalled &euro;1.24 billion, some 36% higher than the outturn for 2014.  The Department had significant achievements in 2015 in delivering on key policies and programmes.  Our overall objectives were to improve the quality of life of citizens and communities to foster economic and social development and to enhance environmental protection.  In overall terms, the Department was assigned over 13% of the total Exchequer capital allocation in 2015 towards implementing major housing, water, rural development and other programs.  In 2015 several critical areas benefited from increased funding, most notably housing where spend increased by 9% over 2014.  Total spending from the vote on the various housing programmes, including the provision of social housing and improvement in regeneration measures amounted to almost &euro;646 million in 2015.  Local authorities also self-funded housing programmes from local property tax receipts in the amount of &euro;119 million, bringing the gross spend on housing programmes to &euro;765 million.<\/p><p>This was used to meet housing needs through a range of programmes, including the local authority construction and acquisition programme, the approved housing body programme, leasing and the rental accommodation scheme.  In total, the housing needs of 13,375 households were met under our housing programmes in 2015.<\/p><p> As members will be aware, responsibility for the provision of water services transferred from local authorities to Irish Water on 1 January 2014.  A sum of &euro;222 million was provided by the Government via the Central Fund for Irish Water to meet its capital expenditure in 2015.  This funding helped to progress capital projects set out in the Irish Water capital plan, including key water and wastewater infrastructural projects.  In addition, &euro;399 million was provided for Irish Water from the local government fund in 2015 by way of an operational subvention.  It funded the allowance of 21,000 litres of free water provided for all children in the State, the cost of capital and domestic water charges at the levels set out in the Water Services Act 2014 and the cost of providing a general subsidy to meet the cost of services to reduce the level of unit charge in line with the provisions of the Act.  The water programme expenditure figure in 2015 for the Department also included &euro;94 million for the water conservation grant introduced in that year.  As at 30 June 2015, a total of 1.308 million households had registered with Irish Water and were, therefore, eligible to apply for the grant in 2015.  The Department of Social Protection which administered the water conservation grant on behalf of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government made grant payments totalling just over &euro;89 million in respect of 890,104 applications under the scheme.  A small number of residual payments continue to be made to householders who have an entitlement to the 2015 water conservation grant.  Capital funding of &euro;16.88 million was also provided under the rural water programme, which included support for the group water scheme sector.  In addition, &euro;18.88 million was provided for the sector from the local government fund by way of operational subsidies.<\/p><p> The chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the funding of local authorities by central government provides an overview of local authority expenditure and income figures since 2006.  It details the range of programmes for which local authorities are responsible and the range of funding sources.  Transfers of funding from central government sources to local authorities in 2015 totalled almost &euro;2 billion.  The local government fund accounted for 43% of this amount.  There was continued change in the operation of the fund in 2015, with the ending of the general purpose grant payments and the introduction of the local property tax, LPT, paid to local authorities through the fund.  Some 80% of LPT revenue was retained locally to fund vital public services, while the remaining 20% was redistributed to provide top-up funding for local authorities with a lower local property tax base due to variances in property values across the State.  These measures were necessary to create a balanced system of funding across local authorities.  Income into the local government fund in 2015 totalled over &euro;1.8 billion, made up of motor tax receipts of &euro;1.1 billion, local property tax revenue of &euro;469 million and a payment from the Exchequer of &euro;241 million.  The main payments from the local government fund in 2015 included LPT payments to local authorities of &euro;459 million, a payment of &euro;355 million for the maintenance of non-national roads and public transport to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a payment to the Exchequer of &euro;481 million, as well as a payment of &euro;399 million as a subvention to Irish Water.<\/p><p> On accountability, as the committee will be aware, under the existing policy and legislative framework, the Local Government Audit Service provides for independent scrutiny of the financial stewardship of local authorities and other local bodies.  It audits local government bodies in accordance with a statutory code of audit practice, thereby fostering the highest standards of financial management and public accountability.  Where the annual audit has been completed by the local government auditor, the local authority is required to furnish a copy of the audited financial statement and any associated statutory auditor's report to every member of the local authority for his or her consideration at the next practicable council meeting.  Scrutiny arrangements for local government were also enhanced in recent years, with the establishment of the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC.  The NOAC scrutinises local government performance in fulfilling national, regional and local mandates and value for money where State funds are channelled through local government and supports the development of best practice and enhanced efficiency in the performance of local government functions.  <\/p><p> The most significant aspect of the Department's community programme in 2015 involved the commencement of the new social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, which was rolled out in April that year and will run until the end of this year.  Its aim is to tackle poverty, social exclusion and long-term unemployment through local engagement and partnership between disadvantaged individuals, community organisations, public sector agencies and other stakeholders.  SICAP expenditure in the nine month period April to December 2015 was &euro;26.8 million.  A total of 36,854 disadvantaged individuals were engaged under SICAP on a one-to-one basis, while 2,506 local community groups were assisted.<\/p><p> Chapter 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report for 2015 deals with progress under the land aggregation scheme.  The scheme was established in 2010 to support local authorities by alleviating the financial burden in servicing land loans that had been taken out from the Housing Finance Agency for the purpose of acquiring land for social and affordable housing developments.  It closed in December 2013.  At the time the Department had approved 73 sites, with a total area of 247 ha, for inclusion in the scheme.  At the time of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report 67 sites accepted into the scheme had been transferred to the housing agency.  As of February 2017, this figure has increased to 71.  In 2013, as a consequence of continuing pressure on Exchequer resources at the time and following a review of the scheme carried out in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it became evident that further expenditure on the scheme in accepting new applications was not sustainable.  Accordingly, in December that year local authorities were notified of the ending of the scheme.<\/p><p> The matters to which I have referred illustrate the broad range of programmes and activities for which my Department had responsibility in 2015.  I should point out that, with the reconfiguration of Departments when the new Government took office in May 2016, the bulk of the Department's environmental functions transferred to the new Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, while a range of rural development functions were transferred to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  <\/p><p> My colleagues and I will be happy to respond to questions or deal with issues that will emerge in the course of the committee's work today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy for his contribution.

I welcome Mr. John McCarthy and his staff.  Mr. McCarthy covered a huge amount in his opening statement.  He began by talking about housing so I will start there as well if that is okay.  Chapter 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2015 report relates to progress on land aggregation.  In layman's terms, it sets out the progress that is being made with the construction of homes on 73 sites, across 610 acres, that are now in the ownership of the State centrally as opposed to through the local authority system.  This mini-NAMA scheme is positive because it gets bad land deals off the books of local councils.<\/p> <p>  A landbank of 28 acres in the Farganstown area of Navan in my own county of Meath, which had been bought for &euro;22 million, did not make it into the scheme.  Meath County Council is now paying interest and principal repayments of &euro;500,000 a year to try to service that debt.  The 28-acre site in question is just lying there with no movement on the social housing for which it was purchased.  The council could be spending &euro;500,000 a year on front-line services, but instead it has to service its debt in respect of this landbank.<\/p> <p>  It is positive that 73 sites across Ireland have made it into the scheme.  It is pointed out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that as of July 2016, no progress had been made with the development of residential housing sites on 84% of the land acquired under the scheme.  In July 2016, there was inaction on 84% of landbanks under a scheme that stopped taking in landbanks in December 2013.  Progress is being made with 12 of the 73 sites that are involved in this scheme.  Some 185 units on seven sites have been approved and a further 180 units on five sites are in train.  How many other specific sites will see ground broken in 2017 on foot of the site visits conducted by departmental officials in 2015 and 2016?  I do not need to tell Mr. McCarthy that this is the biggest issue that arises at the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Even though the housing waiting list is the biggest thing that occupies public discourse, there is no movement on 610 acres of land that has been identified for housing.  How many plans are in place to make progress with these lands?  How quickly will these developments happen?  The narrative we hear over and again from county councils is that it is frustrating to make progress with schemes from concept to design to implementation.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to spell out to me, as succinctly as possible, how many of these sites will see progress in the coming year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#G00900","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488445200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  As it stands, there are 15 sites, involving just over 25 ha and 479 units of accommodation, at various stages in our construction pipeline.  At another four sites, involving 3.95 ha and approximately 180 units, projects are at an earlier stage of consideration and have not entered the pipeline.  A small number of pieces of other land have been used for education and other purposes.  I will try to put this into context for the Deputy.  This scheme was introduced for the very valid purpose of recognising the difficulties faced by local authorities in the aftermath of the economic collapse.

Moving on to chapter four on the funding of local government, one of the things that really frustrates people is how their money is spent.  It is not the payment of tax, rather how it is spent.  Ask any resident in this country who pays property tax their view on what they expected to get, what they thought they would get and what they actually got.  I know the value of the service of local government.  I spent 17 years on a council.  The reason I ask is because when the precursor to the LPT, the household charge, was introduced, every single house in this country received a glossy leaflet through the door encouraging them to pay the &euro;100, as it was at that time.  In bulletpoint form, it set out where that money was going.  There were references to parks, community facilities and estate maintenance.  Those were the bulletpoints highlighted to encourage people to pay this charge when the county councils were collecting it.  Of course, we saw what happened.  They did not collect it.<\/p> <p>  People in most towns have no parks and have to pay another &euro;100 on top of their LPT to their local residents' association to pay for the cutting of grass in their estate.  Ask those people what their memory is of the promise on that leaflet.  When the LPT comes in and the collection is the guts of 100% - we had Mr. Cody before the committee from Revenue, which is doing a fine job in that respect as it brings in nearly &euro;500 million a year - one would think that local government would be enhanced rather than impoverished.  One would think that it would be able to provide the services that were mentioned in that leaflet some years ago.  One would think it would make the critical difference in providing the type of community facilities on the ground level that would actually make a difference, as opposed to maintaining the nuts, bolts and wages of just keeping the county councils on the go.<\/p> <p>  Low and behold, when we looked at those budgets the year the LPT was introduced, most councils were no better off.  They were no worse off, but they were no better off.  The general purpose grant, as the witness outlined, disappeared.  The LPT, which the households were paying themselves, just subbed in for it.  Residents were wondering where their LPT is going.  We could only say that it was going into the income side of things.  There was no scenario in which county councils actually had more money because what was given with one hand was taken away with another.<\/p> <p>  As we can see in the figures, funding to councils in this country went down by 70% in that period from 2007 to 2014.  Even leaving aside the transfer of powers in some aspects, it is massively underfunded.  Can the witness understand people's frustration and can he explain that little movement to me?  When the LPT came in, we were no better off in providing the services that people expect and require in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#H01100","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488445200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>In response to the first question, I can certainly understand the frustrations of the public generally in terms of its wish to have services delivered in an efficient way that delivers for local communities.

With regard to the move from the old general purpose grants to the LPT, the policy position adopted was that no local authority should end up being worse off in the transition.  The approach taken in order to achieve that was that each local authority would retain 80% of the LPT collected in its area locally and the balance of 20% would be used in order to achieve that equalisation function to ensure that no local authority would be worse off.  What that has meant is that some local authorities made the transition on an equal basis.  They lost nothing and gained nothing.

At their lowest point, the figure was at 26,500, so it was a huge reduction in staff numbers.  I suppose the system delivered considerable efficiency through a range of initiatives in order to be able to try to continue to deliver the range of services despite all of that.  Staff numbers have now started to increase in local authorities and particularly in the housing area we have sanctioned a very significant number of posts in order to allow authorities support the delivery of their housing programmes.

I want to move on to the second question regarding housing.  The witness responded to a question from an Teachta Cassells about the four-stage process in which a local authority applies for funding for social housing and the time it takes for the cheque finally to arrive.  My understanding is that the average wait time is about 18 months.  That has been a difficulty because there has been some tension between local authorities, CEOs and councils and the Department in terms of money being available, the local authority saying \"yes\", but the process being very difficult, cumbersome and it taking an awfully long time to draw down the funding.<\/p> <p>  The witness told us there was a review, which there was.  This is the important part.  What we need to do is shorten that timeframe down from 18 months.  I heard the witness speaking about the changes to a one-stage process for proposals below 15 units and costing less than &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million.  The witness might comment on the de-risk element of that.  My understanding from local authority CEOs is that the risk is all on the side of the local authority.  To stick with the broader issue of the four-stage process, what proposals are in the pipeline at the moment to reduce that timeframe?  That is the critical issue here.  That is one question on housing.<\/p> <p>  The second question relates to the acquisition of vacant properties.  Does the Department have an analysis of how many vacant properties there are?  I understand there are two schemes.  One is the repair and leasing scheme.  What percentage of vacant properties overall is the Department targeting under that scheme?  There is also the Housing Agency acquisition programme.  The witness might talk us through what measures are in place.  I do not know whether the witness has seen a report from the Simon Community today in which it states the need to make greater use of vacant properties, which I support.  There are two issues here: the four-stage process for acquisitions or new builds for local authorities and why it takes so long, and the issue of vacant properties.

This issue relates to a housing development being undertaken as part of the Ballymun regeneration project.  It was a situation where pyrite was found.  It goes back to 2007 and 2008.  When presented with the situation that arose at the time, we engaged with Ballymun Regeneration Limited on the appropriate response.  There were two options which were considered.  One was to continue with the existing contract and ask the existing contractor to complete the work and pay for it without any determination of legal liability which would be determined at a later stage.  The other was to terminate the contractor's employment and secure someone else to come in and do it.  Both of those options were considered from risk and legal perspectives and the choice was ultimately made that the best outcome from the taxpayers' perspective would be to continue the employment of the existing contractor, remedy the work and bring the project to a conclusion.  The project was very significantly advanced at that stage.  All of the financial, legal and risk factors were taken into account.<\/p> <p>  Where the issue of a loan came into play was that in wanting to progress the project to completion, we were faced with a situation where there was no legal certainty around where the ultimate liability for the defective material would be placed.  We wanted an avenue through which to provide space for the additional public funds that were going to be provided to be recovered in due course, including if the contractor who was engaging in legal proceedings was to get a successful outcome.  Even though it is ten years on, those legal proceedings have not yet concluded.  There are a whole range of other legal proceedings, and I want to be careful about what I say, ongoing on a similar issue but Dublin City Council or BRL are not involved in those.  This was a vehicle with the taxpayers' interests in mind to try to provide an avenue through which moneys could be recovered at a stage down the road, including if the outcome of legal proceedings which are still going on went in a particular direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#T03200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I want to be very careful and talk in principle.

Mr. John McCarthy is the Accounting Officer and I want him to provide a detailed note of the situation with regard to the assets and liabilities of the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency.  I ask him to send us on a note because five years after the agency was established, it is extraordinary that we are having such a discussion at this point.  Leaving aside the Comptroller and Auditor General, the primary responsibility to produce the accounts lies with the company.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is only the auditor.<\/p><p>There is a board of directors and it is its responsibility to know those things in the first place.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will audit it after they have signed off their accounts.  I ask for a note on that and on the uncollected non-principal private residence issue we mentioned.<\/p><p> I have a last topic to mention.  I apologise, but these are all specific issues that have crossed my desk as a Deputy.  I put down a parliamentary question on this last year and Mr. McCarthy might have seen correspondence from me on it.  It relates to the local authority mortgage protection insurance scheme.  In my constituency - and this is reflected everywhere - the cost of the local authority mortgage protection insurance scheme, which every person with a housing loan must join, is three or four times more expensive than what is available in the private market to people who do not have their loans with a local authority.  It is not 2% or even 30% more expensive, it is 300% to 400% more expensive.  In the private market, it was made illegal years ago for the mortgage provider to force the mortgage holder to take out mortgage protection insurance with that company.  Customers are free to shop around.  Seemingly, what is good for 85% of the population does not seem to be good enough for those who have loans from the local authority.  They are still being obliged legally to have mortgage protection insurance with the scheme.<\/p><p> That is a point but the real point is that it is several hundred percent dearer than what is available in the private sector.  When people run into arrears and one seeks to negotiate with a finance officer, one sees what looks like a phenomenal amount of mortgage protection insurance compared to what one deals with where a person owes money to a bank.  It is utterly unfair.  I know Mr. McCarthy will tell me there is extra coverage, that it covers a person until he or she is 65 and that if he or she dies, he or she gets &euro;3,000 extra.  I know what the benefits are from the reply to the parliamentary question and correspondence from the Housing Finance Agency.  The most recent reply I received from the Minister last year stated that as part of the upcoming retendering process, the relevant committee would seek to secure with effect from 1 January 2017 the most appropriate insurance cover at the best value for money for local authority borrowers.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to provide the committee with a detailed assessment of the improvements made to the scheme which were achieved on 1 January 2017.<\/p><p> I have asked the Department to give me the detail of how much money has been collected in the scheme and how much has been paid out.  That has not been provided.  The Department said it was not its affair.  I have written to the Housing Finance Agency which says it does not have the information either.  I have written to the local government managers' association or whatever the group involved is and it said it did not have the information.  I am told the mortgage protection insurance scheme protection committee cannot provide it.  It is a sub-committee of the City and County Management Association which cannot provide me with the information.  The local authorities obviously do not have it and the Housing Finance Agency has not been able to provide that information.  The Department is on that also.  Despite PQs, the Department cannot provide this information.  What is the total amount paid by local authority mortgage holders for mortgage protection insurance for each of the last couple of years and what payouts have been made?  They are being severely penalised because they have nowhere to go.  If they get a loan from the agency, they are forced to get this insurance.  It is not fair.<\/p><p> The Department says the current underwriter is Generali PanEurope with Marsh Ireland acting as its insurance administrator.  The PQ reply says that financial information specific to the operation of the local authority MPI project is commercially sensitive.  We want to lift that veil of commercial sensitivity.  The Department knows what I am looking for.  I do not accept the answer I was given.  How many people have local authority mortgages in the country under regular mortgages and shared-ownership mortgages schemes, approximately?  Somebody across from me must know.  How many local authority mortgages are out there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#V05100","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488445200,"counter":678,"content":"<p>If the Chairman gives me a second, I will get that figure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":679,"content":"<p>Mr. McCarthy will understand that I have gone to the four groups of people involved in administering this one.

Apart from any criminal process, some of the property owners were found to have been practically of nil means and were not pursuable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#AA01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":822,"content":"<p>Is Mr. McCarthy familiar with the social housing public private partnership, PPP, bundle 1 project?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#AA01900","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488445200,"counter":823,"content":"<p>I am indeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#AA02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":824,"content":"<p>Then Mr. McCarthy knows that it was initiated by his Department in budget 2015 and entails six sites across five local authority areas.  While it is yet to be initiated, it is causing considerable concern among the communities affected.  Mr. McCarthy discussed sustainable communities and community development with Deputy Cassells but we must also discuss the social mix.  I spent my time as a councillor promoting the idea of a social mix and the inclusion of rent allowance in Ballymun, so it would be incongruous to claim that a 100% social housing development in a neighbouring community is a good thing.  What is the rationale?  Most studies accept that a social mix is a social good.  As such, why is the project proceeding in this way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#AA02100","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488445200,"counter":825,"content":"<p>Much of it comes down to scale.  Deputy Cassells and I were discussing a development of 2,000 or 3,000 units, all of which would be for social housing.  Quite a few projects in our mainstream social housing pipeline are in the order of 50 to 60 units.  We generally do not have an issue with a social housing block of that scale.  In larger sites, for example, O'Devaney Gardens where 600 housing units might be built, one would seek to get a mixed tenure on the site.  In other cases, a smaller social housing development in the wider context can achieve the broader mixed tenure.  These sites were proposed by the local authorities in the first instance.  Under the process, the broader housing tenure mix in the wider areas was examined and the sites were considered suitable to be taken forward as part of that project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#AA02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":826,"content":"<p>How did the Secretary General arrive at the funding model?
