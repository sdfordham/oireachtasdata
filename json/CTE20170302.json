I have received apologies from Deputy Alan Kelly, who was a Minister in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government until quite recently.  He has asked for his apologies to be recorded here today rather than participating directly in the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Are the minutes of the meetings of 22 and 23 February agreed?  Agreed.  There are no matters arising that will not come up in the correspondence.  <\/p> <p>  We will move on to correspondence.  No. 315A is a briefing document from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for today's meeting.  We will note and publish it.<\/p> <p>  No. 319A is an opening statement from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We will note and publish it.<\/p> <p>  The next items are category B correspondence.  The first item is correspondence dated 16 February 2017 from Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE.  The letter recommends that, before the Department and the HSE appear before the committee on 9 March 2017 to discuss the fair deal scheme, the committee visit a public residential community hospital.  We discussed this last week and I do not think a visit is feasible before 9 March.  However, following the Easter recess I propose that the secretary identifies a Tuesday morning to visit to a public residential community hospital and liaises with the members regarding their availability.  We will make some preliminary inquiries but we will hold over a definite decision.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 300B, 1 to 3, inclusive, is correspondence dated 17 February 2017 from Mr. Maurice Quinn, Secretary General of the Department of Defence.  This is a follow-up to an appearance by the Department before the committee on 26 January and a subsequent information request.  This was held over from last week and I propose that we hold it over again.  There is quite a lot of documentation, some of which deals with the sale of the Government jet and the health and safety issues in Baldonnel.  I have received some correspondence directly, and perhaps other members have also, in the past day or so from people who do not fully accept what they understand the Secretary General to be saying so I would like another week to consider the matter.  Can we hold that over and give people an opportunity to look at it?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Further correspondence, dated 20 February, is from the HSE with a briefing note for the committee on the High Court case relating to consultants pay.  We will note it.<\/p> <p>  No. 313B is correspondence dated 22 February from Noel Waters, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, in follow-up to his appearance before the committee on 2 February.  We can note and publish it, but perhaps it would be better to hold it over as we have been very busy with Project Eagle in recent weeks.  Will we hold it over as it is a voluminous document with 13 pages.  The reason we are holding some of these items over is that we have been having meetings on Project Eagle in private session and we did not get an opportunity to review them.  We will hold it over for another short period.  <\/p> <p>  Further correspondence, dated 22 February, is from the Central Bank correcting information that was sent to the committee regarding retention payments.  It is a minor correction of &euro;730.  That is in relation to the retention of staff.  We dealt with this issue at some point last summer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#B00100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Have they come back to us on the other issue that they were written to about?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#B00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>It must be a month since we wrote to them on that issue.

In 2015, the Vote recorded gross expenditure totalling &euro;1.2 billion, while the fund recorded expenditure totalling &euro;1.8 billion.<\/p><p>There are some transfers between the Vote and the fund but a consolidated statement of the Department's receipts and payments is not prepared.  While the Vote is mainly Exchequer-funded, the local government fund is mainly financed by motor tax receipts, approximately &euro;1.1 billion in 2015, and local property tax receipts, which amounted to &euro;469 million in 2015.<\/p><p> The breakdown of the Vote 34 expenditure in 2015 is indicated in the figure on screen.  This uses the programme structure as defined in the Vote.  The housing programme accounted for over half of the Vote expenditure in 2015.  Expenditure on this programme was &euro;646 million, which represented an increase of &euro;52 million year on year.  Almost all of this increase related to additional provision for local authority housing programmes.  The most significant increase in the Vote year on year was in respect of the local government programme.  Total expenditure in 2015 was &euro;275 million, compared with &euro;36 million in 2014.  The 2015 expenditure included a payment of &euro;241 million to the local government fund to provide a contribution towards the transfers from the fund to local authorities and a subvention of &euro;92 million paid to Irish Water.  Vote expenditure on the water services programme 2015 totalled &euro;131 million, an increase of &euro;94 million year on year.  The increase was due to the payment of household water conservation grants in 2015.  The grant scheme was administered on an agency basis by the Department of Social Protection but the related grants and agency administration costs were borne on Vote 34.  After appropriations-in-aid totalling &euro;46 million, the net surplus on the Vote at the end of 2015 amounted to &euro;84 million.  With the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, capital funding of &euro;41 million not spent in 2015 was carried over to 2016.  The remaining &euro;43 million was surrendered to the Exchequer.<\/p><p> Chapter 4 of my report aims to present an overview of the level of funding provided by central Government to local authorities and the purposes for which that funding is provided.  Relevant information is drawn together from a number of accounts to get a full picture of the complex financial transfers and of trends over time.  Central Government transfers to local authorities of almost &euro;2 billion in 2015 represented just over 34% of the 2008 level of those transfers when they peaked at around &euro;5.8 billion.  The decline reflects the general reductions in public expenditure since 2008 and the transfer of certain responsibilities away from local authorities.  As evident from the figure which can now be shown on screen, the reduction in transfers has impacted most on local authority capital spending.  This impacted especially in the areas of social housing and roads.  In 2014 the Department provided general purpose grant funding to local authorities mainly for their day-to-day activities.  General purpose grants were discontinued in 2015 and were replaced by annual local property tax allocations.  This resulted in adjustments of funding for some local authorities.  Under the 80% retention rule provided for in the local property tax regime, 19 local authorities would have been allocated less funding in 2015 than in 2014.  However, equalisation funding of &euro;102 million from the residual 20% of the tax was utilised to bring those local authorities to the same level of funding that they received in 2014.  The retention based allocations for 12 authorities and these were mainly large urban authorities in commuter belt counties were some &euro;177 million higher than the amounts they received in 2014.  Total funding of &euro;239 million was provided to those local authorities in 2015 but they were directed to allocate &euro;131 million for housing services and &euro;22 million for road services, with the balance of &euro;86 million available for general or discretionary purposes within those local authorities.  In addition to the &euro;2 billion funding provided by Departments and agencies in 2015, an amount of &euro;427 million was transferred directly from the Exchequer in the form of once-off payments to local authorities.  This was to allow the local authorities to repay borrowing from the Housing Finance Agency that had been used in the past to fund local authority water supply and treatment infrastructure that had since transferred to Irish Water.<\/p><p> Chapter 4 also provides a brief overview of the key structures in place for the oversight of local authority finances.  These are the local government audit service and the National Oversight and Audit Commission.  I previously reported on the Department's implementation of the land aggregation scheme and this was examined by the committee on 5 February 2015.  Under the land aggregation scheme, local authorities could transfer to the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, referred to as the Housing Agency, surplus residential development land on which there were outstanding loans.  The loans were due for repayment to the Housing Finance Agency.  Between 2010 and 2013, the Department approved 73 sites for transfer with a total land area of 247 ha.  My previous report, which was completed in mid-2014, found that there were very significant delays in effecting the transfers of many sites to the Housing Agency.  By July 2016, however, we found that all but six of the approved sites had transferred.<\/p><p> The focus has consequently now shifted to a strategy for the management, utilisation and ultimate development of these and other sites.  Progress in developing and utilising the sites as at mid-2016 can be summarised as follows: no housing units had yet been completed but development had been approved in respect of 185 homes on seven sites and proposals were being worked up in the context of another 180 homes across five sites; and 1.6 ha of land on two sites had been transferred to the Department of Education and Skills for a school and to a community organisation for a children's recreational facility to promote sustainable communities.  However, 93% of the sites had either no proposed development in place or had not yet been transferred to the Housing Agency.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee on developments in regard to the acquired land since the reporting date.<\/p><p> The key agencies in respect of 2015 would have been the Environmental Protection Agency, Pobal, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, the Western Development Commission and the Residential Tenancies Board.  There are a couple of other non-commercial State bodies which do not fall within my remit, namely, the Housing Finance Agency and the Local Government Management Agency.  I thought that might be useful to the committee in its deliberations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#D02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488445200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be here this morning as Accounting Officer to assist the committee in its examination of Vote 34 and Chapters 4 and 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report for 2015 dealing with central Government funding and local authorities and progress on the land aggregation scheme, respectively.  As requested, I have provided some advance briefing for the meeting and will keep these opening comments short.<\/p> <p>  The State's public finances moved further along the pathway to sustainability in 2015 and, in that context, the Department's gross expenditure for the year totalled &euro;1.24 billion, some 36% higher than the outturn for 2014.  The Department had significant achievements in 2015 in delivering on key policies and programmes.  Our overall objectives were to improve the quality of life of citizens and communities to foster economic and social development and to enhance environmental protection.  In overall terms, the Department was assigned over 13% of the total Exchequer capital allocation in 2015 towards implementing major housing, water, rural development and other programs.  In 2015 several critical areas benefited from increased funding, most notably housing where spend increased by 9% over 2014.  Total spending from the vote on the various housing programmes, including the provision of social housing and improvement in regeneration measures amounted to almost &euro;646 million in 2015.  Local authorities also self-funded housing programmes from local property tax receipts in the amount of &euro;119 million, bringing the gross spend on housing programmes to &euro;765 million.<\/p><p>This was used to meet housing needs through a range of programmes, including the local authority construction and acquisition programme, the approved housing body programme, leasing and the rental accommodation scheme.  In total, the housing needs of 13,375 households were met under our housing programmes in 2015.<\/p><p> As members will be aware, responsibility for the provision of water services transferred from local authorities to Irish Water on 1 January 2014.  A sum of &euro;222 million was provided by the Government via the Central Fund for Irish Water to meet its capital expenditure in 2015.  This funding helped to progress capital projects set out in the Irish Water capital plan, including key water and wastewater infrastructural projects.  In addition, &euro;399 million was provided for Irish Water from the local government fund in 2015 by way of an operational subvention.  It funded the allowance of 21,000 litres of free water provided for all children in the State, the cost of capital and domestic water charges at the levels set out in the Water Services Act 2014 and the cost of providing a general subsidy to meet the cost of services to reduce the level of unit charge in line with the provisions of the Act.  The water programme expenditure figure in 2015 for the Department also included &euro;94 million for the water conservation grant introduced in that year.  As at 30 June 2015, a total of 1.308 million households had registered with Irish Water and were, therefore, eligible to apply for the grant in 2015.  The Department of Social Protection which administered the water conservation grant on behalf of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government made grant payments totalling just over &euro;89 million in respect of 890,104 applications under the scheme.  A small number of residual payments continue to be made to householders who have an entitlement to the 2015 water conservation grant.  Capital funding of &euro;16.88 million was also provided under the rural water programme, which included support for the group water scheme sector.  In addition, &euro;18.88 million was provided for the sector from the local government fund by way of operational subsidies.<\/p><p> The chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the funding of local authorities by central government provides an overview of local authority expenditure and income figures since 2006.  It details the range of programmes for which local authorities are responsible and the range of funding sources.  Transfers of funding from central government sources to local authorities in 2015 totalled almost &euro;2 billion.  The local government fund accounted for 43% of this amount.  There was continued change in the operation of the fund in 2015, with the ending of the general purpose grant payments and the introduction of the local property tax, LPT, paid to local authorities through the fund.  Some 80% of LPT revenue was retained locally to fund vital public services, while the remaining 20% was redistributed to provide top-up funding for local authorities with a lower local property tax base due to variances in property values across the State.  These measures were necessary to create a balanced system of funding across local authorities.  Income into the local government fund in 2015 totalled over &euro;1.8 billion, made up of motor tax receipts of &euro;1.1 billion, local property tax revenue of &euro;469 million and a payment from the Exchequer of &euro;241 million.  The main payments from the local government fund in 2015 included LPT payments to local authorities of &euro;459 million, a payment of &euro;355 million for the maintenance of non-national roads and public transport to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a payment to the Exchequer of &euro;481 million, as well as a payment of &euro;399 million as a subvention to Irish Water.<\/p><p> On accountability, as the committee will be aware, under the existing policy and legislative framework, the Local Government Audit Service provides for independent scrutiny of the financial stewardship of local authorities and other local bodies.  It audits local government bodies in accordance with a statutory code of audit practice, thereby fostering the highest standards of financial management and public accountability.  Where the annual audit has been completed by the local government auditor, the local authority is required to furnish a copy of the audited financial statement and any associated statutory auditor's report to every member of the local authority for his or her consideration at the next practicable council meeting.  Scrutiny arrangements for local government were also enhanced in recent years, with the establishment of the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC.  The NOAC scrutinises local government performance in fulfilling national, regional and local mandates and value for money where State funds are channelled through local government and supports the development of best practice and enhanced efficiency in the performance of local government functions.  <\/p><p> The most significant aspect of the Department's community programme in 2015 involved the commencement of the new social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, which was rolled out in April that year and will run until the end of this year.  Its aim is to tackle poverty, social exclusion and long-term unemployment through local engagement and partnership between disadvantaged individuals, community organisations, public sector agencies and other stakeholders.  SICAP expenditure in the nine month period April to December 2015 was &euro;26.8 million.  A total of 36,854 disadvantaged individuals were engaged under SICAP on a one-to-one basis, while 2,506 local community groups were assisted.<\/p><p> Chapter 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report for 2015 deals with progress under the land aggregation scheme.  The scheme was established in 2010 to support local authorities by alleviating the financial burden in servicing land loans that had been taken out from the Housing Finance Agency for the purpose of acquiring land for social and affordable housing developments.  It closed in December 2013.  At the time the Department had approved 73 sites, with a total area of 247 ha, for inclusion in the scheme.  At the time of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report 67 sites accepted into the scheme had been transferred to the housing agency.  As of February 2017, this figure has increased to 71.  In 2013, as a consequence of continuing pressure on Exchequer resources at the time and following a review of the scheme carried out in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it became evident that further expenditure on the scheme in accepting new applications was not sustainable.  Accordingly, in December that year local authorities were notified of the ending of the scheme.<\/p><p> The matters to which I have referred illustrate the broad range of programmes and activities for which my Department had responsibility in 2015.  I should point out that, with the reconfiguration of Departments when the new Government took office in May 2016, the bulk of the Department's environmental functions transferred to the new Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, while a range of rural development functions were transferred to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  <\/p><p> My colleagues and I will be happy to respond to questions or deal with issues that will emerge in the course of the committee's work today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy for his contribution.

I welcome Mr. John McCarthy and his staff.  Mr. McCarthy covered a huge amount in his opening statement.  He began by talking about housing so I will start there as well if that is okay.  Chapter 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2015 report relates to progress on land aggregation.  In layman's terms, it sets out the progress that is being made with the construction of homes on 73 sites, across 610 acres, that are now in the ownership of the State centrally as opposed to through the local authority system.  This mini-NAMA scheme is positive because it gets bad land deals off the books of local councils.<\/p> <p>  A landbank of 28 acres in the Farganstown area of Navan in my own county of Meath, which had been bought for &euro;22 million, did not make it into the scheme.  Meath County Council is now paying interest and principal repayments of &euro;500,000 a year to try to service that debt.  The 28-acre site in question is just lying there with no movement on the social housing for which it was purchased.  The council could be spending &euro;500,000 a year on front-line services, but instead it has to service its debt in respect of this landbank.<\/p> <p>  It is positive that 73 sites across Ireland have made it into the scheme.  It is pointed out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that as of July 2016, no progress had been made with the development of residential housing sites on 84% of the land acquired under the scheme.  In July 2016, there was inaction on 84% of landbanks under a scheme that stopped taking in landbanks in December 2013.  Progress is being made with 12 of the 73 sites that are involved in this scheme.  Some 185 units on seven sites have been approved and a further 180 units on five sites are in train.  How many other specific sites will see ground broken in 2017 on foot of the site visits conducted by departmental officials in 2015 and 2016?  I do not need to tell Mr. McCarthy that this is the biggest issue that arises at the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Even though the housing waiting list is the biggest thing that occupies public discourse, there is no movement on 610 acres of land that has been identified for housing.  How many plans are in place to make progress with these lands?  How quickly will these developments happen?  The narrative we hear over and again from county councils is that it is frustrating to make progress with schemes from concept to design to implementation.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to spell out to me, as succinctly as possible, how many of these sites will see progress in the coming year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#G00900","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488445200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  As it stands, there are 15 sites, involving just over 25 ha and 479 units of accommodation, at various stages in our construction pipeline.  At another four sites, involving 3.95 ha and approximately 180 units, projects are at an earlier stage of consideration and have not entered the pipeline.  A small number of pieces of other land have been used for education and other purposes.  I will try to put this into context for the Deputy.  This scheme was introduced for the very valid purpose of recognising the difficulties faced by local authorities in the aftermath of the economic collapse.

Moving on to chapter four on the funding of local government, one of the things that really frustrates people is how their money is spent.  It is not the payment of tax, rather how it is spent.  Ask any resident in this country who pays property tax their view on what they expected to get, what they thought they would get and what they actually got.  I know the value of the service of local government.  I spent 17 years on a council.  The reason I ask is because when the precursor to the LPT, the household charge, was introduced, every single house in this country received a glossy leaflet through the door encouraging them to pay the &euro;100, as it was at that time.  In bulletpoint form, it set out where that money was going.  There were references to parks, community facilities and estate maintenance.  Those were the bulletpoints highlighted to encourage people to pay this charge when the county councils were collecting it.  Of course, we saw what happened.  They did not collect it.<\/p> <p>  People in most towns have no parks and have to pay another &euro;100 on top of their LPT to their local residents' association to pay for the cutting of grass in their estate.  Ask those people what their memory is of the promise on that leaflet.  When the LPT comes in and the collection is the guts of 100% - we had Mr. Cody before the committee from Revenue, which is doing a fine job in that respect as it brings in nearly &euro;500 million a year - one would think that local government would be enhanced rather than impoverished.  One would think that it would be able to provide the services that were mentioned in that leaflet some years ago.  One would think it would make the critical difference in providing the type of community facilities on the ground level that would actually make a difference, as opposed to maintaining the nuts, bolts and wages of just keeping the county councils on the go.<\/p> <p>  Low and behold, when we looked at those budgets the year the LPT was introduced, most councils were no better off.  They were no worse off, but they were no better off.  The general purpose grant, as the witness outlined, disappeared.  The LPT, which the households were paying themselves, just subbed in for it.  Residents were wondering where their LPT is going.  We could only say that it was going into the income side of things.  There was no scenario in which county councils actually had more money because what was given with one hand was taken away with another.<\/p> <p>  As we can see in the figures, funding to councils in this country went down by 70% in that period from 2007 to 2014.  Even leaving aside the transfer of powers in some aspects, it is massively underfunded.  Can the witness understand people's frustration and can he explain that little movement to me?  When the LPT came in, we were no better off in providing the services that people expect and require in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#H01100","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488445200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>In response to the first question, I can certainly understand the frustrations of the public generally in terms of its wish to have services delivered in an efficient way that delivers for local communities.

With regard to the move from the old general purpose grants to the LPT, the policy position adopted was that no local authority should end up being worse off in the transition.  The approach taken in order to achieve that was that each local authority would retain 80% of the LPT collected in its area locally and the balance of 20% would be used in order to achieve that equalisation function to ensure that no local authority would be worse off.  What that has meant is that some local authorities made the transition on an equal basis.  They lost nothing and gained nothing.

At their lowest point, the figure was at 26,500, so it was a huge reduction in staff numbers.  I suppose the system delivered considerable efficiency through a range of initiatives in order to be able to try to continue to deliver the range of services despite all of that.  Staff numbers have now started to increase in local authorities and particularly in the housing area we have sanctioned a very significant number of posts in order to allow authorities support the delivery of their housing programmes.

I want to move on to the second question regarding housing.  The witness responded to a question from an Teachta Cassells about the four-stage process in which a local authority applies for funding for social housing and the time it takes for the cheque finally to arrive.  My understanding is that the average wait time is about 18 months.  That has been a difficulty because there has been some tension between local authorities, CEOs and councils and the Department in terms of money being available, the local authority saying \"yes\", but the process being very difficult, cumbersome and it taking an awfully long time to draw down the funding.<\/p> <p>  The witness told us there was a review, which there was.  This is the important part.  What we need to do is shorten that timeframe down from 18 months.  I heard the witness speaking about the changes to a one-stage process for proposals below 15 units and costing less than &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million.  The witness might comment on the de-risk element of that.  My understanding from local authority CEOs is that the risk is all on the side of the local authority.  To stick with the broader issue of the four-stage process, what proposals are in the pipeline at the moment to reduce that timeframe?  That is the critical issue here.  That is one question on housing.<\/p> <p>  The second question relates to the acquisition of vacant properties.  Does the Department have an analysis of how many vacant properties there are?  I understand there are two schemes.  One is the repair and leasing scheme.  What percentage of vacant properties overall is the Department targeting under that scheme?  There is also the Housing Agency acquisition programme.  The witness might talk us through what measures are in place.  I do not know whether the witness has seen a report from the Simon Community today in which it states the need to make greater use of vacant properties, which I support.  There are two issues here: the four-stage process for acquisitions or new builds for local authorities and why it takes so long, and the issue of vacant properties.

This issue relates to a housing development being undertaken as part of the Ballymun regeneration project.  It was a situation where pyrite was found.  It goes back to 2007 and 2008.  When presented with the situation that arose at the time, we engaged with Ballymun Regeneration Limited on the appropriate response.  There were two options which were considered.  One was to continue with the existing contract and ask the existing contractor to complete the work and pay for it without any determination of legal liability which would be determined at a later stage.  The other was to terminate the contractor's employment and secure someone else to come in and do it.  Both of those options were considered from risk and legal perspectives and the choice was ultimately made that the best outcome from the taxpayers' perspective would be to continue the employment of the existing contractor, remedy the work and bring the project to a conclusion.  The project was very significantly advanced at that stage.  All of the financial, legal and risk factors were taken into account.<\/p> <p>  Where the issue of a loan came into play was that in wanting to progress the project to completion, we were faced with a situation where there was no legal certainty around where the ultimate liability for the defective material would be placed.  We wanted an avenue through which to provide space for the additional public funds that were going to be provided to be recovered in due course, including if the contractor who was engaging in legal proceedings was to get a successful outcome.  Even though it is ten years on, those legal proceedings have not yet concluded.  There are a whole range of other legal proceedings, and I want to be careful about what I say, ongoing on a similar issue but Dublin City Council or BRL are not involved in those.  This was a vehicle with the taxpayers' interests in mind to try to provide an avenue through which moneys could be recovered at a stage down the road, including if the outcome of legal proceedings which are still going on went in a particular direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#T03200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I want to be very careful and talk in principle.

Mr. John McCarthy is the Accounting Officer and I want him to provide a detailed note of the situation with regard to the assets and liabilities of the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency.  I ask him to send us on a note because five years after the agency was established, it is extraordinary that we are having such a discussion at this point.  Leaving aside the Comptroller and Auditor General, the primary responsibility to produce the accounts lies with the company.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is only the auditor.<\/p><p>There is a board of directors and it is its responsibility to know those things in the first place.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will audit it after they have signed off their accounts.  I ask for a note on that and on the uncollected non-principal private residence issue we mentioned.<\/p><p> I have a last topic to mention.  I apologise, but these are all specific issues that have crossed my desk as a Deputy.  I put down a parliamentary question on this last year and Mr. McCarthy might have seen correspondence from me on it.  It relates to the local authority mortgage protection insurance scheme.  In my constituency - and this is reflected everywhere - the cost of the local authority mortgage protection insurance scheme, which every person with a housing loan must join, is three or four times more expensive than what is available in the private market to people who do not have their loans with a local authority.  It is not 2% or even 30% more expensive, it is 300% to 400% more expensive.  In the private market, it was made illegal years ago for the mortgage provider to force the mortgage holder to take out mortgage protection insurance with that company.  Customers are free to shop around.  Seemingly, what is good for 85% of the population does not seem to be good enough for those who have loans from the local authority.  They are still being obliged legally to have mortgage protection insurance with the scheme.<\/p><p> That is a point but the real point is that it is several hundred percent dearer than what is available in the private sector.  When people run into arrears and one seeks to negotiate with a finance officer, one sees what looks like a phenomenal amount of mortgage protection insurance compared to what one deals with where a person owes money to a bank.  It is utterly unfair.  I know Mr. McCarthy will tell me there is extra coverage, that it covers a person until he or she is 65 and that if he or she dies, he or she gets &euro;3,000 extra.  I know what the benefits are from the reply to the parliamentary question and correspondence from the Housing Finance Agency.  The most recent reply I received from the Minister last year stated that as part of the upcoming retendering process, the relevant committee would seek to secure with effect from 1 January 2017 the most appropriate insurance cover at the best value for money for local authority borrowers.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to provide the committee with a detailed assessment of the improvements made to the scheme which were achieved on 1 January 2017.<\/p><p> I have asked the Department to give me the detail of how much money has been collected in the scheme and how much has been paid out.  That has not been provided.  The Department said it was not its affair.  I have written to the Housing Finance Agency which says it does not have the information either.  I have written to the local government managers' association or whatever the group involved is and it said it did not have the information.  I am told the mortgage protection insurance scheme protection committee cannot provide it.  It is a sub-committee of the City and County Management Association which cannot provide me with the information.  The local authorities obviously do not have it and the Housing Finance Agency has not been able to provide that information.  The Department is on that also.  Despite PQs, the Department cannot provide this information.  What is the total amount paid by local authority mortgage holders for mortgage protection insurance for each of the last couple of years and what payouts have been made?  They are being severely penalised because they have nowhere to go.  If they get a loan from the agency, they are forced to get this insurance.  It is not fair.<\/p><p> The Department says the current underwriter is Generali PanEurope with Marsh Ireland acting as its insurance administrator.  The PQ reply says that financial information specific to the operation of the local authority MPI project is commercially sensitive.  We want to lift that veil of commercial sensitivity.  The Department knows what I am looking for.  I do not accept the answer I was given.  How many people have local authority mortgages in the country under regular mortgages and shared-ownership mortgages schemes, approximately?  Somebody across from me must know.  How many local authority mortgages are out there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#V05100","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488445200,"counter":678,"content":"<p>If the Chairman gives me a second, I will get that figure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030200002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":679,"content":"<p>Mr. McCarthy will understand that I have gone to the four groups of people involved in administering this one.

We also welcome the opportunity to engage with the committee on the issue of tracker mortgages.<\/p> <p>  First, I will give a brief outline of our strategy.  It is important to begin by letting the committee know we have just commenced the second year of an ambitious three-year programme.  In 2017 we will continue to adapt our processes in response to feedback received from service users.  The three-year change programme was devised following the completion of an independent strategic and operational review into the operation of the offices of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman.  This review was commissioned jointly by the then Pensions Ombudsman, Paul Kenny, and I.  The review report, which is available on our website, recommended that we should adopt a more proportionate, informal and preventative approach to dispute resolution.  Having consulted widely with stakeholders including those who had made complaints against financial service providers, the review delivered a number of key recommendations at the end of 2015 which we commenced implementing in February 2016.  This involved a major change programme, which commenced in February 2016.  This has delivered significant change in how we manage complaints.  As a result of these changes, we now undertake considerably more direct interaction with both consumers and providers to deliver a faster, more effective and efficient service.<\/p><p>Our 2017 strategy will continue to raise the bar on consumer protection and complaint handling through the use of mediation techniques and, where disputes are not resolved by agreement between the parties, through fair and impartial investigation and adjudication.  I am happy to report high levels of satisfaction from those using the new service.  A structured survey of both complainants and providers who use the new dispute resolution service has provided a positive endorsement of the effectiveness of the service.  The results prove that the newly implemented processes are working well and that the changes have had a positive impact.  The feedback shows us that we have laid a strong foundation on which we will continue to develop our services and improve how we interact with our stakeholders.  Our strategy for 2017 seeks to build on that firm foundation as we continue to improve our services into the future.<\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, the Government has decided to amalgamate the offices of the Financial Service Ombudsman and Pensions Ombudsman.  We engaged with the committee in October last year as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Bill which, when enacted, will provide the legislative basis for the merger.  We also engaged on that occasion with the committee on Deputy Doherty's Private Members' Bill relating to the Financial Services Ombudsman.<\/p><p> I was appointed Financial Services Ombudsman in April 2015 and I was appointed Pensions Ombudsman in May 2016 under the Social Welfare and Pensions Act.  I currently hold both of those offices in separate capacities under the relevant legislation.  My colleague, Ms Cassidy, was appointed deputy Financial Services Ombudsman in January 2016.  She is the deputy ombudsman-designate for pensions.  As the current legislation does not provide for a deputy Pensions Ombudsman, she will not assume that element of her role until the necessary legislation is enacted.  We look forward to amalgamating fully both offices when the legislation is enacted and look forward to the enactment of other legislative measures that would bring greater protection for consumers.  In advance of the enactment of the legislation necessary for the merger, our 2017 strategy commits us to doing everything we can to make the amalgamation a success.  Both offices are now co-located and work in close co-operation, albeit under separate legislative provisions.  We are actively working with the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Protection to ensure a smooth amalgamation and successful and seamless delivery of the services.<\/p><p> Our core objectives, as set out in our strategic plan, are to operate an efficient, effective and fair dispute resolution process that mediates, investigates and adjudicates on consumer complaints; to provide an excellent customer service; to raise awareness of our work among the public and our stakeholders; to promote compliance by financial service providers with best practice in the provision of products and services; to support and develop the skills and competences of our staff in order to offer the best service to our users; to support the Financial Services Ombudsman council in its work; and to liaise with the Central Bank of Ireland, the Department of Finance, Oireachtas committees and other relevant bodies in order to improve the financial services market for consumers.  For each of these objectives, our 2017 strategy sets out key performance indicators and identifies the timeline and critical success factors.  The 2017 strategic plan has been developed by focusing on 2017, while also bearing in mind future years.<\/p><p> We will be happy to engage with the committee and answer any questions members have on the strategic plan, but before that I will use the remaining time to provide the committee with some information on tracker mortgages. <\/p><p> The long and well established role of an Ombudsman is to seek redress, to redress the difference in power and resources between the individual or the citizen and large institutions when resolving disputes.  This is particularly important when dealing with the inequality of arms that exists between a consumer and a financial service provider.  A time limit of six years for making complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman is set out in the current legislation.  Both the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Bill and Deputy Doherty's Private Members' Bill, which were considered by the committee last October, proposed an extension to the time limits for complaints.  We would very much welcome such an extension as it could be particularly beneficial in respect of complaints relating to mortgages or financial products with a medium to long-term life span.<\/p><p> Where I uphold a complaint, I have a wide range of powers available to me.  I can direct a financial service provider to pay compensation of up to &euro;250,000.  I can also direct rectification.  Such rectification can be very significant as it can involve putting a person back in a position that they were in before the complaint arose.  In some instances, such as where a person was denied a tracker mortgage or the incorrect interest rate was applied, this may potentially be more important than any compensation offered.   The office of the Financial Services Ombudsman has played an important role in tracker issues to date.  I assure the committee that I will use the extensive powers available to me to ensure that customers of financial service providers who do not receive their entitlement and who are treated unfairly will have access to redress through our office.  I will not be found wanting in using these powers as they were intended by the Oireachtas where I find the conduct of the financial service provider to be contrary to law, unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory.<\/p><p> I consider it beneficial to provide the committee with a brief background to the key events and timelines relating to tracker mortgages.  The Financial Services Ombudsman first began to receive complaints regarding tracker mortgages in 2009.  In fact, it might be more correct to say the end of 2008.  We first started dealing with them in 2009 but we received a small number of complaints in 2008.  The 2009 annual report of the then Financial Services Ombudsman included a case study involving a borrower who had been wrongly given the entitlement to return to a tracker rate following a period of fixed interest rate.<\/p><p> In 2009, 2010 and 2011, the Financial Services Ombudsman upheld a number of complaints and directed financial institutions to put complainants back on tracker mortgages.  Some of these findings were challenged in the High Court.  Of particular note, PTSB appealed four findings of the Financial Services Ombudsman to the High Court in 2011.  All four of these findings, issued by the Financial Services Ombudsman in July and August 2011, had directed the bank to reinstate the complainants' tracker mortgages.  In August 2012, the High Court delivered judgment in all four cases.  Two of the complaints were remitted back to the Financial Services Ombudsman for further consideration, while the bank was unsuccessful in the remaining two appeals.  In October 2012, the High Court gave PTSB leave to appeal to the Supreme Court against those two findings.  These two appeals were listed for hearing by the Supreme Court on 16 February 2015.  However, when they were listed for mention by the Court on 5 February 2015, they were withdrawn by the bank.  It was around this time that the Central Bank had commenced an enforcement investigation of PTSB, which resulted in some customers being returned to tracker mortgages and receiving redress.<\/p><p> Shortly after I was appointed in 2015, I commenced a comprehensive analysis of tracker mortgage complaints which had been decided by the Financial Services Ombudsman between 2009 and July 2015.  The aim of this analysis, which covered almost 500 findings over that period, was to inform the Central Bank of the various issues relating to tracker mortgages that the Financial Services Ombudsman had encountered.  We worked in co-operation with the Central Bank in line with the memorandum of understanding in place between the organisations and I presented the analysis to the Central Bank in November 2015.  I understand that this information was of assistance to the Central Bank in scoping the examination currently under way in all the banks.  As the committee is aware, the objective of the examination is to ensure that lenders conduct a complete review of their mortgage loan books to assess compliance with both contractual and regulatory requirements relating to tracker mortgages and, in situations where customer detriment is identified from the examination, to provide appropriate redress and compensation so as to ensure fair outcomes for customers of those lenders.  I support fully this objective of the Central Bank and my office has worked in close co-operation with it to ensure any information we hold that is useful in achieving this objective is made available to the bank.<\/p><p> I became aware in early 2016 from correspondence sent to a complainant who had received a finding from the Financial Services Ombudsman by her bank that at least one bank proposed to exclude customers who had brought complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman from the examination.  On becoming aware of this, I wrote to the CEOs of all the banks informing them that I was firmly of the view - which is shared by the Central Bank - that no mortgage holder who has made a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman should be treated any differently with regard to the examination by virtue of the fact of having made such a complaint, irrespective of the outcome.  I secured confirmation from each bank that no mortgage account holder coming within the scope of the examination will be treated any differently by the bank because a complaint has been made to the Financial Services Ombudsman.<\/p><p> Prior to and throughout the examination process, we have worked closely with the Central Bank and are in ongoing communication with complainants who have complaints with our office regarding their bank relating to tracker mortgages.  We are currently dealing with approximately 400 complaints relating to tracker mortgages.  In the vast majority of these, the mediation or investigation and adjudication of the complaint has been put on hold pending the outcome of the Central Bank examination.  The reason for this is twofold.  First, it will ensure that the Financial Services Ombudsman will have the fullest information available in arriving our decisions following an investigation and adjudication of the complaints because we will be able to take into account that additional information.  Second, it will ensure that complainants will remain and continue to have the right to have their complaint considered by the Financial Services Ombudsman if they are unhappy with the examination as it relates to them, which is very important.<\/p><p>If, having had his or her complaint on hold with the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, a complainant receives a proposal from their bank and the complainant advises the FSO that he or she is satisfied with that offer we will note that the matter has been settled and our file will be closed.  If, on the other hand, having put the complaint on hold with the FSO a complainant receives a proposal from his or her bank that is not acceptable or no proposal is offered, we then can progress the complaint.  There are a number of potential complaints we believe may arise following the completion of the examination process which the FSO may have to deal with.  These could include complaints that a person was not returned to his or her tracker mortgage at all or that they were not returned to a tracker mortgage at the correct time or at the correct margin.  Further, a complainant may well be returned to his or her tracker mortgage at the right rate and right time but may not be satisfied with the level of compensation offered.  Indeed, there may also be complaints about the process itself, for instance, the manner in which the claim for redress was dealt with as part of the examination.  I remind the committee of the assurances I gave here last October, that I am, along with the deputy ombudsman and our entire team, fully committed to using any powers afforded to the proposed financial services and pensions ombudsman, our existing powers and any enhanced powers given by the Oireachtas to the fullest possible extent.  <\/p><p> I can assure the committee that together with my team, I will play my part in providing redress for complainants to the FSO where I am of the view that the conduct of their financial service provider was contrary to law, unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory.  I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity and we are happy to take any questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030200002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Deering","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488448800,"counter":845,"content":"<p>I welcome both Mr. Deering and Ms Cassidy to the committee.

We will require of the provider whatever information is given to the Central Bank on foot of the examination.  It will have to provide us with that same information, which will enhance our investigation role into it.  The other reason is that with the Financial Services Ombudsman, as indeed with any body such as ours, there is only one bite of the cherry.  If people got an adjudication from us now, they could not have the same complaint dealt with later.  From our experience, there is no guarantee that even if people get something from the redress, they will get the correct redress.  Someone might get a tracker back but it might be at an interest rate that is not the correct one or it might not come back from the time that it ought to have.  What we are trying to do is preserve complainants' ability and rights in this regard.

Our legislation was ahead of its time.  Mediation was not quite as well known or popular then but our legislation is very clear that the financial services ombudsman shall resolve disputes by mediation and, where necessary, by investigation and adjudication.  As such, it was the preferred option.  There are about three more statements within the legislation providing that it should be informal, without regard to technical or legal form and all of that.  Yet, we developed in a different way.  I gather that there is a Second Reading in the House today of the Mediation Bill.  At both European and national level, mediation is a preferred option.  During mediation week a couple of months ago, Ms Cassidy and I visited the Four Courts and heard the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court and the President of the District Court all pushing for mediation.  There are many reasons it is the best solution.  We discovered in our research that providers misunderstood mediation and did not actually understand how it operates.  It was about overcoming some of those misunderstandings and fears.<\/p> <p>  Internationally, I note our counterparts in the UK.  We have a staff of 34, including an ombudsman and deputy ombudsman.  In the UK, they have an ombudsman, 300 ombudsmen and a staff of 4,000.  It is a very different scale but they are hugely into mediation.  We looked as part of our research at New Zealand and Australia where we saw telephone mediation in place.  I had experienced telephone mediation through the labour relations agencies in Northern Ireland which do a lot of it.

That is not what the role of the ombudsman is about.

There are differences in the two approaches.  The Government legislation is broader in that it merges the Financial Services Ombudsman with the Pensions Ombudsman.

Deputy Quinlivan is correct.  As time goes on, fewer tracker mortgage complaints will be able to come through our office.  The real complexity around the removal of the six-year rule is the extent of retrospection.  I am unsure of the extent at this stage.  It is a complex area.

If a borrower has been on the wrong rate for a year, it is bad, but not nearly as bad as the implications of being on it for a long time.  Let us suppose we were examining a case today.  Several questions arise.  What is the correct rate the borrower should have been on?  When should that have been applied?  How much has the person lost?  This is what I call the rectification aspect of our work.  Rectification involves putting a borrower back in the position that he should have been in.

The information that insurance companies give is, probably, in terms of insurance, one of the biggest difficulties that we deal with.  The issue is around it being clear.  We had a discussion in our office yesterday.  Something on which I will be engaging with the insurance companies, for example, is when people take out health insurance or travel insurance and they are asked do they have pre-existing conditions.  Any of us here could have a conversation about pre-existing conditions.  What I think a pre-existing condition is may be different to what somebody else deems it.  That is okay.  The person states he or she does not have and he or she travels.  Then, in six months or a year, something happens, one makes a claim and one is told, \"You had an X-ray five months before you travelled which has now shown up that you have a condition.\"  We believe, particularly in phone calls and in written correspondence, there is an onus on insurance companies to explain in detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030200002#N02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Deering"},{"type":"speech","time":1488448800,"counter":1004,"content":"<p>Can the Financial Services Ombudsman make them do that and to explain what is involved in layman's language so that the customer does not become lost in the course of the explanation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030200002#N02400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488448800,"counter":1005,"content":"<p>We can uphold a complaint.

The script I have circulated can be taken as read.  I will make a few brief points at the outset.<\/p> <p>  I hope the 2017 Revised Estimates can be seen as a practical example of how the Government is endeavouring to put the health service on a more sustainable financial footing and to allow the HSE to set realistic and achievable targets for service areas in the year ahead.  On many occasions over the years, when health Ministers have come to this committee to consider Health Estimates, they have been looking at very different vistas from the vista we are looking at now as we consider how the health service is being funded in 2017.  When the new Government came into office in 2016, it was able to provide additional funding to the health service.  As a result, last year marked the first time in many years that the health sector was able to come in on budget in 2016 without the need for a Supplementary Estimate.  This tells us that when the health service is funded adequately and expenditure in the service is carefully and closely monitored, we can ensure the health service comes in on budget.  Coming in on budget is not just about meeting an accounting target or ticking a box; it means that any additional resources the Oireachtas decides to allocate to the health service can be spent on services that benefit patients.  This allows us to move towards delivering the kind of public health service we all want to deliver.<\/p> <p>  I am keenly aware that there is significant concern about the waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures that are being experienced by patients.  We had a lengthy discussion about this at the joint committee last week.  I said on that occasion that the HSE was about to submit waiting list plans, including a specific plan for scoliosis, to me.  The Department of Health has now received those plans.  It is considering them and engaging with the HSE on them.  I intend to share the plans with members of this committee very shortly.  The overriding aims - that by the end of October, no patient will have to wait longer than 15 months for a day case or inpatient procedure or an outpatient appointment; and that by the end of this year, no child will have to wait longer than four months for a scoliosis procedure - have not changed.  Those targets have been set by the director general of the HSE.  I am very grateful to him for taking this issue as seriously as it should be taken.  We were all appalled to learn about the lengthy times people are having to wait.  The achievement of the four-month target will bring this country into line with the NHS practice in relation to scoliosis and the NHS timelines.<\/p> <p>  As Deputies can see from the documentation that has been provided, these Revised Estimates provide for additional investment in acute and emergency services, representing an increase of &euro;90 million on the revised allocation in 2016.  The additional funding that is being provided to the National Treatment Purchase Fund will bring its budget to &euro;20 million this year.  This will increase to &euro;55 million in 2018.  A sum of &euro;40 million is being provided on a recurring basis for the winter initiative.  This is crucial because it means that as we move towards the end of this winter - one would not think it from the weather today -  we will be able to plan at an earlier stage for next winter.  It is my intention that this work will get under way in the Department and the HSE very shortly.  Funding is also being provided for the extension of the medical card to all children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  Deputies will have noted that a Bill facilitating this extension was published this morning.  I know the co-operation of all parties will be available to ensure the Bill in question passes all Stages in both Houses by the end of the month.  I think we should all be working towards that target.  Deputies will be aware that reductions in prescription charges for all medical card holders over the age of 70 and their dependants came into effect yesterday.  This measure, which will benefit 390,000 people in this country, is a first step in advancing the key commitment in the programme for Government to reduce the cost of medicines for all our citizens.<\/p> <p>  In the mental health area, progress is being made in developing services in line with the model set out in A Vision for Change.  Additional funding has been made available for the disability services directorate, encompassing the full year cost of school leavers.  This has been a very thorny issue for a number of years because adequate additional funding has not been provided to deal with the number of new school leavers coming on board every year.  Those full-year costs are being met this year.<\/p><p>There were additional therapy support costs as well as costs incurred from complying with HIQA standards.  There is a significant commitment to the fair deal nursing home support scheme and I hope there will be progress this year in trying to develop a policy platform to have a similar scheme in place in terms of a statutory home care scheme.  Given the Houses of the Oireachtas provide such significant levels of funding to the HSE to deliver a health service that we all want to see and work towards, it is important that we have a performance and accountability framework in place that can monitor it.  My statement, which I have circulated, outlines how the framework works.  We have secured a significant increase in funding for the health services in recent years, but that does not mean that I, or anyone else, should underestimate the significant challenges involved in the delivery of a safe and efficient health service for the Irish people.  Finally, while many of our discussions tend to be on current expenditure, on Monday I will be ten months in this job and I have seen, as I have travelled around our houses, a real deficit in capital spending.  The Government has a capital review coming up this summer which will see &euro;2.36 billion in additional capital allocated across Government.  Additional capital spending in health will see additional benefits and efficiencies in the interests of our patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#B00400","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1042,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement.

It will take some time though because the financial systems in the HSE will need to be adapted to allow for it in the context of the financial reform programme that is currently under way.  In the interim though, the appendices to the Revised Estimates for the health Vote have been constructed along programme lines.

I looked through the various briefings when preparing for this committee hearing. When we look at section 3 of my Department's briefing, which is the performance information section by section and directorate by directorate, we have a sense of what the HSE did in 2015, what it did in 2016 versus its targets in 2016 and what it intends to do in 2017.

We can see straight away the increases in the salaries, wages and allowances.  Presumably they relate to the consultants and medical staff.  I hope that the consultants, nurses, GPs and other medical staff, as opposed to administration, take a fair share of the expenditure.  People will say that we must have administrators, which is true, but we also must have the practitioners.

Last week at this committee we had a detailed discussion on the increased numbers of people working for the health service.  A number of Deputies and Senators raised the issue of the growth in administration and management.  The national director of HR has committed to giving a report to the committee showing a more detailed breakdown.  From my initial inquiries, I would make the point that we need to be careful in presuming that everyone in the admin-management section is not carrying out an important role in terms of the delivery of clinical programme.  For example, a clinical nurse manager on a ward is an important piece of our health service infrastructure that is recognised by our trade union movements and nurse representative organisations as a crucial piece relating to patient safety and the operation of wards.  The role may well end up being classified as administration or admin-management, but a patient going through a hospital today will see a benefit from having that person on the ground.  In addition, the delivery of a number of other clinical programmes will require other people in that category.<\/p> <p>  I could not agree more with the Deputy in terms of his question regarding our desire to increase the number of people working on the front line of the health service.  I am conscious, as we speak at this committee meeting this morning, that the INMO is about to engage with my Department, the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at the Workplace Relations Commission.  I hope it is a fruitful and constructive engagement because it is essential in the interests of all of our patients.  We had detailed and productive discussions with the INMO on a range of issues over the past couple of months on recruitment and retention.  It is fair to say that we made progress on quite a number of them, including having for the first time in a number of years a fully funded workforce plan for nursing at a much earlier time of the cycle.  It is also fair to say, not that I speak for the INMO, that there are some areas where we did not make as much progress.  This relates to how some of the retention measures interact with the process that is going on in terms of the Public Sector Pay Commission and the Lansdowne Road successor talks that will follow.  I hope the Workplace Relations Commission can help make progress in that regard today and over the weekend.  It is not in any of our interests to see industrial unrest in the health service from next week on.  We have already made progress in alleviating two other potential industrial relations disputes in the health sector.<\/p><p>If we were here just over a week ago, we would have been talking about threatened industrial action from the IMO with regard to non-consultant hospital doctors.  That has now been satisfactorily resolved.  We would also have been talking about action from next Tuesday by SIPTU health care support staff.  I am very pleased that a way forward was found with SIPTU in that regard.  I thank it for its constructive engagement.  We had three disputes about ten days ago.  Two have been resolved or put into a process towards resolution and one remains outstanding, but work is ongoing there.  As the Deputy knows, we intend to hire 1,000 additional nurses this year.  I accept the INMO's point of view that we lost an awful lot of nurses.  Numbers have been growing, but I say that while accepting that there is still a way for them to grow to get back to the levels they were at before the crash.  I do not disagree with the Deputy's assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#C00800","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>The Minister mentioned the industrial disputes, two of which have been headed off at the pass and one which I understand is on its way to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.

Where did we get the wriggle room from in terms of being able to settle?  The settlement with the doctors is fairly substantial, as I understand it.  It is the living out allowance, which I think is in or around &euro;3,000 per person.  The SIPTU settlement is obviously more complicated because it is a longer-term solution and involves making good commitments that should have been costed.  These commitments were given, but it was regrettable that the staff had to ballot to get it.  However, they got it and that is good news.<\/p> <p>  I wish to talk about flexibility.

If one looks at a map of Ireland now, as I did recently with the palliative care people in the HSE, there is significant hospice coverage around the country with a number of blackspots, if I may call them that, intended to be filled in within the coming years.  Some of those are Cavan and Monaghan, the midlands and my own county of Wicklow.  There are a couple of obvious places on the map.<\/p> <p>  With regard to actual palliative care services, let us look at the increased provision and increased targets this year in the document I circulated from the Department.  Some of them are worth putting on the record.  For access to specialist palliative care services in the community provided within seven days in the normal place of residence, a target of 91.5% was set for 2016.  We achieved 95%, with a view to maintaining that 95% target this year.  The number of patients in receipt of specialist palliative care in the community in the reporting month was 3,341 in 2016 and will be 3,620 in 2017.  Access to specialist palliative inpatient beds provided with seven days was achieved at a rate of 96.8%.  Our target for this year is 98%.  The number accessing specialist inpatient beds - this is a new key performance indicator that was not in last year - has a target of 3,555 for each reporting month this year.<\/p> <p>  The number of children in the care of the children's outreach nursing and specialist palliative care team is a very important and emotive area.  We have set new key performance indicators for this year.  There were 453 last year.  The number of children in the care of the children's outreach nursing team has a new target of 269 for 2017.  The target number of children in the care of the children's specialist palliative care team in Crumlin hospital or in Temple Street for each of the reporting months is 20 for 2017.  That is a new target for this year as well.  This is an area in which substantive progress is being made and that is reflected in the figures I have outlined.  It is also reflected in the great work that the Irish Hospice Foundation has done with the Department over a sustained period and in the evaluation report on children's palliative care, which was published only a matter of months ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#D00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1054,"content":"<p>As an add-on to that, in my area in County Clare, there are excellent community palliative care services.

It is a much bleaker map if we look at the palliative care available for children.  Paediatric end-of-life care and palliative care is sorely lacking.  I was in Donegal the week before last and I met Ms Ashling Nibbs and Ms Gina Grant from Our Children's Voice.  Ashling very recently lost her son &Oacute;r&aacute;n at the age of seven after a very tough time.  He was brought home to die and only lived for a couple of hours.  She struggled greatly to access services and, in the end, there was only goodwill.  There were no services available.  When the Minister talks about the map, he may want to look at two maps.

For Aisling's son, &Oacute;r&aacute;n, it is too late, but Aisling is committed to this cause and she wants to see, as a legacy to her son and others who have passed away since, that they might be able to make progress in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#D00800","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>I have two questions on palliative care.  The first has been discussed on many occasions, in this committee and elsewhere.  I refer to end-of-life care in nursing homes, the complications that arise when residents die in nursing homes and the impact that can have on public opinion of the nursing home.  If there is a high number of residents dying in a nursing home, it can read badly at times.  In the context of assessing and supporting residents in end of life in a nursing home, it is something we should look at.  There are HIQA inspections and oversight.  Some nursing homes have end-of-life support facilities.  Not enough of them do.  Sometimes - I have tried to get to the bottom of this - there is almost an incentive to transfer residents from nursing home to hospital in end of life for a number of reasons.  It is something that has to be looked at in a clinical fashion to determine why it is happening.  Can the Minister support nursing homes to allow residents die on the premises, without overly complicating it and without it reflecting badly on nursing homes, if there are a high number of residents dying in them, where they are dying in the context of palliative supports, as opposed to keeping the numbers down and transferring them to hospitals?  That certainly is something that we should look at.<\/p> <p>  We talk about the pressure on acute hospitals.  A busy hospital setting is no place for a family to mourn their loved one.  Has any assessment been made of the number of patients who die in hospital as opposed to elsewhere and whether we have a higher propensity to die in hospital as opposed to either in the home or a nursing home with supports?  It is an area that should be examined, not only in the context of the emotional side of it with hospital being a busy place but, equally, in the context of resources and the pressures on hospitals.<\/p> <p>  Paediatric palliative care and palliative care have to be looked at separately.  I do not mean to dismiss anybody's mother or father, or natural death, but the trauma on a family in the context of paediatric palliative supports and bereavement is significant.  We all can understand that.  At times, one must look beyond the immediate short term and there has to be greater supports for families of children who die.  Except for a lot of voluntary work and good work being done by communities and groups that rally round, it is an area that is greatly under resourced and understaffed.  There is a lack of understanding of the importance of ensuring that there is enough support, both in the short term but also in the longer term.  That also includes support for siblings who are often forgotten in the context of a child's death in a family.  It can have a profound impact for a long period of time.  That needs to be looked at.  Before we clap each other on the back, it is an area that needs a great deal more support in communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#E00200","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1059,"content":"<p>Does the Minister want to respond to those?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#E00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1060,"content":"<p>I will start with the nursing home matter that Deputy Kelleher raises.  The Deputy is correct.  On the issue of the 'flu this winter, for example, once the HSE started engaging proactively with the nursing homes when we put the additional measures in place in January, we saw that there is a willingness on behalf of nursing homes and their representative bodies to work with the health service to cater and care for the needs of residents within the nursing home without the need to transfer them to the acute hospital.  It became apparent that the nursing homes were willing to work with the health service and if that work can be built on further, that will have two results.  First, it can result in nursing homes no longer feeling compelled to send an older person to an acute hospital when the care could be better provided in a nursing home, particularly if somebody has his or her own room, <i>en suite<\/i>facility, etc., and infection can be controlled.  Second, an older person can often be provided with more dignity and comfort by being able to remain in the nursing home.  I do not disagree with Deputy Kelleher in regard to that.<\/p><p>I am glad Deputies Louise O'Reilly and Kelleher raised the general issue of paediatric palliative care.  They are correct.  While I stated we are coming from a low base for palliative care, we are coming from an even lower one for palliative paediatric care.  There is such a significant difference.  When a child dies it is something that is unnatural and traumatic and has a major impact on the whole family, and a whole community.  How we respond to that as a society is important.  Progress has been made and I will outline some of it.<\/p><p>In 2009, long before the Government or its predecessor was in office, in fairness to previous Governments, Palliative care for children with life-limiting conditions in Ireland - A National Policy, was published.  Arising from that policy, the HSE established the Children's Palliative Care Programme.  I must acknowledge that this was co-funded by the Irish Hospice Foundation.  The programme at that time provided for the appointment of a consultant paediatrician with a special interest in children's palliative care and eight children's outreach nurses to co-ordinate care for children with life-limiting conditions and their families.  Eight were welcome - it was starting from zero - but were clearly not enough to cover the country, as Deputy Louise O'Reilly references.<\/p><p>I launched, on 21 November, an independent evaluation of the Children's Palliative Care Programme.  It was undertaken by specialists from the UK.  It recommended that additional children's outreach nurses be hired and that a second consultant be appointed.  A further two children's outreach nurses are now being recruited as part of budget 2017.  We have also agreed to the appointment of a second children's palliative care consultant post, which will be funded by the Irish Hospice Foundation for the first year - subsequently, the funding will be taken over by the health service.  I should also point out that there is now a new masters programme in palliative care training for paediatric nurses running between the National University of Ireland Galway and UCD because we need to ensure we continue to provide a skill set for our paediatric nurses.<\/p><p>I extend my sympathy to Aisling on the loss of her son, &Oacute;r&aacute;n.

I mean that in a positive sense.  While this is the way the document is laid out, as I said at the start, it is sometimes not terribly reflective of the way the programmes are delivered and that is the bridge we need to try and cross.  I expect all four regions, without fear or favour, to come in on budget and to fulfil their commitments in the performance and accountability framework.  That commitment is not just to come in on budget, it is the three other metrics that I spoke about last week, which do not often get talked about as much.  These are access to services, quality of services and how they are harnessed.<\/p> <p>  We now have the hospital group structures and we have our community healthcare organisations, CHOs.  While I defer to the Committee on the Future of Health Care as I want to see a cross-party view on this, my personal view is that the CHOs and the hospital groups should be integrated in a more seamless manner.  We talk about home care packages and delayed discharges.  It does not make sense if one section of the health service is responsible for hospital beds, but to free up a bed they need somebody to be provided with a home care package and that is the responsibility of a different organisation within the HSE.  They need to be realigned.  Hopefully some of that work can be done in 2017 once the Committee on the Future of Health Care reports in April.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct to say that different regions have different pressures.  If one looks at the country's demographic profile, some of our hospital groups and CHOs have a higher proportion of older people.  There are areas that have a higher level of social deprivation and therefore generally a higher level of health need.  The HSE's job is to try and reflect that in the submissions that it receives from the hospital groups and from the community health organisations.  I expect that they will do that through their operational plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#F00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1066,"content":"<p>The most sensitive areas in the current year were in regard to waiting times, accident and emergency difficulties, over-crowding and primary care.

I say that because the Director General of the HSE, when he launched the service plan with me, said that the service plan was adequately funded for the delivery of the targets within it.  There is recognition from the HSE that the Houses of the Oireachtas have provided adequate funding to deliver on the priorities in the service plan.  In this year's service plan we have tried to prioritise some of the areas that have caused particular difficulty to our patients, our citizens and our staff in recent years.  I spoke about earlier about the situation in previous years where children with disabilities were turning 18 in the summer but there was a lack of funding for an adequate transition place.  This year, costs for school leavers have been factored into the service plan.  There have been significant increases in home care and home care packages.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to medical cards, where in the past there were significant challenges, in particular during the years of recession, today I will publish the Bill.  I will try and get the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible to ensure that every child with a disability whose parent is in receipt of domiciliary carer's allowance will have an automatic entitlement to a medical card.  That is about 33,000 children in this country.  Of the 33,000, almost 10,000 of them do not have a medical card today.  The others are subject to reviews, which can cause a lot of distress and hassle and inconvenience for a family when the condition, in all likelihood, will not have changed, or certainly will not have improved.<\/p> <p>  We are now back to investing in waiting list initiatives.  I will not suggest that in one year of doing so we will be able to deal with the totality of the waiting list problem.  However, we will unapologetically target those waiting the longest.  If the Deputy went to the doctor today and needed a hospital procedure or hospital appointment, he would go on a waiting list.  What matters is how long one is on that waiting list.  That we have people waiting 18 months and longer for procedures and that we have children waiting such a long period of time is not acceptable.  That is why all of our efforts in regard to waiting lists will be targeted at the longest waiters.  If waiting times can be reduced this year and that work is built on in following years, it will be possible to get back to the relatively good waiting list times which this country previously had.<\/p> <p>  Emergency department overcrowding is perhaps the biggest challenge.  It is dependent on a number of factors.  One is bed capacity.  Another is staffing.  A bit like Deputy Kelleher's question, another factor is to what extent we are currently providing services in acute hospitals which can be provided outside that, be it in primary care, through a GP contract, more primary care teams, community intervention teams or supporting our nursing homes to do more.  <\/p> <p>  Usually the winter initiative comes to an end around now.  I came into office in May.  Discussions started during the summer about a winter initiative which was to take effect in September or October.  This month I intend to begin having conversations about the winter initiative for 2017.  I have asked the HSE and the Department to get together and do a look back and a look forward.  They will examine what went well and what worked.  For example, we had the lowest level of delayed discharges ever recorded.  Some things clearly did not go well.  We will then analyse that data and try to understand, for example, what were the reasons for significant increases on certain days.   If we had GP out-of-hours for a greater length, would that have reduced the attendances?  We must ensure the measures are targeted.  I would welcome a conversation with this committee before the summer in regard to the preparedness for winter next year.  If we follow those steps, we can reasonably take all steps possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#F00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1068,"content":"<p>I very much welcome that the Minister is introducing this Bill.

It is very important for the almost 10,000 parents who are in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance for the care of their child, who does not have a medical card.  I meet in my clinics many people who must keep reapplying for the medical card, because the card is reviewed every three years.

We need to change the law and no matter how straightforward the change is, it still has to go though the process and come out the other side.

It is a moving figure, but the most recent figures available to me are in that region.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly is correct that the people on trolleys are people who have been admitted by a clinician.  It is also correct that people turning up in hospital - this is not blaming people because they often have no where else to go - who may have been able to be treated in a primary care centre in an out of hours GP service in a nursing home or in an appropriate setting, takes staff from the emergency department to deal with them.  Reducing hospital attendances through primary care is a component of assisting and alleviating the pressure on our acute hospitals.  I equally accept that bed capacity and staffing are the other two big pieces.  We have to address the issue using a three-pronged approach, namely, primary care, bed capacity and staffing.  When I listen to people on the radio speak of the need to open a certain number of beds in the morning, even if their analysis is correct, they also need to be conscious of the fact that the beds need to be accompanied by staffing.  It is not an either-or in regard to bed capacity or staffing.  It has to be the bed capacity, the staffing and the primary care.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly made a fair point on whether we are achieving value for money.  I have asked myself this question.  It is part of the reason the HSE and the Department are sitting down to provide me with an analysis of the winter initiative.  That is one of metrics I want them to analyse this month.  It is fair to say that it is easy to measure some aspects, for example, if one provides a certain amount of funding for aids and appliances to benefit over 3,000 additional patients.  One can establish whether the 3,000 additional patients get the goods and whether they were procured at a reasonable price.  It is a quick and easy to answer that.  When one gets to the hospital and the numbers on trolleys, then there is a value for money element, because one can measure whether the funding was provided for extra beds and the beds came on stream.  The other elements I have outlined are harder to measure on a value for money basis.  If there was insufficient capacity in the hospital or if there was not adequate staffing in the hospital.  We need to look at the value for money aspect but we also need to look at the blockages are as well.  Some of them are not as easily measured from a value for money analysis point of view.<\/p> <p>  A 'flu outbreak happens every year in every country.  The advice available to me from our chief medical officer, our deputy chief medical officer, our expert group on influenza was that the type of 'flu this year was a strain that we had not seen in this country since 2009.  I believe the 'flu in 2015-16 largely affected younger people.  The strain of 'flu this winter largely affected older people.  That does result in increased hospital attendance.<\/p> <p>  I make the practical, not political point, and in recognition of the staff working in the health service, that during the month of February in spite of the fact that we continue to see too many people on hospital trolleys, we need to recognise the fact that we see more and more people attending our hospitals as the population grows and gets older.  We had fewer people on trolley in the month of February this year than last year.  It is not an acceptance of the figure, but it is a recognition of the fact that people working in our hospitals, be it in management roles or front-line roles, are doing their very best to reduce the number.  In spite of the fact that more people turned up in the emergency departments, fewer people were on trolleys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#G00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  Before we go off that topic, perhaps I could sow an idea in his head in regard to nursing homes.  I believe each nursing home should have a medical officer which would give consistent medical advice and an overview on how the nursing home deals with people who become acutely ill in their care.  It would be an interesting study if the Minister could compare the number of admissions from nursing homes that have a medical officer to those who do not.  Many of the public nursing homes have a medical officer employed by the HSE whereas most of the private nursing homes do not.  If there were consistency of medical management in nursing homes, fewer people would be sent to acute departments when they become ill in a nursing home.  When patients are admitted to a nursing home, most nursing homes will introduce an end of life discussion on how people wish to view an illness, should it occur.  That is to be encouraged and advance directives in that regard are an item that should be foremost when anybody is admitted to a nursing home.  Obviously one wants to do the best one can for a person in a nursing home but there are illnesses which will not benefit substantially in terms of treatment when the patient lands on a trolley.  The introduction of a medical officer in each nursing home is something the Minister might consider.<\/p> <p>  We are skipping around a bit, which is fine if that is okay.

Those are improvements.  I do not know whether the committee has been out to the PCRS centre for a meeting with management there, but I would very much welcome its input on how it can improve.

I find it hard to explain to the patient or constituent in a situation where everyone is stressed and wondering how quickly they can get their medical card, if at all.<\/p> <p>  Some of the questions are insensitive.  If one receives a letter from a doctor to the effect that a patient is terminally ill a card will issue.  That is not a great help to the patient, I have to say.

Let me be clear and say that there is no financial need or incentive to be carrying out spot checks now.  In terms of the surplus that PCRS actually found itself with at the end of 2016, unlike in previous years when previous Ministers for Health found themselves in very difficult situations regarding medical cards, that financial necessity is not there.  What is a necessity is that we ensure that the system is administered in line with the law.  If we do not like the law there is an onus on us to change it.  That is why we are going to change the law, I hope, on the domiciliary care allowance, DCA.  The reviews that the Deputy talks about for that cohort of people, which is 33,000 people - quite a few - will cease.  It is hugely expensive and time consuming for both the resource within the HSE.  One would be better employed turning around more medical card applications for patients to achieve that target.<\/p> <p>  It is also worth pointing out that the clinical advisory group that was set up by my predecessors to tackle the question that the Deputy is referring to is doing important work.  Its first recommendation, which was adopted by the director general, was that any child under the age of 18 with cancer should be provided with an automatic entitlement to a medical card for five years.  That was a very welcome development.  The next step now, and the director general made this point when he was here last week, is to look at how we can apply that process to all cancer patients.  The clinical advisory group, which includes representatives from Our Children's Health, Patients for Patient Safety Ireland and medics has been looking at this.  My own policy perspective on this is that where people have a clear medical need and a condition that requires access to a medical card the more straightforward we can make that process as legislators the better, because it avoids all the hoops that people have to jump through.  Today we are making good progress on a cohort of 33,000.  The move that we have already made around children with cancer is another cohort of patients who should not have to go through a bureaucratic process.

Until relatively recently a view would have been taken in many parts of administrative Ireland that a house would be provided after all of the other social needs, whereas the evidence now suggests that providing people with a stable housing situation and wrapping around the services is often the way to break the difficult cycle of addiction, abuse or various other health needs.  I gave a commitment to significantly increase the funding and that is what we are doing.  I recently visited the Capuchin Day Centre and saw the work done by Brother Kevin Crowley.  I was in a facility for homeless women and children in Mullingar, called Temporary Emergency Accommodation Midlands, TEAM, last Monday week.  The message that we need to take from that is that the job of tackling homelessness and the issues of homeless people is not just something that rests with the Minister for Housing, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney.  There are societal issues that interact here that we have to try to provide for.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for his work.  I hope the funding we have provided will make a significant difference.  Some of the metrics are outlined in the performance information note from my Department which was circulated to the committee.  We want to get to 100% of substance misusers over the age of 18, for whom treatment has commenced, within one calendar month following assessment.  Currently, it is 97%.  We want to get to 100% of substance misusers under 18 years of age, for whom treatment has commenced, within one week.  That figure is 81.4% now so it is quite a jump to get to 100% of people under the age of 18 this year.  The percentage of service users admitted to homeless emergency accommodation hostels or facilities whose health needs have been assessed within two weeks of admission is currently 73.9%.  We have funded that to get it to 85% this year.  We can make a real and significant difference.  We can also do other things that seem very logical.  <\/p><p> When I was in TEAM in Mullingar last Monday week, I spoke to some women and their children who find themselves living there.  They cannot speak highly enough of the facility they are living in but their medical card is attached to a specific GP and that GP may be many miles away.  To use the example of somebody I was talking to from Portlaoise who is now living in this temporary accommodation in Mullingar, if she needs to bring her child to the doctor, she has to get the bus to Portlaoise and back.  It is a huge burden.  Prescription charges and how they are dealt with is another issue.  Can we give a medical card to a centre and waive the prescription charges?  I have given a very clear commitment to try to look at the prescription charge issue and the medical card issue.  Can these temporary accommodation facilities have a medical card attached to the centre which can be used by those living in the centre?  By virtue of it being a transient group of people, those people will change.  I will be happy to come back and update the committee on those points.  They are two small, practical things on the health side that we could do to ease the hassle and inconvenience for some of these people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#H00900","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>This is an area we need to look at to a greater extent in the future.  There is an increasing cohort of people who suffer from social and economic deprivation and, as a result, find themselves under medical and mental pressure to a huge extent.  Way back in the days of old, we tried to have a programme of identifying families who were at risk for various reasons.  We tried to have a case worker who focused on two or three families in order to provide a safety net for them so they did not become a burden on themselves or become homeless or reliant on drugs or alcohol.  I do not know how feasible that programme might be in the future but it could be very important.  We need to keep that in mind when we consider the issue of homelessness.<\/p> <p>  There is also an increasing number of people, quite often single men and single women, who are dropping out of society, sleeping rough and coming to the attention of the authorities and all kinds of things.  Have we arrived at the time where there is a need for emergency supervised accommodation in towns and villages throughout the country, which would not have been heard of years ago, with a view to alleviating their problems?  They would have a place where they could go.  They would have a roof over their heads and a place that is supervised.  There could be a manager within their immediate environment in order to encourage and support them.<\/p> <p>  My last point is about younger women, in particular very young women, with children who find themselves under social or economic pressure and pushed down the list.  They have little knowledge of motherhood or raising a family and do not know where to go.  It is a problem that has come up again and again.  They need support.  We need to invest in the provision of support services, to give them something to lean on at crucial times, so they do not find themselves pushed to the side and ignored.  It is something that does not immediately come into focus at present other than when talking about the future.  In my time in public life, I have seen a huge increase in the number of young people who are sleeping rough, who are in danger of sleeping rough or who are dropping out of society and have become addicts for a variety of reasons and progressed in an area that is not helpful to them at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#J00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1088,"content":"<p>I am looking at the note we were given and trying to match it up to the figures.

I will get the Deputy more detail.<\/p> <p>  There are a couple of important points to make on Deputy Durkan's and Deputy O'Reilly's question, which relates to breaking the cycle and what we will do, apart from responding to the current crisis.  There are a couple of pieces to this issue.  The new national drugs strategy, which will be published shortly by my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is an important part.  Supervised injecting facilities are a very important element.  The Oireachtas will be showing political leadership in tackling this issue.  We will be following on from something that works very well in many other cities if we establish the first pilot supervised injecting facility in our capital city in 2017.  Items such as the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill are very important measures that will require political leadership in the Houses of the Oireachtas which I hope will be forthcoming from all parties, including our own, in addressing that issue.<\/p> <p>  The powerful message sent from the Oireachtas after the statements in the D&aacute;il last night on recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group cannot be the end.  There is now a need to follow on.  The development of the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy is being undertaken by the Department of Justice and Equality.  My Department is feeding into that from a health perspective by addressing the unmet health needs and addressing how one can interact with the Traveller community to make sure Travellers access the health services that are available.  Funding was available under the dormant accounts fund for 2016 and 2017 and this is being used to support a number of marginalised service users.<\/p> <p>  Two projects being funded include a mobile health screening unit and an intercultural health project for refugees.  The objective of the mobile health screening unit is to provide an accessible targeted screening and primary care service to a wide range of marginalised service users in settings such as hostels, prisons, direct provision centres, refugee reception centres and orientation centres.  The intercultural health project for refugees will support the delivery of a range of health services to meet the emerging needs of new residents of the emerging reception and orientation centres established in Clonee and Monasterevin.  A third EROC is due to open shortly.  We have been having discussions on housing and homelessness and there is a need for an intergovernmental approach to that area.<\/p><p>Rebuilding Ireland, under the leadership of my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, shows the pathway forward, but there is a role for my Department and me to play in that area and I am willing to do it.

Without pre-judging the outcome of the negotiations on the GP contract, an obvious point for discussion is the determination of what constitutes an out-of-hours service and a normal operating hours service.  We can see clearly that there is a demand for the former.  Given people's lifestyles, in terms of work and so forth, we need to determine what is best in terms of accessible hours for GP surgeries and figure out what the Department and the Government need to do to enable these hours to be operated.  The output target last year was 964,770 hours, while the target this year is 1,550,388 hours.  As the target in 2016 was exceeded significantly, there is clearly a massive demand for the service.  <\/p> <p>  Another issue that arises in terms of the sustainability of the service in certain parts of the country is the ageing GP population, of which the Chairman is aware in the case of Shannondoc which operates in his part of the country.  Interestingly, when I attended the OECD Health Ministers meeting, I discovered that while we had an ageing GP population here, we actually compared quite well to other European countries.  However, that is not a reason not to prepare.  We have a lot of GPs who are making retirement plans and need to replace them.  I still believe, although not everyone agrees with me, that if we do not move towards the option of having salaried GPs in rural areas and areas of urban deprivation, there will continue to be an unmet need.  I have an open mind on how that should be done, but it may mean the HSE directly employing GPs or grant-aiding GP surgeries, as it does already in organisations such as SafetyNet.  I am absolutely adamant that this should form part of the discussions on the GP contract because the sustainability question goes to the very core of the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#K00700","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1099,"content":"<p>On out-of-hours services, difficulties are due to the declining number of GPs but also to their geographical spread.

There is a view among GPs that while they have significant responsibilities as employers, one should not have to be a great SME-owner to be a great GP.  That is certainly an issue.  Furthermore, traditionally practice nurses have not had access to the same level of support that is available to nurses in acute hospital settings.

I have met parents who are concerned about the impact of this on their child's overall health and mental health well-being.  I am informed that orthodontic waiting lists have been decreasing since quarter 3 of 2016 - that is, since the middle of last year - following a significant period of increase.

It is the wrong process and the wrong direction at the wrong time.  If anything, we need an increase in that area in the public health sector.  I can think of a number of our public long-stay hospitals where, compared to ten or 15 years ago, the number of patients has halved.  The latter was unnecessary, in my view, because there was no basis for it.  The theory behind it, which was put to me on a number of occasions, was that it was more cost-effective to do it.  I have not seen the evidence for that.  What often happens is that seriously dependent patients end up in the public sector in any event, and understandably so.  The quality of the services and facilities available in the public system in most of our hospitals - I acknowledge that standards have to be kept up at all times - is excellent and unequalled anywhere else.  I do not see the reason for that approach.  We need more of those beds for two reasons: first, to meet the demographic needs; and, second, to alleviate overcrowding in acute hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#L01200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1124,"content":"<p>Regarding the increase in the number of home-help hours - while increasing, it will not go up by a great deal - can the Minister give a breakdown between the public-private and voluntary providers?  I understand that when the tender process for the provision of those services is concluded, the individual health agencies will have their preferred providers and they will have to select from those.  My sense of this is that the choice available to them is frequently between different private providers and that fewer home-help hours are being provided by the HSE.  I echo what Deputy Durkan said.  It seems the State is getting out of the business of caring for older people, which is to be very much regretted.<\/p> <p>  Specifically with regard to the single assessment tool for older people, which is extremely important, the output targets for 2016 and 2017 are a little vague.  At what stage of development is the phased implementation of the IT to enable the standardised assessment tool?  It is to be phased in but that could be done over the next 200 years.  The target for 2017 is to work with providers to establish the greater capacity of the single assessment tool assessments.  They should be doing that in any event.  The single assessment tool, the monitoring process and the frail elderly programmes should be integrated.  Many people would consider those to be fairly basic but they are now being listed in the Department's targets and achievements.<\/p><p>I understand the need to provide information and that information is welcome, but the assertion was that something was to be phased in during 2016.  However, no indication has been given of how far that process got, how many old people have been assessed using the single assessment tool and whether all public health nurses are using it.  Good luck to those nurses who find the time to use it, given that they are overworked.<\/p><p> The distinct lack of ambition shown in the section on services for older people is reflective of how this and successive Governments have slowly put clear blue water between themselves and care of the elderly.  It is not untrue to say there is a plan, be it one which has been fully worked out and written down or that is in the back of someone's mind, because clearly the Government is trying to get out of the business of looking after older people.  That service has been outsourced to large, global corporations that are making a fortune.  The Minister knows them and I will not name them.  As I had a bad experience after I had named one of them, I will not do so again, but we all know what we are talking about.  These companies are making a great deal of money.  They are often the only providers on the preferred provider lists.<\/p><p> HSE home helps approach me - I am sure they also attend other members' clinics - to say they are losing their hours and are not being replaced.

In the past five years there has been a drop of 10% in public nursing homes in most regions.  Is there a deliberate policy on the part of the HSE to get out of providing public nursing homes?  There was serious overcrowding in Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe, County Galway after Christmas.  It was so bad that some children were moved from Ballinasloe to Mullingar, which did not make sense.  There are two nursing homes within 20 minutes of Portiuncula Hospital, to which some patients could have been moved to alleviate the overcrowding.  They are reasonably priced and provide good accommodation.  In such instances why not avail of nursing homes at the weekend or whenever else there is overcrowding?  The Minister will probably say that happens in certain circumstances, but at other times it does not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#M00400","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1128,"content":"<p>The Department and I set policy, not the HSE.  It is not my policy or that of the Government to diminish the role of public community hospitals or public nursing homes.  However, it has been the policy of this and successive Governments to ensure these facilities will be brought up to appropriate HIQA standards.  With Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony, I visited the community hospital in Bandon in her constituency.  It is an example of the capital investment work being undertaken to provide state-of-the-art facilities for older people in a public setting in a community hospital.<\/p> <p>  The reduction in bed numbers is temporary.  Using the Deputy's case as an example, it is a reflection of the fact that in some wards there are beds upon beds and shared bathrooms which must be replaced with single rooms and en suite facilities in order that people will have the dignity we all expect them to have within a public setting.  As the Deputies know, we are making major investments to upgrade these facilities.  As we move towards capital reviews and providing for additional expenditure on building projects in the health sector, I expect us to increase capacity in public settings.  Bed capacity is another factor that will have to be considered.<\/p> <p>  I have never approached this matter from an ideological view.  People have a right to a choice.  Some will choose private nursing home facilities, while others will prefer to be able to avail of public beds in community hospitals.  It can be either-or, but there is an important role for community hospitals and public nursing homes to play.  This is an issue Deputy Bernard J. Durkan raises with me regularly, which is right and proper, but we have a significant body of work to do to ensure the facilities will be of a standard that people in 21st century Ireland should expect to see.  The care provided is excellent.  I am referring to the infrastructural facilities and not in any way demeaning the care given or the dedication of the staff.  Needing to make this investment should not be an excuse for removing ourselves from this service provision.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony mentioned how there were still pressures in seeking access to some services, even though the graph was upwards and investment had increased, but the population of older people has also increased.  A useful example for discussion is how well we have done in mapping demographic pressures in the education system.  The Department of Education and Skills knows this because a certain number of children will turn four, five or six years of age and need school places in September.  It also knows that a certain number of teachers, schools, school buildings, extensions, classrooms and so on will be needed.  We need to undertake that demographic analysis in the health service.  The bed capacity review forms a large part of it, accompanied by the model of care provided.<\/p> <p>  The figures before the committee show an increase in the numbers of home help hours and packages, including intensive home care packages, in 2017.  However, I will level with the committee.  My view - one that is shared across the House - is that until we do in the home care area what we did in the nursing home area, this will continue to be a challenge.  We need a statutory scheme.  We will probably disagree on what it should look like, given the wide variety of views held, but we cannot say we want people to be able to grow old at home or in their communities if the only statutory scheme available to them is the fair deal scheme.  In fairness to the HSE and its predecessors, they have been providing home help without the service being underpinned by statutory provision or the clear rules, guidelines and budget lines of the fair deal scheme.  If committee members examine the fair deal scheme, they will see the amount of money allocated and the turnaround time, etc.  The metrics are clear.  We need the same in the home help area.<\/p> <p>  The Government is committed to reverting to the D&aacute;il within six months of debating Deputy Willie O'Dea's Bill.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, will launch in May a stakeholder consultation process on future statutory home care schemes.  We cannot transpose the fair deal scheme in the home care area.  Presumably, we do not want HIQA to regulate what happens in people's sitting rooms.  We must be conscious that the setting is someone's home, but we need to consider how to place the schemes on a statutory basis.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State is also reviewing the nursing homes support scheme.  There are a number of concerns about how small business owners and farmers are treated in terms of how their assets are considered.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly asked a similar question about public versus private services.  Although it is a valid question, it is an operational one, but I will get her a detailed note from the HSE on the public-private mix, tenders and the roll-out of the single assessment tool.<\/p><p>I have been in many CHOs where it has been used, but I will get the Deputy a note on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#M00500","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1130,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting, but I want to know for how many elderly people the single assessment tool was used last year, for how many people it will be used and the grades and categories of staff who will be involved in using it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#N00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1131,"content":"<p>That will not be a problem.

The Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, will publish the outcome shortly.  We will then undertake a mapping exercise of current service provision nationally taking into account the scale and diversity of the services funded.  This will be used to identify the policy options for the new statutory home care scheme.  The areas we need to consider are regulation, financing, assessment and eligibility.  The issue of public versus private provision is a legitimate one that needs to be considered.  There is a lot of work to be done in this area.  It took several years to set up the fair deal scheme which is generally recognised to be working well, apart from a few anomalies that need to be rectified.  That is the next big thing we must crack.  A total of 1,064 people under the age 65 years are in nursing homes.

I accept that a doctor must sign off on a discharge and ensure a person can be discharged, but the complaint I constantly receive from families is that a son, a daughter, a brother, a husband, a wife or a partner was fit to be discharged on a Friday but because there was no consultant available to sign off on the discharge, he or she remained in hospital unnecessarily until the Monday.

The Deputy is right.  We do not want - neither does a patient - a scenario where a patient finds himself or herself in hospital over a weekend where he or she is medically fit to go home where he or she would much rather be.  Hospitals have a predicted date of discharge, PDD.  Patients are clinically assessed and allocated a PDD.

The first report I received when I became Minister for Health was produced by Lightfoot Solutions UK on the National Ambulance Service.  In reading the report which was published on my Department's website I was struck by the huge need for extra ambulances and additional paramedics.  However, it is also clear from the report that even when we do this, if we wish to meet HIQA's ambulance response times, there will still be a need to provide the National Ambulance Service with extra ambulances and paramedics because of the demographic layout of the country and the way the population is dispersed.  The report specifically referenced the role of community first responders.  I am very eager to look at how we can further integrate and develop the community first responder network with the National Ambulance Service.  Community first responders are providing a very good service around the country, but there is a lot more to be done.  It is fair to say the National Ambulance Service has undertaken a significant reform programme in recent years that involves reconfiguring the delivery of pre-hospital care services.  The objective is to have a nationally co-ordinated system supported by improved technology.  This has seen the completion of the single national control centre project and all nine regional control centres migrate to a national emergency operations centre which I have had the opportunity to visit.  Improvements in services in the west have been implemented, with the ambulance bases in Tuam and Mulranny now operating on a 24\/7 basis and the establishment of a deployment point in Loughglynn, County Roscommon.  We have seen an expansion of the community first responders scheme, with 147 groups now operating nationally.  I genuinely thank them and their volunteers for their incredible dedication.<\/p><p>The development of an electronic patient care record is under way and that will be rolled out in 2017.  On the point the Deputy made about inter-hospital transfers and making sure we free up our ambulances, our intermediate care service is now carrying out 90% of inter-hospital transfers.  The National Ambulance Service, NAS, now supports neonatal and paediatrics retrieval services through the provision of dedicated resources and staff, and there is the development of an adult retrieval service.  The emergency aeromedical support service has been established on a permanent basis.<\/p><p> It is important to say that in 2016 the number of ECHO calls received by the National Ambulance Service increased by 42% and DELTA calls increased by 19%.  There has been a significant increase in investment in our ambulance services, but that is appropriate considering the pressure it has been under in recent years.  The next steps are to continue the reform of the ambulance service through the modernisation programme, to implement a clinical hub desk in the national emergency operations centre, to further develop the intermediate care service, and to roll out the electronic patient care record system.  As the Deputy said, the budget for the ambulance service has increased this year.  Approximately &euro;1 million of that increase is for new developments above and beyond dealing with capacity and demographic pressures.  This will obviously include a number of targets in respect of intermediate care service or emergency response times as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#N01200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1142,"content":"<p>As I understand it, a dispute threatened in the National Ambulance Service last year.  It related to some reports, one of which the Minister has referenced; I understand there are two reports.  As part of the settlement of that dispute, NAS indicated that it was going to go abroad to try to recruit people and that it had been given a licence to do so - I think that was the term used although I do not know that one would be needed.  NAS said it was embarking on a recruitment programme abroad because there was a recognition that, due to the lead time from starting training to finishing it, domestic recruitment would not have been enough to keep pace with requirements.  In terms of recruitment, will the Minister indicate how many additional NAS staff there will be?  How many of those will be people recruited as part of this international licence?<\/p> <p>  The Minister will also be aware that in Dublin we are blessed to have our paramedic services provided by both NAS and the Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB.  Members of DFB have balloted for industrial action and that is not something they would do lightly.  I am very familiar with this group from my previous role.  The group actually would be very reluctant to take any form of industrial action but its members have been left with no choice because they feel the service is under threat.  I do not think we could cope in Dublin without DFB.  Its members are, as the Minster will know, trained fire fighters and also paramedics.  They deliver an incredibly efficient service.  Nobody want to see that dispute go ahead and I understand there is a budget conflict between the Minister and local government but, notwithstanding that, Dublin Fire Brigade provides health services.  In terms of the resolution of that dispute, perhaps the Minister could give us his view as to how that will be resolved because the future of DFB does seem to be in some sort of jeopardy.  That would concern us.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the National Ambulance Service budget and the inter-hospital transfers, my understanding is that transfers are carried out through a range of different sources, including taxis, private ambulances and directly employed personnel.  Will the Minister give the committee a breakdown on that?  He is probably sensing a theme in my questions but perhaps he could give us a breakdown.  The Minister and I have had this conversation many times and I do not believe we get good value for money from the private sector.  I have yet to see any evidence that we do.  I am also very interested to know the budget for taxis.  People spoke about this a number of years ago, and I hope the reason no one is talking about it any more is because it has reduced significantly.  I suspect it has not, but perhaps people have just moved on to talking about something else.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of the 27 measures that are listed here, obviously there will be more than 27 measures with regard to a budget which, I believe, is 31% of the total Vote.  He may not have it to hand, but perhaps the Minister could provide the committee with more detail in terms of the actions and plans for next year.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the IT budget, we all agree with the need to improve IT in the acute sector.  That is almost worse because once everybody agrees, one is left wondering when it will happen.  I could be open to question on this but even if we doubled our IT budget, we would still be short of what the average is in the OECD.  It is a bit ridiculous, when one walks into a hospital, to see people walking around with files.  I am sure they would much rather move to a paper-light or paperless system.  Have key targets and areas been identified where actual progress can be made in this area?  It is really not acceptable in this day and age to have people running around with big charts and files under their arms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#O00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1143,"content":"<p>I concur with the Chairman's opening remarks about ambulances being stalled outside of hospitals and being held up.

Again I make the point to the Minister that when a county loses its accident and emergency department, it is so critical and important that there is a top class ambulance service.<\/p> <p>  If an ambulance from the west has done a call to a Dublin hospital and is on its way back, it can then be called to an accident.  That is fair enough.  If it is somewhere in Kildare and there is an accident which it is called to, that is fair enough.  A difficulty is created, however, back in Roscommon, Galway, Sligo and Donegal because the ambulance which should have been back after a certain period of time is not back.  I would be concerned about such situations.  Sometimes ambulances have to come into the county when an accident occurs because the other ambulance is on its way from Dublin and has been called to the scene of another accident.  In that case, an ambulance has to come from, for example, Longford, Offaly or Cavan to the scene of an accident in Roscommon.  I do not know whether the Minister has any comment to make on that but it is of concern to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#O00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies.  Many points were raised in their comments.  I will get clarification from the National Ambulance Service on Loughglynn but my note just tells me that it is a deployment point.  I take Deputy Murphy's point in respect of the importance of the ambulance service and the great work that it carries out.<\/p> <p>  This is an area in which we clearly have a lot more work to do.  The Lightfoot report presents a roadmap forward in terms of the investment and the scale of investment needed in terms of both paramedics and vehicles.  I made the point in my opening comment on this section that we will have to grapple with this collectively.  The population dispersal in this country, according to the external consultancy, Lightfoot, poses significant challenges in terms of ambulance response times.  The Lightfoot report is very clear that even if we increase the number of ambulances and paramedics, we will need to do something above and beyond that.  We need to do something innovative here.  Some of the ideas the Deputy has come up with are part of that process.  <\/p> <p>  People have an absolute right to live in rural Ireland.  We want rural Ireland to thrive and those living there have a right to an ambulance service, just like people in towns and cities, but we have to recognise that the population dispersal means we need to think outside the box in this regard.  Lightfoot suggests community first responders as a starting point.  I met a group from Connemara in Galway when I was in University Hospital Galway recently.<\/p><p>The group asked whether they could have greater use of the St. John Ambulance and the Order of Malta services.  I believe there is a willingness from those organisations to do more.  In fact, the complaint from the group was that communities had fund-raised for an ambulance, whether a St. John Ambulance or Order of Malta ambulance, only to find that the ambulance could not be fully utilised in all situations.  Obviously, there is a regulator.  It is not me; it is the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.  There is space for the regulator to work with us and engage with those organisations.  That is something I intend to pursue.  I believe such engagement could unleash additional capacity for rural communities and provide them with a far better ambulance service in addition to all of the improvements we intend to make.<\/p><p> I note the theme from Deputy O'Reilly's questions.  In fairness, it is consistent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#O00400","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1146,"content":"<p>We would like to think it is all about consistency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#P00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1147,"content":"<p>It should make our engagements more predictable.  I will have to ask the HSE to give the Deputy a note on it because these are operational matters.  We have taken note of them.  I urge Deputy O'Reilly to come back to me if she does not get satisfactory information in reply.  That includes the question of recruitment from abroad.<\/p> <p>  I realise Deputy O'Reilly knows the history of the Dublin Fire Brigade question, but it is important for me to put it on the record of the committee.  In December 2014, HIQA published a review of pre-hospital emergency care.  A series of recommendations were made in respect of Dublin services to address patient safety issues, to reduce risk and to improve co-operation between the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade.  I met representatives of Dublin Fire Brigade through SIPTU.  I acknowledge the exceptional service that DFB provides.  This is not an attempt to suggest anything to the contrary.<\/p> <p>  HIQA is engaged in a follow-up review to the 2014 report.  HIQA expects to publish a report this month or in April.  While it is fair to say that a good level of co-operation exists between the National Ambulance Service, NAS, and Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB, in providing the service to Dublin city and county, it is also fair to say that some difficulties exist.  I believe that is generally recognised although the way to resolve the matter may not be.  The difficulties might relate to the volume of calls received by the Dublin Fire Brigade.  Some calls have to be stacked when no DFB ambulance resource is available to respond to a call.  When these circumstances arise, Dublin Fire Brigade usually requests support from the National Ambulance Service.<\/p> <p>  HIQA wrote to Dublin City Council late last year indicating that the current arrangements represent a risk to patients.  HIQA, as the regulator, believes this risk arises from the regular delay in the allocation of ambulance resources to patients, including a high number of potentially life-threatening DELTA calls, due to a combination of the ongoing inability of DFB to see all of the potential resources that it and the NAS have at initial dispatch as well as a reliance on individual contact with NAS over the telephone to enable supplementary resource allocation, where available.  Moreover, HIQA believes there is insufficient collective emergency ambulance capacity, as currently resourced and deployed by DFB and NAS, in the Dublin area.<\/p> <p>  In light of the correspondence and to mitigate any risk to patients in the area under my remit, that is to say, the NAS, additional resources were deployed to Dublin.  That was an important step.  An issue arises relating to line of sight and how these organisations, both of which undertake incredible work, can co-operate.<\/p> <p>  I know that the people of Dublin city and county are proud of the track record of exceptional delivery of services by Dublin Fire Brigade in respect of fire and ambulance services.  For want of a better phrase, we need to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater in rectifying the difficulties and challenges.  No one can ignore these challenges in light of what HIQA has said.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy O'Reilly knows well, Dublin Fire Brigade SIPTU members have voted in favour of industrial action over concerns about ambulance services in Dublin.  It is fair to say that the results of the ballot probably reflect a wider unrest in respect of DFB about future certainty and fire-based emergency medical services.  This dates back as far as the 2014 HIQA report.  I look forward to the next HIQA report.  It will represent a follow-up exercise to point us along the roadmap to try to solve this situation.<\/p> <p>  My Department is engaging with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in respect of the industrial action vote by SIPTU members.  The issues need to be grappled with in terms of where responsibility lies.  Following my meeting with SIPTU representatives, I believe SIPTU takes the same view.  It is a health service question.  This is an ambulance service under the remit of the city council.  In turn, the city council is under the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for certain functions.  I am awaiting the HIQA report and I expect it to be published shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#P00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1148,"content":"<p>I sincerely hope the industrial action does not materialise before that report is received.

They need to hear from the Minister as well as from the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government that their future is secure.<\/p> <p>  My understanding of where the issue lies relates to the fact that the computers do not talk to each other, but that this is a small rather than a major issue.

He was going to come back to Senator Dolan in that regard.  I am keen to reiterate the point made by the Minister of State.  When we consider the provision of disability services, we must consider them in their totality.  I know that Pat Healy, the national director for social care for the HSE, made this point at the time of the publication of the service plan, as did the Minister of State who issued a statement clarifying the situation.  We need to consider the overall provision of services and the fact that some people who in the past may have been availing of personal assistant hours are now availing of a different service or benefiting from different additional investment that we have made in respect of disability services.  That was the thrust of the argument being put forward by the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider the fact we are going to see home support hours increase and centre-based respite nights for people with disabilities increase on last year's target.  We are seeing a significant increase in facilitating movement from congregated to community settings.  We are seeing the maintenance of all-day service provision.  We are obviously going to see improvements in terms of the reconfiguration of services for children with disabilities in terms of the associated targets.<\/p><p>Disability services rightly have received a significant increase in investment in budget 2017.  That is for a very good reason.  Considerable work needs to be done in this regard.  My view and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is that we need to look at how we empower people with disabilities to have a greater say on this budget.  I feel very strongly that the State's responsibility to people with disabilities does not end when the State writes a cheque to the service provider.  The totality of the debate should not be about the size of the budget, but rather the impact of that budget on the lives of people with disabilities.  I think and certainly hope there is cross-party consensus on this.<\/p><p> The task force on personalised budgets which the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, established last year can unlock huge potential in this sector.  I meet people on an almost daily basis in my interaction with people with disabilities in my constituency office and my departmental office.  I hear from people who ask for a greater say over how the State's funding is spent as it affects their lives.<\/p><p> Many members will know the group An Saol, which is a group of largely parents and some siblings who have relatives with an acquired brain injury.  The State has provided services for these people.  Their families are very much of the view that if they were allowed a greater say, they could spend the budget much more effectively to deliver a much more meaningful service.  As part of the HSE service plan, we have launched a pilot project allowing An Saol to interact with the HSE.  It is not asking for additional funding but for a greater input because its members know how to spend it better than a bureaucracy does.  It was hard to have this discussion in the years of cuts, but now that we are back in years of increases there is not only an economic but a moral onus on all of us to ensure we can greater empower people with disabilities as regards their services.<\/p><p> Senator Dolan will hear from the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, on that.  I suggest the disability budget and service plan should be viewed in terms of the totality of increases which is quite significant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#P01200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1157,"content":"<p>The issue of the delivery of services to the disability sector is getting attention now.  It needs attention urgently.  For example, parents of adults with disabilities worry about what will happen afterwards.  On whom can they rely for a service?  The issue of decongregation is increasing their concerns.  They have become accustomed to living and working in a community with support services available to them - sheltered accommodation effectively.  The needs may vary greatly between one individual and another.  We know this has been provided for.  If two parents are available in the household, it is a huge strain in any event.  If there is only one parent to do the minding it is huge problem and they have great difficulties.  If it is a lone parent, they have to put their lives on hold with obvious consequences later when it comes to pension age etc.  It means they cannot work.  They have no independence.<\/p> <p>  The degree to which respite is available is a help.  It is not available to the extent that meets all eventualities and we need to look at that.  Most of the parents want to have their child or young adult at home as much as possible but they need to be reassured as to the availability of appropriate residential care in the event of them becoming ill, including something sudden like the 'flu, for example, which can appear without warning.<\/p> <p>  I have come across cases, as I am sure other members have, where those delivering the service identify a person as suitable for relocation into the community given that he or she is self-sufficient to a certain extent and may be able to travel on the bus, for example.  It does not always happen that way and sometimes those assessments are incorrect and err on the side, to my mind, of reducing the dependence on the service or whatever.  That should not be the case.  It should simply relate to the degree to which the person with disabilities requires support and not the degree to which support is available.<\/p> <p>  We have all seen cases of people who have dedicated their lives to caring for a loved one with a disability.  It is a great thing to see but it is not exactly fair.  It may not be fair to the person with the disability either in situations where the resources get stretched where the health of the parents or relatives gets stretched or whatever the case may be.

When will people see progress on this?  The task force was established on 20 September 2016.  It fulfils a commitment in the programme for Government on how we can provide services and supports to people with disabilities to empower them to live independent lives, but also provide them with greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports they receive.  As the Deputy said, one size does not fit all, and we should not have service providers, good as they are, making all the decisions.  No citizens should settle for that.<\/p> <p>  The task force has two components to ensure strong representation from all backgrounds.  It has a strategy group and an advisory group.

The first thing we must do, and I do not mean this in terms of the Chairman, is stop the debate on mental health funding being a debate on &euro;35 million.  The mental health budget for the delivery of mental health services in 2017 is &euro;851.3 million.  We have talked about the marginal figure for a large number of years.  Last year, &euro;826.6 million was spent on mental health services.  That figure is up from &euro;791 million in 2015, up from &euro;766 million in 2014, up from &euro;737 million in 2013 and up from &euro;711 million in 2012.  It is one of the few areas, and I fully support this policy, that even during very difficult years for the health budget and all budgets in this country, has consistently risen from &euro;711 million 2012 right up to &euro;851.3 million this year.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman is correct that there has been a policy of ring-fencing an additional &euro;35 million to spend as part of that budget each and every year.  Truthfully, if anyone looked at that figure over the past number of years, in many years it failed to be all spent in one year.  That is not due to a lack of effort on anybody's part.  As the Chairman has said, it was due to the time lags such as from the moment one decides to employ somebody, the recruitment campaign, the interview process and the taking up of the job so often the &euro;35 million was not spent.  In my first budget as Minister for Health, and the first budget for the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, who is responsible for mental health services, we have tried to be much more upfront about this matter.  We have increased the mental health budget significantly.  We will increase the mental health budget, when one considers the capital spending, by a lot more than &euro;35 million.  There is no point pretending that a sum of money will be spent.  One must tell people what one intends to do.  The total mental health budget of &euro;851.3 million will see the ring-fenced &euro;35 million spent but some of that spending will not occur, in a budgetary sense, until 2018.<\/p> <p>  Crucially, people in these Houses have talked about implementing the Vision for Change policy.  It is so important that we implement Vision for Change.  Every political party agrees with that.  Dealing with this not just about current spending.  There are crucial capital spending parts of the Vision for Change that have been overlooked.  If they are not delivered then one cannot implement the programme.  In addition to the &euro;35 million, of which &euro;15 million will be spent in 2017, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the Government will expend at least another &euro;50 million on the National Forensic Mental Health Service, which will deliver a new modern mental health facility in Portrane thus replacing the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  The project was granted permission in June 2015 and site preparation works were undertaken by the HSE during 2016.  In the budget discussions we got the green light to deliver the project.  Phase 1 will provide a new 120-bed hospital along with ten new child and adolescent mental health units and a new ten bed mental health intellectual disability unit.  Significant additional capital was provided in budget 2017 to progress the project this year.  A preferred bidder for the construction of the new hospital has been identified and the award of the contract process is expected to be completed very shortly.  Construction will then commence as soon as possible this year.  The new facility will open in 2019.  Phase 2 of the project will see the provision for the mental health sector of a regional intensive care rehabilitation unit.  It is important that we do these things regionally as well.<\/p> <p>  If the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, was here today she would make the same point as me that the totality of the mental health budget is over &euro;800 million for this year.  There is a lot more than an extra &euro;35 million being spent when people consider the full range of services of which a crucial part is capital.  There have been international reports written on how we need to replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum and we will do it this year.  This is a more upfront and transparent way of telling people how the mental health budget is going to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#R00900","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1171,"content":"<p>Does the Vote of &euro;907 million for mental health include the additional money?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#R01000","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1172,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#R01100","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1173,"content":"<p>I want to start on this issue.  I have been a member of a health board for a long time.  One of the things that I learned was that every crucial decision, that was imminent as of today, usually took about ten years of preparation and another ten years of procrastination when it was approved.  I congratulate the Minister and his ministerial colleagues for bringing things to a head in those areas.  They were not done as quickly as we would have all liked but they needed to be brought to a head.  There is no use talking about what is required unless we provide it because we will waste money if we continue to utilise outdated and unsuitable services in the mental health service or anywhere else for that matter.<\/p> <p>  There is a huge difference between the co-ordination of efforts between mental health services at community and institutional levels.  I wish to also refer to the degree to which semi-residential or day services in the community must continue to receive the degree of attention that they require, in particular the supervision of patients who require medication.  All of the problems that I have come across in recent times relate to, in some cases, the patient stubbornly refusing to accept the need for medication, refuses to take medication altogether or takes the medication when supervised but refuses to do so when not supervised.  It is a question of trying to ensure the continuity between the level and quality of services available in the residential areas and the community based areas.<\/p> <p>  I would like time to finish my contribution because I must go elsewhere.  I compliment the Minister and his five colleagues.  I disagree with people who say that there are too many involved in this area.  The health ministry has been identified as a poisoned chalice for some years.  I regard it more as a hot potato in the sense that it tends to burn the fingers of everyone involved.  The Department requires a combined effort under a number of headings with all hands on deck.  With luck, their endeavour will work in the long run.<\/p> <p>  I wish to discuss the degree to which we do not rely on health and well-being.  The topic gets more attention than heretofore.  There are many things that the children in school and everybody can do that will contribute to better health.  It is quite simple and comes in the form of dietary changes, etc.  Simple changes can save a lot of money at some stage down the road.  Unfortunately, we do not do enough in terms of health and well-being.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make two final points.  First, I support my colleague, Deputy Louise O'Reilly, in terms of the use of IT in the general hospital services, GP services, and the co-ordination of activity between GPs, the hospitals and consultants, etc. to a far greater extent than happens at present.  I do not know how true is the following anecdote but a man told me the other day that he could save the State billions of euro on IT, according to himself.  He is probably watching this broadcast so I had better not say anything about him.  We need to explore every opportunity as quickly as possible to provide a better service for patients, a more efficient and cost-effective service and a more responsive, quicker service that reduces the waiting lists.<\/p><p> We need to rely more on the ambulance service, as was referred to.  The air ambulance service must be co-ordinated and integrated with the ambulance service to a greater extent than it has been.  That is a goal we should deal with.  The equipping of ambulances is an urgent issue also.  We all come across ambulances from time to time that have seen better days.  Vintage vehicles are alright at shows but they do not do the job to the same extent.  The technology in the older vehicles cannot be available to the level required now.<\/p><p>  Incidental to the debate - but with an impact - is the third level education access.  I have come across cases of refugees or asylum seekers, for example, with very high IQs but because they do not have residency status in Ireland they cannot get access to third level education.  This is a sad situation.  It is not a matter for the Minister for Health but it is an issue.  There are many possible students with excellent potential who could be well used, who could make a great contribution to the health services and who would have a natural tendency to want to enter the health services - but they cannot.  I have taken this up with another Minister, as the Chairman knows.<\/p><p> My last point is around the palliative care residential services.  I know the Minister has visited the facility in Harold's Cross, and others I am sure, and I believe these services should be complimented for the quality of the care they provide and their understanding for the patient in very challenging circumstances.  All that can be done needs to be done in including them in the overall upgrading of services that is required.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and I apologies for speaking at length but I did my best to cover all the points I wished to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#R01200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1175,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan touched on some of the points I want to speak on.  If more money was spent on mental health as a preventative measure it would be very cost effective.  More money might be put into the campaign, \"It's okay not to feel okay\".  If people were to talk earlier and not bottle things up then money could be saved in the long run.  Campaigns could advise people on how diet and exercise can help with mental health.  Many of us think that diet is just for our figure, but it is very important for mental health also.  Sometimes these things need to be spelled out and if money was put into that message an overall saving could be made in the long run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#S00200","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1176,"content":"<p>Turning to an earlier discussion I have just had to leave to take a phone call and I had a quick squint at the newspapers.  It appears that the operation for the young woman who was on \"The Late Late Show\", Megan Halvey-Ryan, due for 9 March, has now been cancelled as confirmed by her mother Sharon.  I wonder about the extent to which we are in a room listening to figures - and with respect, some of these figures are vague - when real life is what happens outside of here while we are all busy analysing the figures.  No amount of analysis will restore the confidence of that young woman in our health services.  She was packing her bag to come to Dublin, her mum said.  I was reading the article as I came down to the committee room in the lift.  We need to address if there is a disconnect between what is said as an aspiration and what actually happens.  I was very distressed to hear that her operation , which was due on 9 March, has now been cancelled.  This touches on what we spoke of earlier but it is what is actually happening on the aspirations and everything else.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the child and adolescent mental health services, does the Minster have a figure for how many children are currently in adult units, which are called inappropriate settings, and does he have a plan to get them out from those units to put them where they should be?  If the Minister does have a plan, perhaps he could identify where the costs and money for that have been allocated.  I was in Sligo on Monday and I spoke to some parents who are having first-hand dealings with the child and adolescent mental health services.  Actually, let me put that correctly - they would love to be having first-hand dealings with the child and adolescent mental health services but instead they are on lists.  They tell me also that the list has closed and effectively no new people are being added.  I note that in the report we can see the number of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS,  referrals seen by the mental health services where one can see this figure is about to go up or is projected to go up.  The people I spoke with last week are not even on a list.  Does the Minister have figures for how many people try to access the CAMHS service but cannot make it onto a list?  If we look at the figures for psychiatry for old age we can see figures for the percentage of accepted referrals, re-referrals, offers of first appointment, etc.  There is a lot more detail there.  I might have a view as to why there is not much detail about the CAMHS but maybe we could get that same level of detail because it would give us an accurate picture.  I can see the percentages are there in the report but we do not have actual figures for how many children are waiting, how many children are referred and not seen and how many children have not yet managed to get onto a list.<\/p> <p>  I try not to be, but if I may I will be just a little parochial and ask about my area.  It is my understanding from parliamentary questions I have asked that a business case for a psychologist in the north Dublin area is being put forward and that the business case has been put forward twice.  We have the fastest growing population in the State and the highest number of young people per head of population in the State, yet we cannot access a child psychologist for the CAMHS service.  This seems very wrong to me.  It goes back to the issue of staffing and the crossover with the budget, and from the figures I can see the projected increase in the children using the services.  Does the Minister have a clear sight as to how this correlates to additional staff? Perhaps he could give us a breakdown of the grades, groups and categories of staff involved, and if it is intended to purchase any services from the private sector, for how many hours and for what types of services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#S00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1177,"content":"<p>I do not want to comment on an individual case at this committee.

My priority has to be to put in place the plan from a policy perspective and from a HSE operational perspective that will bring waiting times for scoliosis in line with international norms.  Four months is a huge improvement on where we were at, but it is right to try to make that huge improvement because where we are at currently is not acceptable.  The new theatre will open in April and this will bring additional capacity.  There will be further capacity this summer with the recruitment of the additional consultant.  We are looking at every and any option including the option of using facilities in the UK.  I take the point and will follow up directly on the other issue after this meeting.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of prevention, Deputy Murphy O'Mahony is right in that we must meet the challenge as it arises, but we must also look at how we can empower people, especially our young people to have the resilience skills that we all need to mind our own mental health.  This is the point.  We all have mental health that we need to protect, just like our physical health and well-being.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, is doing good work with the youth mental health task force.<\/p><p>There are some really good people involved in that group.  It is due to report relatively shortly.  It commenced in September.  It is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and it is working to develop action plans for the age groups from zero to 12 years, 13 to 18 years and 19 to 25 years, and for parents and what are referred to as \"noticers\".  It is being supported in its work by a series of youth consultations to ensure that it is a plan, not of politicians telling young people but that is owned by the young people of Ireland.  We see brilliant work being done, both in schools, above and beyond what they are required or asked to do, and by people in their communities as well.  It is about trying to empower all of that.  I agree with the Deputy in that regard.<\/p><p> In relation to the CAMHS services, on page 25 of my Department's briefing, as distinct from the committee's, there are some figures Deputy Louise O'Reilly is looking for on the number of CAMHS referrals, as opposed to the percentage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#S00600","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1181,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#T00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1182,"content":"<p>According to this, the output target in 2016 was 12,415.

The target for this year, in terms of actual persons as opposed to percentages, is 14,365.  Seventy-two per cent will be seen within 12 weeks or three months of being referred for an appointment.<\/p> <p>  On the important issue of the psychologist post, I will ask the HSE to update the Deputy directly on the position.  For the breakdown of public versus private grades, and the same breakdown the Deputy is looking for across the other areas, I will update the Deputy directly through the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#T00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1183,"content":"<p>Before we conclude, I want to raise two points regarding mental health.  The incidence of suicide in Ireland is frightening.  It is in excess of 500 a year and almost two and half times that of deaths in road traffic accidents.  In relation to what Deputy Louise O'Reilly said, the lack of talk therapy treatments is a issue not only in Dublin but right throughout the country.  In my area, we have not had a psychologist for two and a half years.  There is a significant gap in supplying talk therapy.  Mental health is not merely the prescription of drugs.  It is talking and communicating with people, particularly young men, which group has the highest incidence of suicide in Ireland.  It is important that issue is addressed.  There are many voluntary organisations providing mental health services, particularly in respect of suicide, and they are crying out for funding or for the appointment of psychologists and therapists.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, on health and well-being, the graphic refers specifically to vaccination and I will concentrate on that.  There is a vaccine which is in serious trouble, that is, the HPV vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine could possibly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, which is associated with the HPV virus that is implicated in 70% of cervical cancers.  The uptake of that vaccination programme has dropped to less than 50%.  There is a lot of adverse publicity regarding the vaccine.  The only way to address this is to address the parents and the young girls who feel they have been affected by the vaccine.  Otherwise, the vaccine uptake will decline further.  The Minister might comment on those two issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#T00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1184,"content":"<p>I take the point the Chairman makes in respect of suicide, the huge amount of work that we have to do and his own interest in this issue.  I will continue to work with the Chairman and the committee in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased that the Chairman raised the issue of the HPV vaccine, which is something that we have discussed at the committee previously.  The focus for 2017 is to counter misinformation on the safety of this vaccine and to increase the uptake rate in girls, as part of the schools immunisation programme.  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the national immunisation advisory committee, which is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland that comprises of experts in a number of specialties, including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and by international best practice.  In 2009, that committee recommended the HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls to reduce their risk of cervical cancer and in September 2010, as the committee members will remember, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second-level schools.<\/p> <p>  There are two licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland.  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the school immunisation programme and it is provided free of charge for girls in first year of second-level school.  In September 2011, there was a catch-up programme started for all girls in second-level school and the 2013-2014 campaign was the final year of this programme.<\/p> <p>  The Department is aware of claims of an association between this vaccine and a number of conditions experienced by groups of young women.  More than 100 million people have been vaccinated with HPV vaccines worldwide.  In Ireland, more than 220,000 girls have been vaccinated.  The HPV vaccine safety has been monitored for more than ten years, not only here in Ireland but by many international bodies, including the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization.<\/p> <p>  An illness that occurs around the time the vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply, according to the medical advice available to me, that the vaccine caused the problem.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes any long-term illness, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for such illnesses.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine and, understandably, some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter's condition but there is no medical or scientific evidence to suggest that available to me, the Department, the European Medicines Agency or the World Health Organization.<\/p> <p>  Any person suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention and access appropriate health services, irrespective of the cause of the person's symptoms, and the families of any girl suffering symptoms following the HPV vaccine are advised to seek medical advice from their family doctor in the normal manner and be referred to consultants familiar with these syndromes for diagnosis and management, if their GP believes that is appropriate.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE is currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.<\/p> <p>  I cannot stress strongly enough that all medical advice available to us is that this vaccine is absolutely safe.  That is international.  Some 100 million people have been vaccinated.  It saves lives from cervical cancers.  Each year 300 women in this country alone are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 100 women die each year in this country from this disease.  All cervical cancers are linked to high-risk HPV types and this is a vaccine that will save women's lives.  In 2017, it is our intention, the HSE's intention and the intention of a number of strong advocacy groups to debunk the myth about this and to try to get the vaccination rate increased.  As I say, families who believe their daughters are experiencing a medical condition that we believe is not in any way linked should seek medical advice from their GP in the first instance and a consultant where appropriate.<\/p> <p>  Can I raise one other matter, Chairman, if that is appropriate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#T00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1185,"content":"<p>Of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030200002#T00600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1488445200,"counter":1186,"content":"<p>It is not for discussion now but I want to briefly mention the issue of medicinal cannabis, if the Chairman would indulge me for 60 seconds.

In recent days, I have read information and received messages from people asking that I merely sign an application and make medicinal cannabis available to a named patient.  I am not going to discuss individual cases at this committee.<\/p> <p>  For the information of the committee, however, which will further consider the issue and has a timetable to do so, no licence has been granted by my Department for the provision of medicinal cannabis to any child without the recommendation or support of a consultant to oversee that.  There is no application currently in my Department with a paediatric consultant recommending medicinal cannabis and the Chief Medical Officer, who unlike me is a doctor, has informed me that I cannot grant a licence without that.

The treatment abroad scheme does not cover countries outside Europe but in the past some people by their own manner or means went abroad and obtained treatment and then sought permission to bring the treatment home, but they still required a consultant in this country.
