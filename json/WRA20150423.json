The position of elected councils has been enhanced through additional reserved functions and stronger governance powers.

In February 2013, the Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) document w as published as national policy. The option of moving to a national fire service was considered, but it was concluded that the risks of doing this were too great for the benefits that could be obtained and that those benefits could be obtained while still maintaining the local authority role in providing fire services.<\/p>  <p>  In the current arrangement, accountability for local fire service delivery is maintained through the normal arrangements under which the local authority executive is answerable to its elected members for the implementation of policy.  Local authority elected members exercise their reserved function of adopting &ldquo;Fire and Emergency Operations Plans&rdquo;, as provided for under Section 26 of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003.<\/p>  <p>  For the first time, Keeping Communities Safe sets out national standards and norms for fire services in Ireland. Local authority fire services can now be benchmarked against these national standards, while maintaining proper local accountability for service provision. The fire service is led and managed by 27 Chief Fire Officers, supported by a staff of 175 Assistant Chief Fire Officers, who also provide a range of specialist services. The 217 fire stations are managed by 600 Officers who are numbered among the 1,199 full time and 2,039 retained fire - fighters that make up the service.  Fire - fighter numbers in Ireland have been protected in recent years , despite the economic difficulties and staffing reductions in other public service areas.

Ireland is in the league of most fire safe countries, with a three year average fire fatality rate of 6.4 deaths \/ million of population in the three most recent years 2012 &ndash; 2014.  Of course, each fire death is one too many and we cannot be complacent, but this statistic underscores the quality and professionalism of fire services our fire authorities provide to communities.<\/p>  <p>  I am also satisfied that the current organisational arrangement at national level, with the creation of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in 2009 within my own Department, is an effective model for providing national leadership for fire services and emergency management and for driving and overseeing the development of consistent, effective and safe fire services by the local authorities.

Information from the National Treasury Management Agency, which manages the Dormant Accounts Fund, indicates that the net value of uncommitted funds in the Account as of end March 2015 is &euro;111.46 million.  This does not include a Reserve Fund, currently standing at some &euro;64.18 million. <\/p>  <p>  The level of uncommitted funds in the Account is dictated by a number of factors, in particular the three year aggregate and Ministerial level expenditure ceilings, which have been put on a statutory basis in the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Acts and which must not be breached. <\/p>  <p>  In this connection, the Deputy will be aware that, under Government Accounting procedures, disbursements on dormant accounts measures are paid in the first instance &ldquo;up front&rdquo; from a Department&rsquo;s Vote in the same way as with any other spending programme.  Therefore, Government Departments have to source funding for dormant accounts programmes from their Exchequer allocation in the annual Estimates.  Once expenditure takes place, either on administration of the measure, or by the project itself, it is reimbursed to the Exchequer from the Dormant Accounts Fund in accordance with the Dormant Accounts Acts, in the form of Appropriations-in-Aid payable through the relevant Department&rsquo;s Vote.  While the costs associated with dormant accounts measures are Exchequer neutral, Government Departments cannot spend Appropriations-in-Aid directly themselves once they are reimbursed from the Fund.  These are instead refunded to the central Exchequer.  In addition, the Dormant Accounts Fund is not a source of mainstream funding and the complementary nature of the Dormant Account Funds can impact on funds available for mainstream projects within Departmental Votes. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2012, a new Disbursement Scheme was approved by Government in December 2013.

The scheme targets low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  Recognising that similar mortgage arrears distress was being experienced by people with mortgages borrowed from local authorities and recognising the scale of the problem, the Government rolled out a national Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme in February 2014.<\/p><p>The LAMTR scheme allows local authorities to offer the mortgage to rent scheme to local authority mortgage holders with unsustainable mortgages. This enables families to stay in their home and their established community.  Surrendering the ownership equity in a home is a very difficult decision for a family; however, the mortgage to rent option does provide families with stability and continuity, after an often long period of financial turmoil. Ownership of the home transfers to the local authority and the family pays a differential rent.  My Department is keeping the operation of the LAMTR scheme under constant review.<\/p><p>The LAMTR scheme is just one of a range of short term and long term solutions available to local authority mortgage holders in arrears.

When the estate is brought to a standard which is satisfactory to the planning authority and is in accordance with the permission granted, it should be taken in charge promptly. <\/p><p>Circular letter PD1\/08 also highlighted that in accordance with section 180(2) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, unfinished estates should be taken in charge where the majority of residents so request and that where enforcement action or calling in the bond is not possible, or has been unsuccessful, strategies should be put in place to bring the estate up to an appropriate standard. <\/p><p>As stated, a priority list of all such estates should be maintained by planning authorities and remedial works carried out in accordance with that order of priority.  Where Irish Water becomes responsible for water infrastructure in estates that have been taken in charge and Irish Water is of the view that there is a service critical issue which may impact upon public health, it will prioritise such estates for any necessary remediation works. <\/p><p>Further to the establishment of Irish Water, circular letter PL 5\/2014 clarified in relation to the taking in charge of water services infrastructure in housing estates that planning authorities should take in charge such infrastructure on foot of establishing that it has been satisfactorily completed, with a view to such infrastructure being ultimately transferred to Irish Water by Ministerial Order under the provisions of section 12 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013.<\/p><p>In addition to the guidance outlined above, Budget 2014 contained a special provision in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF) to assist in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments arising from the economic downturn.

Under this process, local authorities were required to lodge claims in writing with the Special Liquidator by 31 March 2015 setting out the details of the claim and providing supporting documentation.  All local authorities concerned submitted their claims to the Special Liquidator by the required deadline.  This involved the submission of 217 bond claims totalling approximately &euro;30m.

While work is underway exploring how to optimise resources and governance arrangements to the greatest extent possible, I can also assure the Deputies that there will be no diminution of locally-provided services to the public, no closure of service locations, and no staff redundancies.  In fact, the aim of this exploration is to ensure that any efficiencies and savings achieved in governance arrangements can be used to expand and enhance local service delivery. <\/p>  <p>  The Citizens Information Board (CIB) is the statutory body responsible for providing information, advice (including money and budgeting advice service) and advocacy services on a wide range of public and social services.  CIB delivers on this remit through a network of delivery partners which includes 51 local Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS) and 42 local Citizens Information Services (CIS).  In 2015 the CIB has been allocated a budget of &euro;46m of which some &euro;17.9 million is allocated to the MABS network of companies.  <\/p>  <p>  There are over 600 permanent staff, approximately 200 scheme workers and an estimated 2,000 volunteers working for the 93 independent companies in the network (51 MABS and 42 CISs).  Each of these companies has a separate voluntary Board of Management, comprising an average of over 9 members per Board resulting in a governance structure of over 800 people.  The maintenance of such an unwieldy company and Board structure is no longer sustainable from an organisational or governance perspective and the resource effort required could otherwise be directed towards improved service delivery to citizens.  Therefore, as part of the implementation of its Strategic Plan 2012-2015, CIB commissioned a feasibility study to identify options for dealing with this issue through greater organisational consolidation and\/or integration of its delivery partners.  This work was carried out by a company called Pathfinder and overseen by a Steering Group, comprising national representatives from MABS staff and Boards, Citizens Information Services staff and Boards, and staff from the Citizens Information Board.  The work included extensive and comprehensive consultation with all stakeholders, including representatives of CIB's delivery partner services (MABS and CIS) at local level.  It identified a number of options for consideration.  Following on from this, the Board of CIB agreed to the establishment of a Design Group tasked with outlining and recommending possible new structural models.  The Design Group includes members of the voluntary boards and staff of a number of the MABS and CIS services, together with representation from CIB management.  Submissions were sought by CIB from the representatives of Boards and staff of MABS and CIS, to inform the deliberations of the Design Group.<\/p>  <p>  The Design Group recently furnished a progress report on its deliberations to the CIB executive, which in turn communicated an update to its network of service delivery partners.  The Design Group has identified, as an option for consideration by the Board of CIB in due course, that the 51 Boards of MABS companies and the 42 Boards of CIS companies could be consolidated across six (6) regions, resulting in six (6) independent MABS companies and Boards, and six (6) independent CIS companies and Boards, all reporting to the board of CIB.  However, it is important to note that any such consolidation would be at the Board level only.  All existing MABS offices would remain unaffected.  Local service delivery and personnel would not be impacted and would continue as before.  The proposed option could provide a structure to ensure that advice and input in relation to local issues continues and for networking to maintain local connections.  It may be possible to take any savings that arise and use them for enhancing local service delivery or indeed offering additional services.  It is also important to note that neither this option nor any alternative has yet been considered by the Board of CIB.  Accordingly, no decisions have been made by the Board and no proposal has been formally made by it to my Department for consideration.  It is expected that the Design Group&rsquo;s proposed option, when further developed, will be formally submitted to the Board of CIB for its consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300035#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments Administration","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300035#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[16012\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300035#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if two recent deductions of &euro;28 from weekly payment under the jobseeker's scheme, in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare, can be refunded; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The incentive provides tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence.  In the recent Budget I extended the scheme to include\u00a0rental properties, whose owners\u00a0are subject to income tax.<\/p>  <p>  Qualifying expenditure is expenditure subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.  The work must cost a minimum of &euro;4,405 (exclusive of VAT) which would attract a credit of &euro;595.  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply.  The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The tax credit is only available to the homeowner and not to children or other individuals who may fund the works.

This scheme provides grant aid to applicants to assist in the carrying out of works that are reasonably necessary for the purposes of rendering a house more suitable for the accommodation needs of a person with a disability.  The grant can assist with changes and adaptations to a home such as making it wheelchair accessible, extending it to create more space, adding a ground floor bathroom or toilet or installing a stair lift.  This grant can cover up to 95% of the cost of works carried out, which is far more generous than the relief available under the Home Renovation Incentive. <\/p>  <p>  Works which are grant-aided\u00a0also qualify for the Home Renovation Incentive.  Three times the value of the grant is deducted from overall expenditure, with any remainder attracting the tax credit of 13.5%.  This is to align with best fiscal practice in that relief is not provided twice for the same expenditure.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the deduction in respect of grant-aided work is not taken into consideration for the purposes of reaching the minimum spend threshold of &euro;4,405, excluding VAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300038#WRH01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living City Initiative","counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300039#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":202,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[16166\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300039#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total number of pre-1915 properties in Dublin 2, 4 and 6 which could be eligible properties under the proposed Living City initiative; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As Minister for Finance, I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions setting interest rates. <\/p>  <p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  Each institution determines the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors, such as cost of funds, and commercial considerations (such as competition, risk pricing and the impact on deposit rates).<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  However, the Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. <\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review and\u00a0has been the subject of recent correspondence between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  The current position is that the Central Bank does not have new proposals for the additional regulation of interest rates.\u00a0However, as I have\u00a0outlined in previous Parliamentary Questions, a former Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that in Ireland, as in most advanced economies,\u00a0it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants\u00a0when,\u00a0in fact, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. In this regard, there have been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may be entering a new and more competitive phase. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act) 2013\u00a0introduced changes to\u00a0Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which regulates fees and charges in order to attract new entrants to the Irish\u00a0banking sector and there is some evidence of\u00a0improvements in the\u00a0banking\u00a0sector with a number of institutions introducing new products and adapting their business model.\u00a0In the last 12 months there have been a number of new entrants to the Irish mortgage market bringing additional and welcome competition to this sector.<\/p>  <p>  I should add that myself and the Governor of the Central Bank meet regularly, the latest of these meetings took place on 2 April. Among the items discussed was the issue of mortgage interest rates. The Governor provided an update on the ongoing work that he and his officials are carrying out on the issue of the standard variable rates charged by the lenders.<\/p>  <p>  We noted that the SVRs charged in Ireland are higher than other euro area countries and have not fallen in line with ECB wholesale rates. The Central Bank will continue to research why this is the case and will publish results shortly. The Governor will update me on progress in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300039#WRJ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Operations","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300039#WRJ00900"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[16170\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300039#WRJ01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will clarify comments regarding a proposed relationship framework agreement with the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, where it was noted that an increased level of oversight is considered necessary, in view of experiences to date; if he will publish the full contents of all the memorandums released to a newspaper (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1186","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>As part of Ireland's third review under the EU\/IMF Programme of Financial Support, a report on which was published in September 2011, there were a number of conditions\/actions to which Ireland committed.

There was an end-March 2012 deadline in place for the introduction of these Relationship Frameworks with each of the banks in which the State acquired an interest in the context of the financial crisis to govern the relationship between the State, as shareholder, and each bank. <\/p>  <p>  The Relationship Frameworks were designed to recognise the separation of each bank from the State, to ensure their businesses would be run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the banks as an asset to the State , and to limit the State's intervention to the extent necessary to protect the public interest.

This decision appears to have given rise to a number of other subsequent actions which Department officials believed\u00a0could, quite reasonably, be considered to have caused a reduction in the Bank's recovery on the Siteserv exposure.<\/p>  <p>  On 25 July 2012, I met with IBRC's Chairman and CEO to discuss, among other things,\u00a0the concerns\u00a0regarding this transaction which were raised to me\u00a0by Department of Finance officials following their engagement with IBRC management.  During my meeting, I sought assurances around the concerns regarding the transaction.  The Chairman provided me with\u00a0strong assurances that the transaction had been thoroughly assessed by the IBRC Board and that the Board of IBRC were satisfied that the transaction was managed in the best manner possible to achieve the best result for the State, including the decision to allow Siteserv to control the sales process.  It should be noted\u00a0that the IBRC Board\u00a0had\u00a0a fiduciary responsibility to the bank's stakeholders\u00a0and so, in light of this legal responsibility, the Chairman and the Board\u00a0would have\u00a0considered\u00a0and\u00a0provided such assurances\u00a0following serious and careful consideration.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that at all points mentioned above, the transaction had been concluded.  Under the Relationship Framework which was in place at the time with\u00a0IBRC, IBRC\u00a0were not required to engage with me or my officials to discuss this transaction. They believed that this transaction was in the ordinary course of business, which was the orderly wind down of IBRC.  It was the fiduciary responsibility of the Board of IBRC at that time to ensure that this transaction, along with all other matters in IBRC, was managed in the best way possible.<\/p>  <p>  I am also\u00a0aware that the Central Bank of Ireland reviewed this transaction.  I understand that\u00a0this review focused on the transaction process and not on whether the transaction was commercially sound or reputationally optimum.<\/p>  <p>  This transaction pre-dated the appointment of the Special Liquidators of IBRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300039#WRJ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300039#WRJ01900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Redeployment","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300039#WRJ01800"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[15997\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300039#WRJ01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the transfer arrangements that are in place for higher executive officers in the public service; if there are facilities at the moment where a person in a Government office in Dublin may transfer to a post in County Cavan or County Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

A new model for procurement was approved by the Government in September 2012, with common goods and services to be procured by a new central sourcing organisation, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), and with central sectoral sourcing organisations in health, education, local government and defence procuring sectoral-specific goods and services.<\/p>  <p>  Common goods and services (such as utilities, professional services and marketing, print and stationery) account for approximately 60% of the State's public procurement spend.  Instead of public bodies each tendering separately for these common goods and services, the OGP will put in place contracts for these categories that all public bodies will buy from. Through the OGP, the Public Service will speak with one 'voice' to the market for services under this category of expenditure, eliminating duplication and taking advantage of the scale of public procurement to best effect. <\/p>  <p>  I would point out that reform\u00a0is being carried out in a manner that recognises the importance of SMEs. The Government acknowledges the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.  Circular 10\/14 which was issued in April 2014 by my Department is aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses that want to tender for public contracts and also to ensure that engaging with government procurement is easy and low cost.  This guidance set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote the involvement of smaller enterprises as well as highlighting practices that are to be avoided because they can hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.<\/p>  <p>  I would also point out that the OGP supports the work of Enterprise Ireland and InterTrade Ireland in building awareness of public procurement and supporting training for small suppliers in bidding for public contracts.  For example,\u00a0in 2014\u00a0the OGP supported two \"Meet the Buyer\" events in Belfast and Dublin which were attended by approximately 1,600 suppliers. The OGP\u00a0also supported the 'Go 2 Tender' programme run by InterTrade Ireland which was attended by approximately 400 SMEs.  This year InterTrade Ireland also delivered a programme on consortia building to assist SMEs to jointly bid for State contracts.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Strengthening procurement capability in the public sector will improve the value for money that we get from the State's considerable procurement spend and will make a significant contribution to Ireland's deficit reduction targets and enable the State to deliver much needed services more efficiently.  The OGP will continue to work with suppliers to ensure that winning Government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that Government procurement policies are business friendly.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300039#WRJ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public

At the emergency meeting Minister Flanagan and I emphasised the importance of preventing these extremely perilous journeys from taking place and in particular to tackle the criminal activity that drives this trade.  However, more than anything, people need to be safe in their home countries, and for this, political solutions to conflicts are essential, as well as increased humanitarian assistance.  We stressed that this is an EU crisis requiring an EU solution.  If it is a question of funding we in the EU need to find a way to make that happen. <\/p>  <p>   We indicated that the most effective responses to humanitarian crises of this nature have to be primarily grounded in the region where the conflict occurs, tackling the issue at its roots.  Ireland is increasing the funding of our humanitarian assistance.  As the Deputy will be aware, we have already been a substantial donor in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  We highlighted the importance of resettlement, which we will continue to do.

The CSO accept that the variant of the ethnicity question on the 2016 census may fall short of what could be expected in today's multi-racial Ireland.

The most recent year for which provisional data are available is 2013 which can be accessed on the EPA&rsquo;s website at the following link:.<\/p><p>In relation to compliance with our international carbon reduction obligations, Ireland is on course to comply with its greenhouse gas emission reduction target for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol in the commitment period 2008 to 2012. The Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, which establishes a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol from 2013 to 2020, was agreed in 2012 but has not yet entered into force. Ireland has completed the necessary domestic acceptance procedures in relation to the Doha Amendment and will be in a position to formally accept it in the third quarter of 2015.<\/p><p>For each year between 2013 and 2020, Ireland has an ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction target under the 2009 EU Effort-Sharing Decision (406\/2009\/EC). Furthermore, in October 2014, the European Council endorsed a binding EU target of an at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and specified that the target will be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, with the reductions in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and non-ETS sectors amounting to 43% and 30% by 2030 compared to 2005, respectively. While the specific details of the contribution to be made by each Member State remain to be defined, the Council agreed that all Member States will participate in this effort, balancing considerations of fairness and solidarity.<\/p><p>The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and in the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015, published in January this year. The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050. Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015.<\/p><p>In anticipation of enactment of the planned legislation, work is already under way on developing a low-carbon plan - the National Mitigation Plan - the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already under way and identify additional measures within the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050. I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the annual mitigation targets under the 2009 EU Effort-Sharing Decision (406\/2009\/EC) in the first half of the 2013-2020 compliance period. However, there will be a significant compliance challenge in the years 2017-2020 and therefore the first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address this particular challenge in the years 2017 to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that. It is also important to note that the Bill will provide for long-term successive planning in this respect.<\/p><p>2015 will be a pivotal year in terms of the international response to climate change. Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change are working to conclude a new global agreement in Paris in December. Ireland, through the EU, is playing its part in these negotiations. The October 2014 European Council Conclusions agreed the headline targets for the EU for the period to 2030 and these form the basis of the EU&rsquo;s intended nationally-determined contribution (INDC) to the new agreement, which was submitted to the UN Secretariat on 6 March 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300051#WRV01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Data","counter":513,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300051#WRV01650"},{"type":"question","counter":514,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[16100\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300051#WRV01700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will indicate which sales of former local authority houses, now freehold, continue to be purchased by investors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":515,"content":"<p>Under section 90(12)(a) of the Housing Act 1966, a person who bought a house from a local authority under a tenant purchase scheme must obtain the authority&rsquo;s consent to re-sell the house within a specified period after tenant purchase (20 years in the case of the 1995 Tenant Purchase Scheme).

Overall in 2014, 271 unfinished housing developments were resolved.<\/p><p>The detailed findings of the annual surveys, annual progress reports and other useful publications and information in relation to Unfinished Housing Developments are available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at:<\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>As Minister for Housing and Planning and Co-ordination of Construction 2020, I now chair the National Coordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments. The Committee comprises senior representatives of the key stakeholders, including the local authorities, banking and construction industries, NAMA, the Health and Safety Authority, residents and officials from my Department. The Committee was established to drive and oversee the implementation of the recommendations of Resolving Ireland&rsquo;s Unfinished Housing Developments &ndash; Report of the Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments, published in May 2011.<\/p><p>The Committee has adopted a collaborative approach amongst its constituent members to promote the work of resolving the housing situation faced by residents of unfinished housing developments. The development of Site Resolution Plans (SRPs), agreed between residents, developers, funders and local authority personnel for the finalisation of works on site to render estates as habitable as possible, have been pivotal in resolving a large number of estates. The 2014 National Housing Survey shows that, of the 1,263 estates inspected, there were 587 estates going through the SRP process. This collaborative approach serves the best interests of all concerned and is an effective tool in the resolution process. Further information on Site Resolution Plans is available in section 3.4 of the Guidance Manual on Managing and Resolving Unfinished Estates, August 2011 which is available at the following link:<\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300052#WRW00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"question","counter":521,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[16102\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042300052#WRW00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when it might be expected that provision will be made by the various interested parties for the completion of the development at the Waterways, Sallins, County Kildare, with particular reference to the alleviation of any issues affecting outstanding works; the extent to which such works have been identified, and responsibility attributed to the various parties involved; the extent to which the reason for ongoing delays havs been noted and identified; the remedial action proposed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":522,"content":"<p>The finalisation of any outstanding planning related matters affecting the development concerned are a matter for Kildare County Council and I have no function in such matters.

The EPA has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from the 29 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.  The EPA publishes an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAFE Directive. The most recent report, Air Quality in Ireland 2013 &ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality, was published in October 2014 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2013, compared to the CAFE Directive standards, as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health.   <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that downward trends have been identified for many pollutants and that Ireland currently meets all EU standards for air quality, while noting that Ireland exceeds WHO air quality guideline values for particulate matter (PM) in some areas.

Because of this, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns can often be similar to, or higher than, those in cities where the sale and use of smoky coal is banned.
