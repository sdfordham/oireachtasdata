We welcome the opportunity to give the committee an overview summary of Microfinance Ireland and our first year in business.  We look forward to members questions, suggestions and inputs on how we can build on our progress into the future.<\/p><p>  Microfinance Ireland, MFI, is a not-for-profit organisation established to provide loans of between &euro;2,000 and less than &euro;25,000 to microenterprises.   Microenterprises are defined as businesses that employ fewer than ten people and which have an annual turnover of less than &euro;2 million.  We were set up to manage the microenterprise loan fund scheme, a Government initiative that forms part of the action plan for jobs.  We do this on behalf of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p>  This scheme aims to address some of the difficulties being faced by microenterprises in accessing credit.  Our role is to provide loans to these businesses if they can show they are commercially viable but they cannot meet standard bank lending criteria.  MFI was set up to provide an alternative to, but not a substitute for, bank lending for these businesses.  We can only lend to a borrower if he or she has had difficulty in getting credit from a bank.  I would stress that MFI, like its peer organisations in other countries, is not a panacea for the problems being faced by microenterprises.  It can only be a small part of a wider solution to assist small businesses with the maintenance and creation of jobs at local community level.<\/p><p>  We are a small and lean organisation.  We had six staff in April of this year and we now have eight full-time staff.  We are a subsidiary of the Social Finance Foundation, which was set up in 2007 by the then Minister for Finance to act as a wholesale supplier of finance for social purposes.  We have a voluntary board with broad business experience.  Our board members are highly committed to developing an overall strategy for the business that is adequate and fit for purpose for a company of its size while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to market changes and forces in a commercially viable manner.  In addition, the board is fully committed to ensuring appropriate governance and regulatory compliance.  Board members also engage and are generous with their time in helping to promote the scheme at appropriate events throughout the country.<\/p><p>  When MFI was set up, the prevailing level of loan applications being declined by banks, coupled with a perception that banks were reluctant to lend, resulted in a preliminary assessment that MFI could lend up to &euro;40 million over a five year period, supporting up to 2,700 microenterprises and up to 3,800 jobs.  It was envisaged the county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, would be the main channel partner for pipeline applications to MFI.  It was also envisaged the CEBs would provide essential enterprise training and pre and post mentoring support and assistance with loan application preparation across all sector activities.  Immediately pre and post launch of MFI, there was intensive engagement and information sharing of the MFI-CEB partnership objectives with the CEB network.  That engagement and relationship building with the CEBs is ongoing.<\/p><p>  With regard to our experience since inception, we opened for business on 1 October 2012, with a lead-in time of just six weeks from the time of the company being incorporated to set up and open for business.  We received our first loan application in mid-October 2012, approved the first loan in mid-November and the first loan drawdown took place in December 2012.  Demand has been significantly lower than originally anticipated.<\/p><p>  In regard to progress in our first year, we opened for business on 1 October 2012.  I will summarise the progress we have made in our first year.  I am pleased to say that, in the year to 30 September 2013: we approved &euro;1.62 million in lending; we supported over 100 microenterprises; we supported 237 jobs, of which 118 are new jobs; we approved 45% of applications, broadly in line with the approval range we anticipated and consistent with the experience of peer organisations in other countries; and we have processed 239 loan applications, with an average turnaround time of ten days.  <\/p><p>  I will give members some idea of the nature of our work.  Our average loan size in our first year was &euro;15,000, in line with what we anticipated.  Some 81% of our approvals were to businesses employing three people or fewer and over 60% of our approvals were to start-ups, companies or businesses that were in business for less than 18 months before we lent to them.  Over 60% of our loan applications were received via county or city enterprise boards and 38% of applications applied directly to MFI.  We have achieved wide geographic coverage, with 22% of our applicants being from Dublin and 78% from the rest of Ireland.<\/p><p>  With regard to the profile of MFI borrowers, some 33% of our loan approvals have been to retail or wholesale traders.  Manufacturing businesses account for 11% of approvals.  Financial services or insurance related businesses account for another 11% and construction businesses also account for 11%.  Some 8% of approvals have involved arts, entertainment or recreational businesses.  Some 7% have been to businesses involved in providing accommodation or food and we classify the remaining 19% as being granted to a range of other services.  As is to be expected in this higher risk lending area, we must work with customers in difficulty.  Therefore, our loan portfolio already includes a small number of businesses which have experienced early set back and challenges with their ventures.  We are committed to working with them as they endeavour to get their businesses back on track.<\/p><p>  On the question of the demand for MFI loans, I hope the numbers I have provided give members some idea of the work we have been doing, although they are not the full story.  It is important to highlight that our lending activity is demand driven.  No matter how much we might wish to lend, we can only lend if we get applications.  We make no secret of our view that we would like to see more applications.  In our first year in business, we did not receive as many as we thought we would, and certainly not as many as we would like.  We need to generate more applications.  We encourage microentrepreneurs to get in touch with us and we encourage anyone who can direct microentrepreneurs towards us to do so.  This includes public representatives.  I would urge any or all members who have constituents, for example, or contacts who have had difficulty accessing credit to contact us directly or via a county or city enterprise Board.  Including details of MFI on members' websites and newsletters or linking in with us to highlight MFI customer success stories in members' relevant constituency events would be extremely helpful to us in promoting the loan fund.  We will give everyone a fair hearing.<\/p><p>  It is not realistic to suggest we can approve 100% of the applications we receive.  After all, 100% of our applicants have already been unsuccessful in getting bank finance and, as we have been entrusted with taxpayers&rsquo; money, we can only lend to commercially viable borrowers who we feel will be able to repay the loan.  However, we have been and will be a vital source of finance for those businesses we can help.<\/p> <p>There are currently around 250 people who are employed in microenterprises that we have supported; if we had not lent to these businesses, it is difficult to see where they would have been able to borrow the money they needed.  We are proud of our success stories, but we would like to hear more of them.<br \/><b><\/b>A key focus for me and my team has been to build awareness among potential borrowers.  We have taken a number of actions on this front.  We target events tailored for the microenterprise community, using the expertise of our staff and board members to speak at these events and encourage borrowers to apply.  We engage closely with key SME banks so that they will refer unsuccessful loan applicants to us.  We also link in with these banks to co-fund propositions that they have partially approved.  We have built strong relationships with business representative bodies to heighten awareness of MFI and put their members in contact with us if they need credit and can satisfy our criteria.  We engage in targeted, highly selective marketing and promotional activity, taking account of our limited budget, the relatively small size of our organisation and our obligation to invest taxpayer&rsquo;s money as efficiently and effectively as possible.<\/p><p> An example of our marketing activity is a recent successful national radio advertising campaign.  This ran over a three-week period last month and resulted in notable increases in the volume of weekly applications.  It was a substantial investment but it delivers results.  We recently re-launched the MFI website and have received very positive feedback about the application process now being clearly outlined; a step-by-step guide with helpful templates to assist applicants, frequently asked questions and samples of customers and their businesses that have benefitted from microfinance loans.<\/p><p> Another key focus is to make it as easy as possible for microenterprises to apply for loans, and if successful, to draw down the money.  We deal with applications thoroughly but efficiently.  We aim for an average ten-day turnaround time and we have achieved this.  We respond to borrower feedback.  We reduced the interest rate we charge on loans - our current interest rate is 8.8% APR fixed - to stimulate more demand.  This rate represents fair value in light of our cost of funds, the higher-risk nature of our lending and the rates charged for similar facilities by banks.  It also provides certainty to the borrower that both the rate and their loan repayments are fixed throughout the term of the loan.  We introduced a direct application channel.  When we opened for business, we originally only accepted loan applications through county and city enterprise boards.  This requirement was seen as too restrictive by borrowers and we removed it to good effect.  This has had a significant effect on application volumes, with direct applications now accounting for 38% of all applications.<\/p><p> We also simplified procedures and introduced borrower-friendly measures such as more straightforward requirements for supporting documentation - applications are accepted on a self-certification basis following informal or verbal declines from banks &ndash; making it faster and easier for micro-enterprises to apply to MFI for loans.  Borrowers have responded positively to these measures.<\/p><p> As previously stated, ultimately the scheme will be demand led.  Economic factors including changes in market dynamics and conditions will continue to be monitored and assessed in relation to the overall appetite and appropriateness for lending from Microfinance Ireland.  These include consumer demand for credit, particularly at local level, for goods and services that form the backbone of micro-enterprise activity and growth; improving employment conditions, which would present greater stability for people compared to the risk of business failure and further debt issues; the current legacy of both personal and business over-indebtedness, which can discourage people from taking on more debt to fund businesses and can lead to a focus on paying down debt and stabilising existing businesses instead of expanding.<\/p><p> I would like to turn to the subject of costs.  In pricing our loans, we have to balance offering a competitive rate to borrowers with getting an appropriate contribution to running the scheme. We cannot charge too much, which would unduly burden our borrowers, and we cannot charge too little, which would ultimately cost the taxpayers whose money we put at risk every time we back a business.  It is a difficult balance and a challenge which begins with keeping our costs as low as possible.  We are acutely conscious that any costs we incur will ultimately be borne by the taxpayer.  There are certain costs that we cannot avoid; we need the right skills to run the organisation competently.  Our annual salary costs were capped by the Government at &euro;500,000 and we adhere rigorously to this.<\/p><p> We need to spend money on marketing &ndash; just like the businesses we support &ndash; to generate awareness and fulfil our mandate to lend to quality businesses who cannot borrow elsewhere. We spent &euro;120,000 on marketing in our first year and we do all we can to make sure every cent counts.  We also incurred once-off start-up costs of &euro;278,000 when the organisation was set up.  While substantial in the context of the amount we lent in our first year, these costs will not be repeated and they were only sanctioned because they were necessary to set up the business.<br \/><b><\/b>Looking to our future strategy, MFI is conscious that its progress will be subject to a formal review by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in late 2014, after two years in business.  In advance of this review, MFI plans to undertake the following initiatives with a view to ensuring the microenterprise loan fund scheme continues to serve viable microenterprises and support both existing and new jobs in the economy.  MFI will continue to build awareness of the scheme and continue to monitor customer feedback to make it easier for prospective borrowers to apply.  We will seek to add other suitable partners to refer potential applicants.  We will continue to engage with CEBs, banks and the Credit Review Office.  We will extend our referral partners to include local enterprise offices in each local authority area; these provide the essential business soft supports including training, &quot;pre&quot; and &quot;post&quot; mentoring to our target audience, which is essential to the robustness of the microenterprise loan fund scheme business model.<\/p><p> We are currently undertaking a pilot scheme for loans up to &euro;5, 000 that offers borrowers the benefit of a simplified application process.  This pilot is being undertaken in conjunction with two local development companies  and is targeted at people on back to work schemes.  This pilot will be evaluated over the coming months with a view to rolling out nationwide in 2014,  if it is successful.  We will focus on success stories of existing customers on our website, at relevant events and suitable media opportunities to demonstrate how the scheme has helped various businesses; from the self-employed local mechanic, to the food producer who has secured a supermarket chain contract, to the business that involves both young and not so young family members, harnessing both experience and new skills to rejuvenate a family hotel, to farm diversification enterprises, to lending to both on-line and specialist and niche retailer businesses, to launching a community-based sports business activity and helping more innovative young companies that are involved in new technologies and new areas of manufacturing.  These are also being grant aided by CEBs and Enterprise Ireland.  After 12 months in business, we now have a portfolio of great success stories and a mix of customers who will assist us in championing how a loan from Microfinance Ireland may be able to assist further businesses.<\/p><p> In conclusion, we are fully committed to achieving the original business objectives around the potential number of jobs being supported through the provision of microfinance loans.  Like any new business, it takes time to launch, establish the model that is the right market fit and over time embed the model by adapting to ongoing market changes and customer feedback.  We firmly believe that we are on the right track and confident of building on the success to date and ultimately delivering on the critical objectives of job creation in local communities.<\/p><p> I hope that this summary I have provided gives you a better understanding of MFI, the work we do, the borrowers we help and the way we seek to fulfil the role the Oireachtas has entrusted to us.  Chairman and committee members, please allow me once again to thank you for your invitation to appear before the committee.

I acknowledge the Chairman's efforts to contact me over the weekend to give me time to discuss some of my concerns about the scheme.  Ms Murray said that MFI is not a panacea, which I accept, but unfortunately MFI is being presented as the panacea for the inability of even good companies with solid business plans to get credit, which is a serious problem for small businesses.  They would love to have even the promise of a ten-day turnaround when it is taking five, six or seven weeks to get an appointment at some of banks.  I am glad the director drew a line under that today.<\/p><p>  When MFI was established the idea was that it would be responsible for investment of &euro;40 million in small business over five years.  It is well short of that, at &euro;1.62 million.  Where is the original target now?  Does MFI expect to engage in &euro;40 million worth of investment over the course of the next five years?  As it prepares for the review, where is the target? <\/p><p>  I believe I saw MFI at the National Ploughing Championships.  How have the applications fed through into the October figures?  What were the weekly applications and the weekly turnaround in October?  The last figure we have here is up to the end of September.  There were 149 applications in the launch phase from October to March, which collapsed to 75.  Was the PR not good enough?  Did people just not understand it?  Surely at that stage alarm bells must have started to ring about the effectiveness of the marketing.<\/p><p>  Ms Murray mentioned one of the case studies being a community-based activity.  Is MFI funding community-based companies as well?  I am really interested in the scheme under which people on back-to-work schemes to borrow up to &euro;5,000.  Can Ms Murray give us some detail or send us some detail about that?  What kind of relationship does MFI have with the Revenue Commissioners, which have the best database for business in the country?  I suggested to the Minister of State at the Department for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Perry, that an information sheet could be sent out with VAT requests or any kind of correspondence with the Revenue Commissioners on the part of MFI and the credit guarantee scheme, because there are many schemes.  Has MFI engaged with the Revenue Commissioners to work with them to promote its services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111200005#E00100","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384264500,"counter":12,"content":"<p>We are deeply committed to achieving the original objective of &euro;40 million over five years.

We recommenced being present at events from the National Ploughing Championships to a range of other events around the country, including Roscommon Business Network International, Fingal Enterprise Week, Momentum Business Launchpad, the National Franchise Expo, Westmeath CEB Access to Finance, Portlaoise National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day, Your Business Day, Kildare Access to Finance, the One Stop Shop for Business with all Government Departments and North Dublin Chamber Expo.  Upcoming events for November and December include the Midlands Thinktank, Meath West SME Event, Meath Access to Finance, LCD Enterprise Officers in Mallow, Carlow Senior Entrepreneurs Conference and the Cork Enterprise European Network.  We are adding to those events daily.  We will be represented at those events with either a stand, a speaking opportunity or panel discussion or, what is more effective, on a credit clinic basis, meeting potential MFI applicants one-to-one.  That gives the Deputy a flavour of our campaign.<\/p><p>  Having looked back at the spend on advertising, particularly national advertising, since the launch we are in no doubt that there is a correlation between that and the applications we see, perhaps after a two- or three-week lag.  There were five applications in each of the first two weeks of October, then eight, six, and last week 13.  That 13 is a peak that is consistent with advertising campaigns.<\/p><p>  We are considering a small amount of money for the community-based schemes, the LDCs and small loan applications that can help to sustain or create one job.  These people are on the back-to-work allowance.  They may be long-term unemployed and in the semi-skilled area.  A small loan of up to &euro;5,000 may be enough to support them.  It is early days.  We have received ten applications and have approved nine of those.  The early insights are very positive.  Mentoring is vital for these people.  That includes training and pre- and post-mentoring.  LDCs are sponsored by the Department of Social Protection and the two with which we are running a pilot will make representations on the pilot&rsquo;s findings to the Department.  Everyone acknowledges and recognises that for any small business, and even more so for people who are long-term unemployed, as well as youth entrepreneurs, mentoring and training are essential to sustain the businesses long-term.<\/p><p>  In response to the question about heightening awareness through the Revenue Commissioners in the past couple of weeks, we have distributed more than 10,000 brochures at different events.  We have links with the Department of Social Protection under which MFI leaflets are placed in their offices.  We have also made contact with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service offices and we will take on board the Deputy&rsquo;s excellent suggestion of linking in with the Revenue Commissioners, who may be able to do a mail shot of our leaflet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111200005#E01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Adrienne Murray"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384264500,"counter":21,"content":"<p>In respect of microfinance availability, the Deputy mentioned that MFI is not a panacea.  There is no one solution to unemployment, as this committee is aware.  Our target is small businesses in local communities.  Typically they depend on local demand.  They are small business offering services or items such as food products.<\/p> <p>These are innovative and different ideas but they are targeting people living in those local communities and looking at the local market demand.  The overall economic situation has a large impact on the people we support and for whom we provide a service.  We all need to be aware of this point.  Second, the people we deal with who have set up these businesses are the heroes because they are taking the risk.  They have made a personal commitment of their time and they are very focused on making a success of that business.<\/p><p> The committee members will be aware that Microfinance Ireland is one small piece of the jigsaw of access to finance.  We are a very important piece of the jigsaw if a business cannot get that &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000 anywhere else but we are only one of the pieces.  As Ms Murray said, access to mentoring, training and advice is equally if not more important.  We look to the success of Microfinance Ireland as being linked to the success of the overall ecosystem - to use that term - available for micro-enterprises.  The 250 jobs we have supported today, in our view would not be there without access to finance because that was the critical item at that particular point.  Those businesses we have supported and the other businesses which we will support need continual additional support such as training or mentoring, from either their own local mentors or advisers - sometimes local accountants with whom they have good relationships - or from the local development centres or the local enterprise offices.  It is important to emphasise that this will be successful if we work closely with other partners all around the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111200005#E01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384265100,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I welcome the group representatives to the meeting.  Along with my party, I supported the establishment of Microfinance Ireland for good reasons because the Minister had set some very ambitious targets.  The ten-year strategy includes a target of &euro;90 million, an additional lending to 5,500 micro-enterprises and the creation of 7,700 jobs.  I would love to believe that we will reach the targets.  The group and Ms Murray have talked about reaching those targets and she is satisfied that they will be met.  However, I have concerns because of the success rate to date.  I will put this in context by providing some figures which were supplied to me by means of replies to parliamentary questions submitted to the Minister.  The annual administration costs for MFI for the year ended 2013 are forecast to total approximately &euro;900,000 with an additional &euro;278,000 start-up.  That amounts to &euro;1.1 million over this year.  Over the same period, MFI will have loaned out &euro;1.62 million across 170 enterprises, with an average loan value of approximately &euro;15,000 and an approval rate of 45%.  Over the first three quarters of the year, the number of applications has fallen from 149 in the first quarter to 71 in the third quarter.  This is a concern.  A total of 33% of applications are in the retail and wholesale sector.  Of the total of 295 applications which have been submitted to date, 64 applications were from Dublin, 25 from Cork, eight from my own city and county of Waterford and three from Kilkenny.  I will give other examples later of other counties from where there has been a small number of applications but none approved.<\/p><p>  MFI offers loans for three or more years at 8.8% fixed rate for all types of business needs, including working capital and financing of business equipment.  These loans are offered to people who have been refused credit by the banks.  There is no doubt that we need some sort of scheme to provide micro-enterprise loans but I agree with the previous speaker that it cannot be regarded as a panacea nor can it be an add-on to bank lending or a substitute for a lack of bank lending which is still a problem in this State.  I wonder whether the targets set out by the Minister are over-hyped and over-ambitious, given the current position of the scheme.  I ask the witnesses to explain the geographic spread and I will give examples.  Six applications were made from Leitrim but none was approved; four applications from Donegal but none approved; eight applications from Waterford with three approved.  In the big city of Dublin, 27 of 64 applications were approved.  I acknowledge the scheme is at an early stage but these are very low figures and there has been a very low take-up in some counties.  I ask why is this the case.  How will the group seek to increase the take-up?  I note the witnesses have challenged us public representatives to take some responsibility but we are limited in our scope.  I ask the group how it intends to encourage more people to make applications and hopefully the targets will be reached.  I do not see us reaching the targets.  How will the new relationship with the local enterprise offices improve the situation?  What targets have been set for next year and are they realistic?  I am sure we will be asking the group to come back here next year and we hope that whatever targets are set will be met.  What is the view of the group on how to reduce the cost of loans for business?  One of the concerns raised with me by people who are in business and by chambers of commerce and other groups is that the loan rate of 8.8% is still very high and it can be a problem.  The group talked about customer feedback.  How is that feedback received because this will provide information about why some view the scheme as not being as generous as it should be and why the take-up is not satisfactory?  What is the customer feedback information?<\/p><p>  We need to consider new ideas and practices in other countries.  One of the criticisms expressed to me is that the scheme is very rigid and traditional in its bureaucracy and application process.  Peer lending is done in other countries and I ask if those models can be considered.  I will explain the concept of peer lending which is where five or six micro-enterprises come together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111200006#F00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384265100,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I am familiar with that concept.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111200006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Adrienne Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1384265100,"counter":25,"content":"<p>That seems to be working in other countries so why are we not using these newer models instead of sticking with more traditional types of lending?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111200006#F00400","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384265100,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I will answer some of the Senator's questions.  On the question of the geographic spread of applications we have applications from every county in Ireland at this point.  There is still one county from which, unfortunately, we have not as yet approved a loan.  Some applications are more robust and more well prepared.  The assistance of their CEBs is obvious.  We see a noticeable difference when assistance is provided by CEBs to applicants in the preparation of business plans and cash-flow projections, when that mentoring assistance is in place.  As regards the spread of applications among sectors, that is a result of the demand in the market place and there are a lot of retailers and food producers.  We are trying to get a pure geographic spread reflected in the number of applications.  We are a very young business and we are trying to shape the model and the process as we go along.  We are fine-tuning the application process.  In recent weeks we had a meeting with the Minister and with the SME banks in attendance.  The Minister asked us to bring along a concrete proposal on how the banks could help microfinance further.  We firmly believe that there is an opportunity to get to the heart of the reasons applications are declined by the banks.  Instead of going through another process with MFI we propose that the banks would refer those applications they have declined to MFI with the consent of the applicants.  We are proposing a small pilot scheme of this process over the coming months and we are hopeful that we will see good results.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111200006#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Adrienne Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1384265100,"counter":27,"content":"<p>That still does not explain why some counties have a much smaller take-up.

In the Border counties, for instance, there has been a microenterprise fund in place for some years which allows applicants to borrow up to &euro;25,000.  In the west there is a similar type of fund, also with a funding limit of &euro;25,000, which I understand is called the creative development fund.  That is to say, there are already other means of accessing finance.  In many cases, however, businesses are reluctant to borrow, their main concern being to pay down debt.  We have been promoting ourselves as mainly providing working capital to microenterprises.<\/p><p>  Standard bank lending rates for overdraft or working capital loans range from 7.5% up to 8.7%.  We are not in competition with banks on the lending rate.  We charge a fair rate for the type of finance we are providing to microenterprises.  It is higher-risk lending and we are not overburdening the borrower with that.  We will continue to monitor our interest rates on an ongoing basis.  The margin we earn on the interest will go towards our ongoing operational costs and will enable us in the future to refresh the loan fund and lend to more enterprises.<\/p><p>  In terms of the overall picture, our plan is quite ambitious.  In terms of next year, we are hopeful of rolling out the two pilots to which I referred and reaching out to more business referrers in order to increase the number of applications.

As I said earlier, we are not in competition with the banks and are not a substitute for the banks.

The cost of infrastructure is of the order of some &euro;700,000, without any marketing whatsoever.  In terms of building volume off that infrastructure, the objective has to be to make more volume go through our business.  The core cost effectively cannot be cut below those levels.  As we begin to process more applications, that cost will not rise proportionately, but there is a certain minimum amount the Government has agreed to invest in the project in terms of the infrastructure to be put in place.<\/p><p>  The &euro;278,000 figure relates to once-off expenditure in 2012.

I was a strong supporter of Microfinance Ireland on its establishment.  While acknowledging that it could not be a panacea, I saw great hope for young entrepreneurs in this country arising out of its activities.  I am disappointed, however, with what the delegates have reported today, particularly their indication that they have not yet been actively involved in engaging with young people.  Reference was made to that the age cohort in response to a question from Deputy Dara Calleary.<\/p> <p>There is nothing in our guests' report about the age profile of the people for whom their organisation is providing support.  I am disappointed by this.  When the Minister brought the legislation through the Houses, I indicated my view that there should be a target in respect of young people obtaining access to support.  I do not know whether the fault in this regard lies with young people or Microfinance Ireland in the context of actively encouraging them to put themselves forward.  I hope Microfinance Ireland will be much more proactive in this regard in the future.<\/p><p> Ms Murray has stated Microfinance Ireland is not in competition with the banks.  Many members have referred to the fact that the banks are not lending to small businesses.  There are numerous instances in which this has proved to be the case.  The reality is, therefore, that Microfinance Ireland is providing an option for those who know they will not be able to obtain loans from their banks.  Is Microfinance Ireland actively involved with the banks?  In other words, are there brochures available in the branches of the various banks which detail what it has to offer?  The problem with the banks is that in recent years they have lost many staff who were able to gauge - from a financial perspective - whether people would be able to repay their loans.  We must oblige the banks to make decisions more quickly in order that young people and others who are seeking loans and whose applications are rejected might approach Microfinance Ireland.  Matters are not progressing as quickly as I would like because the banks are taking too long to decide whether particular businesses are going to be viable.  Microfinance Ireland should link in more with the banks on this matter.<\/p><p> What can be done to improve the level of take-up?  I am aware that Microfinance Ireland is running an active media campaign.  In recent days a person asked me how one might obtain the necessary information if one did not listen to the radio or read the newspapers.  There must be other ways - perhaps via post offices or whatever else - by which Microfinance Ireland can get its message across.<\/p><p> I hope there will be a good level of take-up of the Government's new home improvement scheme, particularly as there are many people who want to get back to work.

The vast majority of those who are unemployed previously worked in the construction sector.  It is important that this fact is taken into account.<\/p><p> I do not have a difficulty with the interest rate, particularly as Microfinance Ireland is operating in a higher risk category.  What is on offer is as competitive as most bank overdraft facilities.  However, I have a problem when it comes to bank charges.

Microfinance Ireland contributed to the proposal to which I refer in that it would be the designated lender if the programme in question was put in place.  We are asking the Minister to agree that there would be no necessity for the young people involved to go to the banks and that they would come directly to us.

To provide some indication of the activities in which they have been involved, references to Microfinance Ireland can be found in AIB's and Bank of Ireland's decline letters in respect of applications for loans and working capital.  They have been mentioning the organisation in letters they have issued on declined loan applications since the outset.  We engaged with them in order to have the reference included in their overdraft letters also.  As I stated, it is mainly working capital that we are funding, which is very important.  We deal with the banks on an individual basis and some of them have made our brochures available in their branches.  They also issue them with decline letters.  They have also included a reference to Microfinance Ireland and the loan fund scheme and how people may apply under the scheme in their own SME newsletters.  We are working with the banks.  Not only are we actively engaging with their strategy people, we have also briefed the wider lending teams, appeals teams and front-line business development people on how they can refer declined customers to Microfinance Ireland.  We are hoping to run a small pilot project in the coming weeks, the purpose of which will be to examine the point of source position with regard to what happens when banks decline or partially decline applications.  Instead of being obliged to undergo a separate application process, we would like the banks to be in a position to immediately pass on - with their consent - customers' information directly to Microfinance Ireland.  It is important to state we are seeking the same information and that our form is based on the model used by the banks.

In terms of <i>Business &amp;amp; Finance<\/i> magazine and the awards schemes, and even those at local level, they are all welcome initiatives in promoting the tremendous work that is done.  As Ms Geraldine Kelly said, the sole traders and the local entrepreneurs are the real winners and the champions of this.  We need to promote them.  The Senator will appreciate that it is early days for us, even in terms of people being up and running with their repayments before we could promote them either on our website or in provisional papers.  We are conscious of using our marketing budget as effectively as possible and we have already started including some of our customers and using them to promote Microfinance Ireland at speaking engagements throughout the country.  I am very much of the view that they are the success stories and the real champions of this.<\/p><p>  In terms of having a leprechaun or a magic wand,  we will continuously strive to talk to people.  We all know people who have had the unfortunate experience of business failure or who have loss their jobs.  Most people would view this organisation as a good idea and a welcome initiative.  Many more people are hearing about us.  In terms of the application process, I would mention a  shortened application process or, as we outlined earlier, whether there is there a link that we missed in terms of the process with the banks, whereby they would refer the declined application directly at source to us.  That would help us in our process.  It would help us in our marketing if there was an automatic referral and customer consent in that respect at the outset.  In fairness, the banks have willingly accepted that they will engage with us in exploring that opportunity and it will be led by the customer.  As Mr. Pat Kilbane mentioned, there are many figures on people who have been declined credit.  The Credit Review Office, which has been in existence for the past few years, has faced the same challenges in identifying customer behaviour or what is the reason that people do not pursue their application to an appeals process in its case.  We need to educate those people, provide the channels and, as Deputy Lawlor said, get our message out to particular sectors, such as the youth sector, and make them aware of this initiative.  There is not a magic wand or a leprechaun that can grant my wishes overnight but we are working very hard.  We are a young organisation, a small business, and we are doing our utmost to explore every opportunity and challenge.  <\/p><p>  In terms of the tremendous work that has been done on our website, I acknowledge that Eircom, recognising this as a Government initiative, provided financial support to Microfinance Ireland for that.  On promoting the scheme, we have PR company that has agreed to assist us on a <i>pro bono<\/i> basis.  There is great goodwill towards this initiative and we are working very hard to find the right avenues and channels to promote it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111200009#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Adrienne Murray"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384266900,"counter":50,"content":"<p>We all love the idea of a crock at the end of the rainbow.  The way I think about that idea is that this is about hope.  It  is about those businesses that are struggling today realising that the opportunity to come to Microfinance Ireland exists.  We circulated the case studies as part of our presentation.  We are supporting a wide range of businesses including people engaged in the production of free range meat products and specialist ice-cream and a person who has a tax audit franchise.  In addition to Ms Adrienne Murray's wish in terms of a crock of gold of getting access directly at the point where people having not been access to credit., those businesses that we have supported will be great champions for us in spreading the word.  There is no stronger promotion than a person who is running a business saying to somebody else, \"This worked for me, why do you not consider that?\".  It is about spreading the word.  Those businesses are in all the constituencies around the country.  What we are talking about is about capturing that in order that we can keep the momentum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111200009#J00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1384266900,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and I congratulate them on what they have achieved.  Theirs is a new business and while it is supported by Government and the State, they have to set up all the processes and it is quite a complex job to get money out there and start lending.<\/p><p>  Currently 96% of all finance for small business in Ireland comes from banks.  That is not sustainable and if we are serious about driving small business and entrepreneurship that percentage must come way down.  In other countries the equivalent percentage is approximately 70%.  We talk a good deal about being pro-business, pro-small business and pro-entrepreneurship but when one peels it back we are not.  We have some good practices but we have a great many practices that we can change and Microfinance Ireland is part of that change.<\/p> <p>I would like the role of Microfinance Ireland to be widened a little.<\/p><p> The other interesting point to note is that 70% of new jobs will come from the small business sector, the people being supported by Microfinance Ireland.  I did a quick calculation on what Deputy Calleary said and of the 237 jobs supported by Microfinance Ireland at a cost of &euro;1.62 million, when divided and multiplied by the other amount the office is supposed to lend, a total of 5,600 jobs would be created within the period which would exceed the target of 3,200 and almost double it based on what has been achieved to date.  Microfinance Ireland deserves congratulations in that regard.<\/p><p> Marketing is a big issue.  It is difficult to get through the noise because we constantly hear so much negativity.  We must focus on changing that.  I would like to see Microfinance Ireland involved in youth entrepreneurship because there is huge opportunity in it.  There are large innovation centres in all the institutes of technology around the country.  Microfinance Ireland must get in touch with all of them and the local authorities which have an economic brief.  Some of them are better than others.  There are also local Leader groups.  Credit unions might be interested in doing work with Microfinance Ireland as they can no longer lend to business or at least should not lend to business.  It could be worthwhile to get involved in a partnership with them.<\/p><p> One of the interesting points I noted from the information provided by Microfinance Ireland was the amount of women who had taken out loans.  Enterprise Ireland does a lot of work to promote female entrepreneurship and there are some good people involved in Enterprise Ireland with whom it might be worth developing links.<\/p><p> Microfinance Ireland appears to have a bright future.  I would like to see it being able to lend more than &euro;25,000 where there is the opportunity but I accept that it is early days and the situation might change.<\/p><p> It would be great if Microfinance Ireland did not have to operate through the banks because the requirement to get a refusal from a bank can break people, especially when they are in difficulty.  It can also take time before a bank issues a refusal.  We can talk to the Minister about being more open on the issue so that people could go directly to Microfinance Ireland.<\/p><p> I dealt with an issue that arose about tax clearance.  I welcome the fact that the website has changed and is more user-friendly.  I commend Microfinance Ireland in that regard.<\/p><p> Everyone present knows my views on mentoring.  We did a report on it earlier this year.  It was processed through Forf&aacute;s, which carried out a more in-depth report, the results of which have come out.  The results are alarming.  We spend &euro;8.2 million on mentoring in this country and it probably costs another &euro;10 million to deliver the service yet we are reaching only 5% of the population.  Decisions require to be taken on recommendations that were made.  I hope the situation will improve and that we will be able to monitor the outcomes.<\/p><p> I am concerned about rates of decline.  Has Microfinance Ireland seen any patterns with the rates?  A success rate of 45% has been achieved.  Is the problem with the people who do not get through due to mentoring or that their business is not sustainable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111200009#J01000","speaker":"988","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384267500,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Collins for her positive feedback.  We welcome suggestions on reaching target audiences such as through the colleges, incubation centres and credit unions.  In some cases we have developed links, for example, with programmes such as LaunchPad, but the innovation and incubation centres are part of our strategy for 2014.  Credit unions in particular in urban areas support self-employed people and we have been in contact to say we would welcome applications.<\/p><p>  In conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, we have funded some high potential start-ups, HPSUs, that are partially trading, which is to be welcomed.  We have linked in with Enterprise Ireland which has been very supportive of us.  Different teams are involved in terms of young companies that have attracted innovation funding that are potential exporters, although that is not our direct remit.  Nonetheless, if such companies need a small loan for working capital we can assist.<\/p><p>  Deputy Collins referred to mentoring and the Forf&aacute;s report.  We would welcome any new initiatives that can support the microfinance model.  We look forward to any initiatives or announcements by the Government in that regard.<\/p><p>  In terms of bank refusals, we are conscious of the difference between what is classified as a formal decline and an informal decline.  To use bank-speak, a formal decline is that the customer provides all their documentation and it goes through the bank&rsquo;s formal application process, which can take X number of days.  An informal decline &ndash; we are getting good traction on this &ndash; is where a person can go along to their local branch, discuss the project and get a verbal decline.  We are happy to accept a verbal or informal decline on a self-certified basis.  That is a practical example and we are getting traction in that regard.<\/p><p>  In terms of approval rates, we anticipated that it would be in the region of 50% and we are in the region of 45% to 46%.  In terms of decline rates, in the first case the applicants have all been declined by the banks, either formally or informally so we are already in a high risk category, but we have a different risk appetite from the banks in that our appetite for risk is higher.  The trends in terms of declined applications are based on business models not being sufficiently researched.  In some cases the business is in a highly competitive area in which we see business failure every day, sometimes due to saturation in particular sectors in local economies.  In other cases, the skills of some entrepreneurs are not relative and they do not have the necessary experience or, ultimately, the business model that is projected does not demonstrate repayment capacity.<\/p><p>  We do try to get applicants over the line.  It is a sad fact of life but in many cases people already have high levels of debt, both personal and business, and we do not think we would be doing people any favours by putting another loan on them where they already have existing debt.  In many cases we will lend to people who have outstanding borrowings, both personal and business, but where they are able to demonstrate that they have arrangements in place with a borrower, be it on interest-only or where a moratorium has been agreed with the lender.  In many of the declined applications we have not been able to see proof of that in terms of their outstanding commitments.<\/p><p>   I keep coming back to mentoring.  In terms of some of the applications that have not got through, we would defer them, go back to the county enterprise boards and say we think there is a good idea and ask them to provide mentoring assistance in a particular area, be it finance, marketing or distribution, and the applicants come back to us at a later stage and we are able to approve them.  We refer people back to county enterprise boards to see whether they can refine the application further and sometimes we can help in terms of phased drawdown.  If they reach certain milestones, we can review the progress of the business and then perhaps release a bit more of the loan.  We are conscious of being solution focused.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111200010#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Adrienne Murray"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384267500,"counter":54,"content":"<p>It is probably worth mentioning our appeal process.

I ran up against a stone wall about getting her help from the county enterprise boards because they do not help hair salons.  I have visited her salon and this lady employs people.  It is a great shame.  I tried to include this issue in the new Bill relating to county and city enterprise boards in respect of mentoring but the amendment was rejected.  I am taking that up formally in the Oireachtas.  It was presumed that mentoring was going to cost money whereas the board of Microfinance Ireland is voluntary.  It was short-sighted to reject my amendment because I said mentoring could be included.  They presumed it would cost money.  I intend to take it further.<\/p><p>  It is excellent that in contrast to the banks, Microfinance Ireland lends without security or collateral.  Its approval rate for completed applications in year one to 30 September is reasonable.  In respect of the approval rate of between 45% and 46%, Ms Murray said that people already have a reasonable level of debt.  I have referred to a friend of mine who is one of Microfinance Ireland's customers - Vicky Crosbie.  She will not mind me mentioning her.  She is an accountant and I told her I would mention her case today.  She is a brilliant girl and is getting on very well thanks to the help of Microfinance Ireland but she did say that she does not know how one would get a loan if one were not an accountant.  I presume that is the enterprise job.  What she said was interesting.  She knows finance and accountancy and can do it in her sleep.  I asked her for her opinion.  It is one to look at.  <\/p><p>  What is the projected growth in application approvals over the next two to three years in order to meet the Government's targets?  Presumably, the board has a plan to meet the targets of &euro;90 million to 5,000 enterprises over ten years and support 7,700 jobs.  This equates to nine million approvals per year,1.6 million approved to 30 September 2013 and 550 enterprises supported each year, so that leaves 107 approved to 30 September 2013.  There is obviously an expectation of a big pick-up in activity to meet the Government projections.  The report in September refers to an average ten-day turnaround.  Is this the time from application to decision?  What is the turnaround between approval of loan and payment?  The other point that has been referred to Senator Cullinane is the failure of three counties.  Leitrim has six applications and no approvals, Donegal has four applications and no approvals and Longford has four applications and no approvals.  They have been vetted by the county enterprise boards so I would like to know why this has happened.  I do not need to repeat it.  <\/p><p>  It was very interesting listening to the three witnesses and I enjoyed the presentation thoroughly.

Traditionally, the county enterprise boards have had sector exclusions but that does not extend to the boards being enabled and willing to provide mentoring across all sectors.  They have been extremely helpful to us.  We are open to all sectors from the local beautician to the local service trades worker.  In all cases, the county enterprise boards are providing mentoring and business training to all sector applicants to Microfinance Ireland regardless of the industry.

First, today's session has been highly informative in respect of teasing through matters and we might make this an annual visit, if the witnesses have time in their schedule next year to do the same.  However, I compliment the work Microfinance Ireland is doing.  It is not the organisation's fault if the applications do not come in.  While it can do everything possible to advertise itself and spread the word, it takes more than one year to get out that message.  Nevertheless, it is important that Microfinance Ireland and the service it provides are in place.  It is of key importance that people have an opportunity to approach it and hopefully to make an application.  It is not the fault of Microfinance Ireland and if the information is not out there, so be it.<\/p><p>  However, I have a couple of questions in this regard.  There is a big difference between those being refused by the banks and those ending up at the witnesses' offices or at the Credit Review Office.  Consequently, I believe the banks have a greater role to encourage people to approach Microfinance Ireland.  Passing out the word alone might not be enough and giving people a small push might be required.  Has an agreement been reached with the banks whereby they can voluntarily suggest people should approach Microfinance Ireland?  Alternatively, do the witnesses want this to be an automatic process, whereby the banks send such applications to Microfinance Ireland automatically thereafter?  I acknowledge that Microfinance Ireland cannot be in a position of offering loans to those who have not applied for them either and, consequently, there is a small issue in this regard.<\/p><p>  As for spreading the word, I presume Microfinance Ireland has engaged with all the chambers of commerce?  There are many groups in all counties delivering programmes, including mentoring programmes, start-your-own-business programmes and so on.  Has Microfinance Ireland tapped into all the associated databases?  Does it request that its information be sent out to all those concerned?  Within the enterprise boards, start-your-own-business courses and all sorts of follow-on programmes are being conducted every night of the week and presumably that is the clientele that Microfinance Ireland is trying to reach.  It should be facilitated in getting the word out because with eight employees, it cannot do everything.  There is a duty on all State bodies and organisations, as well as private sector bodies, to pass on Microfinance Ireland's message.  If the joint committee can help with so doing, it certainly will.  As for the senior entrepreneurs, that is, those aged over 50, I presume Microfinance Ireland has also engaged with them.<\/p><p>  On the applications it has received, has Microfinance Ireland received many initial contacts, via e-mail, questions or telephone calls, that have not proceeded with an application?  Does Ms Murray have to hand figures on this because it would be interesting and would highlight whether there was a problem with the scheme?  For example, the maximum amount of &euro;25,000 may or may not be a deterrent.  If it is, the joint committee really must consider the issue, as that is part of its function.  While I gather that might not be the case, the only way to know is from the information gleaned from those who approach Microfinance Ireland but do not make an application.  If these figures are high, there is a reason for that and it will be necessary to consider what is on offer.  I will leave those comments with the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111200012#M02100","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384268700,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  In response to his first question on the banks and the desirability of automatic referral, to date we have engaged with the banks in a goodwill manner.  They have been helping us to promote the scheme and, as I stated, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, held a round-table meeting last week that was attended by us and representatives of some other initiatives such as the Credit Review Office and the partial loan guarantee scheme.  In addition, the small to medium-sized enterprise, SME, banks were also present.  He asked us to bring along concrete proposals as to how the banks could help Microfinance Ireland.  We are of the firm belief that there may be a process in this regard for the customer.  While we can do a lot of promoting and so on in this regard, the challenge really is how to make it seamless and easier for the customer.  We hope that over the next two weeks, we will carry out, on an individual bilateral basis, a small look-back over the SME banks' declined applications over the past four to six weeks.  It may be possible for them to contact those customers and explain to them that MFI is a Government initiative, and asking them for their permission to pass on their customer documentation.  We are not looking for the bank's information in the context of data protection rules or anything like that.  Instead, we seek customers' consent to pass on their application and supporting documentation directly to Microfinance Ireland.  Thereafter, we can use our own assessment slide rule, for want of a better term, given our different appetite for risk and can then ascertain whether this is where the potential applicants can come to us directly.  It is early days and we have not even put pen to paper in respect of the process and so forth.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has asked us to report back on the pilot by the end of December.  In the future, however, if the pilot is successful, it would be interesting to have inclusion of customer consent at the outset of the bank application.  In other words, should the application with the bank be unsuccessful or only partially successful, the customers would give approval or consent to the bank to pass on automatically their documentation to MFI.  That is the concrete proposal we brought forward to the aforementioned forum.<\/p><p>  The question on the database is interesting.  We get a lot of telephone calls and, in particular, we see an uplift in them when we have an advertising campaign.  To be honest with the Chairman, we simply did not have the resources.  We had six weeks in which to get up and running and had a different website.  While it served us well, it did not have the functionality of creating databases, storing information, etc.  We have more work to do on our website yet but we consider it to be one of our main channels of delivery.  We do not have a network.  The county enterprise boards are the delivery channel and a strong promotional channel but we believe, like many others, that the direct channel offers great potential.<\/p> <p>It offers us the opportunity, as the Chairman stated, to capture inquiries, either coming through the website or from elsewhere, and then follow them up to determine why they did not pursue the application.  Many would say we would nearly know.  We have been monitoring those calls and we get a fairly strong indication when we take the name and address over the telephone as to whether it looks like a concrete application.  In terms of sending an inquiry to us via our website, in the future our new website will allow us greater opportunity to monitor those inquiries and whether they turn into solid sales leads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111200012#M02200","nonspeaker":"Ms Adrienne Murray","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384269300,"counter":105,"content":"<p>From what Microfinance Ireland has dealt with, has Ms Murray a general feeling?

I am the chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am accompanied by Mr. Des Johnson, director of planning, and Mr. Gerald Egan, director of corporate affairs.<\/p><p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has kept itself apprised of developments in respect of the publication of the outline heads of the Bill and the developments leading up to it.  The board is represented on an interdepartmental foreshore advisory group by one of our assistant directors of planning.  We made a detailed submission to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government earlier this year in response to the consultation paper A New Planning and Consent Architecture for Development in the Marine Area.  We also made a written submission to this committee.  It expands on a number of points that I will make in my brief opening statement.  We will be very happy to answer any questions members may have afterwards.  In the written submission, we raised a number of technical issues that will need to be considered further at drafting stage.  We will be talking to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government about them.<\/p><p>  Let me deal with the key provisions of the Bill.  As members are aware, the main ones relate to the alignment of the foreshore consent regime with the normal planning system; the creation of a new nearshore area as a subsection of the foreshore; the definition of an Irish maritime area encompassing foreshore; the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf; provision for the future designation of particular zones within the maritime area; the introduction of maritime options enabling project proponents to reserve a portion of the maritime area for a limited period while applying for the necessary development consents; the planning regulation of offshore commercial gas storage facilities by categorising such facilities as strategic infrastructure, with An Bord Plean&aacute;la as consent authority; and amendments to the Dumping at Sea Acts.<\/p><p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la welcomes the important initiatives introduced in the Bill for the maritime area in respect of strengthening the policy framework through mandatory objectives for the nearshore in statutory development plans, and also in simplifying and clarifying the development consent process.  These initiatives will facilitate a plan-led approach and consistency in decision-making.  The clear separation of the estate management or property management function, as exercised through foreshore leasing and licensing by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and the development consent function, as exercised by planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, will resolve potential conflicts between the interest of the State in seeking to maximise its revenue from the licensing of State property and the public interest in ensuring developments in the maritime area are acceptable in planning and environmental terms.<\/p><p>  The board supports the principle of a proposed division of the development consent function between itself and the planning authorities.  This division will allow for an efficient consent process, minimise duplication and provide certainty for prospective developers.  For projects requiring an environmental impact assessment, EIA, or appropriate assessment, it is clear that the planning system is responsible for the carrying out of the relevant assessments under the EIA and habitats directives which must be completed before consent is given.  These assessments are project based, and the provisions of the Bill facilitate their completion by a single authority, in this case An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in the planning regulatory system.  Owing to the nature of applications for foreshore licenses or leases, these will not require separate assessments under the EIA and habitats directives by the relevant Ministers.  The board welcomes this clarification.<\/p><p>  Other important initiatives include the definition in law of an Irish maritime area and the requirement for mandatory coastal zone management objectives to be included in development plans for development in the new nearshore area.  The board regards these as very important provisions.  The defining of an Irish maritime area could provide a national framework for the future production of a marine spatial plan or a series of marine spatial plans.  In turn, this would further facilitate a plan-led approach to the development consent process and consistency in decision-making in the planning and licensing systems.  Similarly, the requirement for coastal planning authorities to include mandatory objectives in their statutory plans for developments in the nearshore area should provide a strong policy framework for decision-making in the planning process.<\/p><p>  On the subject of An Bord Plean&aacute;la as a key planning regulator in the existing foreshore process, under planning legislation the board already plays a key role in the regulation of development on the foreshore, namely in deciding on planning appeals against development consents on the foreshore that would have been issued by planning authorities and in deciding on local authority applications wholly or partly on the foreshore under sections 226 or 227 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  We have had the latter power since 2001 and have been exercising it.  The board also has a role in deciding on other local authority applications that require an EIA or appropriate assessment and which are made directly to the board and in deciding on strategic infrastructure applications on land that are made directly to the board.  We have been doing that for a number of years.  The appeals and applications coming before the board for a decision vary greatly in their nature, scale and complexity.  Many of them already require an EIA or appropriate assessment.<\/p><p>  The Bill foresees an extended role for An Bord Plean&aacute;la in a new streamlined process.  There is a new function in the assessment of offshore gas storage facilities.<\/p><p>  Let me deal with the regulatory role proposed for An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the Bill.<\/p> <p>We consider that An Bord Plean&aacute;la would be the appropriate consent authority as proposed in the Bill for many reasons, including the following.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has operated as a planning regulatory authority since 1977 and has a national remit.  We operate a timely, coherent and transparent decision-making process for a wide range of development types varying in size and complexity, some of which I have just outlined to the committee.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has concluded 180 strategic infrastructure applications since the enactment of the 2006 Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act.  We have developed extensive experience in determining planning appeals, many involving issues relevant to the foreshore.  We also have experience in processing and deciding direct applications for large and complex proposals, many of which involve assessments under the European Environmental Impact Assessment and Habitats directives.  <\/p><p> An Bord Plean&aacute;la has also nurtured and retained a broad range of skills, qualifications and technical knowledge in the planning and environmental fields among its inspectorate and administrative staff.  We have a highly qualified planning inspectorate with expertise in areas such as EIA, AA and coastal zone management, all of which are relevant to the developments we are talking about here in the maritime area.  We also have extensive experience in holding pre-application consultations, presiding over oral hearings and the assessment of complex planning issues, all of which are relevant to the issue before us today.  <\/p><p> We in An Bord Plean&aacute;la broadly welcome the key provisions set out in the Bill.  From what we can see, they will facilitate a plan-led approach to the future development of the maritime area, aligning the foreshore consent process with the planning system, reducing duplication in the consent framework, involving a single EIA, and providing for a single-stage development consent process both for onshore and offshore elements of strategic infrastructure projects with An Bord Plean&aacute;la as the consent authority.<\/p><p> We will be happy to take any questions that members of the committee may wish to ask.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384260600,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee.

In addition, it is relevant to the debate on wind energy so we must ensure that we get the maritime sector right.<\/p><p>  What would be Ms Kelly's top priority if she had to pick out one thing that this Bill should so that has not been done to date?  What changes need to be undertaken to protect the foreshore?  Does Ms Kelly consider that the current planning legislation is strong enough to deal with the problem of coastal erosion?  When planning permission is given there should be a legal onus on every property owner concerning the knock-on effects of erosion, including displacement.  Can anything be done in legislative terms to that effect?<\/p><p>  Yesterday, we saw the result of a major court case concerning rights of way at Lissadell House in County Sligo.  Rights of way on the foreshore are historical, cultural and necessary because of the public's wish to walk along the shoreline.  Sometimes a development may need to install security measures that could block off a right of way that has existed for a long time.  What can be done in this regard following the outcome of yesterday's court decision?  I suppose we will have to work around it.  Historic rights of way should be safeguarded, however.  Ms Kelly can correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that all foreshore areas constitute a right of way.  Can extra safeguards be inserted in the legislation to state that X number of metres or kilometres should be added to ensure that in any foreshore development, or adjacent developments, rights of way are protected?<\/p><p>  There is a lot of detail in the Bill to which I may revert with other questions later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200004#C00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384260600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>The top priority from our point of view is to ensure that a coherent planning system is put in place for foreshore and offshore developments.

I particularly welcome the idea of a single environmental impact assessment for major projects.  There has been huge duplication involving environmental impact assessments, particularly in developing water, sewerage and drainage schemes.  Public representatives in coastal counties can find it hard to get even a small sewerage scheme sanctioned because there are so many hoops to jump through.<\/p> <p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine seems to have another impact assessment carried out.  I am in a constituency without a coastal region but members in this room know that in coastal regions it is very difficult to have that single assessment.  Could Ms Kelly explain how that works out?<\/p><p> Ms Kelly said earlier that An Bord Plean&aacute;la would be the appropriate consent authority.  I presume most of the projects are dealt with by the local authorities.  Where does An Bord Plean&aacute;la come in on consent?  Ms Kelly talked about defining a maritime area.  Will this cause further duplication with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  I presume that is the only other Department that would be involved.  It is a complex area when one looks at fishing, aquaculture, ocean energy and tourism as well other developments such as wind energy.<\/p><p> We have major representations, particularly from the midlands, that wind turbines should be out at sea.  I do not know Ms Kelly's views on that.  Apparently in the midlands, the turbines have to be higher because of the flat terrain.  There is a significant issue with energy that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is in a good position to deal with if it has a single impact assessment rather than the existing duplication.  I do not know if that will work out because there are very strong interests in fisheries, fishing, tourism and aquaculture, and energy is very important.  Huge meetings take place of people objecting to turbines, especially their location and distance from houses.  There will be more pressure to have those turbines offshore.  I support what Ms Kelly says and what is in the Bill but I am concerned about the practicality of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200004#C00800","speaker":"1040","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384261200,"counter":149,"content":"<p>As I identified, the single environmental impact assessment for major projects with one constant authority for the EIA is very important for everybody's sake.  With duplication and two competent authorities, one can get confusion in the middle.  There should be only one EIA.  On water, sewerage and drainage, these requirements come to projects because of European legislation on EIAs, or appropriate assessments, AAs, if it is a habitats directive.  They come in to protect the environment.  Many people think it is a lot of red tape but its function is to protect the environment in general through EIAs, and specifically designated sites in terms of habitats.  Most project developers understand EIA and appropriate assessment and know what is required and what they have to do.  Most of the water, sewerage and drainage projects come with EIAs to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The EIAs are usually well put together and very professional.<\/p><p>  The heads of this Bill suggest the foreshore, the economic zone and the continental shelf will together be described as the maritime area.  It will not be an extra thing but a designation.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will take responsibility, as consent authority, for anything that is designated strategic infrastructure in that area and anything that needs an EIA or an AA.  That means An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be the single consent authority and this would include wind farms of a certain size and a number of other strategic projects.  The local authority will be the consent authority for much smaller developments in the nearshore area, between the high and low tide marks.  It is a big improvement to have one consent authority for all that.<\/p><p>  I take Deputy Kitt's point about wind energy.  There is much concern at local level around some of the big projects being proposed or promoted on land, and people on land say they should be put at sea.  There is a long way to go before that plays out.  While I cannot comment on individual projects before us, a strategic environmental assessment has been carried out on marine wind energy.  If that is used to produce a marine spatial plan which designates areas that would be useful for wind, that would be very helpful and would give a structured approach to how we approach that.  We are very lucky that we have a very good wind regime, both onshore and offshore.  We could gain much economic benefit from that and it behoves everybody to try to do that.  This Bill will be a step towards a very structured approach towards doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1384261200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>My point on duplication was that one still has to go to another Department for a foreshore licence.

I am, therefore, representing that committee's desire to discuss the issue as well.<\/p><p>  There could not be more important legislation than this because we are an island nation.  We have probably the highest ratio of coastal zone to land mass in Europe.  At every level - cultural, environmental, economic, historic and so on - this is important.  We all agree that the 1933 Act governing this area is inadequate and, therefore, the legislation needs to be streamlined and modernised.  The current legislation is unacceptable because all the power is in the hands of the Department.  Officials can sit on an application for as long they like - six days, six months or six years - before making a decision on whether something can go ahead on the foreshore.  That is unacceptable.  There is no appeals process and we are dealing with sensitive and serious projects, particularly those relating to wind energy, oil rigs and so on.<\/p><p>  Does streamlining mean making it easier for oil and energy companies to get big projects onto the foreshore and to get around environment impact statements and proper public consultation, as demanded by the Aarhus convention, or will it result in a robust system of public consultation and protection?  I worry that it will be former, not the latter, because of the three commitments in the programme for Government, which refer to streamlining, efficient foreshore licensing and getting resources onshore from offshore.  There is no mention of the environment at all.  Providence Resources had to withdraw its application to build an oil rig at a location unprecedentedly close to the foreshore because it was running seriously foul of European requirements for proper environmental impact assessment and there were major problems because of the negligible public consultation.  The company placed one advertisement in one newspaper and a few signs in a number of Garda stations, which was a joke.  All that was left at the whim of the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200006#E00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1384261800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Will the Deputy put a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200006#E00300","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1384261800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>It is a detailed question.

Something similar to the way we run our strategic infrastructure development currently for big projects on land is envisaged for offshore projects.  It is a structured approach.  A manager's report always comes to us as part of the planning application and councillors will have had an input into that.  The application is made and every submission is taken into account in considering it.  In general, there is a presumption that an oral hearing will be held for strategic infrastructure applications.  That presents an opportunity for the public or anybody else, including the proposer of the project, to present their case and be cross-examined by the other side.  There is a huge amount of public consultation at that point.<\/p><p>  The board is a transparent organisation, as is the entire planning system.  The contents of the application are on file, as are all the submissions, objections and the oral hearing.  Everything is available in the board's offices for anybody to see.  When we make a decision, the board takes into account all that has happened in the process and the decision is made on the basis of an inspector having investigated the entire project, sat through the oral hearing, asked questions of the developer and the third parties, put it all together and made a recommendation.  Inspectors are required under the Act to make a recommendation to the board.<\/p> <p>The board is a different set of people.  The Oireachtas decided the decision would be made by the board and not by the inspector.  The inspector makes a recommendation and the board decides on the basis of the inspector's report and all the other evidence in front of it what to do about the particular application.  If the board disagrees with the inspector or moves away from his or her recommendation, the board is required by law to give reasons and considerations for doing so.  It is a very open system and if one follows the paperwork, it is possible to see the reasons the board disagrees with the inspector.  In the majority of cases the board will agree with the inspector.<\/p><p> The foreshore is defined in various parts of the documentation we received with the heads of the Bill.  It is the area from the line of high water out to 12 miles offshore.  The Bill defines a nearshore as the area from the high water mark to the low water mark.  Local authorities will have jurisdiction in the nearshore and An Bord Plean&aacute;la will have jurisdiction in general beyond this.  Sometimes, when they are connected, the local authority might continue to have jurisdiction.  It is quite detailed.<\/p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett will appreciate I cannot discuss a particular project.  Some of my responses to Deputy Coonan may cover his questions also.  Everybody is aware the 1933 Act, which predates the planning Act, is outdated and needs to be updated.  The Deputy's concern is that streamlining might mean an easier journey for a developer.  I do not believe this will be the case.  It will mean a more streamlined and efficient process, but it should mean a comprehensive examination of the environmental impact of the project, whether it be a big wind energy project or oil exploration.  Some responsibility for oil exploration will remain with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.<\/p><p> An environmental impact assessment is a very comprehensive document and the board takes its responsibilities in respect of examining environmental impact statements extremely carefully.  When the board makes a decision on a project requiring an environmental impact statement, the board must conduct the environmental impact assessment.  The board must sign off on having done the environmental impact assessment, and on the basis of the evidence in front of it, that it concluded it would not have a significant effect on the environment.  We do not take this lightly.  We examine all the environmental issues before us in as much depth as we can and we go into great detail.  Environmental impact assessments and appropriate assessments, which are more specific if a special area of conservation or a European designated site is involved, take up an increasing amount of our time at board meetings and are likely to continue to do so.  I do not believe it will mean an easier ride for anybody.  Having one competent authority which is expert in conducting environmental impact assessments will give a very coherent approach to the environmental impact assessment of all these projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200006#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384262400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Will Ms Kelly speak about the public consultation and appeal elements and specific protections for the foreshore as distinct from areas further out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200007#F00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384262400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Part of the environmental impact assessment process takes into account public submissions.

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Anne Marie O'Hagan, who is also from UCC and a member of the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre, HMRC, of the Beaufort Research community.  We thank the committee for inviting us to participate in this hearing.<\/p><p>  In terms of our backgrounds, my principal training was in mining petroleum engineering.  I have postgraduate qualifications in researching marine resource management and coastal geomorphology, that is, erosion and accretion, if members wish to be specific.  Dr. O'Hagan has worked extensively in foreshore licensing and coastal management and provides a unique background in an Irish context, as she has qualifications in environmental science, planning and coastal governance.  She has topped these with a fourth and, she claims, final degree in law.<\/p><p>  We have approximately 90 members of the coastal and marine research centre covering a range of disciplines from computer science to engineering to zoology.  Our work is funded through a combination of competitively won funding from national, European and international programmes, industry-sponsored projects and direct industry contracts.  We conduct fundamental so-called blue skies research and applied industry-relevant research and work with virtually every marine research centre across the EU as well as other international centres.<\/p><p>  As part of our research, we work in partnership with Departments and agencies, regional and local authorities and key sectors, including fisheries, aquaculture, oil and gas, marine renewable energy, tourism and leisure, and conservation.  We have examined spatial issues with industry and other stakeholders, including environmental NGOs and the public, and cross-cutting issues such as adaptation to climate change, pollution, security and provision and use of data and information.  Given our background, we hope we can present an objective view of the definite need for revision and some of the potential difficulties posed by the draft legislation.<\/p><p>  It is generally recognised that the 1933 Act is outdated and unsuited to modern maritime usage.  Therefore, we warmly welcome the decision to review the Foreshore Acts and associated legislation but caution that this initiative could be interpreted as an attempt to streamline the process for large-scale development only.  We are not adverse to streamlining the process, but it cannot be for large-scale development alone.  The new Bill is essential if we are to meet the Government's ambitious national targets as defined under Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth and at EU level through the integrated maritime policy and blue growth agenda while maintaining our environmental integrity.<\/p><p>  At European level, integrated coastal management, ICM, and maritime spatial planning, MSP, are being advocated as the preferred approaches to maritime governance.  This is evidenced by the publication of a proposal for a framework directive on MSP and ICM in March of this year.  While this is still subject to debate, the directive would make MSP and ICM mandatory if adopted in its present form.  As such, member states would be obliged to produce and implement the MSP plans and ICM strategies.  Until such time as this directive is adopted, Ireland will be under no obligation to develop a national maritime spatial plan.  A national plan should be put in place, because otherwise, activities will be regulated only through the consenting processes, the procedural aspects of which are contained in this Bill.  This would result in efforts being focused on consenting rather than on improving management and reducing conflict or potential conflict.  In our experience, effective integrated management requires a strategy that includes all maritime and coastal activity, coupled with effective consenting legislation, if it is to succeed.<\/p><p>  Any consenting legislation must cover all sectors.  Therefore, we are discouraged by the omission of sea fisheries and aquaculture from the Bill.  This will only cause problems and reinforce existing divisions instead of encouraging co-operation between sectors.  This appears short-sighted when a more integrated decision-making is being recognised and advocated nationally and internationally through policies.<\/p><p>  To reduce pressure and maximise the use of our maritime resources, we should consider the co-location of activities, for example, aquaculture and tidal energy.  This would require one multifunction licence for one site instead of a series of licences associated with each location.<\/p><p>  While the Bill is a good start, and without wishing to slow the current process, key aspects need further refinement if it is to be implemented effectively.  To demonstrate this, we have selected some issues as examples, grouped under jurisdiction, responsibilities and mapping-charting, as per our submission.  Regarding the issue of responsibility, which relates to heads 3 and 20, we know An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been tasked with consenting responsibility for certain classes of proposed development, with responsibility for certain other proposed activities given to local authorities.  For both sets of entities, there is a capacity implication, as their experience and expertise have historically focused on terrestrial planning and development.  It is debatable whether this deficit can be closed from the existing terrestrial planning community.  Therefore, the capacity gap may need to be closed by employing external consultants.  Different approaches could be adopted at county level, leading to confusion among stakeholders.  Given the board's extended role, it is unclear what the future is, if any, for the Marine Licence Vetting Committee, which has traditionally provided cross-disciplinary scientific and technical input into decisions on foreshore licences and leases.<\/p><p>  In terms of jurisdictions, a new marine area comprising the territorial seas and the exclusive economic zone, EEZ, is consistent with key EU legislation on the environment, specifically relating to birds, habitats, Natura 2000 and the marine strategy framework directive.  It should be noted that there is a lack of agreed delimitation with the UK and France on fisheries, the EEZ and territorial sea limits.  This could create operational issues for enforcement agencies, such as the Irish Naval Service.  In addition, there are no international maritime boundaries in the Border bays, those being, Foyle and Carlingford.  Although the Good Friday Agreement gave the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, through the Loughs Agency, certain competencies in these areas, its powers do not extend to cover all activities.<\/p><p>  The legislation will result in changes to boundaries, a matter inherently linked to mapping and charting.  Currently, the legal high water mark is taken from large-scale Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSi, maps, namely, the six-inch maps that date from the 1800s and 1900s.  There have been a number of delays and, more seriously, court cases relating to jurisdiction and functional authority as a result of the boundaries as marked on those maps.<\/p> <p>We have cited Lisfannon marina in County Donegal as an example.  There are also implications in key Government functions, such as calculation of rates, land valuation and effective assessment and management of coastal change, such as erosion or accretion.  Technically, there is a disparity between admiralty charts and ordnance survey maps, which can be difficult to align because they have different functions, with differences in key attributes such as coastline and high water mark between the two sources.  Admiralty charts are produced on historical surveys, some of which date back to the early 1800s and 1900s.<\/p><p> These are some examples of key considerations but there are other aspects of the Bill which require further thought.  These include: head 7, dealing with the content of the development plan; head 11, dealing with the disapplication of compensation provisions; head 13, the partial disapplication of development levies provisions; head 20, dealing with local authority regulation of certain activities in the nearshore area and on the foreshore; and head 24, dealing with the designation of shellfish waters.  We welcome the idea of a revision nonetheless, and it should not be an obstruction to development.  Development should be done in a sustainable manner, as that is what integrated coastal management is about.  If the members wish to discuss any submission points or what I have raised this afternoon, Dr. O'Hagan and I would be happy to oblige.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200008#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Gault","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384263600,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation and I wholeheartedly agree with the closing sentiment that we need development in the marine area that is sustainable.  What is the witness's view on whether this Bill ensures the sustainability aspect in the full sense of the word?  This follows on from the questions I asked the people from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p>  Does the witness have any concern in this regard?  I should qualify everything I say by indicating that replacing the 1933 Act is a good move, as is moving the process out of what is essentially ministerial diktat into a proper planning process people can understand as transparent.  Have we got all the environmental protections and an open system where people can be consulted and participate in decisions that will affect local communities, stakeholder groups and people with an interest in the marine area?  The witness has raised some concerns and I have taken note of them.<\/p><p>  Following my earlier point, is there a lack of specific protection for the foreshore because of the creation of one zone being spoken about with this proposed legislation, if I understand it correctly?  It is said that this is to avoid unnecessary duplication but I am concerned that this could mean the particular need to protect the foreshore area, which is more sensitive in many ways, could face a potential problem.  What is Mr. Gault's opinion?  Streamlining can work both ways.  If I understand the proposed legislation correctly, local authorities are out of the picture for anything outside the low and high water mark, and responsibility goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am concerned about that, as the potential democratic input at a local level could be reduced.  I want to strengthen rather than weaken the capacity of local communities to have a say in matters that affect them.  I understand there are issues beyond the local, of which we must certainly be cognisant.<\/p><p>  I wonder if we would be better to have a three-phase process.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire, for example, the council wants to build a small jetty at the D&uacute;n Laoghaire baths, which is fine.  That could be dealt with at a local level, although I am unsure as to whether it would come in under the high and low water mark.  It probably would.  Could this be deemed part of the foreshore and be the responsibility of somebody else?  It seems there is a major difference between a small jetty and an oil rig, as one has massive implications not just for local communities but also wider coastal zone management.  A small jetty from which people can swim does not really have a major implication.

We would like to see the planning system in the marine as either part of or adding to the terrestrial planning system.  Why create a new version, as that seems odd?  There is no problem with having due diligence as far as environmental aspects are concerned.  Public participation, as noted by the Deputy, is unclear in the Bill.  From everybody's perspective, regardless of which side of the environmental or development fence they sit, we need clarity and transparency.  People want to see how this will be done.<\/p><p>  People want a single entry point in order to get a decision in a time-bound system, meaning they will not have to wait around.  Everybody would much rather have a concise and quick decision rather than a much longer \"maybe\".  It is about spatial management, and I disagree slightly with the Deputy with regard to scale.  It does not really matter what is being put in the environment and it should be able to go through a process in any case.  There may be extra elements to be put in place with a specific operation but the same process should be used.  Issues regarding the high and lower water mark also regard a question of scale.  Local authorities would deal with a smaller scale.  Our concern is related to competency, as the marine environment is difficult.  When people speak of high and low water marks, they are different every day, and they move because the coast erodes and accretes.  Nobody seems to speak of accretion, when there is an addition of land, and everybody talks about erosion, which occurs when land is lost.  The environmental systems seem to be in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200009#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Gault"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384263600,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Since adoption of the Strategic Infrastructure Development Act, there has been criticism because of a lack of public participation or an appeal process, as people are automatically drawn to courts.

I present myself to the committee as County Manager of Clare County Council.  I am also the chairman of the Land Use and Transportation Committee of the County and City Managers' Association.  Therefore, some issues will relate to the CCMA and others will relate to Clare County Council.  I have also supplied a copy of the CCMA submission to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government regarding a new planning and consent architecture for development in the marine area.<\/p><p>  The submission made by the managers' association, and my own submission, welcomes the proposal to reform the current foreshore licensing-leasing consent system.  That is the main issue of concern for local authorities.  There are a number of issues of concern about the current system that I hope that the new Act will address, to some extent.  It was interesting to hear the previous discussion.  Some of the issues discussed were a lack of a plan-led approach; a lack of integration between sea-based activities and the planning system; serious delays in issuing licences-leases; no statutory timeframe for the consent process; duplication of requirements, such as the fact that one needs planning permission and foreshore consent; inactive leases sterilising areas; and a lack of enforcement.  Such a situation leads to a disconnected system and acts as an impediment to investment and development in the marine area.  The previous discussion referred to the potential wealth that can be generated by the marine sector, particularly in the aquaculture and energy areas.  That is something that we are very conscious of in Clare County Council.  <\/p><p>  I welcome the aim of the proposed Bill, to align the foreshore consent system with the planning system.  I also welcome the fact that the Bill intends to legislate for a single environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment for major projects to be carried out by a single authority, An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p>  I note that the Bill contains a proposal to define a near-shore area and that the day-to-day management of a near-shore area will be assigned to local authorities with the exception of a development that requires an EIA or an appropriate assessment.  However, the proposed territorial definition of the near-shore area is between the high water mark and the low water mark.  That means that local authorities will have a limited role in terms of development and activity beyond the outer limit of the near-shore area.  That means the edge of the near-shore area and the 12 mile limit. <\/p><p>  It is envisaged that certain developments currently dealt with under section 225 of the Planning and Development Act will remain the responsibility of local authorities, even if they straddle the low water mark, such as pier and marina developments not requiring EIA and AA.  The Bill anticipates that local authorities could be assigned responsibility for certain activity and development entirely beyond the low water mark.  That would be pretty minor type development such as the deployment of navigation aids or research devices on or within the near-shore.<\/p><p>  It is accepted that An Bord Plean&aacute;la and planning authorities should be the main consenting authorities associated with planning and development applications in the marine environment, with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, overseeing the estate management aspects of the process.  Clare County Council and the CCMA consider that the planning authorities should be the consenting authorities for planning applications in the foreshore area, as distinct from what is provided for in Bill.  The Bill provides that local authorities would only be the consenting authorities for planning applications in the near-shore area.<\/p><p>  With regard to the structure, An Bord Plean&aacute;la would then be responsible for the following - the assessment of applications for developments within the exclusive economic zone, beyond the 12 mile limit; strategic infrastructure as defined in the planning legislation in the foreshore; local authority development that requires an EIS or Natura impact statement; and appeals for all development within the foreshore other than the strategic infrastructure or local authority development that requires an EIS.  Local authorities are responsible for all other applications for development in the foreshore area including the near-shore area.  That forms the basis of the submissions.  It makes sense that local authorities, in keeping with the Government policy outlined in Putting People First and giving more functions to local authorities, should have the role of determining consent applications for the foreshore area and the near-shore area. <\/p><p>  The role of consenting authority could be undertaken by an individual local authority or, where necessary, local authorities.  Alternatively, a single local authority or local coastal authority could be identified as the lead authority to deal with applications that traverse the jurisdiction of a number of planning authorities.<\/p><p>  I shall comment on resources for planning applications.  Obviously there could be resource implications if local authorities took on the responsibility.  We consider that applications for development consent or permits on the foreshore and in the exclusive economic zone should reflect the level of resources required.  That is in keeping with the recommendations of the efficiency review group of local authorities and local government, that we charge economic fees.  <\/p><p>  As envisaged in the Bill, responsibility for the day-to-day maintenance of the near-shore area could be assigned to local authorities regarding permitting activities by the introduction of new or existing by-laws that provide for the requirement to obtain permits for events with amenity value and activities such as filming, non-invasive site investigations, temporary moorings, seaweed harvesting of a minor nature or the deployment of scientific instruments and sample collection for research purposes.<\/p><p>  I note that the Bill referred to enforcement.  The CCMS recommends that enforcement in the foreshore area should be a matter for local authorities.<\/p><p>  With regard to the general development of the maritime area and foreshore, and referred to in the previous discussion today, a plan-led system should provide a framework for planning decisions, rather than planning applications and consents for permission being dealt with on an <i>ad hoc<\/i> basis.  We feel that there should be a plan-led approach.  That would facilitate the development of the potential wealth of the marine environment in a planned, efficient and sustainable manner.  The strategic integrated framework plan for the Shannon estuary will be published later this month and could provide a framework for such a plan-led approach.  The plan's objective is to balance the economic development potential of the estuary with a need to protect the environment and is the first of its kind.  <\/p><p>  In summary, I welcome the proposed approach of the Bill to align the foreshore consent system with the planning system.  I suggest that an enhanced role could and should be assigned to local authorities in the context of foreshore licensing and development consent.  As I said, the enhanced role would be in accordance with Government policy on the strengthening of local government as set out in the Government's policy document entitled Putting People First.  <\/p><p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to make my presentation and trust that it will assist the committee in its consideration of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Coughlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1384264800,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coughlan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200011#K00300","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1384264800,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coughlan for his presentation.

I am aware of one in particular, in the Shannon Estuary, where a long delay in a foreshore licence application has cast doubt on the future investment and development of the project.  We cannot afford to have delays.  If a potential investor wants to invest in the Shannon Estuary or in the marine sector, we must be able to respond quickly.  Potential investors and developers have made me aware that they can go to Scotland and get quick responses to applications, which is an incentive for them to invest in Scotland rather than Ireland.  From that point of view, it is important that delays are kept to a minimum.<\/p><p>  With regard to the plan-led approach, Deputy Stanley's comment summarises my point exactly.  We prepare terrestrial development plans for our functional areas but not marine development plans for our marine areas.  It is becoming apparent that the marine area is important and that there is substantial development potential in marine.  The west coast of Clare has been identified as one of the two hotspots in terms of wave energy and wave energy potential.  The other hotspot is Belmullet, County Mayo.  We are anxious to drive development but it must be done in a sustainable way and we must have regard to the environmental impact.<\/p><p>  That is why I referred to the strategic infrastructure framework plan integrated for the Shannon Estuary.  The objective of the plan is to balance development potential with the fact that the Shannon Estuary is a protected area through European designation.  It took a year and a half or two years to get through the process of preparing the plan.  There are 19 partners, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Marine Institute the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Office of Public Works.  These were the public sector organisations and agencies that had a vested interest in the development of the Shannon Estuary or in its protection.  That is the scale of complexity when dealing with the marine environment, as referred to by the previous speaker.  We must have a plan-led approach.  We cannot and adopt an <i>ad hoc<\/i> approach to the development of the marine sector.  In my presentation, I referred to the lack of a plan-led approach and the need for same.<\/p><p>  If a small-scale testing facility were to be developed, it would not require an environmental impact assessment.  Under the proposed Bill, if it was outside the nearshore area, the application would have to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That is the kind of application local authorities could deal with.  We have one on the way in County Clare and I hope we see many more.  A local authority could deal with that application rather than having to send the developer to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Generating support for projects is necessary because sometimes the local community reacts with concern and fear of the unknown to a potential renewable energy development offshore.  It is useful that local councillors and officials can provide assurance to local people that this is something worth considering and that a planning application can go to the local authority rather than An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is located far from the people with concerns.  It is usually easier to get the message across that this may not be a bad thing and to get local support, which is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Coughlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1384265400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>The county manager cited a problem of inactive leases sterilising areas.

We submitted our opening statement and supporting documentation in advance of the meeting and they are available for publication.   I am joined by Dr. Karen Creed and Dr. Tara Higgins.  At the end of our opening statement, we will be happy to answer questions committee members may have.<\/p><p>  By way of background, the Environmental Protection Agency assumed responsibility on 15 February 2010 for the regulation of dumping at sea activities in accordance with the Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Act 2009.  On assuming responsibility for dumping at sea activities, we undertook a detailed review of the existing legislation and the powers included therein.  Following this review, we established a dumping at sea advisory committee under section 41 of the EPA Act of 1992 to advise the EPA on the technical and administrative implementation of its functions under the dumping at sea Act.  The advisory committee meets as required and includes nominated representatives from relevant State bodies, including the Marine Institute, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority; from industry, including the Irish Ports Association; and from the NGO sector such as the Irish environmental pillar.  Committee members have expertise in fisheries, biology, ecology, chemistry, oceanography, navigation, commerce and engineering.  <\/p><p>  Copies of all of our permit applications, submissions and correspondence, inspectors' reports and permits are all publicly available and published on our website.  To reduce cost and increase flexibility the EPA issues multi-annual permits that are not specific to particular vessels.  This has allowed for more cost-effective planning and management of the sector.  Previously, specific vessels were named; therefore, anyone wanting to use a different vessel needed a new permit.  Permits were also only issued for one year.  <\/p><p>  In dealing with the body of work transferred to the EPA we have identified activities that no longer require a dumping at sea permit such as beach nourishment and have moved to tonnage-based application fees.  The agency has adopted a risk-based approach to the enforcement of dumping at sea permits.  The aim is to improve compliance with environmental legislation in Ireland.  We have investigated and prosecuted instances of unauthorised dumping activities under the legislation.  One of the issues which came to light during our initial review of the legislation was that the EPA had authority to licence only the loading and dumping of material at sea, while the authority for licensing dredging activity remained with the appropriate Minister.  This issue of dual consent, whereby ports and harbours wishing to carry out maintenance dredging had to apply to two public authorities for two separate permits, was raised by the agency in submissions to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The agency is satisfied that the proposed Bill removes that duplication and will speed up the authorisation process.  In the future applicants will only have to apply for one permit, which will reduce costs.  <\/p><p>  The agency is pleased that the proposed Bill also includes a number of other amendments to the dumping at sea Acts which we consider necessary to provide legal clarity and to bring the regulatory process for dumping at sea into line with the agency&rsquo;s other licensing regimes.  For example, head 31 will make provision for the Minister to make regulations which will enable the technical details of the permit process to be set down in secondary legislation.  It is envisaged that the regulations will set down the particulars of the permit process such as the timeframes applicable to consultations, notification of statutory consultees and judicial review and will provide for further information requests, oral hearings, a review of a permit, fees, abandoned applications and the withdrawal of applications.<\/p> <p>It is also anticipated the regulations will contain provisions for increased public participation in the dumping at sea permit process, which is of particular importance in light of the Aarhus Convention and its requirements regarding public participation.  The Bill also rectifies a number of other shortcomings in the current legislation, for example, by inserting provisions for transboundary consultation in cases where dumping at sea activities might have an impact on other member states.  In terms of enforcement provisions, the EPA believes that the changes set out in the Bill will improve enforcement of dumping at sea activities and the original Act contains several ambiguities which the Bill will remove, providing not only clarity for the agency but assurances to the regulated community.  The Bill provides clarification on who is authorised to enforce dumping at sea activities and provides for consistency of approach across the various enforcement bodies.<\/p><p> The introduction of fees for enforcement is also welcomed by the agency.  To date the agency has had to absorb the cost of enforcement under the Dumping at Sea Act 1996.  Previously all offences under the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 were indictable; there was no provision for summary offences.  This prohibited the agency from taking legal action without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions and required cases to be heard in the Circuit Court or higher.  The agency welcome the changes indicated and these will allow the agency the option of proceeding with summary prosecutions and it brings the amended Dumping at Sea Act 1996 in line with other environmental law.<\/p><p> In summary, the agency welcomes the amendments to the dumping at sea legislation proposed in this Bill.  The proposed amendments will end the dual consent situation that currently applies to maintenance dredging and will provide the EPA with legal clarity and enhanced powers to better manage the permitting and enforcement of dumping at sea legislation.  These changes are important in the wider context of the better regulation agenda being promoted by Government.  I hope I have given the committee an overview of the significance of the outline heads of the Maritime Area and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill 2013 from the EPA&rsquo;s perspective and I am happy to answer any questions the committee members may have for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200014#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dara Lynott","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384266900,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lynott for his opening statement.

I will speak about a specific and small aspect of the proposed foreshore Bill.  As it is probably useful for the committee to be aware of the service we provide, I will give a brief and succinct overview of our role.  I will be happy to answer any questions that are asked after that.<\/p><p>  The National Biodiversity Data Centre is pleased to be invited to make a submission to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the outline heads of the Maritime Area and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill 2013.  The data centre welcomes the commitment in the proposed legislation to develop a modern consent process for offshore and onshore activity and to implement the EU marine strategy framework directive.  The approach in the Bill to streamlining the consent process and subjecting it to a single environmental impact assessment is also welcome as it should deliver efficiencies in terms of policy implementation.  The National Biodiversity Data Centre provides services to the public and private sectors.  Therefore, it is outside my remit to comment on specific aspects of policy development.  Having said that, the data centre has a key role in assisting the introduction of informed decision-making, particularly as it relates to aspects of the management of Ireland's biodiversity resource and natural heritage.<\/p><p>  The National Biodiversity Data Centre was established as a reflection of the importance of biodiversity, which is the modern way to describe this national asset.  Most people use the term \"nature conservation\".  In 2008, a Government report estimated that biodiversity contributes &euro;2.6 billion to the Irish economy each year.  This vital national asset makes this quantified contribution through unseen ecosystem goods and services.  The National Biodiversity Data Centre was set up to assist in the management of this vital national resource.  It is well known that the geographical location of the island of Ireland on the edge of the continental shelf, abutting the deep waters of the true North Atlantic Ocean and influenced by the temperate oceanic climate, means we have a unique biodiversity that is found nowhere else in the world.  It is important to stress that \"unique\" means \"unique\".  There is nowhere else on the globe with this combination of factors.  I do not think it is sufficiently recognised as a huge national asset.<\/p><p>  The composition and interaction of species, habitats, ecosystems and - importantly - human activity demonstrates that this is a valuable resource that clearly provides opportunities for sustainable exploitation.  Its uniqueness means there is a special responsibility on Ireland to manage this resource effectively.<\/p> <p>Some of these responsibilities are outlined in international conventions such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, the OSPAR Convention, which is for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic, the Ramsar Convention, that is the convention on wetlands of international importance, and is also enshrined in European legislation, such as the EU habitats and birds directives, the environmental impact assessment directive and so on.  <\/p><p> The common theme of these responsibilities for sustainable management is that the effective management of this resource, dealing with the environmental aspects and using it as a resource to exploit, must be based on informed decision making to ensure they are both economically and environmentally sustainable.  It is recognised that the proposed maritime area and foreshore (amendment) Bill sets out a framework and process to introduce informed decision-making as it relates to the marine environment and to the coastal area.  As such it is a welcome development.<\/p><p> The question is where does the data centre fit in.  We have a defined but, perhaps, quite important remit that can assist.  I shall give the committee a brief overview of the data centre.  We are a national organisation responsible for the collection, collation, management, analysis and dissemination of data or information on Ireland's biological diversity.  It was established by the Heritage Council in 2007 and is funded by the Heritage Council and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. The data centre is overseen by a management board, the members of which are listed in my submission.  <\/p><p> The key point to note is that our work is cross-cutting.  We try to engage with the private and public sector and try to deal with volunteers and the research community and public bodies.  We are at the interface of this diverse group of sectoral interests.  The directors of many of the relevant statutory bodies, State agencies and cultural institutions are represented on it.  We have a small staff of six based at Waterford Institute of Technology and we are good value for money.<\/p><p> One of the key planks of our work is to develop a national information management system for Ireland's biodiversity and to make the data freely and universally available in a format that will enable the data to be used for policy implementation, research and building the knowledge base.  One of the systemic weaknesses in terms of managing biodiversity in the past is that it has usually been seen as a problematic area.  It is always at the end of the development process that some problem arises and then nature conservation biodiversity gets a bad name.  It is seen as an impediment to development.  We are now at a stage where we have modern state-of-the-art infrastructure.  We have a data management system which means that information can feed into the decision making process early on.  We hope that biodiversity and nature conservation will become as much a part of good planning and part of the routine as other aspects of development.  We are hoping to streamline that.<\/p><p> We have developed a state-of-the-art data portal where any person can access the data.  We have democratised the whole issue about freedom of information and access to data.  One can be at home with one's PC and one will get exactly the same access to data as somebody working in a university or public body.  It is a fundamental shift in terms of democratisation of information, of which we are quite proud.  We have mobilised 100 data sets of all aspects of Ireland's biodiversity.  Currently there are 2.5 million observations in the system and we have data on close to 14,000 species that occur in Ireland.  There are about 40,000 species found in Ireland.  It is a work in progress but every month we are adding to the database.   By the end of the year we may have close to 3 million observations on it.  It is important to note that the system deals with the terrestrial land based biodiversity and it is fully integrated with the marine.  It is one few places where there is interface between the terrestrial and the marine.  There is a seamless interaction-integration in that area.  If issues arise where offshore development may potentially impact on onshore or terrestrial we have a seamless presentation of data to enable better decisions to be made.  It is important to mention that we are not just a warehouse for data but much of our work involves analysing the data.  Data are only as good as what they are telling us. <\/p><p> We work with our key partners the State bodies, researchers, national experts.  We have a whole programme of analysis of the data.  It is one thing to mobilise the data but what is important is that they are telling us in terms of increasing our knowledge base.  We have done much work in that regard.  <\/p><p> The overall objective of what we are doing is to use empirical data to see the biodiversity resources of the country and by doing some analysis to say how it is changing.  We hope that can feed in a format that can feed into policy development and ultimately lead to better informed decisions that will benefit biodiversity.<\/p><p> By way of summation, what exactly is this service and what kind of data management do we provide on behalf of the State and what aspects of the work might be of direct relevant to the heads of the Bill and implementation of the legislation?  We undertake a large exercise in collating data from the private and public sectors and from those working in a professional and voluntary capacity.  We are at the crossroads trying to bring various partners together.  The engagement we have with the research community would be very different from the engagement we have with local communities.  That data is of value no matter from where it comes.  The value one ascribes to it is what we must note.  As we are at the coalface of decision making, we have to ensure there is high quality data.  All of the data on our system is fully validated and adheres to the highest international data quality standards.  <\/p><p> An important role for us is to have more and better quality data on Ireland's protected and threatened species.  We put effort into collating this.  For that suite of species it is important to try to get information available to people who are potentially making decisions.  One of the weaknesses up to now is not that planners do not want to take environmental or nature conservation concerns on board but the short time period in which to make a decision.  Usually, if they have to go seeking information it does not get there.  We now have the information mobilised fairly quickly and anybody working in any office can access it straightaway.  It is not password protected.  We hope it will improve accessibility of data for key decision making. <\/p><p> As we have a brief for both the terrestrial and the marine environment our system technically deals with Irish grid references for projection systems on land and latitude-longitude for the marine area but it does transcend the coastal fringe where we have a seamless flow of data.  We can deliver empirical data as to the known occurrences of protected and threatened species with any designated site or with any land parcel within the coastal area.  With our partners we analyse the data.   There is much anecdotal evidence.  My father used to speak of the demise of the cuckoo and that he had not heard it for years; of course, he had not because he moved from Kerry to living in inner-city Limerick.  It is all very subjective.  <\/p><p> We review existing data.  There is an internationally recognised process for assessing whether a species is threatened with extinction.  We apply this methodology to Irish data and come up with what is called conservation assessments or red lists.  We can say objectively that for a group of birds, x percentage of those are threatened with extinction.  It means we can prioritise conservation effort.  It reduces the ability of people to muddy the water in terms of their pet subject if we can provide objective data to help the process.<\/p><p> We have been working closely with the EPA and provide data to make the scoping exercises for appropriate assessments and environmental impact assessments under the habitats directive more efficient.<\/p> <p>Basically, if surveys have been done in the past and data have been collected for some purpose, we try to ensure the data are archived with the National Biodiversity Data Centre and that the data are available for any other purpose.  This provides added value for work that has been done, rather than reinventing the wheel, and also ensures the data archived informs future decision making.<\/p><p> We are a service provider to the public sector and one of the key aspects of our strategic plan is the facility to customise our online tools and data management systems to meet the specific requirements of any of the public bodies we work with.  We have an active programme with organisations like the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Inland Fisheries Ireland and some of the local authorities in trying to make our system more user friendly for them.<\/p><p> My introduction may be slightly tangential to the subject matter of the Bill, but I believe is of value to the committee to be aware of this.  I am happy to elaborate on any aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200016#Q01900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Lysaght","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384268700,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputy Coffey, the point Dr. Lysaght makes in regard to the bridging of the marine and terrestrial is well made.

I realise now that I had reason to engage with the data centre a while ago and I have a little story to tell in a moment in that regard.  Dr. Lysaght welcomes the fact that the Bill will contribute to a modern consent process and streamline the current system into a single environmental impact assessment.  He states biodiversity and nature are a unique national asset.  We acknowledge that and must contribute in whatever way we can to a sustainable environment.  I agree that the data centre should not be seen as an impediment but rather as an information provider for those who make decisions regarding any development that may happen, both in regard to the Bill under discussion or planning in general.<\/p><p>  I had reason to contact the data centre a while ago because I was lucky enough to see a pine marten in my area, Portlaw.  I was amazed to see him cross my path one day when I was driving.  I thought at first it was a fox, but then I realised it was a pine marten and contacted the data centre.  When I did, I found out about the MISE - mammals in a sustainable environment - project, which is investigating and collecting data on the habitats of pine martens.  One of the areas being studied was the area in which I was living.  I had not known that and was delighted to discover the data centre was based in WIT and to hear of all its good work.  I commend the centre and I now get the odd e-mail to do with the atlas of mammals and the number of sightings.  I commend the centre also on the excellent work it does in collating the reports of sightings.  Since I reported my sighting of the pine marten, I have reported a couple of sightings of the pygmy shrew.  I wonder if the Chairman has ever seen one, but I have seen it in my area a few times.  The work of the centre raises our awareness and alerts us citizens to our environment and is doing excellent work nationally and in WIT.<\/p><p>  I understand the Marine Institute has a significant technical role in managing the marine and all that goes with it.  Does the data centre have much of a role in the area of aquaculture?  For example, if people are developing aquaculture projects, do these projects have an impact on our existing biodiversity?  If people are bringing in oysters or mussels or whatever that are not native to a particular area, does the data centre have a role to play or does it just provide the data?  What is the centre's role in the planning process for such projects?  Do the local authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la contact the centre for information when developing a development or action plan in regard to marine development?  Do they seek information from the data centre?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200018#S00800","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384268700,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Coffey for his kind words.  I am glad we can provide him with feedback on mammal sightings.  Report of sightings are greatly appreciated.<\/p><p>  I will deal first with the issue of aquaculture, but will leave planning out of it.  We are not a statutory consultee and do not get formal requests for information.  We operate through a portal we are trying to encourage anybody who wishes to use.  I mentioned the term the \"democratisation of data\" and that is our policy.  Anybody can access or define an area on the map and generate the information known on that area, or more technically, the information that is available on our database.  Whether one is a statutory authority or Joe public, one has the same access to our system.  The system is user led and users do not need to come through us, but can define what they want from it.<\/p><p>  In regard to aquaculture, one of the tangential areas is that we maintain a national invasive species database and we engage heavily in that regard at both national and European level.  There are other issues about the importation of non-native species.  One thing Ireland does well, compared to other European countries, is that there is good national co-ordination between the various State bodies in terms of invasive species.  We are more or less the engine driving that, but there is great co-operation between us and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  We have an indirect role in aquaculture, but not a specific involvement.<\/p><p>  The portal we have developed is no good unless it is used.  We can lead a horse to water.  We hope this portal will become a link that every planner in every local authority will have on his or her desktop, which they will use routinely.  If there is to be a development in an area, they can use a simple query searching for the townland and can get a report on what species have been located within the area.  Part of my work has been to go around to the local authorities, working mostly through the heritage officers within the local authorities who set up meetings with staff in the authorities.  We give a demonstration of how the mapping system can be used as a tool.  To be honest, I do not know to what extent the system is being used, but it needs to be used more.  Part of my core work is going out and doing the salesman bit to try to get the local authorities to use it.

Nature study was an important part of the curriculum.  The comment made with regard to perception is dead right.  Some people view environmental data as an impediment to development.  If that is the basis on which they look at biodiversity or the world of nature, we are on a hiding to nothing.  It is difficult to bring any positivity to that perspective, not to mind provide an information stream.<\/p> <p>I recall my grandparents talking about the corncrake and how rare he was getting at that stage.  The terminology - biodiversity, nature - was a very important part of the primary school curriculum.  As we look back, we realise what we have missed.  I wanted to put that on the record, along with our appreciation for Dr. Lysaght's own organisation in helping us to maintain what is a very valuable and finite resource, but which is also playing an important role in our recovery, which is driven largely by the tourism industry.  Tourism cannot be dispensed from a machine; it is there naturally and it is what is bringing people to our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200018#S01100","speaker":"996","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384269300,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I agree full agree with the Deputy.  Of course education is so important for children, but we do not have the luxury to wait for a generation to do things better than us.  Biodiversity is a natural resource.  It is worth &euro;2.6 billion to the Irish economy and that figure has been worked out by the Department and is a tangible figure.  We often hear about environmental designations, usually in a negative sense about what it will stop us from doing.  We can look at that slightly differently.  From Achill to Athens, or from Gibraltar to Nordkapp in Scandinavia, the European Commission has stated that 16% of Irish land area is unique.  We can look at that as a positive thing.  In Britain there are 1 million members alone of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.  There are multiples of that number in Holland and Germany.  Looking for wetlands - something in which we probably would have no interest on a wet day in Belmullet - is actually a fantastic resource.  Tourism provides an opportunity to flag this, but efforts must go towards presenting the detail of what is there, rather than paying lip service.  This issue needs to get to the heart of public policy in a positive way.  There are great opportunities and we are missing them.  I apologise as I do not mean to lecture, but it is a challenge I would like to put back to committee members, because they are in the position to do something significant about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111200019#T00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Lysaght"},{"type":"speech","time":1384269300,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Lysaght for his interesting comments.  By having representatives of the National Biodiversity Data Centre and other like organisations before the committee, we will make better legislation.  We cannot be informed about everything, so the experts can add to the legislation.<\/p><p>  I was looking at what is known as the \"real map\" of Ireland and at the size of the ocean on the west of Ireland.  Given that 16% of the land area is unique in Europe, we are obviously not selling it enough.  To use Dr. Lysaght's words, there is sustainable exploitation.  We cannot afford to leave assets sit idly by, but neither we can afford to destroy natural assets.  It is easy enough to replace man-made assets, but nature is difficult and it takes billions of years to replace.  The most probable exploitation is that of wind at sea.  There are maps available showing the high potential wind areas around the coast, and these are coloured in bright red and bright orange.  Can Dr. Lysaght develop a map of the \"do not touch\" areas that have unique biodiversity?  I could not see that in his maps, which are linked to the British maps.  It is a very difficult ask, because the sea is so huge and there are funding issues here, especially since much of the funding is voluntary.<\/p><p>  When talking about national biodiversity, it would be remiss of me not to remember &Eacute;amon de Buitl&eacute;ar, amuigh faoin sp&eacute;ir and former Seanad&oacute;ir, who has died and who we are commemorating tomorrow in the Seanad.  When we talk about biodiversity, his name comes to mind from my childhood.

However, once we mobilise data and have digital data, we are really at the cusp of being able to do that.  It is probably a bit premature, but perhaps that will happen in another year or two.  There is a technique called biodiversity hotspot analysis and we can begin to use that for the data that we have mobilised, but there are many gaps.  It is an imperfect world, but we are nearly there.

On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Ms Barbara Nolan, head of the European Commission Representation in Ireland.  She is accompanied by Ms Eimear N&iacute; Bhroin, political affairs officer, and Mr. Graham Stull, economic analyst, DG ECFIN.<\/p><p>  This meeting is a good opportunity to assess the European Commission's priorities in the final year of its remit.  Everybody present knows there will be a replacement next year.  The Commission's work programme was announced last month and identifies a series of priorities for 2014, including on many important issues that will have implications for our political and administrative systems.  These priorities will help to inform the work of the Oireachtas throughout the coming year.  The Commission's stated intention is to make 2014 a year of delivery and implementation.  The programme will be focused on banking union and related matters, as well as progressing the issue of the single digital market.  It will also look to ensure new measures set out in the long-term budget or multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014 to 2020 are implemented and become operational.  In this committee we are very interested in hearing about the implementation of the youth guarantee.  There may be some information in that regard from the meeting held by leaders, as the issue is of key importance, not just for the youth of Ireland but also young people throughout the European Union.<\/p><p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of today's proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I invite Ms Nolan to make her opening comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013111200002#A00200","speaker":"1076","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384264800,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to present the Commission's work programme.  Before we get down to business, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the Chairman and committee on all their work during Ireland's EU Presidency.  In particular, the handling of the COSAC meetings was impeccable.  It significantly boosted the involvement of national parliaments in EU matters.  We in the Commission are keen to support that.  We very much appreciate all the hard work that was done during the first six months of this year.<\/p><p>  In October, the European Commission adopted its work programme for 2014.  The overall emphasis is on action and results.  With the European Parliament elections looming in May 2014, there is a legislative hiatus on the horizon.  In the work programme, considerable emphasis is put on trying to ensure that the work of the European Parliament and the Council on important proposals from the Commission, some of which have been on the table for a couple of years and others that are new, is completed.  The new initiatives are limited.  There are only four purely legislative initiatives, although other initiatives are a mixture of legislation and softer measures such as communications or recommendations.  We have tried to focus on putting forward what we think has a chance of getting through the machine, if one likes, because we have a very small window in which to get business done.<\/p><p>  A key stepping stone on the way to the adoption of the Commission work programme was President Barroso's State of the Union address to the European Parliament in September.  That set out the overarching political and economic ambitions and priorities for the Commission in the year ahead.  A key message from the address is that Europe is on the right track for recovery.<b><\/b> In Ireland, there are signs that the country is beginning to turn a corner.  However, President Barroso also underlined that there is still a lot of work to be done.  He said: &quot;We owe it to our 26 million unemployed.  Especially to the young people who are looking to us [the political leaders] to give them hope&quot;.  Even if things are looking brighter, there is no room for complacency.<\/p><p>  That leads us to the overarching policy priorities.  The first is deepening economic and monetary union and progressing work on the banking union, which takes top billing in that regard.  The second is delivering on growth and jobs, with a focus on tackling youth unemployment - I will return to the youth guarantee - and there are also the issues of strengthening the Single Market and promoting trade.<\/p><p>  The Commission work programme essentially translates the State of the Union speech into concrete actions.  The Commission does not develop the work programme in isolation.  It takes account of a variety of inputs across member states,<b><\/b>including debates in this Parliament, the European Parliament and parliaments elsewhere in the EU.  It also draws on the feedback from COSAC meetings in developing concrete actions.<\/p><p>  There are five annexes to the Commission work programme.  It sounds heavy and bureaucratic, but in fact all the material one would wish to find is contained in the annexes.  If one wants to know about a particular Commission initiative, there is a roadmap for each one when one gets into the detail of the annexes.  It is important that people are aware that there are no secrets.  All the information is available in the annexes to the Commission's work programme.  Some highlights include economic and monetary union, notably the adoption of key proposals on banking union and the further development of economic policy co-ordination; making the best use of the EU budget - the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, programmes are to be rolled out to support growth and jobs and to get the money flowing out to member states; completing the Single Market, including in the field of telecommunications; justice and security; and taking forward the EU's external agenda.  A constant theme throughout the programme is the delivery of a concrete set of measures that will benefit citizens.<\/p><p>  I will give more detail on the highlights.  In terms of economic and monetary union, the Commission will continue work on completing the banking union.<b><\/b> While very good progress was made on this under the Irish Presidency, a lot remains to be done.  Looking at specific measures, the adoption of the single resolution mechanism, SRM, fund is a priority.  I also want to flag the fact that the single supervisory mechanism will become operational in 2014.<\/p><p>  The Commission will work to reinforce economic governance<b><\/b>in the European Union.  I wish to focus on one issue that I believe will be of relevance to the country and to the committee, namely, the European semester.  For Ireland, the focus in recent years has been understandably, and almost exclusively, on the implementation of Ireland's EU-IMF programme and not on the European semester.  However, with Ireland's exit from the programme imminent, the semester will move centre stage.  As the crisis has demonstrated, there is a need for greater economic policy co\u00adordination between European countries.  The European semester is a central pillar of that.  Under the semester process, the European Commission publishes a set of economic policy and reform recommendations tailored to each member state.  They are known as country-specific recommendations or, in the awful jargon used, CSRs.  They are subsequently adopted by the Council at the end of June or in early July.  The recommendations will point to the important reforms that need to be undertaken in Ireland and in all EU member states from next year onwards.  For example, recommendations for other member states have targeted areas such as fiscal deficits, pension reform, welfare reform, labour activation and stimulating competition in professional services.<\/p><p>  In developing the country-specific recommendations, the input of national parliaments is vital.  The semester process for 2014, in which this country will take full part, kicks off tomorrow, 13 November, with the publication of the European Commission's economic priorities for the year ahead in the Annual Growth Survey, which will give an overview of the general economic situation of the EU and identify common policy priorities.  On Friday, 15 November, for the first time ever, thanks to the adoption of the two-pack, the Commission will publish opinions on the draft budgets of euro countries and reports on countries in the excessive deficit procedure.  Ireland will not have an opinion published on its budget because it is still under the EU-IMF programme until the end of the year, but that will happen in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013111200003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1384264800,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Could Ms Nolan clarify whether that means our budget will be moved back or the opinion will be delivered earlier?

It is the same for everybody else.  Each member state is under the same semester process unless it is in a programme.  I can confirm that it will be 15 October for draft budgetary plans next year.<\/p><p>  The social dimension of economic and monetary union should not be forgotten.  It is also a priority, and this reflects the importance of the need for a more cohesive economic and monetary union for European society as a whole.  I do not propose to go into this now as the committee is due to discuss this issue next week with Mr. Koos Richelle, Director General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.  I will leave this to one side because it is his particular area of expertise and responsibility.   <\/p><p>  The second area I wish to mention is making the best use of the EU budget.  A central element of the Commission's growth and jobs agenda is to maximise the effectiveness of the EU budget, the so-called multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and all of the programmes that will now be rolled out in that context.  The Commission is committed to working with the European Council and the Parliament to ensure that this budget swiftly becomes operational.  The necessary structures and programmes must also be put in place at national level so that we can deliver funding and help projects to get off the ground.  Provided this is done quickly, it will provide a real boost to the European economy.  I am delighted to report that in the early hours of this morning, after a marathon negotiation session, agreement was reached between the European Parliament and the Council on the 2014 EU budget, which is a crucial step towards the full final adoption of the MFF for the period from 2014 to 2020.  We can now move forward.<\/p><p>  The overall goal for the budget is to boost investment and employment, particularly for the young.  On this latter point, the implementation of the youth guarantee is of great importance, with 5.5 million young people in the EU currently unemployed.  The youth guarantee means that member states should ensure that all young people under 25 are either in employment, education, training or an apprenticeship within four months of leaving formal education or becoming unemployed.  In this regard, the Commission is looking forward to receiving Ireland's implementation plan for this initiative before the end of the year.  The Taoiseach is attending a meeting in Paris today which is the second in a series of meetings convened to focus on youth unemployment.  The first meeting was held in Germany, presided over by Chancellor Merkel.  My understanding is that the Taoiseach is focusing his remarks on the need for digital skills.  Unfortunately, I do not have a read-out of that meeting, but I am sure reports on what happened will be available later today.  <\/p><p>  On the investment front, funding for research and innovation is also vital, with Horizon 2020 centre stage.  Enterprise Ireland, in co-operation with the Commission and particularly Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn, will host the launch of Horizon 2020 in Ireland on 10 December next in the Convention Centre, Dublin.  Ireland has a very good track record in winning research funding and has set itself a target of securing &euro;1 billion under Horizon 2020.  Mobilisation of the entire research community has already started and the latest available information will be disseminated at the aforementioned conference in December.  Supporting SMEs is also of particular importance.  In that context, I would flag the fact that the European Investment Bank has an increasing role in supporting access to finance for SMEs.  We must advertise that fact more throughout the EU for the benefit of SMEs.<\/p><p>  In the context of completing the single market, I will focus on two areas in particular which we consider to be vital to support growth - namely, telecommunications and energy.  On telecommunications, in September 2013 the Commission adopted a proposal Connected Continent: Building a Telecommunications Single Market.  This telecommunications package will make it easier for operators to work across borders, improve consumer rights and more generally boost productivity.  Altogether, the single market in telecommunications could be worth &euro;110 billion a year and a world-class digital infrastructure could boost productivity by 5%.  At the EU summit last month, EU leaders called for timely adoption of the telecommunications package.  They recognised that the digital economy is vital to jobs and they put the digital agenda at the heart of their economic plans.  They also called for action to complete the digital single market by 2015 and said that urgency was needed.  With the European Parliament elections in May and a digital world that is moving on rapidly, I am happy to report that the relevant committees in the Parliament have already started work on this package.  However, it is hard to see how this work can be completed before the Parliament rises in advance of the election.  On energy, all consumers should have access to a fully integrated energy market by 2014.  The focus in 2014 will be on the energy retail market, to ensure that consumers can tap into the benefits of the internal energy market.  <\/p><p>  The justice and security dossiers have become an increasingly important element of the Commission's work.  The Commission has a number of proposals on the table and negotiations are under way between the Council and the European Parliament on some of these.  A particularly important file is the new data protection package, and the Irish Presidency is to be congratulated on the sterling work it did on this.  It is hoped that this package will emerge from the legislative process with a vote during the Parliament's last plenary session in April.  <\/p><p>  On the external agenda, the EU has a key role to play in tackling crises.  The EU is collectively the largest donor of global development assistance and humanitarian aid in the world.  It was announced today that an additional &euro;10 million would be given to the Philippines to deal with the crisis there following the typhoon.  Promoting peace and security remains a pillar of the EU's external action programme.  EU efforts in the ongoing crisis in Syria will continue, including the provision of assistance to the civilian population, support for attempts to bring all sides in the conflict to a peace conference and support for the Syrian mission of the UNOPCW, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.  <\/p><p>  On the trade front, committee members will know about the launch of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership negotiations, which was one of the highlights of the Irish Presidency.  EU and US officials are holding another round of negotiations this week.  The aim is to remove trade barriers, making it easier to buy and sell goods between the EU and the US.  <\/p><p>  My final point is on the REFIT initiative, the Commission's regulatory fitness and performance programme.  This relates to President Barroso's message in his so-called State of the Union speech, in which he said that the EU needed to be \"big on big things and small on smaller things\".<\/p> <p>Basically, his message was that where Europe cannot add value, it should not meddle.<\/p><p> In many cases, common rules are good because they are essential to making the Single Market work properly and protecting consumers, the environment and other public interests, as well as actually reducing red tape.  For example, why saddle business with 28 different sets of regulations and standards in the Single Market when we could just have one?  The European Commission has been listening to concerns on burdensome EU regulation for some time.  In the past five years, it has slashed administrative burdens by &euro;32 billion and scrapped 5,590 legal Acts.  However, we are determined to go further.  Under REFIT, the regulatory fitness and performance programme, the Commission has identified further measures to simplify or withdraw legislation and issues where we will not act at European level.  These cover a wide range of areas, including consumer product safety, public procurement, clinical trials of pharmaceuticals, package holidays and food hygiene.  For example, on the latter, rules will be consolidated and simplified and greater flexibility granted to small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in how they meet them.<\/p><p> Next year will be an eventful one for the EU's institutions.  The European Parliament elections, in particular, will have a significant impact on the legislative timetable.  The window for getting things done is fairly small.  As the elections will take place in May, the last plenary session of the current European Parliament is to be in April.  Accordingly, April will be the final deadline for any vote or endorsement by the current European Parliament before a gap in the EU's legislative process.  In September, the focus will be the formation of the next European Commission.  If all goes according to plan, a new European Commission will be in place on 1 November 2014.  Work on a new work programme for 2015 can then begin in earnest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013111200004#C00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384266000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Nolan for her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013111200005#D00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1384266000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Nolan and her colleagues for attending the committee this afternoon.<\/p><p>  Various slogans from Europe regarding SMEs are encouraging.  While some might not be brilliantly thought out such as &ldquo;Europe needs to think small first,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Europe needs to be big on big things and smaller on small things,&rdquo; there has been a timely realisation that the real engine that can drive growth in Europe is small businesses.  We know already that if every small business in Europe employed one more person, unemployment in Europe would be wiped out instantly.<\/p><p>  The area in which Europe fails, however, is innovation, particularly compared to China and the United States.  Europeans - it is not so much the case with Ireland - tend to be extremely risk-averse.  The Commission has a role in encouraging people to set up their own businesses.  While we may be critical of our friends in America, they have a business culture where failure is not seen as a mark against someone, as it is seen here.<\/p><p>  I understand the Commission will give report cards or opinions on national budgets but will not necessarily change them.  This will be interesting for the Commission in terms of how it strays into political choices in each country.  It will be interesting to see how the German budget is marked.  There needs to be a focus on the member states in budgetary surplus, particularly Germany.  We all know how those member states that are in programmes or close to them with excessive deficit procedures will be marked.  There are rules about those with surpluses too.  If we want economic growth in Europe, the German surplus should be addressed.<\/p><p>  Ms Nolan stated that the digital technology sector could be responsible for economic growth of 5%.  We are hearing that the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, could provide growth of 2%.  The President of the Commission, Mr. Barroso, said Europe was doing well, but it is not really.  Growth levels are flat.  The recent troubles with regard to taping of conversations and spying by the US on Europe must be set aside.  This trade agreement is extremely important for the European and American economies.  The issue of spying needs to be addressed in a different forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013111200005#D00300","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1384266000,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Nolan for her detailed presentation.<\/p><p>  What is all this talk about the digital economy?  Surely it is not just building a telecommunications Single Market.  Will she give us a layman&rsquo;s interpretation of this high aim Ireland is placing on the digital economy at European level?  What is the exact plan that we are claiming will create an extra &euro;110 billion for the European economy?<\/p><p>  The committee should congratulate and wish Latvia well on becoming the 18th member of the eurozone.  It should be recognised that it is entering at a good time when exchange rates between the dollar and the euro are good and have stabilised.<\/p><p>  Some of the documentation presented to the committee refers to the priorities of the Commission.  The social agenda is one area of concern for citizens both here and in Europe.  Will Ms Nolan explain how Irish agencies access, if at all, the European moneys set aside to implement the strategy for integrating the Roma community into mainstream European communities?<\/p> <p>Given the background of the scare that some of these Roma people may be kidnapping European children, what agency is charged with drawing down funding from this Roma strategy?<\/p><p> I am delighted with the policy being implemented across Europe to try to address tax fraud and undeclared income.  The Swiss are to be congratulated on recently arresting somebody with a large sum of money travelling back to Germany and, as a consequence, discovering huge art collections that had been pilfered in Germany.  It was not a huge amount of money.  We have heard of our criminals carrying bigger sums of money.  We had an assistant city manager with more money stuffed in his fridge than this person was arrested with.  Am I imagining that there is increased surveillance, policing and customs activities on undeclared sums of money and the tax evasion that seems to be rampant in Europe?  Are the Irish authorities as good as the Swiss or Germans in targeting these people who are moving between borders with bags full of &euro;100 notes?<\/p><p> My last question is of particular relevance.  I am not an expert in this field but the European External Action Service, EEAS, has been particularly active in countries such as Greece which are funnels for illegal immigrants.  The deaths of the boat people coming from North Africa, Algeria, Morocco or wherever were tragic.  How much of a priority is it to reinforce the EEAS in carrying out border security?  The report tells us the Commission is very keen to create job opportunities and to have minimum rates of pay for these seasonal workers and wants to ensure the benefits of European workers are not undermined by huge inflows of illegal immigrants.<\/p><p> The European neighbourhood policy, ENP, is of tremendous importance and is particularly topical now.  What is happening with the Russians, who, one might say, are intimidating their neighbours into joining their customs union?  Armenia has pulled out of any agreement or plan to move closer to Europe, and Moldova and Ukraine are under pressure.  Will progress be finalised this year on our relationships with Moldova, Albania and Ukraine?  Given the size and population of Ukraine, it is very important that it is a good neighbour for us.<\/p><p> With all due respect to the audience, there are only two members here.  It is very sad and a poor reflection on the committee's membership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013111200005#D00400","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384266600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>The economic and monetary union, and particularly the banking union, is something we have agreed to and supported all along.  The Irish Presidency was very supportive.  After our exit from the bailout programme we would like some of the benefits of the thinking that went into the European banking union and economic governance.  We hope to receive the benefit of the doubt regarding measures that are likely to be necessary throughout the EU in individual member states.  That specifically refers to the Irish situation, because we have a general idea that we will be alone again.  We have done everything necessary and made all the sacrifices, and we will continue to do so.<\/p><p>  Some commentators said this will mean nothing to us, but it is very significant.  An exit means we have achieved our targets.  It is our first goal in the aftermath of the economic collapse.  I would like to think that, far from being critical, all our European colleagues would recognise the major sacrifices made here and that it may be necessary to give this country the benefit of some of the matters we have aspired to and spoken in favour of, particularly in the context of the passage of the referendum on the fiscal stability pact.<\/p><p>  Similarly, regarding European economic governance, it is necessary that Europe progresses in a particular direction and that there be a degree of emphasis on certain regions as opposed to others where particular measures may be needed to achieve the kind of cohesiveness and balance necessary.  I hope that can be done in the context of what we are proceeding with.<\/p><p>  Regarding the social and economic monetary union, we must achieve a greater degree of political cohesion and commitment.  I say that against a backdrop in which some countries - one in particular - are having second thoughts.  In the event of progress in that direction, there will be severe and serious consequences for the rest of the EU, including this country.  I hope the social dimension of economic and monetary union, which is a priority, will have the added dimension of a political commitment that will have the benefit of bringing the EU countries into step, moving in unison and in the same direction towards a common goal, which has been missing in certain areas for the past number of years.<\/p><p>  One criticism of the youth guarantee is that it will have no impact.  We believe it will have an impact, but we must make it work, and quickly.  It must be obvious to everybody that it is working.  If a body as large and powerful as the EU comes together and decides on a particular agenda it must make it work.  That is very important for future social and economic stability.<\/p><p>  Innovation and the digital economy is very important, but in this and other European countries there is, obviously, a reliance on the telecommunications sector as a foundation stone.  To what extent has the universal delivery of high-standard telecommunications throughout Europe been achieved without exception?  Not many years ago, some of our European colleagues had very archaic mobile telephone and data systems.  In some cases they have made dramatic progress.  There are some serious deficiencies in this country's system - for example, there are businesses in which people have to move equipment around the premises to get a broadband connection.  That should not be the case.  To be able to capitalise nationally and throughout Europe on the benefits of modern technology, we must have the services available without exception across the board.  We must do whatever is required to be done as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p>  Energy is a very serious issue.<\/p> <p>It is imperative for national governments and the European institutions that clear evidence be made available through their respective avenues to the general public to illustrate the benefits of the energy policy pursued by the European Union in terms of cost and health and safety.  There must be an evaluation of the difference between nuclear energy and alternative energy.  We need to be able to get this across to our communities, particularly at this moment, because a debate is taking place on those issues now.  There is a dearth of the impartial evidence, which we need to be able to draw on in order to advise ourselves and our constituents.<\/p><p> On a final point, I cannot let the moment pass without making reference to the external agenda.  I welcome the &euro;10 million committed to the Philippines.  I feel that as large and as powerful as the EU is, it needs to be able to respond much more rapidly than it has done and needs to be able to co-ordinate global efforts towards offering assistance in places where natural or other disasters take place.  The disaster at Fukushima two years ago and the situation in the Philippines at present are both the result of natural disasters that have caused appalling death and devastation.  We need to be at the forefront.  I know we are the greatest donors but that is not enough.  We need to be able to co-ordinate and to set an example.  We need to be seen to be in there at an early stage.  Part of the PR game should be that we are in there at a very early stage and seen to be assisting.  The EU has a number of NATO countries with heavy lifting and logistics capacity and we need to use that.  I will conclude and leave other issues until another meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013111200006#E00200","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384267200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>Before I ask Ms Nolan to respond, I wish to make a number of points.  With regard to the European semester, I would like to inform the committee that we have asked Ms Catherine Day to appear before the committee to talk about the annual growth survey.  We are hopeful Ms Day will appear here either in December or in January.  That will be an opportunity to talk about the first stage of the annual growth survey.<\/p><p>  My first question is in regard to the CSRs.  Up to now, our recommendation as part of the troika was just to carry out the programme.  However, for those counties that are outside a programme, a range of different recommendations were put forward.  Having gone through them, I know that some of them, such as those for France and Germany, dealt with their taxation issues.  Can Ms Nolan explain what was the reaction on the ground among the media and the population when these CSRs were published in each country?  Was there any kind of europhobic reaction?  Were people even aware this was happening?  What impact did it have on the ground?<\/p><p>  My second question concerns SMEs, which were also mentioned by Deputy Dara Murphy.  In my constituency of Meath East, I recently carried out a survey of SMEs, their needs and how they are getting on in the current climate.  I had responses from more than 100 businesses.  One of the questions I asked was in regard to EU funding in terms of access to grants, loans and other funds from organisations such as the European Investment Bank.  I was surprised because the feedback I got was that businesses do not have the first idea of the types of fund, loan or grant that are available at EU level.  That is a failure on somebody's part, although I am not sure whether it is that of MEPs or the national politicians or whether the Commission also has a part to play.  Can Ms Nolan explain how we can improve knowledge among our small businesses of the types of funding that are available to help them set up and grow?<\/p><p>  My third question is in regard to continuity.  As Ms Nolan knows, the Commission will be replaced next year.  We have the European Parliament elections in May.  The Presidency of the Council of the European Union will be with Greece in the first six months of the year, where an election will potentially take place, and then with Italy in the remaining six months of the year, where an election may also take place.  The Latvian Presidency will start on 1 January 2015 under a new Government, because the Latvians go to the polls next October.  Therefore, we can expect a lot of change and flux at Presidency and Council level over the next 18 months.  The European Parliament will be replaced and all of the Commissioners will be replaced.  If something happens at a European level or if more crisis issues arise, although we all hope they will not, how concerned is Ms Nolan about continuity and how will the Commission ensure there are plans in place to deal with any potential crisis should other institutions be unable to do so?<\/p><p>  My next question concerns President Barroso's State of the Union address.  He said we could expect further proposals and ideas from himself on the future of the EU, and he said these would come before the EU parliamentary elections next year.  What forum will they be presented in and when can we expect to hear something from President Barroso?<\/p><p>  My last question is in regard to the financial transaction tax.  This is proceeding very slowly and we would have expected to see greater progress since the announcement of enhanced co-operation.  What is going on?  Is this due to the fact that a government has not yet been formed in Germany?  When can we expect to see some movement in regard to the financial transaction tax?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013111200007#F00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384267200,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the committee for their comments.  I will try to take the points in order, although I do not think an answer was necessary in some cases as the points were more of a comment.  With regard to SMEs and innovation, quite a large chunk of the current framework programme 7 is directed at SMEs.  Horizon 2020 will also have a lot of ring-fencing of funding for SMEs.  It is very important, for example, that they avail of the opportunity of this conference that is coming up in December to inform themselves about how they can access EU funding under the new research and innovation programme.<\/p><p>  As there were several comments on SMEs, I will link them with the Chairman's comment.  It is true that there is a myriad of different opportunities for funding, whether it be from the European Investment Bank under the framework programme or under other programmes - for example, the entrepreneurship programme also has funding available for SMEs.  We do our best to inform people about it but we also rely on the chambers of commerce to do a lot of the publicity because they are made aware of all of these opportunities.  They are at the local level and we rely on them to relay a lot of the information.  I accept that the information is not always getting there but there is also the point that, in some cases, it is not that easy to access and there is a lot of paperwork, which may switch people off in terms of accessing money.<\/p><p>  With regard to research and innovation, an SME would normally need to have contacts in other member states and be able to mount something that is of an international standard, which is not that easy, as I fully accept.  We will continue to try to reach out to SMEs.  We financed a conference last year in Croke Park with the Department to try to reach out to SMEs and give them an idea of the different opportunities available.  We will continue to do that.  The problem is that many owners of SMEs do not go to conferences precisely because they are running their businesses and they do not have time to do that sort of thing.  It is difficult in that they are not a homogenous audience and are difficult to reach.  We continue to work with the local operators here to try to get our message out.<\/p><p>  There were a number of comments on the CSRs.  Deputy Dara Murphy said they would not change the budgetary process, and he was correct.  However, there will be comment on matters such as budgetary surpluses - for example, the German surplus.<\/p> <p>I saw the comments that the Vice President of the Commission, Olli Rehn, made about the matter in the press today.  The Commission will comment on deficits and surplus but it is not going to be a selective commentary.  I can assure members that where we see a problem like that, comments will be made.<\/p><p> There have been mixed reactions to the CSRs among different member states.  In the United Kingdom the reaction has been mainly hostile, both from the media and from its government, because they do not like receiving instructions from Brussels.  CSR results have been well received in other countries.  Many stakeholders in individual member states have endorsed the CSRs because they agree with them.  It depends on the findings and nature of the results.  In many cases, informed commentators, economists, etc., were quite satisfied that the CSRs were justified.  I cannot give one answer because the reactions of individual member states have varied.  It depends on whether there is a perception that a problem exists and whether the CSR finding is valid.<\/p><p> I am pleased to hear that the committee, like us, thinks the TTIP is very important.  Talks have continued despite the issue of leaking of data, etc., and both sides are determined to continue.  A trade agreement is an important step that would greatly boost the two economies.  My information is that talks will continue along the lines of the programme that was mapped out from the outset.<\/p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne asked about what we hoped to achieve through a digital economy.  We started from the premise that Europe has fallen behind its main competitors and is not the world leader, but there is a need to invest more and update the legislation in order to move things forward and regain competitiveness in the sector.  Different markets may be sliced up but we want a single market.  I have outlined the big picture.  As I said, it is not going to be easy.  There is a very small window of opportunity to get the business done, given that this is a very recent proposal, but that is our objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013111200007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384267800,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Am I right in thinking that GPS is an American communication system?

There are other aspects to the digital economy.  It includes all of the people who work in the docklands area of Dublin, mainly in American companies.  We must let Europe know that Ireland is at the leading edge and we need to get Europe up there with the big players.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Roma strategy, there have been many attempts to connect the various issues that affect the Roma, who can be found in large numbers in several member states.  It is a very difficult problem to solve.  It is also a very old problem.  There have been attempts to channel structural funds to particular areas in order to raise their standard of living, improve their education and so on.  The European Commission's justice department manages the issue.  I understand that Roma issues are managed by the Department of Justice and Equality in Ireland, but many other Departments feed into it, because Roma issues includes housing, education and lots of other things.  <\/p><p>  My organisation shares the committee's view on undeclared sources of revenue.  We have tried to close tax loopholes and we can now exchange information on savings.  We want to progress the initiative further in order to ensure that people with satchels full of money, as mentioned earlier, have nowhere to run or hide.  We are also trying to close off all loopholes in that area.  As the committee will know, tax evasion has been discussed at the highest level in Europe and it is an ongoing project for us.<\/p><p>  It is not the job of the European External Action Service to reinforce border security; that is the job of the FRONTEX agency.  Security is a difficult area and we must rely on co-operation between member states and third countries.  FRONTEX is a small operation at present - although it may grow in the future - and it is not equipped to carry out all of the work.  Security is very important and will become more important as more and more people are forced to flee situations that occur outside of the EU region.  Border security is a high priority. <\/p><p>  With regard to neighbourhood policy, the Eastern Partnership summit will take place at the end of the month and I understand that the Taoiseach will attend.  We still do not know whether Ukraine will attend, but a lot of high-level negotiations are taking place.  Developing the Eastern Partnership is a priority for the Lithuanian Presidency and the Union at present.  It is also a priority to develop other forms of co-operation between neighbouring countries in the European Union.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Durkan that we must make the youth guarantee work.  Member states have signed up to the guarantee and we rely on them to deliver on their promise.  The EU organisation can deliver what it can, but each member state must live up to the commitment it gave to young people under 25 years.  <\/p><p>  The matter of continuity was raised by the Chairman.  It is true that one arm of the European institutions, the Parliament, will undergo significant change for a couple of months.  Nevertheless, the current Commission will continue in office until a new one is appointed, thus ensuring continuity.  The same applies to the post held by Mr. Van Rompuy, who shall remain in office until his replacement is appointed.  There is continuity and the show must go on.  The civil service still exists.  I reassure the committee that business will continue, although there will be a little hiatus in decision-making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013111200008#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1384267800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>What did President Barroso say?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013111200008#G00600","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384267800,"counter":328,"content":"<p>Yes; I was asked about further proposals.

I say that on the basis that, at the 11th hour, the Minister has introduced a very substantial amendment to the legislation relating to the fees regime.  The Minister and the committee are aware that the issue of fees was the most contentious item in respect of the restoration of full freedom of information legislation.  The Minister has, at the 11th hour, essentially gutted this legislation and put up impossible barriers and unreasonable blockages in respect of freedom of information.<\/p><p>  It is my belief that, given the significance of this amendment, far from taking the Committee Stage today, what we should do is adjourn our considerations and ask stakeholder bodies, like the National Union of Journalists, Transparency International and other stakeholders who appeared before this committee on the basis of the original drafting of the legislation, to come before the committee and to tease out, from their perspective, the consequences of the Minister's amendment.  On that basis , we need a ministerial response and, I would hope, a reconsideration of these very retrograde amendments.  I do not think it acceptable that, at the last minute, the Minister in a sort of cynical and sneaky way moves an amendment such as this simply on the basis that he has the numbers from his Government colleagues on this committee to sneak it through.<\/p><p>  The intention of this legislation was to undo the damage of 2003, when freedom of information was gutted.  This amendment sets the clock back and does even more damage than 2003.  I am proposing, and I would ask my committee colleagues to support me, that this matter be put back and that, as I have said, we ask those stakeholders to come before the committee to tease out the implication of the Minister's last-minute amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200003#B00200","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1384272900,"counter":348,"content":"<p>The changes to the new FOI Bill should be something very positive and there are some positive things in the Bill.

We do not know whether that is true but I believe what they are saying, across the board, is sufficiently serious that we should pause Committee Stage.  As a committee and having done a lot of work on this, we should invite those like the NUJ, academics and other experts back in to discuss the potential of the proposed changes to the fees structure.  This is very serious.  The experts are telling us this will eradicate meaningful FOI in Ireland.

It has been portrayed and accepted by many that this Bill was going to undo the introduction of fees that was contained in the amendment of the fees some years ago.  However, the new section not only copper-fastens most of the application fees, it introduces a new range of application fees whereby one request can result in an organisation deciding that the request goes to four different parts of the organisation and, therefore, it charges four separate fees.<\/p><p>  In addition, as I said on Second Stage, this committee had considered the review of non-disclosure provisions in accordance with the information Act - the section 2 report.  The outgoing Information Commissioner, in a report to the committee, discussed the 100 secrecy provisions that are embedded in several items of legislation across all Government Departments and recommended that 52 of these secrecy provisions be deleted.  That exercise should have been completed and taken on board, and a decision should have been made by the Department as to whether it accepts those recommendations.  For us to proceed now, and then have a debate on whether the 52 secrecy provisions that are embedded in other items of legislation should have been dealt with in this legislation, is too late and comes after the fact.  There are a couple of reasons that more work needs to be done before this can be finalised on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200003#B00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1384272900,"counter":350,"content":"<p>It takes some neck that the last speaker, who effectively emasculated the 1997 legislation in 2003, would come in to lecture us about the effectiveness or otherwise of what is proposed.  Having said that, I think members have been put in somewhat of an invidious position because of the late changes announced by the Minister in his amendments in recent days.  It does, to some extent, make it more difficult to embrace the kind of pre-legislative scrutiny we embarked upon, as a committee, not just on this legislation but in other areas, where it has worked well.  In fact, in recent days we have, I regret to say, seen evidence of the consequences of legislation that is rushed.  In that context, I have some sympathy for the points of view being raised.<\/p><p>  Nonetheless, I believe it is possible for us to proceed with Committee Stage today because, unless we gallop through, we are unlikely to reach the controversial elements of the legislation.  I believe it would be opportune, in the interim, if the Minister and his Department would circulate us with some briefing documentation on where the amendments that have emerged have come from.  We have not had sight of them and we do not know the rationale behind them.  As a committee, we engaged quite effectively with other bodies in the context of this legislation to date.  On that basis, we could proceed.  We are not likely to reach the relevant sections today and it would give the Minister an opportunity to brief the committee more comprehensively in the context of the amendments that have been suggested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200003#B00500","speaker":"986"},{"type":"speech","time":1384272900,"counter":351,"content":"<p>An enormous amount of discussion has taken place in this regard and it is one of the flagship Bills that I want to bring through to greatly expand the capacity of freedom of information in this State.  I welcome the pre-legislative scrutiny this committee did and the submissions we received in regard to it.<\/p><p>  Although we will be dealing with some 90 amendments, there was, I suppose, one contentious issue where we had not got agreement, and that was on the issue of fees.  If we look at all OECD countries, with some exceptions - and we might be a little jaundiced about the full volume of information that is \"free\" in some of the exceptions, like Russia - most charge some level of retrieval or processing fees because there is an actual cost involved.  I have been very frank and open in this regard from the very beginning.  The approach was to retain a front fee of &euro;15, which has been the fee for a decade, and to then mitigate subsequent fees, for example, for appeals and so on, as is well known and has been debated.<\/p><p>  Before people lose the run of themselves, and I will take as long as people want on these matters, the only new issue is to be explicit about disaggregating totally unrelated questions that are lumped together.  One can argue there should be no fees regime at all, and I would be sympathetic to that in normal circumstances.  However, when we are in the situation where I have to recommend and vote for prescription charge fees for medical card holders and for fees for accident and emergency and so on, I think it reasonable to seek a front fee of &euro;15 for an FOI request when the average cost of processing such a request is &euro;600.<\/p><p>  The amendment that has caused some controversy in the last few days, and it surprises me that it is of controversy, is to be explicit in regard to manifestly separate questions that have in recent times been lumped together.  When we get to it, I will circulate examples of completely different issues being lumped into a Department.<\/p> <p> I will give one example of an FOI request submitted to the Department of Taoiseach.  It inquired in some detail about a number of matters: the arrangements for the inauguration of the President, the cost, the invitations issued and all the rest; all correspondence related to the Magdalen laundry cases; the information technology used in the Department of the Taoiseach; and all uses to which the Government jet had been put.  All of this was purported to be part of one request, but manifestly it was not.  There are even more egregious examples of requests that run to pages on completely separate issues.  Where a request has many subsets, it will be deemed to be one request.  There is no issue with such a request.  That will be clear in the legislation and guidelines because one of the difficulties with FOI requests, as explained to the committee in the past, was that there were no common guidelines or common implementation procedures adopted across Departments.  I want this to be made clear now, as I know it suits the agenda of some people to say the legislation has been gutted or made impossible to deal with.<\/p><p> I am very proud of this ground breaking legislation.  It establishes a number of key statutory principles governing the operation of FOI legislation.  It creates a legal presumption that official records requested will be released unless an exemption is provided for in primary legislation.  It strongly promotes the proactive release of official information by public bodies.  It requires public bodies to draw attention to the scope to obtain records through other access regimes also.  <\/p><p> I want a culture of open data which we are going to create.  I have made the determination that in the current climate we have to have some fee regime and there is a fee per request.  One cannot in all conscience have such a regime and yet allow somebody to submit an entirely different set of requests and call it just one request as then one undermines the principle and could do away with fees.  In less strained economic times I would not advocate having a charge to access any information.  That is true for a lot of things we have had to do in recent times where we have made charges for things that in better times I certainly would not like to see charges.  As I said, if we are now charging for prescriptions for medical card holdersm, is it reasonable to charge something towards the cost of retrieval of information?  This does not apply to requests for personal information which account for 70% of all such requests, for which the service is free and will remain so.  However, some FOI requests are very complicated and require hugely demanding work.  As I said, I will circulate examples to the committee.  Let me give an example of how completely extraneous matters are bolted together to avail of the one charge of &euro;15, which sometimes are submitted by big publishing houses.  Such requests cost the State thousands of euro to process because they are all different.  I think that is reasonable, but I we will deal with the matter when we come to it because the legislation is ground breaking.<\/p><p> One thing about which I am bemused is that it has taken me one year to get traction with the media on this legislation.  When it was all good news, I was hard pressed to get a line in any newspaper on the restoration of the FOI regime, but if there is an issue of controversy, I am suddenly invited by the media and it becomes an issue of importance.  We should focus on how we can put the best possible regime in place.  I am open to any argument on the amendments tabled because I want us to reach a consensus on these matters as best we can.  I have fought hard with everybody to reach the most advanced position in tandem with the commitments made in the programme for Government.  It did not strike me that it had not been well signalled, but if we were going to charge &euro;15 per item, obviously completely extraneous items bolted together, as seen in the documentation circulated, cannot be construed as being part of the same request.  That is the net issue that has proved controversial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200003#B00600","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384273500,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I have listened to what the Minister has said.

The matter is so trivial that we should not be discussing it.  At this point we should not even be discussing the charge of &euro;15.

Second, he knows, as we all do, that the reason the fees issue is controversial in the course of this debate at this committee is that it is accepted across the board that having a fee acts as a disincentive for people in seeking information.  That is the position.  Third, there are provisions within the legislation to deal with vexatious requests, which is correct and as it should be.<\/p><p>  The multiple item requests cited by the Minister are a consequence of the introduction of fees.  Naturally, where people are being charged unfairly, they will try to cover as many angles as they can in a single request.  If the Minister wants to do away with this practice of throwing in the kitchen sink in a single FOI request, he should get rid of the fees.  <\/p><p>  I want to be in a position to support the restoration of freedom of information legislation.<\/p> <p>I have made that clear to the Minister.  The manner in which he has gone about all of this makes an absolute farce of his so-called reforms and a farce of the notion of pre-legislative phases at this committee.  In fact, it makes a farce of the entire debate and hearings, the ritual we went through here.  Not alone is he introducing an amendment that will affect not a single fee but multiple fees and upfront payments.  He is doing it at the 11th hour in a way that I consider to be most unedifying for him as Minister, the Minister who proclaims to be committed to openness and transparency.  There is nothing open or transparent about this.  From my point of view, it is not sufficient at this juncture for the Minister to circulate the document to us or to tell us that his officials will give us a briefing.  What we actually need is space, on the basis of his amendment. to hear from the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, the academics and the stakeholders their view of the consequences of this amendment and to allow us to consider it and even for the Minister to consider it.  He might just be wrong.<\/p><p> If I am not mistaken, in 2003 when Fianna F&aacute;il gutted the legislation, this Minister and his party were vociferous in opposing those charges because, at that stage, he understood the consequences of those charges.  He was right then and he is wrong now.  <\/p><p> Given the level of scepticism in the broad public around politics and political processes and openness and transparency, this is a very bad turn of events.  Reinstating freedom of information should be a good moment for us yet, by his own actions at the 11th hour, in introducing a measure such as this he has, in fact, derailed what should have been a good news story.  I reiterate my call that we halt proceedings at this stage, do things correctly, and give this committee its place.  We are not here as extras to fill up the air time and then the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, the Government or anybody else ploughs on and does whatever they want.  That is unacceptable for any parliamentarian and it is unacceptable for this committee.  <\/p><p> The reasonable thing for the Minister to do, given the implications of this amendment, is to hit the pause button, bring in the relevant stakeholders and allow them, with us, to tease out the implications of this amendment and then we can proceed.  I would hope, having heard from those stakeholders, the Minister would revise his position and deliver legislation we could all support and stand over that was truly about freedom of information and not giving the veneer of information but actually holding things back and throwing up obstacles in people's way.

There is a procedural issue for the committee.  The Minister has outlined briefly the reasons he believes the changes introduced in the amendments on Friday are not terribly important.  That is fine.  Mr. Gavin Sheridan who appeared before the committee is on the record in respect of the amendments on Friday as saying: \"If passed, freedom of information is dead.\"  Mr. Gavin Sheridan is not an alarmist.  He is an expert in this area.  He worked on the Anglo tapes and is a respected journalist.<\/p><p>  Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley, National Union of Journalists, said in a press release that came out in the past hour: \"The new charges would make the use of FOI unaffordable and would undermine the significant reforms contained in the Act.\"  Ms Jane Suiter, a respected academic, was on radio this morning speaking about it as well.  Therefore, as a committee we have a decision to make.  We have two conflicting views on very important legislation that we all want to get right and on which we have all spent a great deal of time.  As the views of the Minister and respected experts in this area are so different and the language that sensible people are using is so strong, the only sensible thing to do is to pause committee proceedings.  We can come back as soon as possible but let us invite the experts back in and understand as a committee the reason they are so strong in their opposition to the amendments.  Ideally, the committee can and should give its opinion back to the Minister.  Let us do this again in ten days time.  I hope the Minister is right.  As a committee we have to listen when the NUJ and respected academics use the language they have used in the past few days.  As Deputy Creed said we could pause committee proceedings on the basis that we are all present and have an open debate and hear the Minister's position on why he believes the changes are not so big.  We could invite in the experts, have a meeting with them in the next few days and proceed again with the Minister within the next two weeks.

The bigger issue is that of fees.  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald is right.  The net issue is whether there should be an upfront fee.  I discerned from the beginning, we discussed it here and I am aware members opposite have a different view, that in the current economic climate it is reasonable to have a tokenistic contribution of &euro;15 to an FOI that, on average, costs &euro;600 to process.  If we are to have a fee of &euro;15 we cannot completely undermine that by allowing somebody to put in 15 manifestly separate questions unrelated to each other and pretend that it is a single request.  Both of those are not compatible because it would be unfair to a person who puts in a single request and pays the &euro;15. <\/p><p>  If we do not legislate for it, journalists or anybody else will put in requests for 40 or 140 questions and pretend it is a single issue.

That is why the notion that this aggregation of manifestly separate questions is a surprise or a gutting or an undermining is just not right.  It was always my position that they would be separate questions.  There can be a variety of subsets of the same issue.  This goes back to the point made by Deputy Fleming about different units or different sections of the Department.  All of that will be one FOI request if it is on the same issue, whether to different sections of the HSE, or different sections of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There can be any number of subsets of it, if is the same question.  However, when they are manifestly different questions they cannot pretend to be about the same issue.  I want to work with the committee on this issue.  That is my understanding and my intention.  I want to ensure that is what is done in practice.  I hear what Deputy Fleming is saying.  He is saying that civil servants, somehow, will undermine that.  I do not believe that but let us make sure it does not happen.  That is why I am drawing up, in parallel to this legislation, a code of practice that will be implemented by every FOI officer in every agency and Department.  I want them all trained as provided for in the legislation.<\/p> <p>It is a legal requirement to be operating on the same manual and on the same basis so that one does not get different responses to FOI, as one currently gets depending the agency or Department to which one submits it because there is not a commonality of interpretation, and as I want to do away with.<\/p><p> I will undertake to bring that code of conduct back here to this committee.  We, together, will nail it down to ensure that that intention is, in fact, what is nailed into the way and practice of the FOI implementation.  I hope that will meet the requirements of the Deputies opposite.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200005#D00400","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384274700,"counter":370,"content":"<p>As there are many speakers indicating, I will put the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200006#E00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1384274700,"counter":371,"content":"<p>A Chathaoirligh,-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200006#E00300","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1384274700,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I will put the question.

I know the view of the NUJ on fees generally.  They have a strong and coherent view that there should be no fees, that information should be free.  There are many experts in the area and Deputy Donnelly name checked some of them who hold that principled view, and it is a noble and fine view.<\/p><p>  I made a discernment from the beginning in this, which I stated to this committee in the pre-legislative scrutiny, that I believe that there should be, in the current climate where we are charging for a range of essential services, what in many ways is a token charge.  A charge of &euro;15 towards a cost on average of &euro;600 is little more than a token and is justified in these circumstances.  In better economic times, it is something we might come back on.<\/p><p>  If we are to have a fee, obviously, we must ensure that it is applied and not have the pretence that there is a fee that really does not apply because one could put in any number of requests and call it one.  If that is the view of the committee, then there is no point in having fees.  That undermines the principle of it.  I wanted to make the point in relation to the experts.  I know what the NUJ will say.  They will say, \"Have no fees.\"<\/p><p>  It would be worth looking at the practice in other OECD countries because there are different types of fees.  I do not want to get bogged down on this one net issue because there is so much good in this Bill, but some countries charge up-front fees such as my proposal of &euro;15 here.  I am suggesting that we give free two hours search and retrieval for that.  Many other countries have no up-front fee but then they charge search and retrieval fees at an hourly rate and they charge for photocopying.  If one goes through all the OECD countries, world leaders in this, such as Canada and New Zealand, charge for this using different mechanisms because there is a real cost to the system of some of the complex demands that are made.<\/p><p>  In this, I propose: first, that we hold on to the &euro;15 up-front fee; and second, that one will get two hours' free research for that, which accounts for the vast bulk of non-personal matters - all personal matters, or 70% of all FOIs, are free.  On top of that, I am suggesting that we cap the search and retrieval fees at &euro;500 - at present, it is open-ended.  In addition, I am reducing all the appeal fees to go to the Information Commissioner, etc.  If one looks at it in the round, it is a reasonable set of proposals.<\/p><p>  I am open to hear the views of the committee when we get to these matters.

Members will, no doubt, be talking in due course with representatives of other Departments to ensure that everyone is familiar with the guidelines.  A strong, authoritative leadership role by the FOI central policy unit is critical to ensure the system works.  The mandate of the unit must be to develop the policy and guide and inform public bodies as to its implementation.  That is the intention.

A review of the implementation of FOI was carried out in that context and consideration was given during that review to the publication of all records released.

Many journalists who obtain information under FOI regard it as their own and use it selectively, sometimes weeks or months later.  It is a matter of debate whether the information obtained should all be published at the same time on its release.  Whether that is appropriate is a matter for debate.<\/p> <p>As of now various Departments have different views on it.

My Department has communicated with the General Register Office to ascertain whether any difficulties arise in this regard.  The office is part of the Department of Social Protection and, as such, it is covered by freedom of information provisions.  I note that the committee's report recommended that the General Register Office be brought within the ambit of freedom of information legislation.  This is already the case.  The legislation will not prevent access to the registers as provided for under the Civil Registration Act.  Legislation governing birth, death and marriage certificates held by the General Register Office is laid out in section 61 of the Civil Registration Act 2004.  As I stated, we have communicated with the office and I understand it responds to both personal and non-personal freedom of information requests and publishes a substantial amount of information outside the freedom of information request framework.  I am assured by the office that it is not aware of any problem in accessing records it holds.<\/p><p>  The definition of the term \"personal information\" in section 2 sets out what, at a general level, constitutes personal information.  It is information that would be either known, in the ordinary course of events, to the individual and his or her family or held by the freedom of information body on the understanding that it will be treated as confidential by that body.  The definition sets out examples of what this type of information this could entail.  It includes such information as relates to the educational, medical and psychiatric history of an individual; the financial affairs of an individual; his or her membership of a trade union; the criminal history of a person or proceedings that were taken against him or her; an individual or a person's entitlement to or claiming of social welfare benefits; or any matter relating to the religion of an individual.  This is personal information and is regarded as personal.  <\/p><p>  Section 37 protects personal information held by the freedom of information body against third party access.  Given issues such as psychiatric history, there is good reason this should be the case.  A public body has discretion to consider the release of such information to a third party where, on balance, the decision maker is of the opinion that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the right to privacy.  Prior to making a decision on any such release, the consultation procedures that are set out in section 38 must be followed.  Public bodies, including the General Register Office, must respect the right to privacy in handling freedom of information requests.  However, the Bill makes clear that where the personal information relates to the requester, with some exceptions such as medical or psychiatric records, the exemption from the provision of personal information does not apply.  Cases could arise in which information of this nature would not be released to the individual in question but to the person's doctor if it is believed it would be in the best interests of the individual in question to do so.  As such, there is nothing in the Bill that would prevent the General Register Office or any other public body from giving access to personal information, provided it does so in compliance with the legislation.

The administrative functions do not include confidential matters, commercial matters or matters of sensitivity.

We all understand that Bus &Eacute;ireann is out there in the commercial arena.  I am not even remotely suggesting that the company be brought into it.  The Minister and I probably agree that we should not give a commercial disadvantage to State-owned companies that are competing with the private sector.  However, school transport is a public duty.  It is really a Department of Education and Skills function.  It is contracted from the Department of Education and Skills to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The company involved need not be Bus &Eacute;ireann; it could be any company.  The essence of amendment No. 11 is that the school transport function, which is an integral part of the functions of the Department of Education and Skills, whether it is carried out by Bus &Eacute;ireann or any other company, should be subject to the freedom of information provisions.  My views are clear.  The Minister will get the gist of what I am saying in that regard.<\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 85 to 97, inclusive, are quite a group.  On the ones in my name, there is a list of exempted bodies in that schedule and I want EirGrid excluded from the list of exempted bodies.  I refer to amendment No. 90, which relates to EirGrid.  This is an issue.  The Minister, even in his own county, will be aware of the operations of EirGrid with the Grid Link project.  It is important how EirGrid goes about its business.  This is an organisation that is not in commercial competition with any State company or anybody in the private sector.  It is the provider of the network.  This time last week, I was at an oral hearing against an EirGrid proposal in County Laois.  Having lodged an objection with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I have seen how the company operates at first hand.  I have been dealing with it for a number of years in the midlands.  There are 400 kV pylons traversing the midlands from Moneypoint up towards Dublin.  They have been there for 20 or 25 years.<\/p><p>  The reason it is necessary for EirGrid to be excluded from the list of exempted agencies is that it is having a serious impact on the lives of many individuals.  I am not happy about how EirGrid goes about its business.  There are several State organisations that do work on behalf of the State in terms of the provision of services, and some of them go about it in a good way.  I will contrast how the National Roads Authority, NRA, does its work with how EirGrid does its work.  They should be similar organisations in terms of how they deal with the public.  They want to bring a line from A to B, and they have alternative routes and alternative corridors.  In many places in which the motorway network was built over the past decade or so, many people whose families had lived in particular houses for a hundred or two hundred years found that those houses had to be removed and bulldozed to make way for them.  By and large, the NRA did a good job.  It is probably unpopular politically to say that, because commentators enjoy taking a crack at the NRA, but I have seen at first hand how it explained to the people how it was going about its business, and its representatives met people in a non-confrontational manner.  EirGrid could learn much from the likes of the NRA.  I suggest that if the NRA could be moved in to take over EirGrid, all the problems that we will probably encounter over the coming period would not happen.  The reason is that EirGrid is secretive about how it does its business.  It is not up-front about it.  As I have said to the face of the EirGrid representatives at the public hearing, they deliberately misled the public.  They give out false information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200012#M02100","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1384278000,"counter":505,"content":"<p>Deputy Sean Fleming should be more measured in his language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200012#M02200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1384278000,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I must explain why.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200012#M02300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1384278000,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I accept that.

There are matters that would be commercially sensitive attached to the commercial mandate of these bodies, which should be exempted from FOI.  That is reasonable; however, none of these bodies should have a blanket exemption from FOI.  They should be included and when requests impinge on matters that are demonstrably commercially sensitive, or damaging to that body's commercial mandate in the case of the commercial semi-states, an exemption should apply.  It is not good practice to give them a blanket exemption.  From the discussions we have had around this issue, many matters hinged on the Minister's correct concern about commercial sensitivity and competitive tensions between State bodies and private operators.  All of that is legitimate, but he could have catered for that concern not by granting a blanket exemption but by setting out circumstances that relate to those commercial sensitivities and the commercial mandate and allowing exemptions in those circumstances only.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200013#N00600","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1384278600,"counter":522,"content":"<p>At the risk of annoying committee members, I would like to go through this list, because creating an exempt list in legislation is a very serious thing to do.

What is the full list of reasons for any organisation to be exempt?  If and when there is a legitimate argument for commercial sensitivity, is there not some other provision in the legislation under which a body can claim commercial sensitivity?  Let us say a body is not on this list but an FOI request is made where there are legitimate grounds for claiming commercial sensitivity.  Does that apply somewhere else?  Could the Minister point to that or tell us if there is any provision other than this list?<\/p><p>  I disagree with Deputies Fleming and McDonald on the competitiveness of State-owned organisations.  It is unfair on the companies competing with State-owned organisations.  I have asked Dublin Bus for very reasonable passenger flow information regarding very disruptive changes it was making to bus services in Wicklow and it hid behind commercial sensitivity, which seems to be what it would do.  Dublin Bus was most unhelpful.  If a private operator can operate a Dublin Bus route at exactly the same level of service to the public but at a lower cost to the State and the citizen, that is good.  The public gets the same service and the cost to the taxpayer decreases.  I know that is not a universally shared view.  Such information is useful.  A private bus company is trying to compete with a State-subsidised entity.  That is not fair or reasonable.  Could the Minister outline why these are exempt?  Nothing should be exempt.

I said that ultimately Irish Water should be included but legislation is going through the House and I do not want to pre-empt the scrutiny of that.  I would like to exclude Irish Water with the option of coming back to it and I have the provision to bring it in in due course, but we can discuss that on Report Stage.<\/p><p>  I will not go through the full list of Part 2 exemptions, but they include all the commercial semi-state companies, and the general principle applies.  I will deal with the companies that are proposed to be delisted.  Tourism Ireland was established under the framework of the British-Irish Agreement 1999 and it operates under a code of practice for North-South bodies approved by the North-South Ministerial Council, which has regard to the FOI legislation operating in both the UK and Ireland.  In view of this arrangement, which ensures there is an appropriate openness and transparency in Tourism Ireland's activities consistent with its unique status as a North-South body, I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment.<\/p><p>  With regard to Bus &Eacute;ireann and the provision of a school transport service, the Deputy accepts why the company should be excluded but he believes the school transport system is a discrete subset that should be covered and I am pleased to advise him that I am restoring the application of FOI to records held for service providers in so far as the records relate to services provided under contract to an FOI body.  Records relating to the school transport service provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann will be brought under FOI within six months of the enactment of this legislation.  The draft Bill exempts most commercial semi-state bodies from full FOI provisions as set out in Part 2 of the Schedule.  The Government has agreed that commercial semi-state bodies in general should not be subject to FOI requirements because of the points I have made about commercial information.<\/p><p>  The six North-South bodies established under the British-Irish Agreement along with Tourism Ireland were established separately under the framework of the British-Irish Agreement.  That is the formal legal status.  They operate under the FOI code of practice for such bodies approved by the North-South Ministerial Council, which met in Armagh last Friday.  It was a constructive interaction between the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.  They must have regard to FOI legislation both in the Republic and in Northern Ireland.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which is the particular body referenced by Deputy Fleming, is covered by FOI.  The Food Safety Promotion Board is a North-South body and a separate entity.<\/p><p>  EirGrid is a regulated by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which means there is transparency in how its network business is regulated, and significant information is published by the CER on its website regarding key decisions such as electricity network charges, investment programmes and intended developments.  To subject it to FOI would have the clear potential for an unintended consequence of creating market distortions and placing EirGrid at a disadvantage in its commercial relationships with its customers, which is ultimately not in the interests of the consumer or the State.  In other words, it might not be in competition as a core provider of infrastructure but it is in a commercial relationship with a variety of energy generators who would be unhappy to have their information subject to FOI.  That would happen if EirGrid was included, and for that reason I was persuaded that the company should be exempt.<\/p><p>  I am convinced that commercial semi-state companies should not be subject in general to FOI for the reasons I have outlined.  Deputy Donnelly, in particular, has a different view, which is fine, but what I propose is consistent with what I outlined to the committee when I last appeared.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200014#O00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1384279200,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's recognition that the school transport service is discrete and his declaration that it will be subject to FOI within six months.

I will desist from bias in my language but I am not sure that I fully agree with the Minister's comments about the company.  It provides all the 400 kV and 200 kV power lines in the electricity transmission network, while the smaller lines - 38 kV and so on - that run into people's houses are provided by the ESB.  EirGrid's mission is to transport the electricity produced by the generator, public and private.  The ESB has had to divest some of its generating capacity in the interest of flexibility and market liberalisation.  It has nothing to do with the recently announced sale of State assets, which is a separate issue.  ESB probably only produces between 30% and 40% of electricity in the State.<\/p><p>  Wherever electricity is generated, EirGrid's mandate is to transport it to wherever it is required, and that generally means from other parts of Ireland to the east coast.  There is no commercial issue.  The companies running the power stations in Wexford, Cork or Moneypoint deal with commercial organisations.  EirGrid is investing of a few billion euro of taxpayer's money ultimately but it is a public body that is a service provider.  Every public body engages in commercial transactions.  For example, local authorities purchase materials but they cannot be excluded from FOI because the companies that supply services to them would not like their information to become public.  This is also a commercially sensitive issue.<\/p><p>  The reasons these bodies are included in the Schedule is that Departments do not trust the Information Commissioner.  They think he might be too liberal in his interpretation of commercial sensitivity.  This exemption is a mechanism to prevent this issue from being examined by the Information Commissioner on appeal.  This is one way for a Department to ensure information will never get out.  Like every other body, EirGrid deals with commercial organisations, but it is not in competition with anyone.

The only thing the Minister has added to commercially sensitive information is third party data, but Government Departments have third party data from companies and they clearly know how to deal with it.  I do not think commercially sensitive information should be released to competitors.  We agree on this.  However, the legislation already covers issues of commercial sensitivity.  Unless there is something else that is not covered by the section the Minister referenced on commercial sensitivity, why does this list exist?  I cannot hear any reason other than commercial sensitivity.<\/p><p>  As an aside, I have a philosophical question which is not relevant to the information.  State companies were not established to compete.  They were established because the private sector did not establish them.  Bodies such as the ESB and Irish Water were not established to compete; they were established for very good reasons.  The State is not in the business of establishing companies to compete with the private sector.  The State is in the business of establishing organisations that would not be established by the private sector on its own, and we have a bunch of these.  With respect, these bodies do not compete on a level playing field.  Dublin Bus does not compete on a level playing field with private operators because Dublin Bus has a State guarantee.  If the private operators run out of money they will go out of business, but none of the State agencies will ever go out of business.<\/p><p>  If commercial sensitivity is already guaranteed for any agency, what is special about this list that is not already covered by commercial sensitivity?

It is not the only accountability mechanism in place and all the commercial semi-State bodies operate in a regulated environment.  They are subject to independent authorities and are accountable to a line Minister, who in turn is accountable to the Houses and every committee therein.

In broad strokes it sounds great to make all bodies subject to freedom of information processes, and they could all make their cases.  Practically, law is not made in such a manner, and where would representatives of the bodies go to argue the case?  What sort of bureaucracy would be required to set that up?  Would it involve the Office of the Information Commissioner?  It would function with that level of requirements.  There must be a level of practicality.<\/p><p>  I am sure the committee and I will have discussions with the Information Commissioner about the volume of additional work this legislation will send his way.  To do what some of the Deputies opposite want would be incredibly onerous.  The general principle is that we cannot dovetail all accountability mechanisms into the Freedom of Information Act, and there is a suite of oversight provision intricately involved in every piece of legislation that has established a commercial semi-State company.  Examining the proposed Irish Water legislation, one can see the layers of accountability being inserted on different issues, with independent statutory authorities being responsible for oversight.  For as long as I have been here, we have always wanted independent oversight, as we need an ongoing, independent and verifiable oversight of all public activity.  That is why we have set up bodies to do the job and we trust them to do it.  If they do not do the job effectively, we hold them to account as well.<\/p><p>   A Deputy made a specific point regarding the rate of pay, for example, of CEOs in the likes of EirGrid, etc.  The level of remuneration of every chief executive of every commercial semi-State body is subject to my authorisation.  One of my first acts in office was to drastically reduce all those rates of pay.  The Hay scale has been collapsed and nobody in the commercial semi-State body is paid more than &euro;250,000, which is a very handsome salary to my judgment.  Nevertheless, I have been told by all and sundry that we would not get people to run the very largest semi-State companies for that level of salary.  We have done so, although these people were getting multiples of that amount not so long ago.  I stopped performance-related pay, which is not good in the long term.  We should set objectives and reward people for achieving them if they bring about transformations; that issue is for another day and when we are out of our current dilemma.  It is not true that these commercial semi-State companies set their own pay rates, as they do not.  They are subject to oversight.<\/p><p>  There was a question regarding Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Information that would not be commercially sensitive includes number of buses and children carried, accident information, safety regulations, schemes regarding eligibility, qualifications of drivers and overall costs to families.  That is a range of matters.  I would like to know the determinations of routes and catchment, which is one of the more controversial elements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200017#R00600","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1384281000,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I hope the Minister does not think I am harping on but I did not fully get the reply about EirGrid.

The provision of the grid is the establishment, building and putting in place of the grid, including the sub-stations and everything else.  That must be subject to greater public scrutiny.

I fully accept that its dealings with different power generating companies is commercial in respect of the cost of connecting them in and out, when it brings them in and out and so forth.  That is a commercial business and we can understand that.  However, this is the provision of the infrastructure.  It is a little like the National Roads Authority, NRA.

The provision relates to the Labour Relations Commission.  I did not realise the LRC would be linked with NAMA in this discussion.  Essentially, the Minister will know from where I am coming on this matter.  The Haddington Road agreements talks took place recently, as a result of which, various letters were issued by the LRC to public sector management on the agreement, but they have not been made public.  It would probably be going to the extreme to include all of the LRC's work in the legislation, as opposed to partially including it in Schedule 1.  There is an element of secrecy to the work of the LRC which is not fully justified.  While it is necessary to have some level of confidentiality during the conciliation part of LRC proceedings, in matters of public interest and where the taxpayer pays the bill, the letters issued to public sector unions should be made available to Members of the Oireachtas.  During the discussions earlier this year I tried to see the letters issued, but I was surprised to discover they were exempt from the provision of FOI legislation.  I think the Minister is of half a mind to release parts of the letters.  I hope we can go some way towards dealing with this matter. <\/p><p>  Amendment No. 83, in my name, to Schedule 1, reads: &quot;In page 74, to delete lines 4 to 8...&quot;.  It concerns the terms and conditions for the National Treasury Management Agency.  On page 3 of the Bill, as initiated, there is a list of contents encompassing the sections and Schedules to the Bill.  Part 1 refers to &quot;Partially Included Agencies&quot;, while Part 2 refers to &quot;Exempt Agencies.&quot;  It is difficult to understand and people are confused about which public body is included.  I want to remove part of section 6.  The Minister responded to an issue on pay scales in the National Treasury Management Agency, as well as its subsidiaries, including the NTMA and everybody else.  My amendment talks about partially included items.  Will the Minister confirm that the terms and conditions on which a person holds a position in the agency are subject to freedom of information legislation?  <\/p><p>  These are the key points I wish to make on the amendments which have been grouped.

It deals with the deployment of Garda personnel which is very unequal.  One can understand why it happens in the way it does in some locations, but it is almost impossible to figure it out elsewhere.  Around this time of the year, the Garda Commissioner is required to compile a service plan that is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in every December.  It is almost impossible to understand the rationale behind some of the deployment decisions made.  I have carried out a comparative study and discovered that some offences are likely to be under-reported because garda&iacute; are required to witness them such as road traffic offences and drugs seizures.  A low ratio of garda&iacute; leads to an under-reporting of crime which, in turn, understates the need for additional garda&iacute;.  The Garda divisions of Kildare and Meath are by far the worst represented, followed by Wexford.  I understand why this happens in a place such as Limerick which has had a particular problem; the same applies to Dublin city centre.  However, every time I have asked a parliamentary question I have been told decisions are based on crime rates, size of population and other similar criteria.<\/p> <p>We have gone through the statistics on crime from the CSO website.  It appears that the crimes reported are counted but there is under-reporting of specific crimes.  There is a need to examine that to ensure there is a fair allocation of resources around the country.  I do not see how we can do that through the process of laying the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plan before the Houses of the Oireachtas without the ability to scrutinise it properly.  It is up to the Garda Commissioner to deploy staff as he sees fit based on the information available to him.  For example, Sligo\/Leitrim north does not have a particular difficulty and has a significantly lower population than some parts of the country but it has a higher number of garda&iacute;.  I hope that outlines why the specific element should be opened up to greater scrutiny.

There is a variety of subsets in the grouping.  In respect of the amendment tabled by Deputy Sean Fleming, No. 12, which is grouped with amendments Nos 81 and 83, receivers and administrators, whether appointed by NAMA or by another secured lender, fall outside the definition of a public body as set out in section 6 of the Freedom of Information Bill.  The receiver or administrator is an independent legal officer appointed to take control of and realise the assets securing the loan.  The receiver or administrator acts as the legal agent of and for the benefit of the borrower and not of the lender or the secured creditor.  The receiver or administrator&rsquo;s costs are borne by the receivership and not by the lender.  Accordingly, I am strongly advised that it would not be appropriate to define receivers and administrators as public bodies and therefore I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p><p>  NAMA appoints receivers and administrators by reference to sections 147 to 149 of the National Asset Management Agency Act.  A secured lender, including NAMA, can also appoint receivers and administrators by reference to section 316 of the Companies Acts 1990, as amended.  In the case of assets outside Ireland, receivers and administrators are appointed by reference to contractual loan documents or by reference to the courts in the relevant jurisdiction.  <\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy Sean Fleming&rsquo;s amendment No. 81, the Equality Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are being provided with an exemption from freedom of information to protect their functions in so far as they relate to dispute resolution, conciliation or mediation on a voluntary basis to settle disputes.  That is their function.  This includes the role of the Labour Court, the Rights Commissioner Service and the Labour Relations Commission in resolving industrial disputes.  The possibility that records relating to parties to industrial relations processes would be released into the public domain under freedom of information would, I am strongly advised by the organisations, deter individuals, public and private bodies and trade unions from participating in the voluntary process.  Moreover, continued recourse to the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery to resolve industrial disputes is considered central to maintaining a stable industrial relations environment, promoting domestic and foreign investment and supporting economic recovery.<\/p><p>  Where functions of these bodies relate to legally enforceable quasi-judicial functions, records relating to such functions will be subject to freedom of information, like those of other quasi-judicial bodies, but potential release of records will be subject to the exemptions in the Act in the normal way.  In the case of Deputy Sean Fleming&rsquo;s amendment No. 83, notwithstanding the established and strong general principle that pay information relating to any person employed by a State body should be subject to freedom of information, having consulted with the Minister for Finance, I accept that the NTMA is, for the most part, made up of specialist professional staff more or less exclusively recruited from the private sector and that this places it in a qualitatively different situation from other public bodies in terms of the potential impact of the publication of individual pay information.  We have had discussions on this matter to see if we can make it more transparent and, in keeping with the need to promote greater openness and transparency on pay structures in the NTMA, I have requested that the NTMA take further steps to disclose additional information on remuneration levels by reducing the pay bandwidths reported on to &euro;25,000.  The NTMA has agreed to this measure.  On that basis, I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.  <\/p><p>  I will now move on to my amendment in this grouping, amendment No. 79, relating to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  The ODCE currently has an exemption from freedom of information except in regard to administrative records.  I had proposed in the Bill to refine this exemption from freedom of information to only exclude from freedom of information any records relating to the office&rsquo;s functions performed by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation advises me that, given the nature of the work currently being carried out by the ODCE in respect of investigations relating to the IBRC and the added administrative burden that it imposes, it is not advisable to bring the ODCE more fully under the freedom of information provisions at this time, as it could potentially have an adverse impact on the office&rsquo;s administrative capacity to effectively discharge its statutory responsibilities.  I am proposing in this amendment, therefore, that the ODCE remain subject to freedom of information in respect of its administrative records, pending a review to be carried out after one year following enactment of the Bill.  This will provide a longer lead-in time for the office to prepare for the extension of freedom of information that will apply to it in due course, during which time the nature of the exemption that might apply can be appropriately refined.  It is hoped that current pressures on the ODCE - I must be careful what I say - arising from its investigatory workload will be attenuated over that period.<\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 80, 82 and 84 have been tabled by Deputy Catherine Murphy and are being moved by Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  The Government decided that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be subject to freedom of information in respect of administrative functions subject to security exemptions.  Human resources and their deployment - the point made by Deputy Catherine Murphy - and the factors and policy choices made by the Garda Commissioner and his staff in making those decisions will be encompassed by freedom of information, subject to security exemptions.  In summary, therefore, the amendment is unnecessary, as it is currently encompassed by the provision set out in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200020#W00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1384282500,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I will go back to those three issues.

It was put forward by the environmental pillar but goes beyond environmental issues in terms of freedom of information.  It refers to public bodies, not excluding the semi-State bodies.  The particular concern of the environmental pillar is that the semi-State bodies have an enormous impact on our natural environment, our amenities, on biodiversity and other important areas of public interest.  To exclude organisations like Coillte, Bord na M&oacute;na and others is unacceptable in their view and I completely agree with them.  We have debated at length at other committees, for example, the goings on inside Coillte, notwithstanding the fact that many of us campaigned against its privatisation.  There are real issues involved here.  I do not see a good reason for their exclusion.  The Minister has argued that it is about commercial sensitivity and competing in a commercial environment and so forth but that is not a good enough reason to insulate these very important bodies, which have such a huge impact on our society and our environment, from the provisions of the freedom of information legislation.  This amendment has been tabled in that context.<\/p><p>  I wish to make a philosophical point regarding our earlier discussion with the Minister.  The inevitable logic of the Minister's argument is that if an entity or body is operating in a commercial environment, secrecy is justified.  That means that the more we commercialise areas of endeavour in the economy, the more secrecy we have and the less access ordinary members of the public have to information.  To put it in very simple terms, it means more privatisation, more secrecy, less accountability and less information.  The Minister's argument is an admission of that.  He is admitting that privatisation equals secrecy, lack of public oversight and an erosion and undermining of democracy.  I believe that is actually the case but surely that is not something we should accommodate.  Surely we should be doing the exact opposite of accommodating the proposition that commercial activity insulates commercial entities from any requirement to be properly accountable, transparent and open to scrutiny by members of the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200022#Y01100","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1384283700,"counter":674,"content":"<p>The definition proposed by Deputy Murphy and supported by Deputy Boyd Barrett is based on the definition set out in the access to information on the environment regulations which transposed the requirements of EU Directive 2003\/4\/EC on public access to information on the environment, known as the Aarhus Convention.  The definition in the convention and the regulations was left deliberately broad to ensure the widest possible access to environmental information.  There is a balance to be struck between providing legal clarity for both requestors and the public authority or body carrying out public services, and providing the widest possible access to environmental information.<\/p><p>  Issues have arisen.  There were instances where, in the context of the access to environmental information regulations, entities have argued that they are not public bodies, with the determination ultimately being left to the courts.  I understand that litigation is currently pending in that regard.  The rulings of the Irish courts and the Aarhus Convention compliance committee suggest that the access to environmental information regime could potentially encompass bodies which would not be perceived as \"public\" in the ordinary course in that they carry out commercial activities and may even, in some circumstances, encompass private companies which also perform some environmental functions and hold environmental information.  While ensuring access to environmental information is necessary, providing access to the wider suite of information and data held by bodies involved in commercial activities or by private companies will damage their competitiveness, in my view.  <\/p><p>  I believe that my own definition of a \"public body\", as provided for in this Bill, is more precise and ensures that both the requestor and the public body know what we are talking about.  The definition strikes a balance in determining and clarifying which bodies are actually encompassed by freedom of information, given the various competing considerations I have already outlined.  The Freedom of Information Bill already provides the power to bring non-public bodies which are funded by the Exchequer, directly or indirectly, under the remit of the legislation.  It is my intention to work with the various Departments to determine which of these bodies should fall within the remit of the Bill in due course.  I would also welcome the advice of this committee in that regard, following the bedding down of the swathe of public bodies that will be encompassed immediately after the enactment of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200022#Y01200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1384283700,"counter":675,"content":"<p>We have rehearsed this argument and will return to it again on Report Stage.  Environmentalists have been at pains to tell me that very often the definition of \"environmental sustainability\" that is used in political parlance, in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere, is so narrow as to reduce its meaning to nothing.  When sustainability is defined by the EU in various environmental directives and at the conclusion of environmental summits, like the Rio summit in 2012, it is a very broad definition that takes into account the impact, at every level, on society and on communities because that is the environment.  The environment is not just the fish in the sea or the level of pollution in the air.  The environment is, literally, everything and that is how it is defined.  It is not just me or Irish environmentalists who are saying this.<\/p> <p>That is how it was defined at the Earth Summit in Rio and is defined in EU directives.  The point being made by environmentalists is that the companies the Minister is exempting have enormous impact on our society and the environment in the broadest sense and therefore to insulate them on the grounds that they are engaged in commercial activity would be a massive blow to the campaign for environmental sustainability in the official and proper meaning of that term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200022#Y01300","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384284300,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I am curious about how this European directive is handled elsewhere.  One of the commitments in the programme for Government was that these directives would be expressed in primary legislation.  It is sometimes quite difficult to wade one's way through statutory instruments.  It seems that we comply with the European directives but when one tries to apply them - for instance in the case of the directive on wind farms, and I am in favour of wind energy, where the communities must be consulted - the consultation almost happens after the land has been purchased and contracts have been signed with land owners.  In terms of how it functions, it does not mean in practice what it is intended to mean.

I understand the scale of what was agreed at the summit.  The broad stroke has to be written into legislation that is practical and meaningful.  As I said one cannot encompass everything on an issue like this.  We have spoken about access to environmental information which is a separate issue.  As to how the  remit of FOI relates to public bodies, we have to be clear as to what is encompassed and what is not encompassed.  I have given members my views on the bodies that should be excluded and the reason for that.

Section 42(<i>e<\/i>) excludes records relating to tribunal inquiries, other than in limited circumstances, such as general administration.  This exemption means records of tribunals of inquiry or commissions of inquiry were already excluded from the remit of FOI in section 42; the relevant provisions contained in sectoral legislation in the actual bodies that set up the tribunals of inquiry are being reconsolidated into this legislation.<\/p><p>  Obviously there is a public interest in excluding FOI, where the tribunal is deliberating.  One needs to give the tribunal scope to do that and that is what the actual crafting of legislation does, as it must be allowed to weigh confidential information and decide whether it should in the public interest be published or not.  The efficiency of the whole tribunal process would be undermined in circumstances  that FOI requests could be made on a selective basis during the work of tribunals.  This would have the effect of allowing the tribunal's inquiries to be reviewed and its conclusions second guessed on the basis of selected records being requested or released.  It is also likely that individuals would be discouraged from providing confidential information to tribunals, were this information in the FOI domain.  For those reasons I do not think that tribunals of inquiry should be encompassed.  It was never envisaged under the base legislation that they would.  In conducting their work, they weigh up evidence and determine truth because much of what they get is not true and some of it is contradictory.  A judge or whoever is the authorised person under law makes that determination at the end of the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200023#Z01300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1384284300,"counter":689,"content":"<p>So, the Minister is saying yes, but not during the deliberation phase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013111200023#Z01400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1384284300,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I am saving never.
