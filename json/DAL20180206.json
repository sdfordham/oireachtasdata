I put it to him that campaigning for and articulating the need for basic services such as housing, health, broadband connectivity or questioning the lack of spending on important projects in rural Ireland is entirely legitimate, as is calling to account the Government for its lack of delivery on promises made by it to rural Ireland many years ago.  We need a reality check in terms of delivery on promises made to rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The previous Fine Gael-led Government undermined and arguably destroyed a very good model for rural development in the form of the then Leader programme, which was lauded by the European Union as an example of good governance and developmental community-led approach and was designed to revitalise rural areas, create jobs and so on.<\/p><p>From 2007 to 2013 the previous programme allocated some &euro;400 million.  The Fine Gael-led Government came in and reduced that allocation to &euro;250 million and destroyed it by undermining the governance structure with huge bureaucracy.  There were also major delays in getting the programme off the ground.  As of this month, only &euro;13 million out of the 2014-20 programme allocation of &euro;250 million has been spent.  Forget all the rhetoric.  This programme is there on the ground, waiting to be delivered, but it is not delivered in accordance with the promises made.<\/p> <p> On broadband connectivity, back in 2011 Fine Gael said that it would connect 90% of homes by 2015.  That was the promise then, and we had lots of promises in 2012, 2013 and 2014, such as former Minister Alex White's national draft strategy on broadband, and commitments such as the tendering process for the roll-out of broadband that commenced in 2013.  SIRO pulled out and Eir has pulled out.  Two years ago, the programme for Government promised that the contract would be awarded by 2017.  If there was one project that would really enable rural Ireland and the regions to develop economically, it is the availability of high speed broadband.  Everything else pales into insignificance with that vital piece of infrastructure.<\/p> <p> Despite all the promises, the existing businesses are under huge pressure because of the lack of broadband speed, household quality is reduced and the potential of new micro enterprises is stymied because of the lack of broadband connection.  Today, we learned that while there is no delivery on broadband, &euro;466 million is also needed for the railways just to maintain them and ensure we can hold on to the existing network to connect to Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Kerry, Waterford and Wexford, not to mention the towns of Athlone, Longford, Roscommon and Carlow.  All of those areas could now be affected.  Is that &euro;466 million in the existing estimates?<\/p> <p> Rural crime is a real issue also, but I will deal with that later.  My main point is that in a week when all sorts of promises are being made about billions of euro and we are going to do the roll-out in five years' time----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517925900,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The Deputy is out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600004#B00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1517925900,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Government seems incapable of doing the here and now in delivering existing programmes in accordance of the promises it made.

At the time, if the Taoiseach recalls, we in Sinn F&eacute;in acknowledged the positive language in the joint report but we warned that it fell far short of what is needed to truly protect the national interest, North and South.  We cautioned that the promises contained in the joint report were not legally binding.  We pointed out that the report was full of holes and open to interpretation.  We warned that the Government needed to be very careful dealing with a Tory Government, especially a divided one.  That was sound and solid advice, and how right we were.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. David Davis, the lead negotiator for Britain in the talks, described the joint report as nothing more than a statement of intent.  The European Commission described it merely as a gentlemen's agreement, a far cry from cast iron and rock solid.  This was a fudge designed to get Britain and the European Union into wider trade talks.  The assumption the Taoiseach made was that Britain would commit itself to staying in the customs union and Single Market or some variation of that.  That is what we would want to see as well.<\/p>  <p>  The Government accepted a bag of promises from Theresa May and Boris Johnson.  Those promises have been cast to the wind and the Taoiseach's cast-iron guarantee is now not worth the paper it is written on.  The future of this island is still subject to Theresa May's Cabinet battles and Boris Johnson's leadership ambitions.  There will be a hardening of the Border on this island if the hard Brexiteers have their way and Britain and the North leave the European Union.  We cannot have a situation where the North is dragged out of the customs union and Single Market against its will.<\/p>  <p>  We have consistently said that the only practical solution for Ireland is for the North to have special status in the European Union.  This would simply reflect the will of the people; as the Taoiseach knows, a majority in the North voted to remain.  Sinn F&eacute;in is very clear on what that special status would mean.  In practical terms, it would mean the North staying in the customs union and Single Market; both the Assembly and the Good Friday Agreement staying in the legal framework of the European Union and the European courts; and the protection of the rights of those who live in the North of Ireland who are Irish and European citizens, who should be able to enjoy exactly the same rights post-Brexit as they do now.  The sooner the Government realises this and works towards those alternatives, the better.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's naive guarantees in December have damaged his credibility.  He allowed himself and the Government to be led by the nose by Theresa May, with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, being patted on the back by Boris Johnson as the best boy in the class.  Will the Government finally accept the reality that there was no cast-iron guarantee in December?  Will the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste accept that because of their naivety, we are essentially back to square one?  Will the Taoiseach explicitly call for the North to stay in the customs union and Single Market?  Will he call for the Good Friday Agreement to stay within the legal architecture of the Union?  Does he see that as the only practical, sensible, realistic solution to protect the interests of Irish people, North and South?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600006#D00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1517927100,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I said a number of things about the UK-EU joint report which was agreed in December.

That is exactly what we have been doing.  We are now seeking that those commitments and guarantees written in black and white in the December report are written into the EU-UK withdrawal agreement, which will be legally binding.

It is significant that the work being done at present is on the withdrawal agreement, making those commitments legally binding, and the transition arrangement for the period after the UK leaves the EU.

I want the best possible outcome for the people of this island.  The concerns I have are concerns which are shared and have been expressed by many people.  The European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Phil Hogan, said last week that a border on the island of Ireland is inevitable if Britain leaves the customs union.  I agree with that.  The EU negotiator Sabine Weyand said that meeting commitments on the all-island economy would imply that the North effectively remains within the customs union and the Single Market.  Michel Barnier has said exactly the same, that is, without a customs union and being outside the Single Market will mean barriers to trade in goods and services are unavoidable.  If the North is taken out of the customs union and Single Market, we will see a hardening of the Border irrespective of whatever backdrop agreement the Taoiseach believes he has in place.  It simply will not be good enough and will fall far short of what is necessary to make sure that we do not have that hardening of the Border.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach knows that the issue of the Border is about more than trade.  While trade is important, it is also about the peace process.  It is deeply political.  We want to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is protected in all its parts.

She died from a cardiac arrest as a result of a massive haemorrhage after giving birth to her son, Frederick, by emergency caesarean section.  There were no emergency blood supplies in the operating theatre.  The coroner believed that the 37-minute delay in getting a transfusion probably cost her her life.  Holles Street said it would rectify this situation but although fridges were installed in theatres, they were not sufficiently stocked when Malak Thawley bled to death in the same hospital in May 2016.<\/p><p> Five years ago yesterday, while giving birth to her fourth child, Sally Rowlette died in Sligo General Hospital as a result of a catastrophic mismanagement of HELLP syndrome, the same condition as a result of which Dhara Kivlehan died in the same hospital a few years earlier.  The HSE's brutal opposition to the truth coming out, fighting her husband, Michael, for four years and resisting that inquest, probably cost Sally Rowlette her life and her children their mother.<\/p> <p> We are hearing a lot lately that Ireland is one of the safest countries in which to give birth but when something goes wrong, there is no appetite for transparency or no appetite to learn.  It is a battle every time with the bereaved and stunned families on one side and the HSE lawyers on the other.  It is a case of litigate, delay and deny.  That is the HSE way.  The report on Portiuncula University Hospital still has not been released.  Investigations were ongoing in seven out of the 19 maternity hospitals last year.  Twice in the past three years, the HSE has gone to court to prevent the truth coming out, first, to prevent the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, publishing the report on Portlaoise and, now, Holles Street hospital effectively taking the Minister to court to stop an external investigation into Malak Thawley's death.<\/p> <p> There is something very wrong in our health service.  There were 27 maternal deaths between 2011 and 2013 but only three inquests.  The culture of deny and defend has to end.  While I welcome the Minister's measure to have an external investigation, the reality is that mandatory inquests in respect of maternal deaths are a key step in ending this culture and improving maternity care.  That is something on which this House has agreed since Second Stage of my legislation was passed in the dying days of the previous D&aacute;il.  That legislation was prioritised by the current Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  We gave the Department of Justice and Equality six months to table amendments.  On the night before the committee hearing, it pulled the plug and did not proceed with that investigation.  The legislation in question is supposed to be a priority for the Government.<\/p> <p> Two years ago, the Taoiseach met Sean Rowlette, who gave him a letter from his children in which they said they miss their Mam every day.

My sympathies and those of the House are with the families.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is one of the safest countries in the world in which to give birth, both in terms of maternal mortality and neonatal mortality.  However, that should not give rise to complacency in any way because we need to ensure that the number of maternal deaths and neonatal deaths is minimised.  It is never possible to eliminate them entirely but they can be reduced further and minimised.  Any time a maternal death occurs, there should be total transparency.  Hospitals should be upfront about what happens and should carry out full investigations so that lessons can be learned and further events avoided into the future.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the actions of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, Deputy Clare Daly will know that he has sought an independent review of the Thawley case, and the Government is totally behind him in that regard.  We are very disappointed and dissatisfied that Holles Street hospital is threatening to take the Minister or the HSE to court in order to avoid an external inquiry.  There should be an external inquiry.  Rather than trying to block it, the hospital authorities should welcome it.  If they have nothing to hide, they should welcome it.  We are totally behind the Minister in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation was passed in recent months to provide for open disclosure.  As a result, for the first time open disclosure by doctors and other health care professionals is protected.

In 2013, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who is now the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, published a statement:<\/p><blockquote>I'm a big supporter of having a directly elected Mayor for Dublin.  There's a big democratic deficit at the moment in that the person who runs the city, the City Manager, is unelected and yet has all of the power and responsibility for the capital, whereas the Lord Mayor (elected by the Councillors) is largely a ceremonial role.<\/blockquote><p>Late last year, the D&aacute;il was told it was likely the Government would hold a plebiscite on the mayoral issue next autumn, around the time there might be a presidential election.  It was also reported that in a report to Government, the Department had come out in favour of directly-elected mayoral system for Dublin and possibly Cork.  I would add Limerick, Waterford and Galway as all our cities should have that sort of leadership.<\/p><p>This is not about an urban-rural divide.  We all have rural and urban connections wherever we live in this country.  It is not about Dublin versus the rest either.  It seems the Government has a cunning plan at the moment whereby it will cripple Dublin with gridlock in an attempt to help the rest of the country develop.  A planning proposal which involves being stuck in traffic for 75 minutes to get from Castleknock to Kildare Street every day is not a clever one.  Things are worse around the country.  Speaking for Dublin, the city is in crisis.  Every other city is the same.<\/p><p>We need real leadership with a mandate to tackle the housing crisis.  One cannot get that when one has four different city managers who are unelected and answer to no one but the mandarins in Custom House and Merrion Street who run everything in this country.  We need mayors to sort out the housing crisis and a transport crisis which is just as bad, if not worse, in Galway as it is in Dublin.  We need someone to represent each of our cities and the enterprise culture we have to develop business and the economy in a co-ordinated way rather than according to a divided approach.<\/p><p>We need a mayor who has real power so we can develop the cultural life in our cities, as well as a mayor who can help to lead community development.  Dublin Culture Connects is a fantastic example of bottom-up leadership that is happening but it will not work when it is controlled and led just by the Civil Service, rather than by elected officials.<\/p> <p> Will the Taoiseach put this to the people?  Will we have a plebiscite this autumn in order that we can introduce directly-elected mayors in our cities, starting in 2019?  I do not believe he could introduce a plebiscite that would say to the people we are thinking of doing it six years later.  Will he put it to the people?  Will he live up to what he said numerous times in the D&aacute;il and what the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has also said, namely, they believe, like us, that a directly-elected mayor is needed?  If we are going to do it, the Taoiseach must decide now so we can have the plebiscite in time.

I think the same logic applies to other cities as well, and even potentially to counties and other local authorities.  That would involve a major transfer of power from county and city managers, or chief executives as they are now called, to somebody elected.  That would be a very big change in the way our local government works.  The relationship would be similar to that which exists between a Minister and a Secretary General, as opposed to all the power, or almost all the power, residing with the chief executive, as it does now.  However, we need to be more definitive on what proposal we are actually making to people before we have a plebiscite.  We have pencilled in a plebiscite for this autumn and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will bring proposals to Cabinet in the next few weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I was very much against the proposals that were made by former Minister Gormley from Deputy Eamon Ryan's party because he proposed, essentially, to have a super-mayor who would be a mayor over the four existing local authorities in Dublin.  Therefore, we would have the four existing local authorities all with their own chief executives, all with their own mayors, and then another super-mayor over that with very little power indeed.  The last thing we need is another layer of bureaucracy in local government or between local government and national government.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the exact role of an elected mayor needs to be fleshed out.  The Deputy mentioned, for example, transport.  Are we suggesting that Dublin Bus be transferred from national government to a Dublin executive mayor?  How would it apply to the DART, for example, which runs on rail lines that also connect other parts of the country?  What would happen with the housing budget and would it be a transfer from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to that authority?  If that mayor had an enterprise role, would the IDA and Enterprise Ireland cease to operate in the Dublin region or would there be some sort of double structure?  Those things need to be fleshed out before we actually put a proposal to the people.<\/p>  <p>  Realistically, if we look at what was done in London, for example, while I am not sure a plebiscite was held there, even after the decision was taken to establish a directly-elected mayor in London, it did not just happen six months later and they had a programme as to how that was done over time.  There also is the question of revenue-raising powers and how any directly-elected mayor with no revenue-raising powers would be able to do any of the things the Deputy mentioned.  Would the property tax go to the mayor's office?  Would VAT collected in a particular city go to the mayor's office?  All of those things need to be fleshed out and thought through and I do not think this had been done adequately yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600010#H00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1517929500,"counter":128,"content":"<p>The mayor has to have a real role.

It may be that a directly-elected mayor for the city of Cork on the new city boundaries might work more logically than one for Dublin, particularly as the latter is divided among three local authorities.

Currently, we are investing in the support of teachers to adopt these new curricula.

In addition, we are investing in new routes to both improve the existing skills of teachers, with masters qualifications being tendered for, additional resources in NUIG to support such improvement and a new undergraduate route into post-primary teaching of Irish.

The Taoiseach will be aware that the programme for Government committed to a second cath lab at University Hospital Waterford.  He will also be aware of a report by Dr. Niall Herity, which did not make a positive recommendation.  I am sure he is also aware that since then, a mobile lab has been deployed at the hospital.  My understanding is that that mobile lab is to come out of the hospital next week.  It was deployed for a number of months.  The waiting times for diagnostic testing have been dramatically reduced because of the deployment of this mobile lab.  The problem is that for those who are then tested and diagnosed and need an intervention, the waiting times for interventions has increased.  The reason for this is that the temporary mobile lab cannot carry out intervention work, and all the data show that this spells out the need for a second permanent lab.  A meeting is to take place next week, I think, with the Minister for Health and regional Oireachtas Members from across the south east.  A protest in Waterford is planned for Saturday, which I encourage people to attend.  As the Taoiseach knows, this is a very important issue for people.  If the data show, as they seem to do, a need for a second permanent lab, how can he and his Government ensure the appropriate urgency is given to this issue in order that we can get the necessary capacity into the hospital to treat people in cardiac arrest as quickly as possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600013#L00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1517930700,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I discussed this briefly with the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the other public representatives from Waterford just last week.

It seems to me there is a strong case to keep it in place while the other review - a review of the locations of cath labs across the country is ongoing - takes place.  If it were to be removed, I think we would just see waiting times worsen again, so there is a strong case to be made for keeping the second mobile cath lab in place while work is completed on the review, which will examine whether to locate a second one on a permanent basis in Waterford.

The simplification of our tax code is at the core of the Bill.  In an ever-changing global environment, it is essential that Ireland remains ahead of the curve when it comes to a consistent, simple and efficient tax system.  The tax strategy group publishes its work in the lead-up to the budget every year.  That work offers a valuable insight into possible changes in the various strands of our tax regime, ranging from income tax and corporation tax to value-added tax.  The Bill does not seek to replace the group but, rather, to complement it.  While the tax strategy group would continue its work on general taxation, the office of tax simplification would specifically look at making the tax system easier for all users, including the Revenue Commissioners.  The proposed office would bring forward recommendations on how the tax code could be simplified.  Crucially, the Bill has a time-bound element to it to ensure the office does not turn into another quango.<\/p><p>A similar office was established in the United Kingdom.  It was asked to advise on ways to simplify inheritance tax in the UK by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  The current tax director of the office in the UK, speaking on inheritance tax, stated, &quot;Some of those who deal with inheritance tax will be private individuals who are already dealing with difficult circumstances, so the complexities of the administrative aspects of this tax may be particularly challenging.&quot;  That case perfectly sums up the role the office of tax simplification could play and how useful it could be in an Irish setting.<\/p><p>The cost of doing business in Ireland must be closely monitored at all times.  We are a small, open economy on the periphery of Europe and it is imperative that we remain competitive in a challenging global environment.  If another country has a better offering, it will get the investment and jobs.  Taxation is a significant cost for large and small companies, not only in terms of the tax incurred but also the administrative burden.  By reducing the compliance costs for businesses, we can reduce the cost of doing business in Ireland.<\/p><p>Behavioural economists often argue that if one wishes for people to comply with something, one has to make it simple.By making the tax code simple for people to understand, we would increase compliance.  Most people and companies in Ireland endeavour to be tax compliant but some fail to comply through a lack of understanding.  Ignorance is not a defence for non-compliance but we must recognise that simplifying the tax code would bring people into the tax net.<\/p><p>The argument also works the other way.  There are a large number of credits, reliefs, exemptions and reductions across many areas of the taxation system.  In many cases, people do not apply for such benefits because it is challenging for them to understand whether or not they qualify.  That is particularly the position in respect of certain tax credits.  As a consequence, some targeted reliefs and benefits are not as effective as they could be.<\/p><p>It is important to note the benefits a simple code would have for the Revenue Commissioners.  Under a simpler tax code, it would be easier for Revenue to determine whether an individual or company is tax compliant.

The Taoiseach is right when he speaks about the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  It provided a democratic and peaceful means of achieving Irish unity.  If we want Irish unity, however, we must put bones on exactly how that is going to be brought about.  Sinn F&eacute;in put forward a practical proposal to have an all-party committee in the House to examine how that could be done.  We are aware that recent population changes in the North have underpinned the need for such an approach.  We also know that the census in the North, which for the first time asked about identity, revealed that those who view themselves as British are now a minority at 48%.  Unionists have, for the first time, lost their majority in the Assembly.  In the same census, those who define themselves as Irish were at 45%.  While I wish to see a united Ireland, I also wish to see one in which those who are British and those who have a different identity are comfortable and where their rights are fully protected.  I have always maintained, as does my party, that unionists in a united Ireland can never be treated like nationalists have been treated in a partitioned Ireland.  We want a new republic and we want a different type of Ireland, North and South.  We do not want to peg North and South together to simply have a united Ireland but not a united people.  That is the type of Ireland I want to build.  It makes practical sense to have a committee in this House that would look at how we can practically work towards Irish unity.<\/p>  <p>  I was not surprised that the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il rejected such an offer, given that he is the most pro-unionist leader of his party, certainly in my lifetime and possibly for longer than that.  I expected, however, that the new Taoiseach would see the reality of what is before him; that this is a realistic practical proposal by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Taoiseach asks for proposals all the time, and when we give them to the Taoiseach, he rejects them.  I am asking him to reconsider it because it is in the spirit of wanting to work towards Irish unity in a practical way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600018#Q00100","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1517933700,"counter":246,"content":"<p>The Deputy should note I want to cover as many questions as possible.

As a former Minister involved in North-South infrastructural development in education, health and enterprise, I regret very much the lack of progress on North-South infrastructure over the past eight or nine years.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House of the North-South projects the Government is identifying, with the British government and the Northern political system - as it now exists in the absence of the Executive - and about these developments.  I believe that the failure to deliver the Narrow Water bridge project concretised and encapsulated in a nutshell the lack of energy and impetus regarding North-South co-operation on all sides, including Sinn F&eacute;in, the unionists and the Irish and British Governments.  It was a classic project that had both communities from different traditions urging it on but through inertia and a lack of commitment, it failed to be delivered.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of the EU, I have a number of questions on Cabinet committee C.  It is striking that the Cabinet sub-committee on Brexit has not met since September.  This means that the Government's proposals on Europe were not cleared by the Cabinet sub-committee or the ideas were not discussed there initially prior to the Taoiseach speaking to the European Parliament.  Were they agreed with the Taoiseach's colleagues beforehand?<\/p>  <p>  As for the studies on the impact of Brexit, last week the Taoiseach listed a range of documents, including studies not carried out by the Government, but having reviewed the list the fact remains the Government has not produced any report that goes into detail about the possible impact of likely scenarios or mitigating activities that might be required.  We know about sectoral exposure because of work that was completed before the Taoiseach came into office but we do not know the sectoral impacts under various scenarios, including, for example, under a Canada-type trade deal or a South Korean-type trade deal.  There is no clarity in respect of the services sector.  We have had no debate about it.  While everyone goes on about merchandise, hard borders and physical infrastructure, services are a huge part of the trade between east and west and North and South.  We have not had enough focus on that and I question whether there is a whole-of-Government approach to Brexit or whether the other Departments are lagging far behind in engaging with the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600018#Q01200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1517933700,"counter":257,"content":"<p>My main question is about Palestine but I will briefly ask about the united Ireland issue.  I agree with having the committee but if we want to further the drive towards Irish unity, we need to immediately separate church and State, get our schools and hospitals out of the hands of the Catholic Church and do something about the appalling lack of a universal, proper national health service that does not have people queuing for years on lists.  In general, we need to improve social services, especially in the areas of housing.  This would make the prospect of unity attractive and would be the best preparation to forward the struggle for Irish unity.<\/p>  <p>  On Palestine, I am aware there were some discussions about the outrageous moves by the Trump Administration to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in what was a flagrant provocation of the entire Arab world and the Palestinian population.  It reinforced even further the ethnic cleansing of Jerusalem and the illegal occupations of the West Bank by settlers.  Is the Taoiseach willing to follow the example of Denmark?  Whenever we ask why the Irish Government does not unilaterally show a bit of backbone on the issue of Palestine, recognise the state of Palestine and boycott Israel for what under international law and UN security resolutions is illegal activity in Jerusalem and the West Ban, the Government always hides behind the European Union.  The Irish Government states it cannot do anything because Ireland is tied into the foreign policy of the European Union.  Denmark, however, has proven that this is not the case.  This month, Denmark has made a decision to boycott any companies that have any involvement whatsoever in the occupied territories.  If Denmark can do it then we can do it.  We should do it immediately.  It is simply unconscionable how countries in Europe that claim to uphold human rights can stand by while Israel flagrantly acts in defiance of international law and flouts the human rights of Palestinian people in the occupied territories.  Will the Taoiseach respond on whether we could follow the lead of Denmark and take independent, unilateral action to boycott Israel for its actions in the occupied territories?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600018#Q01300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1517933700,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I shall address the first matter on Irish unity.  I reiterate the Government is committed to the Good Friday Agreement and we see ourselves as - and are - co-guarantors of that agreement.  We should not forget that when the Good Friday Agreement was approved, it was approved by 97% of people voting in a referendum in this State and more than 70% of people voting in a referendum in Northern Ireland.  Talks are under way in Stormont at present.  As I speak, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, is in Belfast representing the Government.<\/p><p>As those talks are at a very sensitive stage, today is not the day to be asserting our unionism or nationalism.  I do not think any good purpose would be served by giving anyone any cause to take offence.  I think that is all I will say for now.

For example, the cancer service at Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Derry is seeing patients from County Donegal who need radiotherapy every day.  There is an agreement in place to ensure patients from County Donegal who have particular types of heart attacks can get primary percutaneous coronary intervention treatment in Altnagelvin in Derry, rather than in locations like Galway or Dublin, which are much further away.

When I was looking at the travel times the other day, I noted that when the road has been completed, it will take an hour to drive from Emyvale to Derry.

In the meantime, our embassy will stay in Tel Aviv.  I am not up to date with the foreign policy position Denmark is taking in this regard, but we have to bear in mind that when a country recognises Palestine, Israel interprets that in the same way as the Palestinians have interpreted the US Government's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  I understand this has happened in the case of Sweden.  The Israeli Government has a tendency to disengage with countries that recognise the state of Palestine.  That could undermine the important humanitarian work we do in that region.  We have plans to intensify and increase the humanitarian work we do in the Palestinian territories.

The establishment of a new configuration of Cabinet committees encompasses the Government's national priorities for the coming years.  The statement of strategy reflects the Department's role in supporting the Taoiseach and the Government to develop a sustainable economy and a successful society, to pursue Ireland's interests abroad, to implement the Government's programme and to build a better future for Ireland and all of its citizens.<\/p>  <p>  The statement of strategy, which is aligned to the Government's key priorities and policies, sets out six strategic priorities: providing excellent support services for the Taoiseach and the Government, ensuring Ireland has a sustainable economy, helping to ensure Government policies and services support a socially inclusive and fair society, ensuring Ireland maintains strong relationships in Europe and the world, ensuring the best possible outcomes for Ireland from the Brexit negotiations across all four priorities identified by the Government and planning for the future in the context of the many uncertainties arising in the international environment.  It also incorporates the work of the Department linked to specific initiatives, including work relating to the Citizens' Assembly, data protection, strategic communications and a number of statutory inquiries.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from the work to date of the Citizens' Assembly and the work of the previous Constitutional Convention, the Government has published an indicative timetable for a number of referendums in 2018 and 2019.  The Government has a number of key priorities for the immediate period ahead.  The Department of the Taoiseach, along with other relevant Departments, will assist in making progress with these priorities, which include Northern Ireland, the publication of the national planning framework and the ten-year infrastructure plan, the Brexit negotiations, the ongoing reform of the justice and health sectors, the doubling of Ireland's global footprint, reform of the Seanad, climate change, pension reform and housing.  The protection of Ireland's growing economy is critical to ensuring Ireland is an equal society that creates equal opportunities for all of its people to participate and share in its prosperity.  The new revised statement of strategy will guide the work of the Department in achieving these goals in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600019#R02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1517934300,"counter":283,"content":"<p>On the priorities of the Department of the Taoiseach, I referred during our discussion on the previous group of questions to the need for sectoral impact studies in the context of Brexit.  I put it to the Taoiseach that we do not know what the sectoral impacts will be under the various scenarios that may emerge from the EU-UK deal on Brexit, if such a deal emerges.  I am thinking particularly of the possibility of a Canada-style or a South Korea-style deal.  There is a lack of clarity in respect of the services sector.  I ask the Taoiseach to indicate whether further work on the sectoral impacts of Brexit will be published as part of the Department's priority work.  If so, when will it be published?  The Taoiseach gave commitments in that regard when he was appointed as Taoiseach.  He said that detailed sectoral impact studies would be done under various scenarios.<\/p>  <p>  I make the point that the Taoiseach's speech to the European Parliament was about the future of Europe.  The entire purpose of Cabinet committee C on European affairs is to discuss that issue and issues like it.  I am not talking about the mere speech itself; I am talking about proposals about the future of Europe emanating from the Government on behalf of the country.  The Taoiseach promised that there would be consultation with the D&aacute;il on such proposals.  Is he now suggesting that when he goes off to speak about Ireland's position on profound issues like the future evolution and development of Europe, he does not have to consult his Cabinet colleagues, a Cabinet committee or indeed the D&aacute;il?<\/p><p>I do not think that is the case.  There is an onus to have full engagement with the D&aacute;il on key issues about the future of Europe.  For example, can the Taoiseach tell us if he has commissioned any studies on the impact of new digital taxes since this matter was last discussed?  We know the Taoiseach is against harmonisation as we are and as are the people.  What we do not know is whether concrete steps have been taken to move the discussion on digital taxation from broad generalities to hard specifics.  Only when this is done can there be any idea about the implications for Ireland and other countries.<\/p> <p> In terms of the Taoiseach's departmental priorities, clearly propaganda will be a core priority with &euro;5 million being spent on priorities decided by the Taoiseach before any public consultation was launched.  When this was last discussed, the Taoiseach laughed at the idea that he was deciding on ad buying.  Of course he is not buying ads; he has an entire section created within his Department to do that for him.  We were promised last year in the D&aacute;il that the market research commissioned to guide the new unit would be made available to us before the marketing campaigns were implemented.  This has not happened.  Can the Taoiseach explain why it has not happened?  Can he confirm that no campaign will be rolled out before the background documentation is made available for scrutiny?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600019#R02500","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517934900,"counter":285,"content":"<p>There are many priorities for the Taoiseach's Department in the coming year.  I would imagine that the publication of the national planning framework and, more significantly, its implementation are massively important.  My party has engaged very extensively with this process and we have made a number of detailed submissions.  We know it is important that we get this right.  We all want a thriving capital city in Dublin, where there are huge pressures on public services, housing, public transport, infrastructure and population growth.  We also need a release valve in different parts of the country and in the regional cities to ensure that we have significant population growth in areas outside Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  There are concerns about the plan.  We have an issue about the serious imbalance between the plans for urban and rural areas.  We also have significant concerns about its proposals for the north west and the vagueness of the North-South dimension.  Given the Brexit issue we discussed earlier, I imagine that an all-island and North-South impact and focus would need to be front and centre in any national planning framework.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the south east and my own constituency, there is hope for a very important project as part of the national planning framework.  That is the North Quays, where &euro;300 million of private sector investment is being put on the table and &euro;60 million to &euro;70 million of State funding is necessary to realise the project and get it over the line.  This is one of a number of projects which need to underpin any national planning framework if it is to be successful and if it is to be aligned with capital infrastructure.  Can the Taoiseach inform the House if plans and proposals like the North Quays project will feature and be properly funded so that we can actually allow those cities that will be identified as regional cities to grow their populations, provide leadership and provide the capacity that is necessary for the entire region and, in that case, the south east to grow and develop?  I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could give a response specifically on that issue but also more widely on the national planning framework and its impact on the entire island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600020#S00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1517934900,"counter":286,"content":"<p>There are many priorities one could talk about but I want to focus on one of them.  I believe the Cabinet is, sadly, 11 years on, still discussing the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I hear that we are close to the moment when the Government will ratify it.  While I hope that happens, I want to know what the Taoiseach intends to do to actually implement it and to ensure that people with disabilities receive the equality of treatment, support and services that they need to make the convention a reality.<\/p>  <p>  I will cite one example of what I mean.  We submitted a parliamentary question in the past week or two about waiting times for walk-in showers for elderly and disabled people in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Quite to our shock, we discovered the waiting time is 18 months.  Many of those people cannot be released from hospital and are blocking up beds because they cannot get a walk-in shower.  The waiting list for ramps is ten months.  People often cannot be released from hospital because of this and the council says it is because it has difficulty getting contractors to do the work.  They are absolutely unacceptable waiting times for people who really need things such as ramps, grab rails and showers in particular because of the difficulty getting contractors; in other words, the outsourcing process is preventing it.<\/p>  <p>  The obvious answer is to return to directly employing people in the maintenance departments of local authorities so they do not have to spend six or eight months trying to identify a contractor.  We would then have people employed by the local authorities directly to go out and install these things for people with disabilities and the elderly.  Would the Taoiseach consider that?  The unacceptable situation in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is almost certainly replicated right around the country and it is people with disabilities who are suffering the consequences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600020#S00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1517934900,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Beginning with the sectoral analyses with regard to Brexit, last week I listed the documents and studies that have been published already.

I think we will have a better idea in that regard in the next few weeks.  The most important thing and our priority at the moment is to ensure that there is a transition period so that we actually have time as individuals, as a Government and as businesses to prepare for any long-term permanent changes that may take place in the relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of my speech to the European Parliament, it very much reflected my own views on the future of Europe but was also in line with Government policy.

My speech to the European Parliament took place in Strasbourg on 17 January.  In my intervention, I spoke about the achievements of the European Union, the benefits for Ireland of EU membership, and my thoughts about how best the Union should evolve for the future.  I also spoke in some detail about the Brexit negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  I stressed the importance of our values - respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law &ndash; and the principles of solidarity, partnership and co-operation and how we need to keep these to the fore as we respond to the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.  I said that Europe needs a forward-looking agenda with ambition and direction.  Acknowledging the achievements of the European Union, we can lead the way with imagination, creativity, and courage and create opportunities for all our citizens.   <\/p>  <p>  Rather than looking for great institutional changes, we should focus on implementing what we have already agreed.  This should include completing the Single Market, the digital Single Market, the capital markets union and banking union with a view to delivering concrete benefits for our citizens in areas that directly affect their lives.  <\/p>  <p>  I stressed that the needs and expectations of our citizens must inform thinking about Europe's future and that a wide debate is therefore crucial.  I outlined Ireland's Citizens&rsquo; Dialogue on the Future of Europe, which I launched in Trinity College last November and which will run until 9 May, Europe Day.  Our aim with this is to facilitate an open and wide-ranging debate with our citizens which will help to inform our approach on a range of key issues. <\/p>  <p>  On Brexit, I highlighted the unique challenges this poses for Ireland and thanked the European Parliament for its strong support and solidarity in the negotiations to date.  I also stressed the need to ensure the commitments and principles agreed in December are translated into the withdrawal agreement.  I also noted our ambition for a close and comprehensive future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom.<\/p>  <p>  In their interventions, Members of the European Parliament reiterated their support for Ireland in respect of Brexit.  President Juncker's statement that we are all Irish was particularly welcome, as is the Commission&rsquo;s commitment to propose continued PEACE funding beyond 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the debate, I had a bilateral meeting in Strasbourg with the President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani.  I thanked him for his strong support with regard to Brexit.  We also exchanged views on the future of Europe and I expressed appreciation for his initiative in bringing forward the series of debates in the European Parliament.  I also had a bilateral meeting with the European Parliament&rsquo;s chief Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt.  We discussed developments since our last meeting in Dublin in September, and I expressed my sincere appreciation for his understanding and his commitment to ensuring that Ireland's unique concerns are addressed.  I also attended a lunch hosted by the first Vice-President of the Parliament, Mairead McGuinness, which was also attended by party group leaders and other MEPs. <\/p>  <p>  I met briefly and exchanged a few words with President Juncker and Michel Barnier, although I did not have a formal bilateral meeting with either.  I had a short bilateral meeting with Commission Vice-President Katainen in relation to Mercosur.  I emphasised our commitment to free trade generally but highlighted our strong concerns around the very sensitive beef sector and our views on what should and should not be included in any agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600021#T01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1517935500,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I find how the Taoiseach has articulated this to be extraordinary.  He said that he spoke on his thoughts about how Europe should evolve and on the future of Europe.  He said two or three times today that he did not share his speech to the European Parliament with any of his Cabinet colleagues.  I must remind him that the constitutional framework under which he has his position is far different to that of President Macron or indeed President Trump.  Those leaders are directly elected by the people.  The Taoiseach is not directly elected by the people.  Parliament elected him as Taoiseach and when he speaks to the European Parliament on the future of Europe he speaks as Head of the Irish Government, not in a personal capacity.  I find it extraordinary that he has presented a case today that, in speaking to the European Parliament, he was essentially speaking in a personal capacity.<\/p>  <p>  The future of Europe is not an issue of conscience.  It is an issue of substantive policy and it is extraordinary that in preparing a presentation to the European Parliament on a live debate on the future of Europe, he does not feel any necessity to convene a Cabinet sub-committee, which is specifically in place, on Europe.  He did not consult with his Cabinet colleagues or the Parliament here in terms of the future of Europe, including issues such as federalisation and a closer banking union or what will happen if there are further issues with banks concerning guarantees of deposits.  There is a whole range of issues out there.  Some of the European leaders are pushing for closer harmonisation and closer integration, while others are pursuing different agendas.  <\/p>  <p>  From the Taoiseach's perspective, only his personal thoughts were articulated.  That is an extraordinary take on the situation and in my view is an incorrect approach that is not in keeping with the constitutional framework governing the position he holds as Taoiseach of the country.  We function with collective responsibility in this Parliament.  He is a member of Government and he speaks on behalf of that Government.  He should not speak in a personal capacity on such a key issue, which involves all of our futures.  He committed to prior consultation with this Parliament prior to major European debates, and he did not do so on this occasion.  He might indicate the reason why that happened.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600021#T01400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1517935500,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I will focus on the Taoiseach's address in the European Parliament and the meetings he attended in Strasbourg and will turn to the theme of Brexit, which dominated and underpinned both of those events.

Mr. Barnier stated yesterday that Britain will face unavoidable barriers to trade if that happens.  The Taoiseach and I can agree that both of us want Britain and the North of Ireland to stay in the customs union and the Single Market.  We both desire that and notwithstanding any backstop agreement that might be in place, that is the best outcome for Ireland.  I appreciate there is a difficulty where there is a negotiation between Britain and all of the other member states while within Britain, the Tory Party is divided with different opinions held within it.  It is very difficult to know who has the upper hand and what exactly is happening and what exactly the British Government wants at any given time.<\/p>  <p>  Given those meetings, is the Taoiseach in a position to update the House on his assessment as to where Downing Street and the British Government stand on any trade deal that might emerge and on what are their intentions?

We cannot become collateral damage in any of that.  We cannot allow Ireland to become collateral damage in any of that.

In addition, a further peer review process of verification is under way in respect of these figures, as requested by the Policing Authority.<\/p>  <p>  I want to assure the House that the Policing Authority continues to monitor this issue to ensure there is independent scrutiny of how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na records data.

As the Minister said, not all of those cases will result in a conviction or indeed a prosecution in the first instance.  There is a serious problem with the classification of homicides on the PULSE system and my understanding is that a complete homicide review for the years 2003 to 2017 is required.  To date, such a review has not been completed.  What must occur is a full and accurate examination of the paper files in the State Pathologist's office on suspicious deaths for the years 2003 to 2017.  The information on those paper files must then be compared with the data on the Garda PULSE system and a review of the investigation files themselves must take place.<\/p>  <p>  I am not stating, as the Minister asserted earlier, that there have been cases of unlawful killing that have not been investigated.  My point is that we have had only a partial review to date.  The Minister talks about 41 homicide incidents for the years 2013 to 2015 but I understand that a quarter of such cases have been misclassified because they are referred to on PULSE as the result of sudden death with a failure to refer to the possibility they may have been caused by a violent act of another individual who is suspected.  PULSE may also fail to record that an assault resulted in a subsequent death.  Those are the factors which need to be investigated but no investigation has been properly completed to date.  I have continuing concerns that the review, which was started in 2016, has not been completed and I ask the Minister to take steps to ensure its completion because I do not believe the necessary urgency is there on the part of either the Garda or the Policing Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600023#V00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1517936700,"counter":346,"content":"<p>The possibility that homicides were misclassified is of itself worrying and deeply unsettling.

It raises the question as to why any inspector would want to apply for promotion to the position of superintendent if he or she is going to be paid less.  There is also a deficit in the new pay deal for the majority of superintendents in that, as they can now retire and claim their pension, they are faced with the dilemma that they have a permanent pension levy, and the absence of the pay deal applying to superintendents and chief superintendents means there is a significant risk they will retire early as a result of the failure to apply this precedent.<\/p>  <p>  This is a problem that needs to resolved promptly.

It is interesting to note that the Road Safety Authority, when it looked at road fatalities for the period 2008 to 2012, found that speeding was a contributory factor in 32% of road fatalities and alcohol in 38%.  These are clearly issues of enforcement in which an active Garda traffic corps continues to have a role to play, notwithstanding the improvements that were made last year.  In reply to a parliamentary question I tabled, the Minister reiterated that Templemore reopened in 2014 and that recruitment has been ongoing.  My specific concern is that he indicated that only 627 garda&iacute; were assigned to the unit in December 2017.  Back in 2014, when Templemore was reopening, there were 800 garda&iacute; in the traffic corps.

Deputy Daly is aware the Protected Disclosures Act came into operation on 15 July 2014.  A member of the Garda who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the legislation.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.  These supports are, therefore, available to any person in the Garda organisation who makes a protected disclosure.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has signed up to Transparency International Ireland's integrity at work initiative, which will involve external validation of these processes.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or under the 2016 Act they may opt to make a disclosure directly to GSOC, which is a prescribed body for receiving protected disclosures.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC, the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure.  It is also open to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make a protected disclosure to me as Minister, and I will consider it in the context of my Department's sectoral policy on protected disclosures. <\/p>  <p>  GSOC has a very important role in ensuring that public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is safeguarded, and it has extensive powers under the 2005 Act to enable it to carry out its responsibilities.  I assure the Deputy that resources and funding are kept under continuing review to ensure that GSOC is enabled to continue to operate effectively and efficiently and in accordance with its statutory remit.  In May 2017, sanction was given for an additional five staff to create a dedicated unit in GSOC to deal with protected disclosures.  It must be borne in mind that there were, at that time, a relatively small number of disclosures on hand in GSOC.  The sanction was provided on the clear understanding that GSOC would revert should the evolving situation indicate that greater resources were required.  It is unfortunate that, eight months later, it would appear that GSOC has not yet succeeded in recruiting all the staff who were sanctioned.  I am at one with the Deputy in my being keen to ensure there are available resources to allow GSOC conduct its statutory duties and obligations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600028#AA00700","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1517939700,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I am afraid the Minister and I are certainly not at one because he is satisfied and I am not, and I am not the only one who is not satisfied.

There is a very real reason for this, which is that their legitimate complaints which were handled through GSOC were, first of all, delayed in terms of non-co-operation by Garda authorities in getting the information to GSOC to allow it to investigate it.  When GSOC then recommended to Garda management that it would be involved in some of the disciplinary hearings on the outcome of some of those investigations, Garda management said \"No\", told it to butt out and said that it would not have anything to do with the investigation.  Critically, when Garda officials turned around and said they had not completed their own internal report, GSOC could not publish its report, with the result that a Garda whistleblower in the Minister's constituency, where Garda involvement in the drug trade has been proven not just in Athlone, but also in Laois with the re-emergence over the past weekend of drugs which had been lost six years ago coming back into the station, is out sick and on the floor without any support whatsoever.

I acknowledge a number of contributory factors in that regard, including the need for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to increase its recruitment abilities after a lengthy moratorium, the time required to vet persons comprehensively before they can be employed in the policing sector and the number of bodies, including the Policing Authority, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, involved in the sanctioning process for each post.

I wish to raise the matter of the ambulance response times in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  I must highlight a very harrowing case that actually happened to a family in County Monaghan.<\/p>  <p>  Last July, a young man of 44 years of age, who was a son, a father and a husband, suffered a cardiac arrest in Castleblayney, County Monaghan.  Luckily he was in company at the time and the 999 call was made.  People who were on the scene at the time carried out CPR on this man and the locals who made the 999 call stayed in constant contact with the ambulance service while they waited for an ambulance to arrive.  These people had the time both to get the defibrillator to perform the CPR and to make contact with the ambulance service and they waited and waited.  The ambulance had to come from Navan.  It was redirected to Dunshaughlin - this is all in County Meath as the Minister of State is aware - before it reached Ballybay, which is just outside Castleblayney, County Monaghan.  I understand there is an ambulance and an ambulance service based in Castleblayney, which is literally ten minutes from where the incident was happening.  In the end this gentleman was waiting for the ambulance to arrive for one hour and 15 minutes.  He was still alive and had a good strong pulse when the ambulance did arrive.  Unfortunately, when the gentleman was taken into the ambulance, he lost his life.  His mum and his family maintain to this day that had the ambulance response time been much quicker or had the doctor on call arrived on the scene, the outcome quite clearly could have been very different.  This man has left behind young children and a wife, his mum, dad, sisters and brothers, who are absolutely traumatised and heartbroken at this outcome.<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Minister of State that it is just not good enough in this day and age for anybody in such a critical condition to be obliged to wait that length of time for an ambulance.  Not only was the incident happening within ten minutes of Castleblayney, where there is an ambulance service to respond to such calls, they were another ten or 15 minutes away from Monaghan Hospital.  The ambulance that was dispatched was directed to Cavan General Hospital, which has an accident and emergency unit.  This response time is just not good enough.  In December we met representatives of the National Ambulance Service, NAS, to address these issues but I have a couple of questions to put to the Minister of State today.<\/p>  <p>  For this family, unfortunately, that is not where this issue finishes.  Another family member, who had been ill for many years, became critically ill just ten days after he had lost his son.  The ambulance was called again.  This man's wife, who is in her 70s and had just suffered the trauma of losing her son, had to call on the ambulance service again.  To not put a tooth in it, the ambulance got lost.  When the family rang the 999 number, they were told the ambulance was in Shercock, County Cavan, which is literally ten miles away or a ten-minute journey at most.  The ambulance got lost and when it did show up the family was told that it had no satnav and had been given no contact details as to where the 999 call had come from.  This gentleman had to wait one hour and 25 minutes, ten days after they had lost their son, having waited one hour and 15 minutes.  Thankfully, the outcome for this gentleman was much better and his life was saved.  He was brought to Cavan General Hospital.  That family are absolutely traumatised.  I put it to the Minister of State that this family are not the only ones in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan who are bewildered by the ambulance response times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600032#EE00400","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1517942100,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Smyth for the sincerity and appropriateness with which she has brought this issue to the House.  I extend my sincere sympathies to the family of that young gentleman and for the harrowing story and circumstances they endured.  I am very conscious that no mealy-mouthed words I will issue today with statistics or figures will go any way towards answering the what-ifs, the maybes and the buts the family has to live with every day of their lives.  Listening to me speak about the global macro picture, the response times in the Cavan-Monaghan area and what percentages of calls have been achieved satisfactorily and within an appropriate response time, will go nowhere towards solving the anguish of those people.  When we talk about ambulance response times, the reality is that we are talking about life and death.  We cannot afford to get them wrong.  I absolutely accept this from the outset.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Deputy to not assume this response is a defence; it is by way of background and explanation from the Department.  Ambulance response times are helpful for performance measurement, however, it should be recognised that sole reliance on response times does not provide a comprehensive picture of modern ambulance service performance.  Response times tell us how fast the service was provided rather than how well the patient was cared for.  Response time performance is being globally reviewed as to whether it is the only appropriate measure of pre-hospital patient care.  While rapid deployment and timely arrival is accepted as being necessary, patient outcome indicators are now being viewed as a more appropriate measure of patient care and experience.  The National Ambulance Service has developed a suite of key performance indicators to measure patient outcomes and experiences and these are currently being piloted to be included in the national service plan.<\/p>  <p>  That said, I am aware that the Delta response times in the north east have been below target.  I note, however, that Echo response times are on or above target in the period September to December 2017.  A number of developments have been made by the NAS in order to address the issue of response times.  I am also aware that in Border counties the NAS works closely with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to provide a more responsive service for patients.<\/p>  <p>  The capacity review published in 2016 identifies particular difficulties serving rural areas such as this region.  The capacity review indicated that the only practical way to improve first response times in rural areas is through voluntary community first responders, CFR, schemes.  The NAS continues to work with local CFR groups across the north east region to enhance services.  There are currently 25 CFR groups in the north-east region.<\/p>  <p>  I have also been advised by the NAS that it is improving regional coverage and deployment across rural areas including Cavan and Monaghan.  The National Ambulance Service is moving away from ambulance provision from fixed bases to dynamic deployment.  This means that resources can be used across a region so that if demand increases in one area, other resources can provide cover as required.  In addition, the National Ambulance Service has developed the intermediate care service to provide lower-acuity hospital transfers, which frees up emergency ambulances for the more urgent calls.  A permanent emergency aeromedical support service has also been established to provide a more timely response to persons in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  Over recent years, year on year, additional investment has been directed towards the National Ambulance Service.  This year, an additional sum of &euro;10.7 million has been made available, which includes &euro;2.8 million to fund new developments.  New developments include the development of alternative pathways to care, as well as the hear and treat clinical hub that is expected to go live soon in the national emergency operations centre.  This will divert some lower-acuity patients to alternative care pathways and will free up some emergency capacity.  In time it is hoped that such initiatives will help to improve response times around the country including in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  I assure Members that the National Ambulance Service is focused on improving ambulance response times throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate my earlier comments that I do not mean to be insincere by giving those facts and figures.  They do not do a service to the individuals involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600032#EE00500","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1517942100,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

I ask the Minister of State to bring back these specific questions to the Minister because the family deserves answers.  We have met with the National Ambulance Service and that is fine but the family wants answers from the Minister with responsibility.  Crucially, the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan is suffering.  The family wants to know why they had to wait one hour and 15 minutes for an ambulance service on that particular day for their son who lost his life.  They also want to know why, ten days later, they had to wait one hour and 25 minutes for the father.<\/p><p>Why was the advanced paramedic unit not sent to this emergency?  Why did the doctor on call not come that night?  I just do not think it is good enough for the National Ambulance Service to say, as it did in all sincerity at the meeting I mentioned, that the ambulance got lost, that no satnav was available in the vehicle and that it had no contact number for the family that made the original call.  If someone in my office did not take the particulars of a constituent who came in, I would be very upset and it could be a sacking offence.  This is a matter of life or death.  It is not good enough in this day and age for the National Ambulance Service to answer by saying the ambulance got lost, no satnav was in use and no contact number was available.  When an elderly gentlemen was in this scenario for a second time, the ambulance sat outside a local shop while the members of the crew blindly looked for directions to the house the call came from because they had no contact details.<\/p> <p> I have written to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Taoiseach about this issue.  The Minister kindly set up the meeting with the National Ambulance Service.  The Minister and the ambulance service gave a commitment that if the family did not feel the answers were good or focused enough, the members of the family would be able to sit down with the Minister, which is the least they deserve.  They want to be heard.  That is all they are asking for.  The Minister has written me to say that due to diary constraints, he cannot commit to a time now.  This family deserves to be heard.

It is not just a choice on our part - as public representatives we have a responsibility to ensure we get accountability for these failures in the systems.  There is a management structure in place within the National Ambulance Service at a macro level and at a local level.  There are operatives carrying out various duties.

This device, which allows blood glucose levels to be monitored without invasive finger-prick testing, is an absolute game-changer for anyone suffering with diabetes.  In some cases, patients have to test their glucose levels up to ten times a day.  This can be a real inconvenience and discomfort, especially for children.<\/p>  <p>  While we welcome the HSE's decision, we believe clarity is needed in respect of it.

Why is this group being excluded?<\/p>  <p>  Would it be possible for the Minister of State to clarify the specific criteria which must be satisfied, in line with the recommendations of the health technology assessment group, in order for reimbursements to be made in respect of children and teenagers with diabetes?

This is a huge cost for families with young children and for patients who are funding this themselves each week.  The sensors, which cost &euro;60 each, last for 14 days.

It was announced a few days later that FreeStyle Libre was to be included in the long-term illness scheme for adults and children.  This decision is to be welcomed.  I acknowledge that this is a positive development.  We are looking to see whether it can be extended to all sufferers of type 1 diabetes.  This would be massively important for them.  There is a great deal of concern and anxiety out there at the moment.  The people who are not included in the current arrangements have put together a campaign to try to impress on the Minister the importance of their case.

As the prevalence of diabetes increases, diabetes-related complications represent a growing global public health and health service challenge.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medical devices in the community drug schemes.  In February 2017, an application by the manufacturer was submitted to the primary care reimbursement service of the HSE for the reimbursement of the FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitoring system.  Glucose monitoring allows people to self-manage diabetes by making adjustments to their diet, lifestyle and treatment to reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications.  Current glucose monitoring methods include self-monitoring of blood glucose, which involves finger-prick blood glucose monitoring using testing strips and electronic glucose meters, as well as continuous glucose monitoring, which needs to be calibrated with a blood sample.<\/p>  <p>  The FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitoring system is intended to be used as an alternative to current methods for people who administer multiple daily injections of insulin.  This innovative technology allows glucose readings to be taken non-invasively and does not need to be calibrated with a blood sample.  The HSE health technology assessment group carried out an appraisal of the evidence submitted with this application.  An expert group under the auspices of the health technology assessment group considered the FreeStyle Libre application for addition to the reimbursement list in line with the 2013 Act.  The health technology assessment group recommended that reimbursement for the device should be considered subject to certain conditions.<\/p><p>The HSE has accepted its recommendations in principle and will be developing an application suite for hospital clinicians to use when proposing suitable patients for consideration of individual reimbursement support.  This will be confined to children and young adults who require multiple daily injections of insulin in the first instance, with a review after 12 months.<\/p> <p> The HSE has indicated that it will take some months to build the application suite for reimbursement support.  When the application suite is ready and in place, hospitals providing a diabetic clinic service will be able to apply for the device for children and young adults, in line with the recommendation of the health technology assessment group.  As patients receive approval on the application suite, pharmacies will be able to see their approval status and will be able to dispense to the patient under their long-term illness scheme eligibility.<\/p> <p> We have made huge strides in treating and managing diabetes and I am happy to welcome the HSE&rsquo;s decision to reimburse FreeStyle Libre, which will be welcome news for young people and their parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600033#FF00600","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517943300,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, there is no new information available here.

Most importantly, however, we only support it if it is undergrounded.  Shockingly, the Government plans to overground it.  Fine Gael and the Independents seek to construct 409 pylons, some of them up to 51 m high, carrying 400,000 V through Meath, Cavan, Monaghan, Armagh and Tyrone.  Some will be constructed at a minimum distance of 13 m from people's houses.  There are significant fears regarding threats to health as well as the value of homes, farms, and businesses.  Tourism, agriculture and the bloodstock industry will all be affected.<\/p>  <p>  The truth is that the technology the Government is seeking to build is becoming increasingly out of date.  It is being superseded by new underground technology that is being rolled out elsewhere in the world.  EirGrid itself has conceded that it can be done.  We also know that the price of undergrounding is falling all the time.  The fact is that EirGrid has pig-headedly forced through a particular version of the interconnector.  This has actually slowed down the delivery of the infrastructure.  It is ten years on the go and still without a shovel going into the ground.  <\/p>  <p>  There is another crisis arising.  EirGrid has stated that it has access to the land to build the pylons but, lo and behold, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has not approved access for EirGrid to the lands to build the pylons.  It is not included in the planning permission that has been received by EirGrid.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has not approved any one of the 584 access routes required on the lands.  That is very significant.  There are 400 landowners along the route of the interconnector, 97% of whom have said that EirGrid will not be allowed on the land.<\/p>  <p>  If EirGrid accessed the land without agreement of the farmer, it is my understanding that it would be breaching An Bord Plean&aacute;la's permission.  Is this something new?  Is the Minister aware of EirGrid breaching An Bord Plean&aacute;la's permissions before, in County Laois, for example?  What is to happen when EirGrid breaches these permissions?  Is the Minister going to stand idly by and allow that to happen?<\/p>  <p>  Legally, it is EirGrid's duty to get an agreement on an access route, which should be achieved between the farmer and the council.  Is this going to happen?  How is EirGrid going to gain access to the land if it does not have planning permission for access?  That is a serious conundrum that could leave the Minister, Deputy Naughten, with another massive problem within the space of a couple of weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Has the Government factored in the cost of dealing with this problem and has it factored in the cost of dealing with the lack of co-operation from farmers?  We hear from the Minister, Deputy Regina \"Che Guevara\" Doherty, that there is going to be potential for civil disobedience along the route and that she herself is going to take to the barricades and defend the farmers.  If she showed the same level of energy and enthusiasm defending farmers at the Cabinet table or in the D&aacute;il Chamber, we would all welcome it.  What is the Minister going to do if we get to this point?<\/p>  <p>  The farmers along the routes are decent, law-abiding people.  It is not in their wildest dreams to seek to come into conflict with the Government.  However, there is a danger that the Minister is sleepwalking into a Shell to Sea situation, except far worse; Shell to Sea was in a couple of townlands in one corner of one county.  This is going to happen along the whole route, in Meath, Cavan, Monaghan, Armagh and Tyrone.  How is EirGrid going to gain access to the land when it does not have permission to do so?

It is important to state at the outset that it is not part of the Government&rsquo;s remit to direct EirGrid in the development of energy infrastructure to particular sites, routes or technologies.  This policy was clearly expressed in the 2012 Government policy statement on the strategic importance of transmission and other energy infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  It is not \"my\" Government but our Government; it is a Government made up of representatives of this House.<\/p><p>The decisions that have been taken on this project were taken by previous governments, not this Government.  Of course, there was no Government in Northern Ireland to make a decision one way or the other.<br\/><br\/>On 21 December 2016 An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission for the North-South interconnector project in Ireland.  The decision concluded a lengthy planning process which included an oral hearing completed over 11 weeks from March to May 2016.<br\/><br\/>The planning process carried out by An Bord Plean&aacute;la heard from my Department that the North-South interconnector is a key project in delivering the objectives of national energy policy, specifically, security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability.  The interconnector will bring benefits directly to electricity consumers across the island of Ireland through lower prices as a result of more efficient operation of the all-island single electricity market.  It will also ensure a safe and sustainable source of energy for both jurisdictions. <br\/><br\/>All aspects of the project were evaluated, including the potential for undergrounding, and it was determined by the inspector that an overground option was the most appropriate solution.  This is dealt with in considerable detail in the inspector&rsquo;s report.  On 23 January 2018, full planning permission was granted for the section of the line that lies in Northern Ireland.  The Department of Infrastructure in Northern Ireland stated that the decision was based on the urgent and compelling need for the proposed development and was taken because the Department considered that it is in the public interest to take this decision without further delay given the strategic importance of the project for the region.<br\/><br\/> So, the statutorily-independent planning processes on both sides of the Border have determined that the proposed North-South interconnector should be developed as an overhead line, not as an underground line.  I fully accept the outcome of both planning processes.<br\/><br\/>The proposed interconnector had already been the subject of a variety of studies, all concluding that an overhead line is the best solution, both from a technical and cost perspective.  However, based on concerns expressed to me at meetings with various parliamentary colleagues and local community representatives and to address the main points of the motions passed in the Oireachtas in February and March 2017, I have commissioned two further independent studies into the project.  The first study is specifically examining the technical feasibility and cost of undergrounding the interconnector.  The second study, at the Deputy's request, is examining the levels of compensation provided to property owners in proximity to high-voltage transmission lines across Europe.  Both reports will be published this quarter, and people will have the opportunity to consider them in detail at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600034#GG00800","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517943900,"counter":462,"content":"<p>The Minister has studiously avoided answering my question.

Is the Minister going to tell us how exactly Eirgrid is going to gain access to build the North-South interconnector?<\/p>  <p>  Why should it not be the policy of the Government to direct that Eirgrid builds the interconnector underground?  If it is the policy of political parties, why is it not translated into Government policy when that party has its hands on the steering wheel?<\/p>  <p>  It is disingenuous to say that I asked for an investigation into the levels of compensation for families living along the curtilage of the North-South interconnector.

It is ten years since the development stopped.  Various procedures have been gone through in the meantime.  I have raised the matter in this House, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on a number of occasions.  I raised it in parliamentary questions and with Ministers.  I have also raised the issue with the local authority.  The position remains that the development, although in its final stages of inertia, is about to move on to the next stage, with a little bit of a push.  I wish to raise that crucial strategic movement tonight.<\/p>  <p>  If we count the amount of time and energy that has gone into evaluating the situation in Naas over the last number of years and put a cost on it it would be colossal.  The symbolic vision of the stalled cranes on the horizon will have been there for ten years now and will remain there unless something very serious is done to move the process on.  I know there is a process in place.  On the last occasion the arbitration system had been referred and deferred; after sitting for a year it adjourned for a year, which is an extraordinary situation.  At this stage I am asking the Minister of State if he can liaise with his colleague in the adjoining Department with a view to finding out exactly what is happening with the arbitration.  Nothing positive can happen unless the arbitration is dealt with.  There was only one arbitrator in the entire country.  That was supplemented by four or five others, to the best of my knowledge, but we have heard nothing about that particular process since.

This is our third or fourth time discussing it here so I know it is an issue that is very close to the Deputy's heart and that he raises it out of genuine interest.  I want to try to help as best as I possibly can, as does the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  We have been trying to get it resolved as best we can within our powers but that is not all in our gift.<\/p>  <p>  As indicated in earlier Topical Issue debates and replies to parliamentary questions on this issue, the management of the stalled town centre development in Naas is a matter for Kildare County Council in the first instance.  Furthermore, with processes under way involving both NAMA and arbitration, it would be improper for us, as Ministers, to get directly involved.<\/p>  <p>  I further point out that under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, both I and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, are specifically precluded from exercising any power or control regarding any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be involved, except in very specific and extreme circumstances, which do not appear to apply In this case.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I am advised that Kildare County Council has continued to make every effort to influence and encourage NAMA to offer the town centre site for sale as soon as possible and that a receiver has already been appointed for this purpose.  I understand people are interested in purchasing it.  I believe Deputy Durkan is aware of that and has been trying to work with people who could make something happen on that side also.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously outlined to the Deputy, and subject to a satisfactory planning approval, there is no impediment to accessing the site or to the appropriate development of the site.  Kildare County Council fully recognises the strategic importance of the site to the town of Naas and will continue to support and work in partnership with any stakeholders involved in the site.<\/p>  <p>  During the past two years, Kildare County Council has initiated and supported a number of projects with the strategic objective of ensuring that the social and economic development of Naas is protected and enhanced.  Our Department will stand full square behind it in that regard.  This work is underpinned by the work of the Naas roads and transport steering group, the URBACT group and the Naas regeneration group.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the Deputy is frustrated by the length of time it has taken to get this matter resolved but as I have outlined, the local authority is doing all it can within its available powers and the parameters of its role, while also recognising the relevant due processes that are required to be followed, with a view to seeing the sale of the site by means of the receivership process and its subsequent further development.<\/p>  <p>  I am hopeful that with the appointment of the receiver, the matter can be further advanced towards resolution with a view to facilitating the further development and completion of this strategic town centre site in Naas.  Our Department, and the Minister, Deputy Murphy, directly, have been in touch with the Department of Justice and Equality to try to move this on as quickly as possible and bring some pressure also.  We do not have any powers to get involved from a planning point of view but, as I said, Kildare County Council wants this to happen as well.

Earlier today I launched the Government's programme to commemorate the centenary of the introduction of voting rights for women in parliamentary elections.  The programme booklet reprints a remarkable piece of correspondence from Prime Minister Lloyd George to Countess Markievicz, which is now in the collection of the National Museum of Ireland.  The letter is a short, formal, three-sentence invitation to Countess Markievicz to attend the reopening of Parliament at Westminster.  It addresses the new MP as &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;.  The envelope has the original postal address of Dublin St. Patrick&rsquo;s, the constituency to which Countess Markievicz was elected, but it is overwritten and redirected to Holloway Prison in London.<\/p>  <p>  In those two small details we can detect the seismic changes in the political landscape of our world 100 years ago: a system which had just opened its doors to women&rsquo;s participation in political life but could not quite believe that the MP for Dublin St. Patrick&rsquo;s was not &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; but &ldquo;Madam&rdquo;, and that the self-same madam, instead of taking a seat in His Majesty&rsquo;s Parliament, was incarcerated in His Majesty&rsquo;s Prison Holloway as a result of her political activities in seeking an independent Irish republic.<\/p>  <p>  Those two joint but separate campaigns - the struggle for Irish freedom and the struggle for women&rsquo;s political rights - were core to Countess Markievicz&rsquo;s work.  The Representation of the People Act 1918, enacted on this very day 100 years ago, gave some women aged over 30 and all men over the age of 21 the right to vote for the first time.<\/p><p>This had the effect of tripling the size of the electorate, which no doubt had a significant impact on the subsequent election.  The Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act, passed in November 1918, further allowed women to stand for election on an equal footing with men for the first time.  While 17 women stood in the general election, only Countess Markievicz was elected.  In Ireland, Sinn F&eacute;in alone put forward women candidates, Countess Markievicz, who was victorious in the Dublin St. Patrick's constituency, and Winifred Carney, in Belfast Victoria.  Women would have to await passage of the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann) Act 1922 by the Third D&aacute;il for full and equal voting rights in time for the election to the Fourth D&aacute;il on 27 August 1923.  It is no consolation that women in the UK did not achieve an equal franchise until 1928.  Meanwhile, Countess Markievicz would become a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and our first female Cabinet Minister in 1919.  It would take 60 years before another woman sat at the Cabinet table in Government Buildings.<\/p> <p> The programme I announced today outlines some of the key commemorative events which will be held during the year, including exhibitions, celebrations, hedge schools, talks, stamps and seminars.  It will complement the Vot&aacute;il 100 commemorations organised by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The programme will be delivered by many partners, including our national cultural institutions, History Ireland, local authorities, trade unions and third-level institutions.  One highlight will be a pop-up museum named \"100 years of Women in Politics and Public Life\" looking at the key women who have contributed over the past 100 years to shaping the State, including the 114 women Deputies.  The exhibition, curated by historian Sin&eacute;ad McCoole, will be held in Dublin Castle from November and then travel to regional venues.<\/p> <p> Today we reflect on the significant contribution women have made to our country over the last century.  We also reflect, however, on the missed opportunities for women and society in the conservative State which came into being after independence.  We have made much progress in this House to provide equal opportunities for all but we still have a way to travel.  It is timely on the 100th anniversary of the extension of the franchise to women to redouble our efforts to provide those opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600036#JJ01200","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517945100,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister of State on the launch of her programme.  I sent my apologies as I could not attend due to commitments in the House.  It is wonderful to see a programme of events to commemorate women in all guises, particularly, given today's statements, in politics.<\/p>  <p>  The centenary of the extension of the right to vote to women is an important milestone.  It is important to celebrate it.  However, the struggle for equality continues.  Female political representation stands at 22% in the D&aacute;il and 30% in the Seanad.  While this is an historic high, it is far from a fair balance.  This inequality is reflected in board rooms, managerial positions and pay levels.  The 100th anniversary of the Representation of the People Act 1918 serves as a reminder of how far we have come and how far it remains for us to go.  The 1918 Act massively expanded voting rights by abolishing practically every property qualification for men and enfranchising women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications.  However, despite their war contribution, women were still not politically equal to men who could vote at 21 without property restrictions.  Full electoral equality was achieved in Ireland in 1922.  In a speech in the D&aacute;il on 2 March 1922, Constance Markievicz said women's suffrage was a matter of women voicing their opinions publicly in an ordinary and simple manner by registering the vote in the polling booth.  Countess Markievicz was the first ever female MP.  In December 1918, while still serving a prison sentence, she was elected to the House of Commons as a representative of Dublin's St. Patrick's division.  As an Irish republican, she chose not to take her seat.  Later, she served as Minister for Labour in the First D&aacute;il and was a founding member of Fianna F&aacute;il in 1926.  However, no other female Minister sat in Cabinet until 1979, when then Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, was appointed Minister for the Gaeltacht.  Only 19 women have ever been appointed to Cabinet.  Disappointingly, the number of women in the Cabinet was actually diluted by the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, on his appointment.<\/p>  <p>  The gap in representation continues in boardrooms.  Ireland's rate of female board membership currently stands at 16%.  The National Women's Council of Ireland has called for quotas to ensure fairer female representation in business.  Fianna F&aacute;il takes pride in its efforts to expand female participation in politics.  We have conducted systematic reviews and actions to boost the numbers going for office and internal party positions.  We are committed to addressing issues like the gender pay gap and the five \"Cs\" which impede female participation in politics and corporate boardrooms.  There are now more women in the Lower House of our national Parliament than ever.  Female Deputies have grown in number and are rarely lone voices in rooms full of men.  A diversity of opinion is needed on the political stage.  Women must have a voice in politics because their specific rights and interests will otherwise not be protected.  In all, 35 women were elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 2016 to take 22.3% of the seats contested and to comprise 22.2% of all Deputies.  That is a whopping 40% increase from the previous record of 25 women elected in 2011, comprising 15% of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann at the time.  Many observers have pointed to this rise as attributable directly to the introduction of gender quotas, which allow for a party's State funding to be cut by half unless 30% of its general election candidates are women.<\/p>  <p>  It is poignant that we celebrate this anniversary today when 25 of the country's 40 constituencies have at least one female representative in the national Parliament as opposed to 22 of the 43 in 2011.  A number of barriers continue to exist to the involvement of women in politics.  We often hear talk of the five \"Cs\" , namely, child care, cash, confidence, culture and candidate selection, in this context.  I compliment Professor Yvonne Galligan who was instrumental in providing and publishing our own gender equality action plan.  She helped the party to make huge strides in bringing women to the national stage, as well as on the local stage and within our smaller cumainn and CDCs nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600037#KK00200","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1517945100,"counter":482,"content":"<p>As a republican and a parliamentarian, I am particularly proud of Ireland's unmanageable revolutionaries.  These brave women from across the political and class divide fought fearlessly and furiously against a harsh and hateful patriarchal power.  They were pilloried, beaten and, worst of all for many, dismissed.  Sunday marked the 150th anniversary of the birth of Countess Markievicz.  She embodied the boldness of republican and socialist demands for a free and equal Ireland.  Constance threw off the &quot;old idea that a woman can only serve her nation through her home&quot; and challenged women across classes and generations to dedicate themselves to the cause of freedom and equality with a rallying cry that &quot;Now is the time, and on you the responsibility rests&quot;.  It is important to acknowledge the depth of opposition to women's suffrage to fully appreciate the demand the countess made of Irish women at that time.  In 1912, the deputy leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party told a deputation of Irish suffragettes:<\/p><blockquote>Women's suffrage will, I believe, be the ruin of our Western civilisation.  It will destroy the home, challenging the headship of man, laid down by God.<\/blockquote><p>Challenge the headship of man they most definitely did.  One hundred years ago today, the Representation of the People Act was passed and women over the age of 30 who met a property qualification were granted the vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600037#KK00300","speaker":"1302"}]
