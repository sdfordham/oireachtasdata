It might be useful in my statement to focus on what we regard as some medium-term budgetary priorities rather than on the pre-budget activity for budget 2018.  To kick off, I will share some reflections from the business community on the state of the economy, the impact of some of the challenges we are seeing from Brexit and from policy reform in the US and our assessment of the economic context for budgets over the coming years.<\/p> <p>  It is fair to say the economy is now facing very significant challenges.  It is also very positive that we are coming into this period of challenge on a very strong footing.  Despite the challenges we have all had in terms of assessing the GDP metrics of the past couple of years - and, clearly, there has been a lot of volatility within those GDP metrics - the core indicators of the economy, such as domestic demand and, crucially, employment, remain incredibly strong.  During the course of 2016, employment growth accelerated again.  The labour market is probably the single best indicator of what is happening out there in the real economy.  It is in great shape.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the risks of Brexit, for many firms, it has already impacted on their businesses.  We have probably seen the impact most clearly in two sectors of the economy.  The first is our food and drinks industry.  Since June 2016 we have seen double-digit year-on-year monthly declines in the value of our food exports.  That is already happening and we have considerable pressure within our food industry.  The other area where we have already seen the immediate impact of Brexit is in our retail sector.  The core fundamentals of the economy - earnings, the absence of inflation, and strong wage growth are all incredibly strong.  That is not translating to the expected buoyancy in the retail sector at present.  In the course of last year, we saw that after the vote, the growth in retail spending started to slow quite significantly.  We have been seeing much more activity in cross-Border shopping and we have also been seeing more retail activity going online.  They are the two sectors where we see risks.  Notwithstanding that, other sectors of the economy will be stronger this year and they will compensate for some of the weaknesses.  In Brexit-affected sectors, particularly construction, we will see a notable increase in activity this year.  We will see it in housing completions and other elements of construction.  Our overall assessment from a budgetary perspective is that we will still have very favourable economic fundamentals and strong GDP growth.  We do not see any significant risks to the short-term budgetary outlook.  That is our assessment.<\/p> <p>  I will talk a little about what we regard, from a business community perspective, as the most pressing medium-term reform priorities which we would like to see reflected in budgets over a number of years.  We have two main issues we would like to highlight.  One is our wider investment agenda; the other is personal taxation reform.  The business community believes the investment agenda is the single most significant challenge facing the country from both a business and socioeconomic and quality of life perspective.  Right now, Ireland has the lowest level of public capital investment of any country in the EU.  It is under 2% while the European average is around 3%.  In addition to that, we have the fastest growing population and we are most likely to have the fastest growing population for decades to come.  In many ways that creates the perfect storm in terms of the pressure on our infrastructure system and what has up until now been an inability to address that.  That is already evident in terms of housing shortages.  Increasingly, the 3% growth rate in the number of people at work is very evident in the return of congestion we are seeing in our major cities.  We must also remember that when we had the money the last time around in the Celtic tiger period, we did not finish the job in terms of a national infrastructure provision in a whole range of areas from education to health and housing.  In terms of transport, we did not connect all of the regions to Dublin.  The north west, in particular, remains a significant black spot in terms of road connectivity and, crucially, we did not connect the regions to each other.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the big challenges on the medium-term horizon as we try to address the national planning framework and the vision for the country out to 2040, one of the key things we will have to grasp is that almost 50% of our economic activity is happening in the Dublin region.  We had previously put our own estimates on this but last week in the documents published by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, 49% was the figure put on it.  This is clearly unsustainable going forward.  It is sub-optimal for Dublin and for the rest of the regions.  IBEC, as a national organisation, really wants to see a much better spatial distribution of that economic activity across the regions.  The best way to do that is to have a long-term vision that creates the framework through which we can achieve that and, crucially, to have the medium-term budgetary framework underpinned by capital investment plans that will deliver the infrastructure in the regions in order to spread the economic activity.  Without that infrastructure investment and provision, we will continue to see Dublin over-congested and we will continue to see the regions lagging behind.<\/p> <p>  We have a particular interest in the all-island economy.  For over 20 years, IBEC has been involved on a joint business council with our sister organisation, the CBI in Northern Ireland.  As members can imagine, the level of activity through that joint business council has scaled up significantly over the past year with the prospect of Brexit.  We have shared the connected report with the committee.  What we are trying to focus on is what an all-island investment plan might look like and to try to further develop that all-island economy, particularly in the context of the demographic ambition we see for the all-island economy.  We think there will be a population of 10 million people on the island by 2050.  Right now Ireland is the only country in the world that has a smaller population than it had 180 or 190 years ago.  The potential for population growth is very significant.  It is really important.  In the context of that national planning framework, we take that long-term strategic view.  Crucially, we take an all-island perspective on the investment needs of the economy.<\/p> <p>  I will make a number of other points and then I will be happy to take questions and comments from the committee.<\/p><p> In terms of the limits and why we have not achieved investment spending, we think that the appropriate level of public capital investment should be 4% for the economy.  Ireland is currently below 2% and the European average is 3%.  There are two significant limiters.  The first one is the European fiscal rules.  They do not give sufficient recognition to Ireland's demographic growth as the fastest growing population in Europe.  Ireland also comes from a weak starting point in terms of the stock of our existing infrastructure.<\/p><p> We think the fiscal rules make sense in terms of managing the day-to-day expenditure of the State.  They do not incentivise a government that wants to prioritise the tough growth and prosperity enhancing medium-term issues of infrastructural investment, education and innovation.  They are the three components of our spending that will make a difference in the long term to the overall productive economic capacity of the State and, ultimately, the quality of life and prosperity of people.  We call on the committee's support to challenge these fiscal rules.  We think they are overly restrictive and that they put an unnecessary constraint on our ambition in terms of investment spending.  We have the cheapest money in history that we are not accessing because of the constraints of the fiscal rules.<\/p><p> The other arbitrary constraint on our investment spending ambition is the limit on public private partnerships within the capital investment plan.  Again, this is a self-imposed limit by Government.  We think it is an arbitrary cap.  It prevents private sector money from investing in public capital projects, particularly in the context of the opportunities that we now have with the more active role being played by the European Investment Bank in terms of having a presence in Ireland.  Hopefully, we will have a public finance environment that can co-finance projects.  We need to ensure that we give an opportunity to private money and seeks project investment opportunities.  Unfortunately, the current PPP framework does not enable such activity, which we think is a significant issue.<\/p><p> I will make a few final comments on medium-term taxation issues before handing over to the Chairman and committee for comments and questions.  In addition to the infrastructure issue, the taxation reform priority is a significant medium-term budgetary issue that needs to be examined.  It has come into sharp focus with Brexit.  From a labour market and skills perspective, Ireland is uncompetitive when compared to the US, the UK and many other European countries in terms of the effective tax rate that high skilled workers must pay in the Irish economy.  We have one of the lowest entry points to the top rate of tax in the developed world.  I refer to &euro;33,000 below average earnings, which has a high top rate of tax.  For high skilled workers, that gives us a very uncompetitive personal tax rate.<\/p><p> In the context of opportunities that might arise from Brexit, we know from everyday feedback from our members and businesses that prospective employees turn down jobs because of the rate of tax they would have to pay if they moved to Dublin.  That situation is a significant challenge.  When one compares the average personal tax system in this country with international metrics one discovers that it is not a high tax system on average.  The amount of personal tax paid in Ireland is not particularly high compared with other countries.  When one considers at how early income earners are hit with a penal tax rate of over 50% then Ireland stands out.  This fact has become an issue in terms of attracting and retaining skills but also in terms of incentivising people to work overtime, accept promotions and competing with the social welfare system.  In the context of a very tight labour market the personal tax system in Ireland is a significant issue.<\/p><p> I have outlined two medium-term issues.  We ask the committee for its input, feedback and, ultimately, support in terms of how we can progress that through a medium-term approach to budgetary decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486562400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien for his interesting presentation.

I must leave shortly to ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport a question in the House.  I am particularly interested in IBEC's document entitled Connected: A prosperous island of 10 million.  I attended the launch of the national planning framework that took place in Maynooth last week.  Mr. O'Brien is right that we should use this opportunity to rethink our capital spend, increase it and invest in long-term infrastructural projects that will overcome visible bottlenecks.  I also agree with his assessment that we must balance the development that takes place outside of Dublin with what happens in Dublin for its sake as well as that of the rest of the country while keeping the energy of Dublin.  The city of Dublin must compete with other international capital so investment is not an either-or matter.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned, having read the report, that IBEC seems to be going towards seeking almost 1,500 km of new motorway or an advanced upgrade of dual carriageway.  Cities are where economic development has occurred.  It seems to me that such economic development has occurred where life has been brought back to the centre of cities.  That is where we have a real problem.  Cork city has been hollowed out in the past 20 to 30 years.  Galway city is a disaster in planning terms.  Everyone that I have talked to in Galway has told me that new roads will not solve the problem but we are going to spend &euro;600 million on another ring-road.  Galway has suffered from bad planning and needs urban public transport to address the problem.  I am concerned that IBEC's network version for the future it is all motorways and dual carriageways.  I do not think that we can afford such motorways and dual carriageways and the necessary investment in public transport in the cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Dublin for two reasons.  First, the budget is low.  Second, what has characterised our development in the past 20 or 30 years is this incredible doughnutting because everyone lives 20, 30 or 40 miles away from our cities and has to try to drive back into the cities.  No matter how many motorways and dual carriageways are built the system will not work.  As we have seen in Dublin, those cars will eventually arrive at the M50, which will be clogged as sure as eggs are eggs.  That is the biggest threat to our long-term viability.  People refuse to travel to Dublin because they know the city is a transport disaster.<\/p> <p>  Why does IBEC not champion investment in public transport as a critical economic investment?  Why does IBEC talk about motorways and advances in dual carriageways but does not recommend a light rail system for Cork or using the existing rail lines in Limerick and Galway?  We should aim to develop the centre of those cities and encourage people to live there.  We should not have an ever extending commute that has characterised this country for the past 50 years.  If we do not make that fundamental shift no amount of financial investment will work.  Instead, we will become uncompetitive and people will have a lousy quality of life.  Why is IBEC obsessed with motorways and roads but not with public transport?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#E00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486562400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The document we have presented today is only an element of our policy priorities around the all-island economy and the road investment for same.  We see this year's mid-term review of the capital investment plan as an opportunity to put forward priorities on a much broader range of issues.  As part of that we have lots to say about light rail and public transport.  That investment is needed.<\/p> <p>  I share the vast majority of the views expressed by the Deputy.  In many ways, we have tried to deliver the 20th century solutions that were never finished in terms of the needs of the economy.  We also need to get on and address the 21st century solutions in terms of how we develop our cities, have smarter cities and have integrated public transport.  We did not finish the job in terms of the basics of road infrastructure, which must be addressed.  It is not the only part of the solution but it plays an important role.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider the quality of road infrastructure between our second and third cities of Cork and Galway.  Most European countries had reached that standard in the post-war era and maybe beforehand.  The infrastructure is simply not fit for purpose.  If one considers the road connectivity to the north west one will realise that it is simply not fit for purpose.  If one considers the dynamic that we created with the last capital investment plan before the crash, in terms of all of the roads and motorways leading to Dublin, we think that has been a significant contribution to the current spatial imbalance.<\/p><p> I agree with the Deputy about an investment plan.  We will be putting those views forward in our mid-term review of the capital plan.  It needs to be much broader than roads.  We will have lots to say about those.  In the context of finishing a road plan that was started when we had money in the 1990s, this is still the priority and needs to be finished.  We need at the same time to move on with public transport and the more sustainable development of our cities.  The UK has been effective in generating strong debate about its northern powerhouse.  If we are serious about having a counterbalance to Dublin and an Atlantic corridor effect, that has to be underpinned by road development that will be of the 20th century standard that is not there now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486562400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>In Mr. O'Brien's city of Kilkenny, the historic city is being knocked down in order to put roads in place.

I am shocked that IBEC thinks that the approach it has to take now is to stick in the 20th century for another ten or 20 years and then we will get into the 21st century.<\/p> <p>  Our competitor cities are moving in the direction of smart travel and away from the use of cars towards not just public transport but also walking, cycling, pedestrianisation and public spaces.  That will not come cheap.  If IBEC keeps us stuck in the 20th century for another ten or 20 years, we will arrive 20 or 30 years late with cities that will not work.  If those cities do not work, our economy will not work.  That is the priority.  Mr. O'Brien says that the priority is more motorways and interconnected highways.  It is not, it is making our cities work.  I was involved in the planning of the M50 but not another single car can be put onto it.  There is no extra capacity.  The problem cannot be solved by more traffic coming in on more roads.  It is the same in Cork, Galway, Limerick or Waterford, but Mr. O'Brien says we have to go the road route.

We deal with businesses in the west, the south west and north west, and the south east.  There are some good motorways into the south east but the latter is not connected to the south west.  The regions are not connected to each other.  Every time we ask our members in those regions to name their number one issue they will talk about access, infrastructure and skills.  IDA Ireland does great work to promote the regions.  Without a quality infrastructure, that has to start with the basics of a quality road network, supported by public transport, those regions will not prosper and we will not get a redistribution of the excessive amounts of economic activity that is happening in and around the M50.

He referred to the fiscal rules and the fact that Ireland is locked out of them by the way that Mr. Juncker has chosen to put out potential investment packages, which are heavily dependent on large-scale private operators being able to take up those opportunities.  Ireland does not have the scale that appears to be required.  The Minister for Finance has referred to some changes that may be of benefit but through IBEC's international contacts, how would Mr. O'Brien see us changing the fiscal rules to our advantage?  What would he prioritise?  Does he have any example of other countries that have been capable of doing that while perhaps also having experienced difficulties during the economic crash?<\/p> <p>  I find the revised Estimate presented recently for the children's hospital really shocking.  As a committee with responsibility for budgetary oversight, we have not yet received any detailed analysis and I do not think anybody has, apart from a reference to construction inflation.  I think this is at the heart of some of the difficulties relating to construction in Ireland.  I am very scared that we are again on the road down which we went in the 2000s, when the Celtic tiger period was at its height and when construction companies felt they could ask what they liked.  As we are hostage to them, there is very little that can be done.  We constantly hear stories of overpriced and poorly-built houses and apartments that people mortgage their lives for.  These cases emerge regularly.  I am concerned that the old practice of having a contract figure but then using the courts on every occasion, or some other form of arbitration, to up the subsequent price is now returning to our construction system.  It makes public financing extremely difficult because while there may be sub-contractors possibly sharpening their price offers, they will then to through the back door going to arbitration or the courts for anything and everything.  There was a long delay regarding the Dublin Institute of Technology as a result of contract issues.  That was a very large contract for a very large company that resulted in a long delay.  I am really concerned that the children's hospital will face into the same process.  Does Mr. O'Brien have any insight to offer on that matter? <\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien dealt extensively with skills training in his presentation, upgrading for people in the workforce.  I say this on the day when we have heard very sad news about Hewlett Packard, with 500 jobs lost.  Do the witnesses have a view?  Some of those people are very highly trained.  I assume they may get other job offers elsewhere but the people in Leixlip are in a deep shock about what has happened. <\/p> <p>  In Germany and Austria, employers buy into the concept of apprenticeship.  What would it take to get similar buy-in from Irish employers to go after apprenticeships for the 30% or 40% of secondary school students who may not initially want to, or be interested in, going to college but who would love an apprenticeship?<\/p> <p>  Why are there almost no girls taking up apprenticeships?  Does IBEC have any proposals on that?  Is Mr. O'Brien aware of employers that would be willing to give more women an opportunity?  Does he have a view of what role is available or possible for the public service, which is a major employer, to offer work experience and apprenticeship and traineeship-type programmes in conjunction with the various structures we have developed to ensure that as far as possible everybody gets a chance to gain work experience and qualifications?  Maybe they can do a traineeship followed by an apprenticeship and, as happens in Germany and Austria, if the person wants to go further academically he or she can do that.  Employers are key to this.  Does IBEC have any proposals on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#F00400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486562400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The reason the fiscal rules do not work for us is that we came into them at the very bottom.<\/p><p>Fiscal rules, basically, are about the treatment of how much one can grow the capital expenditure rather than about the size of the capital expenditure in the first place.  We came into it at the very bottom of the downswing in terms of capital expenditure.  The second reason is around the way the rules treat investment, which is pretty much the same way they treat current spending.  There are some differences such as they allow for the amortisation of capital spending over four years.  For any household buying a mortgage that would not make sense.  Businesses that invest in capital would depreciate it over the lifetime of the asset.  The fiscal rules treat it as a four year depreciation period which means that the cost of capital is upfront rather than over the period.<\/p><p> The reality from a State financing perspective is that the cost to the State of capital, if it is debt financed, is the interest on the debt taken on, and some of the capital costs over time.  We do not do that and we do not treat it, in its net present value, as a separate entity compared to current spending.  As a result, in effect one has projects that would make sense over a 30 year period.  With regard to projects such as social housing or retrofitting of buildings it is cheaper for the State to pay for rent allowance under the fiscal rules in the short term.  As we all know, governments have short life spans and in many cases politicians have short career spans so it is very hard to get people to buy into it, but not in all cases.  It is very hard to get people to buy into spending their fiscal space on something that may not have an effect in the very short run.<\/p><p> The other issue is-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486562400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Can I ask Mr. Brady if it is open to us to interpret the rules in a more flexible way now that Ireland is out of the period when the troika had a lot of control over our affairs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#G00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486562400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Some flexibility has been brought into them over the last couple of years but there is not a huge amount of flexibility on the investment side.

This means we may have some flexibility over the coming years.  We are coming out of a certain period of the expenditure rule, which governs the overall fiscal framework, and into a new one and this means we will have a little bit more space for capital spending over the coming years.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Burton asked if there were other examples of countries that have fiscal rules that work.  The UK is a good example.  It had a golden fiscal rule for a target for investment as a percentage of GDP and it treated investment and current spending differently.  It had that rule for around 15 years under the Labour Government.  It worked very well.  In a European sense, we would look for an extension of that depreciation period of capital and more flexibility around the size of projects before private financing can work under the fiscal rules.  The debt rule is there so if these things happen it does not mean that states are suddenly going to build up a huge amount of debt.  The debt rule would still be in place to take care of that and there is still a brake on it.  It does not make sense to us that Ireland has a planned current surplus this year of &euro;2 billion.  Half our capital programme is being paid for from savings at a time when interest rates are at record lows in the history of interest rates - as Mr. O'Brien said in his opening statement.

Attention has been drawn to the lack of skilled labour in the sector, which will eventually push up the costs.  Labour is a large part of costs for any construction project and if there is a lack of skilled workers it will have an effect.

This is something that the EU can really mobilise around in a commitment to deliver better quality of life, prospects, and long-term economic prosperity for its citizens.  We are trying to create that sense of ambition through our business community links.  This is why investment in roads and other projects is so important in how it crystallises some of that vision for the future of the State.  We are trying to have that conversation in Europe.  Many EU policy makers are very entrenched and deeply conservative in some of their fiscal thinking.  We are trying to make the argument for differentiation between day-to-day discipline and the investment agenda.  We are getting a lot of support.<\/p> <p>  I shall share some observations on the children's hospital project from what we see in the construction industry, which has clearly been significantly depleted during the downturn years.  It appears to us that if a more certain medium-term outlook is created for the projects that Ireland plans to undertake, and if we give more advance notice of the scale of proposed construction activity within the economy, then we will create more competition.  Ireland does not have a good pipeline of projects and therefore we do not get some of the international players active in the local market and we do not get some of the indigenous companies scaling up their capacity.  If Ireland could create more certainty around the future investment needs and plans and more clarity on the pipeline of projects that will be undertaken in the medium-term, it would enhance the capacity of the construction sector.  It would ultimately lead to better quality, competition and value for money for the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, the planning system is also an issue.  Planning delays add a lot onto construction costs.  Policy certainty and efficiency in planning decisions can have a big impact on the final costs of projects.  Ireland does not have a good track record in this regard.  In some cases it has not been good on project deliverability, on policy certainty or on a planning and administrative system that can allow for smooth and quick delivery of projects.  There are a lot of obstacles that developers, project financiers and the construction sector must deal with in delivery projects.<\/p> <p>  On the skills shortages, the Deputies will know from their time in engaging with us on apprenticeship schemes that the business community and IBEC members really want to see this new initiative succeed.  There is a lot of passion right through our industry groups and trade associations for this measure, as seen in the initial round of proposals.  There are frustrations that it is not happening quicker and that accreditation for the new apprenticeships is not coming through as quickly as it should.  In some cases we will also need to have sufficient resources allocated.  Having seen the initial bids that were successful in phase 1, and which will hopefully be earmarked for further phases, our sense is that at the industry and trade association level - be it in medical technology, in finance or in retail -  there is a lot of ambition to make this new apprenticeship model work.  There is demand coming through from businesses.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Burton raised the gender issue.  A lot of businesses in technical, software or engineering sectors that were traditionally male dominated are increasingly conscious of this issue and are well organised in their networks in promoting policies to get a better gender balance in some of those sectors.  Hopefully some of the learning, especially from the technology industry that has done a lot of work in this space, could also be fed into some of what we are trying to do through the apprenticeships, particularly in roles that traditionally would have been dominated by males.<\/p> <p>  The committee asked about the public sector and what role it could play around experience for job seekers, internships or apprenticeships.  It is a crucial employer in the State.<\/p><p>One of our experiences in IBEC was we facilitated an exchange programme between the private and public sectors.  We got a lot of interest in the private sector.

A look around IBEC's membership will show that such persons are key SME founders.  The Government places significant focus on regional and rural development but I do not see that happening unless there is more upskilling and more apprenticeships.  Micro-enterprises can start off as a one, two or three-person outfit and then can scale up at a local level provided they have reasonable access to credit.<\/p> <p>  Is there one thing IBEC would suggest to us as a committee?

We saw the commitment in last year's budget to a funding model for higher education.  The national training levy has to be part of that.

On her point about apprenticeship, is there a role for politicians or Government?  The perception that exists in this country for those who are leaving second level, and for their families even more so, is that one has to go to third level and if one does not go to third level, one is a failure.  We ourselves created that perception, possibly in coming from a position where so few of our parent's generation went to third level.  It has created an industry of courses, as I stated previously.  There are courses, which I will not name on this occasion, in third level institutions in this country that provide no prospects for students and yet students leaving second level every year take them up, and we have those real problems that Deputy Burton raised, in particular, in the hospitality sector.<\/p> <p>  I deal with a language school in Kilkenny that brings students from Germany and Austria and places them in businesses to learn English and the last two students who came to me were Austrian.  These 19 year old students had a full-scale debate with me on how negatively they perceived corporation tax rates in Ireland.  Both of these guys were doing apprenticeships in office management, not going to third level.  How do we change the perception that exists, whether we like it or not, that unless one goes into third level on leaving secondary school, one has failed?  Does Mr. O'Brien have any advice?

We need to continue to showcase those success stories and showcase what is achievable through apprenticeship programmes.  That will take time.  It may be as much a communication, branding and awareness challenge.  On a number of occasions, we have raised the particular challenges of the lack of sufficient career guidance in second level education.  During the crisis years, one of the issues that affected the quality of decision making from school leavers was that we had poor career guidance.  Even before the crisis, we probably did not have a sufficiently good model either.  We should address the resourcing of career guidance and ensure that we are prioritising the branding, the case studies and the experience sharing of what is coming through the new apprenticeship models.

The first of these is the need to challenge the fiscal rules in the area of investment.  I suppose related to that is the good, simple and straightforward idea of a target percentage of GDP for capital investment.  Frankly, the latter is something the committee should push.  If one does not, as IBEC has highlighted well, with a growing population and a significant investment infrastructure deficit we will encounter serious problems.  We are encountering such problems and they will get worse.  I very much welcome that and agree with IBEC.<\/p> <p>  I also welcome and agree with the strong emphasis IBEC placed on social housing in its document and the need to significantly ramp up investment in that and look for a derogation on the fiscal rules, if I understood IBEC correctly.  In that regard, does IBEC also think that the state aid rules are a problem for us in ramping up investment?<\/p><p>I firmly believe they are holding us back from being able to invest in a number of areas, including social housing and forestry, the potential of which I think we need to discuss further.  Maybe the witnesses will comment on that.<\/p><p> Do the witnesses think there is a bit of alarmism going on with regard to Brexit, which everybody is talking about?  Frankly, we do not really know what it is yet.  I heard Donal O'Donovan, who is not exactly on my side of the political spectrum, correctly saying at the weekend that when the dust settles from all the political hyperbole, rhetoric and position-taking, things will settle down when it is seen that it is not really in any anybody's interests in Europe, Britain or elsewhere to create too much friction between the economies.  Regardless of what we might think about the nasty racist ideas of UKIP and Theresa May, etc., the real economic imperatives and connections will assert themselves as the need for less friction becomes evident.  It is already evident here between the North and the South and between this country and Britain.  Nobody here thinks the discordant approach makes any sense.  Do the witnesses agree that things might settle down in this respect?  Many of the negative impacts we are already feeling relate to currency fluctuations.  What is the view of the witnesses in that regard?  My feeling is that the problems in this regard will settle down too.  It is even possible that when things settle down, the English currency might increase significantly in value again.  I think it will.

I would be interested to hear the witnesses' take on that.  Some of us have been saying for a long time that this country's economic model has a significant overreliance on foreign direct investment.  The dangers of that have been highlighted in a very strong way in the context of the Brexit debate.  We can see it again today with the Hewlett-Packard announcement.  We need to be talking about much greater diversification of the economy and the development of a diverse indigenous industrial base.  Will the witnesses comment on that?<\/p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses' general commitment to social housing.  I agree with them that the voluntary housing bodies do not really have the capacity to deliver the scale of social housing that is required.  This is a big weakness in the Government's proposal but why do they believe we are similarly unable to rely on the local authorities?  They spoke about a different model.  I remind them that the most successful period of social housing construction in this country was delivered by local authorities.  That was when it worked.  Obviously, there are problems such as the running down of capacity, but I think they could be reversed.<\/p> <p>  I strongly disagree with the witnesses on the education front.  Given the importance of generally upskilling and encouraging people into education, why on earth does IBEC support the introduction of fees and loans?  I think it is bonkers.  That is my serious opinion.  It will certainly limit access to education for some people.  It will be a disincentive for people.  It will leave a massive financial overhang for people.

We have already spoken about the need for infrastructure.  The other crisis in our economy is the lack of spending in education, particularly in higher education, which was a real victim of the downturn.  We are asking the higher education sector to do more and more in terms of volume, activity and expectations, but we are not resourcing it.  It is clear that despite the vagaries of the international rankings, our universities are not performing at the level that is needed.  That there are three Scottish universities in the global top 100, versus the situation in Ireland, gives us an indication of how far behind we are and where we need to be.<\/p> <p>  I will explain why we favour the fees and loan model.  We have the fees right now.  The fees are the registration charges that people have to pay to go to university.  We do not have any support framework around those fees.  We think the solution to the higher education resourcing problem should have a number of parts.  The State will need to pay more.  Employers are happy to have a conversation about how they can contribute to the cost of higher education.  We spoke about the reform of the national training fund that is needed.  If we are serious about getting enough resources into higher education, we need a proper fees model.  I would respond to the Deputy's concerns about access by saying that if the model I have mentioned is accompanied by a sufficiently robust system of loans, access difficulties should be no worse than they are now and most likely will be better than they are now.  We currently have fees without a proper loan model.  We would favour a proper loan model supporting a sustainable fee structure in the future.  At the same time, the State should be spending more money on higher education and employers should be coming to the table to make a contribution.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about investment.  I would like to share with the committee a statistic that relates to the 4% target.  We have seen public debate in recent weeks about the allocation of an extra &euro;2.6 billion under the mid-term review of the capital plan.  An extra &euro;6.5 billion will have to be spent if we are to reach the 4% investment target by 2020.  We are a long way short of that target, even with the potential additional commitments in the mid-term review.

While we have been here before with regard to currency, this time is different and we are seeing much more significant impacts because people are expecting a permanent change in the trading relationship.  The problems caused by the supply-chain reaction of the currency have been more significant than the problems we would have seen if the currency was the only issue.  People are changing where they are sourcing their products from.  That is definitely happening in a way that is not justified by the currency alone.  I agree with the Deputy that the trading relationships between Europe and the UK will be put back together when the dust settles in the long term.  Our big concern relates to the impact on our economy of the kind of dislocation we will see in the interim.  We could well go over the edge of the cliff because of a failure to reach transitional agreements.  The mutual interests of the big European trading blocs and the UK might well mean that the pieces get put back together over time, but we could have a lot of carnage along the way.  Our main concern is that Ireland could be in the firing line when that carnage happens.  The current arrangements might get put back together, but not before we get a lot of economic pain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1486562400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>\"Carnage\" is Mr. Trump's word.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#J01000","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486562400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>It is a Trumpism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#J01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1486562400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>We have not mentioned that gentleman's name up to now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#J01200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486562400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Mr. Brady will answer the questions that were asked about social housing and the enterprise model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486562400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that state aid difficulties will become more acute because of Brexit.  When the UK is outside the EU, it will not be subject to state aid rules.  It is already coming after some of our indigenous enterprise base with offers of state aid and it will continue to do so.  At the moment, the EU's state aid rules confine such aid to rescue and restructuring.

There was no social welfare system, education system or health system that was being funded primarily by the State.  The State had more space to be able to spend on social housing.  Under the current fiscal rules and because of the level of retirements in particular and loss of capacity in the social housing sections of the local authorities, it will take a long time before the local authorities are able to ramp up that expertise.

One will be able to build at a time when the State is not able to finance the build.  That is the main advantage of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.  Let me give the Deputy an example of how successful it has been.  There are about 20 social houses for every person in the Republic of Ireland, there is about 35 houses for every person in the North.  One would have an extra 100,000 houses in the North because they have continued to build even at times of fiscal constraint they are able to source outside funding because it is a larger body that is able to work with larger users.  It is the same issue the local authorities face.  Dublin probably does not face that issue, but smaller local authorities do.

In terms of public transport and road infrastructure, we fare the worst in the country,  I know from talking to businesses - we actually had an IBEC briefing last year and I spoke to some of our major multinational companies such as Allergan and Baxter - that the road and the rail network is a major problem in terms of retaining the business they have.  One of the points they made to us is that not only are they trying to keep what they have but when new contracts come on line they are competing for contracts with others in their company who are based in other countries around the world.  I would be interested to hear the views on the importance of upgrading the road infrastructure in the west, in Mayo and in Donegal in particular.  I would also like to hear IBEC's views on the western rail corridor and Knock Airport which are major infrastructural projects that we would like to see advanced.<\/p> <p>  Would IBEC discuss the TEN-T funding available and how it will work for Ireland?

As she rightly states, businesses in the west, particularly in the north west, are very concerned about the access infrastructure.  It has a very significant impact on inward investment decisions and sustainability of the existing jobs for indigenous companies.  It has a major impact on the cost of getting product to market.  In the context of Brexit it becomes a renewed challenge.  Ireland will be the single most remote member of the European Union post Brexit.  We will face additional complexities and delays of getting product to market through Border checks, through a UK landbridge and we do not know the challenges and delays that will occur.  These factors are all becoming more significant.  I think it is clear from the national infrastructure map that we did not finish the job the last time in terms of connecting the west and the north west of the country with Dublin and we have made no progress in terms of connecting the regions to each other.  They would be our two immediate priorities in terms of road upgrades.  The rationale for an N4 and N5 upgrade is very significant.  When one considers the strength of the enterprise base and what it is contributing to the local economy it more than pays for itself to make that road investment.<\/p> <p>  The other major issue we need to take into account when we look at the 2020-2040 vision for the country is that if we plan on the basis of current trends, we will get a very different answer from planning on the basis of what the potential of the region would be if it had sufficient infrastructure.  We have to take a certain approach of build it and they will come to the provision of infrastructure, otherwise we will create a self-fulfilling prophesy for many of the regions that they will continue to decline over time.  Our north west region is the only part of the country that had a falling population between the census of 2011 and 2016.  Everywhere else the population of the country is rising.  Clearly there is a correlation, we think, to the poor level of infrastructure of that region.<\/p> <p>  The western rail corridor has not been a very significant business issue.  It needs to be able to support itself predominantly from a socio-economic basis and if those arguments can be made, it would be important for the tourism infrastructure in particular.

We also have a situation on the N4 and the N5, where the freight levels are actually higher than on some of our motorways at the moment.  There is a Brexit implication to that as well.  There are three access roads to the north west in general.  Two of them run through the North.  If we end up with a hard Border, there could be two customs posts on the A5 and the Enniskillen road.  The N4 will then take all of the traffic going to the north west.  There is already capacity on the Longford bypass with about 14,000 cars a day plus about 1,000 heavy goods vehicles.

We only have one freight link and that is from Mayo straight to Dublin.  There are parts of that line where there is only one carriageway.  If that goes down or is blocked, that is our freight blocked for the entire western region.  This is something businesses are telling us.  They are concerned about increasing their capacity, attracting new contracts and investing further.  If that line is blocked for even half a day, it means that their businesses are seriously hit financially.  There is no alternative route.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the western rail corridor, it would be lovely to have a link from Claremorris as a commuter base into Galway and on to Limerick.  There would then be a potential to grow the population in Mayo because of the offshoot from Claremorris to Castlebar and Ballina.  There would be a potential for a commuter belt outside of Galway.  The witness is saying that he is interested in spreading the population load between the cities.  If we want to see Galway and Limerick increase in population, surely we should be looking at connecting those cities to the wider areas, including Mayo, Sligo and Roscommon.  We need these supportive industries to advance these projects.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting to look at the maps.  There is a 1739 map of our road network and a 2015 map.  What is clear from those two maps is that there is nothing in the north west in either of them.  We have not addressed the issue in the last couple of hundred years.  The north west is consistently left isolated.  It is the same with TEN-T funding and this is why I am asking the witnesses for their views on this.  The west of Ireland does not feature on the map.  We were not included.  It goes from Cork to Dublin to Belfast, with a little offshoot into Limerick, courtesy of the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan.  The north west was left off it.  How are we supposed to advance our infrastructure if we are not even included in the pot to access funding?  What do we do next?<\/p> <p>  The potential is there for County Mayo to be a commuter area to the larger cities.  Sligo should be promoted in that regard as a major economic hub in the north west with access to Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo and into Galway and Limerick as well.  That whole region has potential.  I am glad that the witnesses have said \"build it and they will come\" and spoken about self-fulfilling prophecies, because the lack of investment has led to the decline in that region.

That is why we would go back to the fiscal rules.  The Deputy is absolutely right to identify initiatives such as the TEN-T, the European Investment Bank and whatever funding streams we have.  We have arbitrary caps in the system that are limiting our take-up of public-private partnerships.  Crucially, we need a larger capital investment envelope.  Without that, we are not going to solve the infrastructure deficits for Dublin or for the regions.  That is really the issue that we would like the committee to coalesce around.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the particular challenges to the north west, there are absolutely rail freight opportunities for certain industries.  We have many businesses in the north west that report that to us as a priority.  An improved road network is the most significant priority.  In terms of Knock Airport, one of the things in our connected document is a vision for a C-ring right around the country.  Knock is positioned right on that C.  If it has north-south connectivity, crucially, and better east-west connectivity, it could really be a much more effective air connection for the whole west and north west of the country in a way that at the moment it probably is not, because the road network leading to it is just too poor.  That is probably the policy intervention that would have the most impact.  As we continue to see congestion around the M50 and the greater Dublin area, many people will look at travel times getting in and out of Dublin airport and seek alternatives.  Building an improved infrastructure to support Knock Airport is something we see as very important from a business and tourism perspective.

It was mentioned in one of the briefing documents that existing planning does not take account of the additional impact associated with tourism and business visitors, which is becoming increasingly evident right throughout the year.  In particular, I am going to focus on the north west again.  The Wild Atlantic Way was launched with much fanfare.  It has been a massive success.  Tourism to not just to Mayo, but across the western region including Donegal, has increased.  I am glad to see that the document reflects the fact that planning is not acknowledging this.  We are all very happy-clappy that we have the west of Ireland when the tourism comes.  We can send the tourists down for their hot whiskeys and their walks along the hills, but we have no interest in actually providing the infrastructure and the resources to the people living there all of the time.  If we start to suck the life out of the west of Ireland, as we have been doing for the last ten years, there will be nothing left to go and visit because there will be nobody there to run the local shop and pub and to provide the accommodation for these visitors that we all say are very necessary to the entire economy of our country.<\/p> <p>  From IBEC's perspective, we need to see it fighting more for infrastructural projects in the west of Ireland.  Our voice is quite weak at the national table.  We have not been listened to in the last number of years.  As I said, we are left off any map one looks at.  IBEC represents huge businesses in that region.  The briefing it organised for the west in Allergan last year was hugely informative and we were all sitting around the table on the same page.

One of the boards of which I am a member, the Northside Enterprise Centre, is a member of IBEC and receives a large amount of interesting information from it.  I apologise if members have asked the question I am about to ask.  Did IBEC submit to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, a fully costed budget, similar to what this committee tries to do?  The summary of recommendations and costs in the submission collates various proposals on tax cuts and expenditures.  Is an overall figure provided elsewhere in the document?<\/p> <p>  IBEC probably makes a strong case every year on the need to attract and retain highly skilled workers.  Its submission refers to the effects of taxation on highly skilled workers.  The Minister repeatedly asks the Opposition to produce a menu of alternatives.  What menu will IBEC offer?  For example, it opposes changes to the 9% VAT rate for the tourism sector, a tax on sugar and so on.  How does it propose to maintain expenditure?  Social housing and health, which are major issues for the workforce, are strictly rationed and the effect of this rationing on ordinary families has been the subject of considerable media publicity this week.  Does IBEC agree that we should continue to ration housing and health or should we spend the money needed in these areas?  If so, how does it propose to achieve this?<\/p> <p>  IBEC refers to staying the course and the witnesses probably referred earlier to the budgetary rules, particularly in respect of the capital plan.  I welcome their comments on the capital plan and I hope IBEC's viewpoint will be shared by our European colleagues in order that we are given greater wriggle room to develop infrastructure in the west, as outlined with great eloquence by the previous speaker.<\/p> <p>  On the regions, decentralisation failed because it proposed scatter-gun development across the country.  Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Sligo, Castlebar, Kilkenny and a cluster of three towns in the midlands benefitted from decentralisation.  We should also consider a second tier of towns such as Wexford as locations for decentralisation.  Deputies who represent the Dublin region sometimes become a little depressed because Ministers invariably knock the city when announcing plans, arguing that this or that cannot be done.  I understand the population of the four Dublin county council areas has reached 1.4 million and the population of Leinster is approaching 2.5 million, which is the population of Wales.  I do not see much wrong with this.  Munich, a world class city, is the capital of Bavaria, a German state of roughly the same size as Ireland.  This country needs a world class city as its capital, which will necessitate building a metro to the airport and completing similar projects.  At the same time, this should not prevent Cork, Sligo and other places becoming classy cities.  It is possible to achieve both objectives.  The Taoiseach and Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, presented a false dichotomy on this issue the other day.<\/p> <p>  Dublin is the capital of the State and we want it to be world class city, rather than third or fourth rate city.  If one looks back to the late 1980s before the docklands were developed and the Luas was built, it was a third rate city, with a desperately low level of resources provided for third level education and so on.  We need to develop Dublin as well as the other cities. <\/p> <p>  Is IBEC being too sanguine about Brexit?  Other members probably asked that question earlier.  The witnesses indicated that retail is in a little trouble.  Agricultural exports, especially food, are critical to the economy.

However, one also hears that food companies may move to the United Kingdom.

We included costings, which can be found in the annex to our submission document for last year.  The crucial point in respect of priorities is that we need to resize the envelope.  We fully accept the day-to-day pressures on services that must be delivered, for example, health, education and social services.  We continue to make the argument for tax reforms that would pay for themselves over time.  The best way for the State to finance all of this is to take the capital envelope out of the equation.  If we do so, we will have far more resources to address day-to-day needs.  That is by far the most important issue.   I empathise both with the committee given the challenge it faces and the Government given the decisions it must make.  It is impossible to meet the public service needs of the State, with its growing population, within the current budgetary framework.  Removing the capital envelope from the budgetary framework would allow us to address the most urgent priorities and start to build for the future in a way that will support a sustainable economy.<\/p> <p>  On our Dublin focus, as I stated, IBEC is a national organisation.  However, having 49% of economic activity in the State inside the M50 is sub-optimum.  It is not good for the Dublin region or the rest of the country.  We want to see a stronger, more prosperous capital with the type of infrastructure it needs but Dublin is being choked, which is not good for the city.  This is not about spreading activity outside of Dublin but about ensuring future growth is more equitable in its distribution.  It is not about taking things out of Dublin but about giving the capital the infrastructure and services it needs to be a global city.  The reality is that cities will be the future in the sense that the wealth and prosperity of nations will very much depend on them.  We need Dublin to be as good as it can be and this will require a more equitable distribution of the focus of economic activity as between Dublin and the regions. <\/p> <p>   IBEC is concerned about Brexit.  While we have not yet seen many of its impacts, apart from in retail and on food and some other traditional manufacturing industries, we are concerned that we will face a significant dislocation.  Much of the commentary on Brexit focuses on the proportion of Irish exports that go to the United Kingdom.  This significantly undervalues the nature of our economic linkages with the UK to the extent that exports to Britain are much more job intensive than exports to other countries because of the nature of the industries involved.  Brexit will cost many more jobs that would be reflected in the proportion of trade with the UK.  We are, therefore, concerned about the issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1486562400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Lahart.

I was attending another committee meeting.  I read the documentation circulated by IBEC and I will focus on two or three areas.  I have been interested in apprenticeships for some time.  If I recall correctly, IBEC was not at the forefront of the previous iteration of proposals on apprenticeship.  However, I remember reading a very good proposal from SIPTU.  As it was an area of great interest to me and one that should have been addressed a little earlier, particularly in the context of the crash, I was interested to read and hear IBEC's views on apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>  I will ask the witnesses a few questions and respond to some of their comments.  To follow up on comments made by the Chairman, there are some very poor third level courses and they need to be called out because they do not do students any favours.  I remember reading statistics which showed that college attendance was dependent on postal address.  Almost 99% of students living in Dublin 6 and 6W are likely to attend third level, whereas the proportion of young people in Dublin 15 and other postal addresses who attend third level courses is much lower.<\/p><p>My first instinct was I could not believe that 99% of students in Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W wanted to go to third level education.  IBEC has a really important role to play here.  When they set up the apprenticeships commission in the UK there was a former apprentice on it, along with captains of industry and many other leading players.  Their ambition and objective was to get to a point where every parent would consider an apprenticeship for their child.  They may not actively engage in it, but parents would consider it as an option.  We need to get to that point.  When I was in school a quarter of my class left after the old intermediate certificate to do apprenticeships, and they were the ones who succeeded.  <\/p><p> We must not just look to Government for this.  IBEC and business have a huge role to play in terms of bringing about a really big and significant culture change.  It ought to be possible that if people engage in an apprenticeship they can end up gainfully employed and trained.  Equally, if they so desire - as in Germany - they could end up being a PhD in that particular area of training if they are ambitious in that way.  Therefore, we need a dual system that allows somebody to move forwards and backwards in the education system.  We do not have it now.  <\/p><p> In Denmark, 45% of apprentices are female.  Apprentices account for 11% of their working population.  One key thing is that in Denmark one can qualify to become an apprentice at any age between 18 and 60.  Therefore, the opportunities for retraining are huge.  <\/p><p> Mr. O'Brien mentioned the national training fund in that regard and also in regard to third-level fees, which I thought was interesting.  I would like to probe that further.  What does Mr. O'Brien think IBEC can usefully do to begin championing it?  I know we have broadened the base but in Denmark there is a range of 250 apprenticeship programmes, so we are still narrow.  They do everything from hairdressing to fitness, right through to sheet-metal working and tourism.  What can IBEC do practically to bring about a culture change on this?  It is not just a policy change. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#M00400","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486562400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>From an Irish perspective we have been to the forefront of this apprenticeship discussion for a number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1486562400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Google did not show that.

I have one colleague, Mr. Tony Donohoe, who is on the National Apprenticeship Council.  He devotes a lot of his working life to promoting apprenticeships, so we are passionate about making them succeed.  I would be keen to work with any member on any suggestions and ideas they may have.<\/p> <p>  At the most practical level, there are two streams to what we are doing.  First, we have over 40 trade associations within IBEC.  We have encouraged all of them to be business-led in identifying the demand for apprenticeships.  A number of those have put bids in for the new apprenticeship programmes.  They are coming from trade associations that are part of IBEC.  Thankfully, many of those have already been successful in round 1.  Hopefully, we will see more of them being successful in the subsequent round of the apprenticeship programme.  <\/p> <p>  Second, we have a responsibility to promote the relevance of apprenticeships to the business community, and we do that on an ongoing basis.  We do numerous events, including on the skills agenda.  We see labour shortages continuously coming up as a big issue for business.  We are continuously reminding our HR community, CEOs and other business decision-makers that they need to do more as individual businesses to support the success of apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>  We are beginning to see that culture change.  It is going to be a long battle and we have been coming up against some challenges along the way, but I think we are making progress.  IBEC will not be found wanting in lending its support in practical ways to ensure that new bids are coming through from industry groups for new apprenticeships where business needs them.  We will encourage as many businesses as possible to get involved by supporting new apprenticeship programmes and taking apprentices into their businesses.  That is IBEC's responsibility and we are doing it. <\/p> <p>  I might take the opportunity to catch up with the Deputy bilaterally and share some of the work that we have been doing.

My sense was that public bodies, State companies, semi-State companies and local authorities have been slow on the bidding part, yet in 20 seconds one can think of scores of areas where apprenticeship programmes would be not just appropriate but also incredibly useful.  That is something we can push for.  It is disheartening to hear that the private sector has been driving the bids.  It is almost as if the State has said: \"That's for you guys out there.  It's not for us.\"<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the area of international education.  With Brexit there will only be five or six countries left in the world that can position themselves to offer this.  It is a potentially lucrative area, but we have been slow to respond.  A number of moves are being made on it but I am asking Mr. O'Brien to say whether or not he sees potential in this area.  If so, what kind of potential is there?  I have scratched the surface by meeting some of the players to try to find out about it.

I would argue that capacity is an issue.  It may not be the main one but it is a big issue for student housing in particular, which has knock-on impacts in the rental sector.  In parts of Dublin, one sees a lot of private rental housing being almost pushed out by extra demand from student rental.  Student housing has particular relevance both in terms of the housing crisis and attracting foreign students.  It is one of the things we addressed in last year's budget submission.  For example, the VAT rate on student housing in the UK is zero, while here they pay the full VAT rate.  A zero VAT rate would reduce costs and encourage third level institutions to get into that area.<\/p> <p>  According to figures we have gone though recently for a piece of work we are doing, Ireland has the highest rate of students going abroad.  In any given year, about 12% of Ireland's third-level student population are abroad at a foreign university.  The EU average is only 2%.<\/p><p>Irish people are far more likely to go abroad to go to international universities, which lends to our reputation abroad.  <\/p><p> There has been a great deal of focus in the Brexit debate on immigration.  Ireland has the highest rate in Europe of non-nationals and the most educated non-nationals in its labour force.  About 70% of non-EU nationals in the Irish labour force have a third level education.  About 60% of EU national are educated.  In spite of the fact that we are the second most educated country in Europe after Finland, we have far higher levels of education among non-nationals.  Ireland has been a success story in many ways in the international transfer of skills.  That is hugely important.  We see some of our international partners, in particular the US and the UK, move away from the globalised skill set and the feedback that comes from companies all the time is that this is one of the key pieces of the 21st century.  We are moving to a services-based economy.  We are moving to a more high-skilled economy with a lot more flexible movement of labour.  Essentially capital is following labour, rather than the 20th century model of labour following capital.  Because Ireland has been so successful at that there are really good opportunities out there for us as long as we do not succumb to the same issues that some of our neighbours have and that are happening in the US right now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486562400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Brady talking about isolationism and protectionism?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017020800002#O00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486562400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Yes, isolationism and attitudes toward immigration, whether the immigrants be high skilled or low skilled.

From work I did on the housing committee at the start of this D&aacute;il, there is potential for great growth in terms of the third level sector and the ability to attract international students.  I think some of that is being realised but I think - a hobbyhorse of mine - there has to be a correlation between the willingness of third level institutions, particularly in Dublin, to engage in expansion and course building with the ability to try to attract in third level students and the almost compulsory requirement to provide accommodation.  What we are seeing - I believe we will see a horrendous scene if this is not addressed in the Grangegorman area - is a displacement of traditional housing where local people will not be able to acquire accommodation because of it.  I would be supportive of any incentive to provide student accommodation but there is a necessity from an industry side to be willing to get into that and from the colleges side not to take on the notion that adding 1,000 or 2,000 students to a third level institute of technology or university, no matter how commercially beneficial it is to the college, without correctly assessing the impact it has on the greater community can be damaging on a whole host of levels.

Some additional clarity has been brought to those rules in the past year but I think there was a wider policy decision as to what degree of public private partnerships we were willing to take on.

I appreciate the fact that the committee was willing to meet me so quickly.  It is good to be here with it, as I have always found this process helpful to our work.<\/p> <p>  As members know, there is an urgent need to address the high cost of child care.  We require legislation in order to implement the scheme that we announced last year.  Although it is critical that we get the scheme up and running as swiftly as possible, it is also important that we get the legislation right, in which regard I value the committee's input.<\/p> <p>  The affordable child care scheme is a landmark measure.  It signals a comprehensive reorganisation of the various child care supports that have been offered by the Department and, prior to that, the Office of the Minister for Children.  The funding that I secured in budget 2017 will allow us to take a major step forward in terms of accessibility, affordability and quality.  It will also assist in addressing my key concerns of supporting the objectives of reducing child poverty and enabling labour market participation.  Although what we are putting in place now and the moneys that we secured for 2017 are only a first step, they represent a major leap.<\/p> <p>  One of the scheme's key features is that it is intended to be simple for parents, who will be able to apply online, and child care providers, in that once a subsidy has been approved, it will be paid directly to the providers on the parents' behalf.  A great deal of complex work must be done in order to enable this simplification.<\/p> <p>  Another key aspect is the provision of subsidies with universal and targeted elements.  This is the best way to offer a progressive approach to the development of a national child care infrastructure.  For the first time, it will provide a degree of financial support for those facing the highest child care costs, especially for those with children under three years of age.  That it will remove the stigma that can attach to targeted schemes is a key priority for my Department and me.  The targeted element will focus subsidies on families with the lowest incomes, allowing them to receive the greatest benefit.  We have placed a net threshold at a level that achieves the correct balance for the scheme's introduction.  In this way, the subsidy is available for low-income parents.  Those who receive the highest subsidy levels will be those under the relative poverty line.  There are also commitments to targeted subsidies as we move up the ladder to middle-income earners.  We are trying to get the balance right so as to take account of families' different socioeconomic backgrounds and concerns.  This is a first step.<\/p> <p>  The subsidy is designed to wrap around school and early childhood care and education, ECCE, provision.  It is important to remind members that subsidised hours of care and education will be either 15 hours or 40 hours per week.  The standard 15 hours of subsidy will be available to all families regardless of whether the parents are engaged in work or study.  The enhanced 40-hour limit will apply where the parent or parents are engaged in work or study.  We are trying to make the definitions of \"work\" and \"study\" as inclusive as possible.<\/p> <p>  We have conducted extensive consultation on the scheme, most recently as last November, and have received more than 4,000 responses.  There was a high level of support for the proposed scheme in those 4,000 responses.  However, a concern was raised with the Department by parents and providers about the proposal that no more than 48 weeks of subsidy would be payable per year.  This proposal would create funding difficulties for providers and would not fit with their business model of income coming in and costs going out on a 52-week basis.  We have responded to this and adjusted the proposals accordingly, but I would welcome the committee's views on the matter.  The adjustment allows the same amount of subsidy to be payable on a 52-week basis rather than across 48 weeks, so it is budget neutral.<\/p> <p>  Issues of quality, cost, provision, conditions and pay arise in our discussion of the Bill, so I will remind members that we will engage in an independent review of the cost of quality child care.  What the legislation puts in place is an infrastructure through which we can continue investing as the years pass.  It is accepted internationally that, if high quality services with the best outcomes for children are desired, then valuing the workforce is critical.  The current terms and conditions for child care practitioners do not reflect the importance of their work.  I have met them and we have engaged in the early years forum.<\/p><p>We have also met with Patricia King, head of ICTU, and other members of IMPACT and SIPTU.  This is a key aspect of my priority to support the quality workforce in 2017 and with budget 2018 negotiations to ensure it can continue.  The independent review is important and will help us determine the basis for the costs for child care provision.<\/p><p> The issue around the sustainability of community services is critical for me and my team.  It has been raised consistently since we announced the portable child care scheme and as we are moving to put in place legislation.  We are looking at ways of ensuring the support for these services.  I acknowledge that the financial situation of many community services has been further stretched by the move to require FETAC level 5 qualifications of all staff who work directly with children.  The impact is large for community services which previously relied on community employment schemes.<\/p><p> A large part of the financial challenge, however, is that community services face low revenue.  The highest subsidy rate available under the community child care subvention is &euro;95 per week.  When we move to the new scheme parents may now receive a subsidy of between &euro;150 and &euro;205 per week, depending on the age of the child.  We anticipate more parents will use child care, meaning more income will go into community services and accordingly supporting the business model.<\/p><p> As well as beginning work on the independent review of costs, officials in my Department are examining the potential to bring more child minders into the scheme while ensuring quality.  A departmental group will discuss this with Childminding Ireland.<\/p><p> The Government wants to support all the ways parents choose to mind their children.  For stay-at-home parents, we are reducing some of the barriers for those who want to move into learning paths and the workforce.  At the same time, other Departments are putting in place supports for these parents.  This will all come together in the first ever national early years strategy, which will take a joined-up approach, outlining how my Department, with the Department of Social Protection and others, will ensure parents have a choice in how they care for their children and are supported in this.<\/p><p> In parallel with the legislative process, officials in my Department and staff in Pobal are already working hard to develop the business processes and IT systems which will make the affordable child care scheme possible.  That work involves close co-operation with officials of the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners, as well as support from a range of other Departments and agencies.<\/p><p> In addition, preparation for the scheme has already involved consultation with a range of stakeholders.  I thank all involved in that process to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#B00900","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Jerry Murphy from Pobal to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#C00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to discuss the work of Pobal on the development of the affordable child care scheme.<\/p> <p>  Pobal was established in 1992 as Area Development Management Limited by the Government, with the agreement of the European Commission, as an intermediary company working on behalf of the Government to support social and economic development.  Over time, our work has evolved in line with developments in government policy and the needs of the groups and communities we serve.  In 2005, the company name changed to Pobal.  The company is governed by a board of directors appointed by the Government who give of their time and expertise on a voluntary basis.  Pobal's programmes are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, our funding Departments and the EU.<\/p> <p>  Pobal now manages or administers 24 programmes on behalf of the Government.  In 2016, we administered &euro;428 million of funding.  Our role varies across the programme we manage but includes working with Departments on programme design, funding allocations, contract management, beneficiary support, training and quality improvement, monitoring, reporting and audit.<\/p> <p>  Pobal has been involved in the development of early years provision since the inception of the sector.  Pobal worked with the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform from 1994 to develop community child care projects in disadvantaged areas through several initiatives.  Pobal subsequently managed the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, the State's first national child care provision programme.  We managed the State's National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2011.  We have since then worked with local communities, with the early years sector, with county child care committees and with the relevant lead Departments to support the sector's development and delivery.<\/p> <p>  Pobal works on a wide range of early years initiatives on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Our roles include administration of the various targeted subsidy programmes such as the community child care subvention and the training and employment child care programme; management of the early childhood care and education scheme process, support and oversight of county child care committees; the learner funds, hosting of the better start quality initiative and of the access and inclusion model.<\/p> <p>  Pobal's role gives it access to clear information on the structures, activities, successes and challenges of the early years sector.  We are keenly aware of the impact on parents of the availability, or unavailability of good quality, affordable child care.  We are conscious of the financial restrictions within which the early years sector operates and of their impacts on it.  We are conscious of the stresses placed on both parents and on the sector through the complexity of existing systems for managing provision.<\/p> <p>  The affordable child care scheme, from our viewpoint, is a valuable and substantial move forward which can assist all stakeholders in overcoming sets of existing challenges.  The new offer of financial support to all parents significantly broadens the base of those who can access State child care support.  Moving to a single mechanism for offering targeted subsidies will make it simpler for parents to understand their rights and for child care providers to manage their provision.<\/p> <p>  Pobal is conscious of the need to ensure, as we move from the current complex structures to a more logical and unified approach under the affordable child care scheme, that the process of transfer to the new programme is well planned and supported.  Pobal will, in partnership with the Department, work to prepare and train providers to operate the necessary new systems.  Pobal is also aware of the need to work to ensure these new systems reduce, to the greatest degree possible, the bureaucracy on parents and child care providers.  We will work to keep these levels controlled, subject always to the need to ensure proper public accountability for funds.<\/p> <p>  Our experience of working on existing early years provision allows us clarity on the scale of challenge and complexity in completing this work.  We are committed to ensure this experience and the lessons learned are brought to bear on scheme design and implementation.  A key feature of this challenge for Pobal is moving from working only with child care providers to also working directly with the tens of thousands of parents who will access this scheme.  Other important challenges are to be met in regard to ensuring appropriate, high quality and secure data systems, properly balancing accountability and simplicity and in preparing parents and the child care sector for the transition.<\/p> <p>  Since we were approached by the Department in October to take a role in the delivery of this scheme, our knowledge and understanding of the detailed challenges in the broad programme, as well as the necessary steps to meet them, have grown.  We are particularly aware of the challenges presented by issues such as ensuring computations of family income are accurately addressed, where complex sets of situations will be encountered and will need to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>  Pobal has put in place a dedicated staff team to support the development of the new programme.  This work includes developing new business processes to deliver the affordable child care scheme and an ICT system to support these processes.  It also includes providing the sets of information, training and other materials needed to ensure parents and child care providers are prepared for the scheme's roll-out.<\/p><p>We are working closely with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to ensure the affordable child care scheme programme is operational to a high quality standard and that the systems developed are helping to make this service a success for parents, children and providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy for his presentation and presence which are very much appreciated.

As discussed at our last meeting, the committee will do everything it can to assist that process and ensure there will be no stumbling blocks along the legislative path.

It is very important and appreciated that we have an opportunity to discuss the scheme.  I have a few brief points to make.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister said she wanted to have a system that was simple for parents and providers and that it should be available online.  Will she tell the committee when exactly it will be available online?  Parents are asking providers about the scheme and have questions about what it will mean for them.  They want to know when they will be able to obtain information on it and the providers are not able to tell them because they do not know the answer.  What briefings are being offered to providers, or when will they occur, in order that providers will be able to give the information to parents?  Many people go to members of the county child care committees which act as a one-stop-shop with questions about child care services.  Have the committees been briefed on the scheme or when will that take place?<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about the early years strategy.  I believe it is the key to everything.  For years we have had many systems of child care because we were not following an early years strategy.  Will the Minister indicate when she expects the strategy to be published and implemented?  Is there a timeframe or plan in that regard?<\/p> <p>  It is welcome that the Minister met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union and IMPACT to discuss the pay and conditions of child care workers.  It is important to have the worker organisations on board, but the reality is that if we want quality child care services, we need to treat child care workers with the respect they deserve.  Currently, their pay and conditions do not reflect the very valuable work they do.  There will be an issue about sustainability if the high turnover of staff in the sector continues.  What schemes does the Department plan to introduce to address the issue of workers' pay and conditions, as it will be the next crisis?  We rightly hear a lot about the affordability of child care, but another aspect of the matter is the way workers are paid.  Many of them cannot even meet the cost of their own bills and the problem especiallyd affects women who generally dominate the numbers employed in the sector.  Perhaps the Minister might also provide clarity on the figure of 52 weeks.  Is it the case that the amount of money is the same but spread over 52 instead of 48 weeks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#D00600","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I ask members to stick very closely to the scheme we are discussing.

A lot of my questions will be directed at Mr. Jerry Murphy as they concern Pobal which was handed the mammoth task of delivering the programme as it has a lot of experience in that arena.  My first concern is about the level of engagement it has had with the Department of Social Protection and Revenue because we are looking at individuals who are self-employed and also in the PAYE sector.  What ICT system has Pobal acquired or sought to procure to ensure the required integration between all of the various Departments involved? That system needs to be delivered as staff will need to be trained how to use it.  In a nutshell, will it be ready for use in September?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the affordability, accessibility and sustainability of cr&egrave;ches in rural communities throughout the State which are on a knife edge.  The position is different from that in Dublin where people are queuing to secure places in cr&egrave;ches; in rural areas it is the opposite where cr&egrave;ches are driven by the needs of those in receipt of social welfare payments or participating in the back-to-education scheme.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the scheme which is a landmark in terms of the shift in child care, but there are huge hurdles to be overcome.  I wish to pick up on one or two points made in the briefing document.  One of my concerns is that the document states the change reflects the aim of the scheme to support labour market activation.  I believe, however, that this does not apply in all cases.  Some families do not come within that classification, but the best place for their child is in a community cr&egrave;che.  What will be done to support these families?  For various reasons, the parents may not be able to work or may not be up to minding for their child.  What funding models will be used to support these families?  The current system is very compassionate in that regard.  I believe some of that compassion is being lost.<\/p> <p>  The extension from 48 weeks to 52 is welcome, but I am concerned about the retention of staff in the child care sector because of the funding model used.  What is being done to address the issue of staff retention in the sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#D00800","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>In the interests of transparency I inform the committee that I am a director of a not-for-profit community child care facility.  My question to the Minister is about the rural aspect of this matter.  I very much welcome the scheme.  It marks a shift, not only in helping parents but also in broader economic terms to facilitate those who need to find work.  Is this about centralising child care services or moving people to the bigger centres?  I know that many rural child care facilities help to keep local schools running.  They are a conduit in rural Ireland.  If that service can continue to be provided, schools will stay open.  The automatic psychology is that the child care facility will act as a feeder for the local school, although it is not the only reason the facilities have been provided.  It is, however, a knock-on effect and they breath life back into an area.<\/p> <p>  My second query is about qualifications.  If I am off the point, the Chairman can flag it for me.  Obviously, there are particular qualifications required.  Will the Minister indicate if there is any thought within the Department for those who may have considerable experience in child care - I am talking about individuals with long experience - but who may not have the specific qualifications outlined by it?  They may, however, have other qualifications that may be health related.  Has the Department looked at broadening the spectrum of qualifications to take into account the fact that there are people with long experience?  Could a top-up examination or an assessment be undertaken based on the length of their experience?  In rural areas especially we are talking about very small child care facilities provided by a person with extremely long service in child care who may have to take examinations.  It will put pressure on their businesses if they have to hire someone with qualifications to look after them.  Oftentimes it will not be commercially viable to do this.  The extra workload involved in this regard should also be considered.  Will the Minister indicate if any thought has been given to this aspect of the scheme?  The point on vocational experience arose following the launch of other apprenticeship schemes last week.  I wonder, therefore, if there has been any thought process on this aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#D00900","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and thank both groups for coming.

Its concern is that in practice this could introduce zero hour contracts and insecure hours for staff.  Deputy Anne Rabbitte has already raised an issue about the figure of 52 weeks.

The delegates might bear in mind that I do not want to stray too far into that issue.<\/p> <p>  It is too narrow a focus for the committee to think child care will be provided by current child care providers because with the ambition of the scheme, they cannot do so.  According to the figures I have, there are 20,000 people minding children.  In the area I represent, Skibbereen, Clonakilty and Bandon, many of those minding children are relatives, grandparents, aunts and so on.  There are also many childminders in the system who are unregulated.  Tusla's figures show that approximately 120 of the 20,000 childminders are regulated by it.  We need to rely on that cohort of people, but how can we bring them into the system and regulate their services?  There is a provision for the Minister to do this, but will she elaborate on it to help the committee because capacity is a greater and immediate challenge?

As the Chairman identified, many of these issues are outside the context of the Bill on which we are working.  At the same time the legislation will put in place very different infrastructure and a way to provide for State investment to support families in the provision of child care, taking cognisance of the requirement for quality provision.  As I indicated in my opening remarks, I am very committed to this and we are very cognisant of it.  We have begun discussions that I think will prove very fruitful, not only with some of the unions which are bringing more child care providers into their membership, which is a welcome and important step that supports the appearance and status of the professionalisation of the sector.  We will continue these conversations with them to help the Department in considering the issue of pay and conditions.  I have referred to the independent review we are conducting.  There are key places where we are having conversations because we are aware that the current pay and conditions are not adequate to acknowledge and recognise the quality care service being delivered throughout the country.  The Department will continue to be cognisant of the inclusion of as much support as possible in respect of the learner funds and increased support for the providers in respect of their additional qualifications which is a key aspect of conditions, as well finding ways to support members of staff who have been involved in community services such as community employment schemes and want to move towards training to obtain the qualification required to ensure quality.  These are matters we will continue to discuss, perhaps in other arenas.  It is welcome that the committee is preparing a report on the issue.  We, too, are doing work to provide me with support, as well as the argument and evidence, to look for more resources for child care providers, in addition to moneys for non-contact time.  Members are aware of this key request from the sector in the context of the last budget.<\/p><p>I will ask one of my officials to address Deputy Tom Neville's question on qualifications and acknowledging the broad experience many providers have acquired outside the context of formal qualifications, particularly in early childhood care and education.  The Deputy will be aware of our drive to ensure quality and learning among those working with children.  Ongoing theory and practice are provided and learning and training are offered in different ways in early years education and care.<\/p><p> The Deputy also referred to our announcements on apprenticeship models and other sectors.  While the word \"apprentice\" may have some positive and negative connotations for different sectors, perhaps even in the early childhood education sector, it may worthwhile to consider this type of model in the context of work in this sector.  Discussions on the issue are just starting, but as we proceed, we will be very open to this approach.  The legislation provides that certain qualifications are required in the sector.  We are open to considering other approaches, however, and fully cognisant of the concerns raised by the Deputy.  Deputy Anne Rabbitte referred to rural areas where some of these issues arise more frequently among providers than in cities. <\/p><p> I have said a great deal about pay, conditions and qualifications.  Before asking my officials to elaborate on these issues, I will first address a couple of other matters.  Deputy Anne Rabbitte raised a number of issues about parents who choose to care for their children at home.  She asked if there was some compassion missing in the application of the scheme.  That is not the case.  The scheme provides a new subsidy for children aged under three years, regardless of circumstances.  Many parents who choose to mind their children at home would also like a mix of care choices.

While I accept that this is less than that available under some of the other schemes, careful consideration was given to this issue.  While we know that 15 hours of care in services is good for children, there is less evidence in respect of longer hours.

I will make two points on that issue.  This refers to included income on equity grounds.  The starting point for the income assessment is that all forms of income are assessed.  We have excluded certain specific payments, primarily payments intended to support labour market access through education and training or time-bound short-term measures that support families into the labour market.  Family income support tends to be given in the form of a long-term payment, rather than as short-term assistance into the labour market.<\/p> <p>  A second important point is that the scheme also provides for what is known as a multiple child deduction.  This is a deduction from a family's income where there are two or more children.  The rationale for the deduction is very much around family income supplement because the amount of supplement paid to a family increases significantly when they have two, three or more children, in other words, the larger the family, the larger the FIS payment.  The multiple child deduction built into the affordable child care scheme has been set specifically at a level to offset the increase in payment of family income supplement the more children a family have.  The FIS payment, to a considerable extent, leads to an adjustment in a family's income through that mechanism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#F01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Toby Wolfe"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>The deduction also affects other families who are not in receipt of family income supplement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#F01200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>The multiple child deduction applies to all families, but concerns about the interaction with family income supplement drove the calculations on the level of the deduction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#F01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Toby Wolfe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>The Minister asked me to respond to Deputy Tom Neville on the issue of qualifications.  There are a limited number of other ways in which people without a relevant qualification may work in services.  However, I reiterate the point made by the Minister that, in our view, it is good for children that they are looked after by a qualified workforce.  There is broad agreement on this matter, as is reflected in the development of regulations in this area.  There are, however, a number of exceptions.  The Deputy will be aware that we have provided for a grandfather clause, under which some people who do not have the necessary qualification and intend to retire in the next few years may continue to work in the sector for a limited period.<\/p> <p>  Under level 7 of the new access and inclusion model, a range of supports are provided for access and inclusion.  We are providing for a capitation sum of approximately &euro;13 per hour for individuals who can come to a preschool room and support the preschool leader in providing an inclusive service for all the children in the room.  Under the regulations, we do not require that such persons must, in every instance, have a level 5 qualification.  The Deputy referred to a health qualification.  He or she may have a health qualification, for example, because a child may have particular care needs.  Some allowance is made under the access and inclusion model.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Education and Skills has responsibility for reviewing the courses on offer.

I imagine there is some variation with that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to community services, the Minister answered most of the question but we very much recognise the challenges faced by community services.  The Minister has already mentioned the interventions we are making in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Another point it is important to make is that in budget 2017, and for the first time, the Minister got a small allocation of &euro;1 million for a sustainability fund to help the Department develop a sustainability policy.  It is hoped that the Minister will be making an announcement in the coming days on that.  It is a small amount of assistance to community services that are struggling, particularly in terms of community employment where community employment participants are no longer able to be part of the ratios.  Clearly, if services have people beyond the ratios, and we know many of them do and that it is very generous of them to do so, those people outside the ratios are not bound by the regulation requirements.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked about efficiencies and the wording used in the heads of Bills, etc.  In terms of what that means, we know that services that run a very good business model are already looking for efficiencies.  They are trying to dovetail one child with another child.  We have some early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme providers providing services in the morning and now in the afternoon so that they can give full day, full week contracts.  The affordable childcare scheme has been built in such a way that providers will be able to examine how they can dovetail children.  Some children might be there for the morning, others will be after school etc.  It is those type of efficiencies we are talking about.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the quality requirements.  Clearly, the regulations will be the fundamental requirements but also as part of the contract, and we have that already.  For example, the existing contracts state that we require services to implement S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  Most of the services are saying \"Yes, we do\" but that they need more support.  That is something on which we are working.  Last year, we funded an Aistear co-ordinator and a S&iacute;olta co-ordinator to work in the Department of Education and Skills out towards the services.  There is a good deal happening with regard to providing more mentoring and support on S&iacute;olta and Aistear.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about school age child care.  Our regulations allow for regulation of preschool services.  Currently, there is not any regulation of school age child care but in terms of what we do, many of the school age child care services provide early years child care as well.  The Tusla early years inspectorate inspects that service in its totality.  It does not focus on the school age aspect but on the early years aspect.  We have allowed those services to attract State funding.  Those services registered with Tusla that provide early years and school age child care will be included in this affordable childcare scheme.  The Minister, with the Department of Education and Skills, will soon publish a school age child care action plan.  We have a plan to bring in some of the existing stand alone school age child care services that do not have an early years component.  We are hoping that under the legislation the Minister will be able to make regulations so that it is not just those who are registered with Tusla who can avail of the affordable childcare scheme but that she can also establish a list of services that need strict criteria that will also be avail of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie McNally"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>On the timing of that, would that be ready when the scheme is being introduced in September?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#G01100","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Yes, that would be our intention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#G01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie McNally"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>The Ombudsman for Children-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#G01300","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I do not know the categoric answer to that question.

As soon as the scheme is up and running, we will, in the second and third years, get a much better picture of the way demand is developing.<\/p> <p>  The Department has also joined the ESRI's SWITCH research programme and the affordable childcare scheme is being built into the SWITCH model at present.  Work began on that last summer and it is ongoing this year.  The work programme with the SWITCH model includes estimations of labour market response to this scheme.  We are fairly confident that we will not hit the budget cap this year and we will get increasingly confident as time goes by.  It is in place as a protection for the public finances and in the event that the budget cap gets hit, we will be looking carefully at the way prioritisation of cases and the queuing system works at that point, but we believe it is unlikely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#G02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Toby Wolfe"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I want to address the questions from Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Funchion on when the system will be available online, the concerns around working with providers and especially parents to ensure the appropriate information is provided and that there is awareness raising in terms of how this works, the level of engagement with the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners as well as the need to train people to deliver all of that.  That is all part of what we are currently working on.  We are planning an intensive information and awareness raising campaign for parents particularly but also providers with regard to understanding the system, how one goes about applying and how that works.  That will be rolled out in the months prior to September and we have been working intensively on that from a communications perspective.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the development of the system and its readiness, Deputies will be aware that the path we have set ourselves is very ambitious.  Delivering a child care system that will be fair and equal, especially for the sake of the parents, the children and the families, is not easy.  A huge amount of work is taking place on that.  As members will appreciate and as the Chairman has identified, the legislative timetable is tight, and I will answer the questions and then ask Mr. Murphy and his colleague to come in also, but the timetable is also tight in terms of the legal information and payment infrastructure we need to put in place.<\/p><p>What we are putting in place now will be there for generations of Irish families.  We are extremely conscious of the need to get it right.  I should say with that in mind that it is possible the systems will not be fully automated by September.  This would place an administrative burden on the Department and on Pobal.  We might not have a fully automated system that delivers everything by September 2017.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, we need to integrate data from the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners so that the system can calculate every family's net income and provide the subsidy they will receive.  We need to test the information technology system rigorously to ensure it works in complicated family circumstances.  We need to get it right.  We do not want a system that fails.<\/p><p> Our intention is that parents will be able to apply online from the home or office computer.  The universal payment for children under the age of three will be fairly straightforward because it will not require the same level of calculation as the targeted measure.  The other targeted payments will require more work and might therefore take longer.  Some applications might have to be assessed in a manual fashion while we are finishing the development of the new systems.  It could be a semi-automatic payment.  The intention is that the parents will apply.  I expect that universal payments will be determined fairly quickly, but it might take a little more time for targeted payments to be determined.  The bottom line is that families will benefit from September.  We will get a much clearer view of this from the project board, which contains officials from the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners, by the end of this month.  I will be happy to follow this matter up with the members of the committee at that stage by clearly communicating how this is going to work.  I guess I am saying now that regardless of what happens, our bottom line is that families will benefit from September.

We believe there is sufficient capacity in the system at the moment.  If the Government continues to invest in child care, we will certainly need to build capacity from 2018 onwards in formal settings and in the childminding sector.  Childminding Ireland, which is the umbrella organisation with particular expertise in this area, even if it does not have exclusive competence in this regard, is looking at this matter.  It is considering the question of whether grandparents and relatives always want to be treated as paid childminders.  Some of them choose not to be seen as such.  Childminding Ireland is looking at who should be defined as a childminder.<\/p> <p>  Just 120 childminders are currently registered with Tusla.  It is possible that several hundred more could register with Tusla.  We would be actively encouraging them to do so.  Not every childminder is eligible to register.  In order to have such eligibility, a childminder has to be minding three or more unrelated children in his or her own home.  At least several hundred childminders could register with Tusla.  We hope they will do so.  While we want to look at a way to bring the other childminders in, we cannot put State funding into an area that is totally unregulated.  We have asked Childminding Ireland to make recommendations to us on what a quality infrastructure might look like and on the minimum standards and criteria we might consider in areas like Garda vetting and paediatric first aid.  The infrastructure in this regard must be of a sufficient quality to assure the Minister when she is making regulations and drawing up a list.  We want to move towards statutory regulation in the long term, but we are considering what we can do in the short and medium terms.<\/p> <p>  I did not intend to mislead Deputy Jan O'Sullivan when I said we hope to have the regulations in place after the primary legislation is passed.  I was not suggesting that we will necessarily open the doors immediately to childminders or to stand-alone school-age child care services.  I expect it will take some time for them to build up to meet the minimum standards that will be required of them.  I do not expect that we will be extending it significantly this September.

As other members of the committee have said, this significant and historic scheme is welcome.  There are concerns in relation to some aspects of it, however.  The Minister said in her opening statement that 10% of people will not be better off and will require transitional arrangements.  Who might be in the 10% group?  What categories of children might be involved?  How long would such a transitional arrangement continue for?<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about the community model.  I do not require a response to this point, but I am merely seeking to put it on the record that, as the Chairman suggested, the necessary capacity to support the expansion of the scheme does not exist.  It is very important for the Department and the Government to place a significant emphasis on capital investment in the community sector in the interests of expanding capacity.  This initiative needs to have a substantial capital element.  I suggest that the community and public end of child care provision will be absolutely crucial in this regard.<\/p> <p>  One of my biggest concerns relates to the cost of delivering child care and sustainability.  Like Deputy Neville, I am a member of a board of a family centre.  The Minister will not be surprised to hear me ask questions about the sustainability of community facilities.  I raised this issue last summer, before this scheme was announced, in the context of the change in the regulations.  I echo Deputy Rabbitte's point that early years education needs to be an essential part of this initiative.  We should not confine our focus to job activation.  While the provision of 15 hours might be of value, I am concerned that some people who previously enjoyed substantial numbers of hours of child care will miss out on those 15 hours because of the pressure that will be on spaces and because of the first-come, first-served nature of the child care sector.<\/p><p> I have significant concerns about those in the earliest years, those from nought to three.  The ratios are obviously significantly lower in this regard.  From nought to one, the ratio is 1:3.  For one year olds it is 1:5, and for two year olds it is 1:6, whereas it rises to 1:8 from three upwards.  I am concerned that, because of the nature of the ECCE scheme and the affordable childcare scheme, ACS, many community facilities and probably facilities across the board will now focus significantly on the older cohort of children.  I am concerned about this because it is from the ages of one to three that early intervention is most valuable.  The investment in the first few years is of greater value in tackling disadvantage than the investment after three.  It is not just about qualifications because this is about the capacity of the community facilities to take on staff.  Some of them simply cannot afford to do so.  While the subsidy from the ACS might be substantial in many respects, a facility must have adequate staff from the get-go to avail of it.  Therefore, I emphasise the need for the provision of funding to ensure such facilities have the ability to take on additional staff now.  This is absolutely necessary.<\/p><p> I will not labour points that have already been made.  With regard to pay, the reality is that the scheme is budgeted for on the basis of pay of roughly &euro;10.79 per hour.  The living wage is &euro;11.50 per hour, however.  The budget is on the basis of low pay, therefore.  It is worth putting that on the record.  It is a fact.<\/p><p> A policy paper we received makes reference to maintenance payments being deductible.  I understand from the submission of One Family that this relates only to legally enforceable maintenance payments.  That could exclude many people who are very reliant on maintenance payments.  They could find themselves in hardship on that basis.<\/p><p> The family income supplement was raised.  I still have concerns about that.  Parents could decide to work less than the 20 hours to obtain adequate child care provision.  In many respects, that goes against the grain of what we are attempting to achieve on the labour market activation side.<\/p><p> The relevant tax year is going to be important in terms of calculation.  I have slight concerns about that.  It could be 2015 for some families, depending on circumstances.  Circumstances could have changed drastically since then.  I am not sure the model is necessarily the best or whether there are other possible models.  There could be significant changes in people's incomes and their need for a substantial subsidy, for example.<\/p><p> On my final point, I am slightly unsure.  Reference is made to the ability of sponsor organisations to ensure people get the full subsidy.  We received a submission from Barnardos expressing concern that children in care would get only 15 hours under this scheme whereas they would have had many more hours previously.  I seek clarification on that because a reduction in the number of hours for children in care would be a regressive step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#H01900","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and other witnesses for attending.  I have a couple of questions, which I will keep as brief as possible.  I wish to return to what the Minister said about the targeted scheme not being fully ready by September.  Does that mean people will not be able to avail of the targeted scheme if it is going to be dealt with manually?  Will it be available on schedule in September?<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise the issue of vulnerable children in homeless accommodation.  Ms McNally said exceptions will be made.  Do children in emergency temporary accommodation have, as a right, access to the child care scheme?  The Minister might confirm that.  Alternatively, must it be approved later?<\/p> <p>  I raised Garda vetting with the Minister in the Seanad when the scheme was announced.  She said extra resources would be allocated for Garda vetting to allow childminders who want to register with Tusla to do so in time for the scheme.  Have those resources been allocated already?<\/p> <p>  On head 8 of the Bill, particularly in respect of the types of income that will be taken into account and the incomes listed in Schedule 2, I am disappointed that rental income and other income from land and property will be taken into account.  I raised this with the Minister in the Seanad previously.  This is probably an urban issue more than a rural one.  Many families are in rented accommodation and their former family home, which is no longer suitable for them, is rented out.  The rent is subject to the normal taxation and universal social charge regime.  It is not actually earned income.  I refer to the families caught in the middle who are struggling to make ends meet.  They are renting out the former family home, which they cannot sell because it is in negative equity, and are renting another home for their expanding family.  They will not be able to avail of the scheme fully.  This seems nonsensical because these are the families the Minister has been trying to support through the scheme.  I would like her to address the reasoning behind that.  If a family has rented out the former family home and it is in negative equity, why is the rental income taken into account when assessing eligibility to participate on the scheme?<\/p> <p>  As with other Deputies and Senators, I have very grave concerns over the pay and conditions of people working in the child care industry.  The pay and conditions have a negative impact on the children because there is a high turnover of staff.  This primarily affects the workers.  We really need to address this urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#J00200","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>It was really fantastic to hear about this programme.

My view has also been coloured because this is really the first time I have heard about the scheme fully.  It sounds remarkable.  I ask the Minister to forgive my question if it is irrelevant.  I am just dropping in at this very late stage.  We all know about rental issues in respect of rent and subsidisation.  There was an awful statement from landlords that those in receipt of a rent allowance should not apply to become a tenant.

In a full year, the funding is in the region of &euro;150 million.  Am I correct about that?  It is obviously very significant.  I urge caution in this regard.  Can the system be demand led?  If it is to be equitable and fair, we want to ensure everyone who wants to participate is eligible and that we will not run out of funding.  Can making the scheme demand led be legislated for?  This would ensure adequate funding.  Obviously, I do not for a second take from the funding of &euro;150 million because it is a massive amount.

The Minister has given additional resources to Early Childhood Ireland, some members of which are in the Gallery, and officials have met Barnardos to determine whether there is a need for additional resources there.  Senator Freeman asked about cherry-picking and we very much hope that will not happen.  The schemes of the past could only be accessed by community services so the situation was, to some extent, one of community services versus private services, but we recently opened up the CCS to private services.<\/p><p>Several hundred private services are now providing those schemes.  As the affordable child care scheme develops, the Minister's vision is very much that it will be the only show in town.  We hope and expect that all services will sign up for it, particularly because of the universal element which will bring them all in.  We will have legislation in place but we will also have contacts, built into which will be a requirement to provide inclusive services.  We mean that inclusiveness in the broadest sense.<\/p><p> We were asked about fee policy and whether, come September, services will know what to charge.  The answer is that they should because we will have told them.  We have had the discussion about how we will do it.  Certainly, we will be telling them what the subsidy is and they will already have published their fee, which will be stated.  The total fee will be a certain amount less the subsidy we provide.  The parent will pay the difference.  That should be clear.  As the Minister said, we will be working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#K01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie McNally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>What if the parent does not know what he or she will be entitled to on top of the universal payment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#L00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>As soon as we know, the parent will know.

There are people who will benefit from the scheme.  We are not talking about people who will get no benefit.  However, there are those whose income is at a level where the level of payment the scheme will give them is a bit less than they are currently receiving.  This relates in particular to people on the CETS scheme, which has the highest level of payment of the current schemes.  People at those levels of income will still benefit from the affordable child care scheme, however.  The scheme provides for what we are calling a \"saver clause\".  As such, anybody on a current scheme at the moment of transition to the new scheme will retain the current level of payment for a transitional period.  In the case of those people who are on the CETS payment by virtue of being on an education or training course, they will retain their current payment right through until the end of the education and training course that gave rise to their payment.  They will never be in a position where they started a course expecting a certain level of payment but then find themselves stranded.  That will not happen.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on maintenance payments and the statement in the policy paper that the only deductible maintenance payments would be ones with a legal agreement around them.  There was a change between the policy paper and the heads of Bill.  We had discussions with one-parent organisations on the issue and the heads of the Bill now have a much wider range of maintenance arrangements that can be deducted from income.  As such, the issue the Deputy was concerned about has been addressed in the heads.<\/p> <p>  There was a question around the tax year being potentially 2015, the previous year, and that incomes might have changed in the meantime.  We have tried to design a scheme which is streamlined so that when a parent applies, once the automated system is up and running, he or she will get an instant response.  The way we are doing that is by using the most recent income data available from Revenue.  That is somewhat historic, but one of the protections we are building into the scheme is to provide that, at most after 12 months, a parent's income will be reassessed automatically every 12 months.  That is the maximum period for which an income can be out of date.  We have also built into the proposals that if a family's income has fallen since the most recent data was available from Revenue, it can request an assessment based on current income.  For instance, if somebody loses a job since the most recent data was available from Revenue, he or she will be able to request a manual assessment in which his or her current income is calculated.  If someone is out of a job, he or she will then get the maximum payment.<\/p> <p>  A number of members referred to rent and mortgages.  We are not proposing that housing costs will be deducted from income, either housing costs of a family's first home, whether it is mortgage or rent, or the housing costs of a second home.  The cohort of families who will benefit from the scheme all, by and large, face significant housing costs.  It is not that some face a housing cost and some do not.  Large housing costs are common to the cohort.  Clearly, there is variation in the level of housing cost families pay, but we must be clear that the scheme is intended to reduce child care costs rather than to function as a support for family housing costs.  We were aware in the decision not to deduct housing payments of a risk of subsidising up to 39% of the difference between two families' housing costs through the affordable child care scheme.  I take the example of two families with the same income level and children of the same age, but where one lives in a larger house with a larger mortgage payment.  If the housing costs were deductible, the difference in the affordable child care subsidy for the family with the larger house could be up to 39% of the difference in the value of the mortgage.  If we were to deduct housing costs, we would have to be clear that we were, in effect, subsidising the difference in mortgage and rent payments between families.<\/p> <p>  There was a follow up question on family income supplement asking if we would continue to look at the issue.  We will certainly keep looking at the issue.  We want to avoid any unintended consequences for FIS recipients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Toby Wolfe"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I am conscious that Senator Clifford-Lee probably did not get an answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#L00600","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I have to go to another meeting shortly.

It is a little shorter.<br\/><br\/>Early Childhood Ireland's policy and advocacy work is underpinned by the belief that quality for children, sustainability for both child care service providers and their staff, and affordability for parents are the three essential, interconnected pillars of a robust, functioning and desirable child care system.  As such, for ACS to work it must address quality, sustainability and affordability together, and not one without the other.<br\/><br\/>Early Childhood Ireland welcomes the development of the ACS, which represents a significant change to the current structure of State-funded child care supports.<b><\/b>We welcome the amalgamation of existing targeted child care programmes into a single, streamlined and, it is hoped, more user-friendly scheme.  However, we think it is a mistake that the free preschool years are not yet incorporated into the scheme from the outset, though we understand the reasons behind that.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the principle of progressive universalism whereby ACS encompasses both universal and targeted<b><\/b>elements that can be increased over time as additional State investment becomes available and where families and children in most need receive the greatest financial support.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the scheme&rsquo;s stated objectives to promote a reduction in child poverty, positive child development outcomes, labour market activation and improved quality.  However, it does not appear to Early Childhood Ireland that the focus of the scheme reflects the priorities in this order or that the scheme as currently proposed is capable of addressing all the objectives.<\/p><p>We believe that improved quality as a stated objective should be connected to the second objective of improving child development outcomes, particularly as the two are intrinsically linked.<br\/><br\/>Getting the cost model right from the start is imperative to the success of the scheme for children, families and operators and for the survival of the early years sector.  Early Childhood Ireland is concerned that the affordable care scheme, ACS, is being rolled out before an independent review of the cost of providing quality child care in private and community settings consistent with the principle of ongoing professionalisation of the sector, as per A Programme for A Partnership Government commitment in May 2016, is conducted and published.  This is regrettable, given that the cost model being used to calculate the targeted subsidies is based on the current unacceptable <i>status quo<\/i>whereby the majority of the sector is breaking even at best and the workforce is highly professional, low paid and employed on a part-time, 38-week basis.  Maintaining this <i>status quo<\/i>will do nothing to improve the sustainability of services, expand those services or help the poor pay and conditions of staff, which has led to a staffing crisis whereby our members cannot recruit or retain the staff needed to comply with the regulatory requirements in the sector, never mind to expand.  This crisis is being witnessed daily and our members' expansion in line with the introduction of the second free preschool year is being curtailed.<br\/><br\/>This should be a scheme for children with their best interests at the core of its design.  Instead, it feels overwhelmingly like a scheme for and, in terms of labour market activation, about parents.  Labour market activation appears to be the overarching consideration in the development of the targeted subsidy.<br\/><br\/>I hope the committee will indulge me in going off my submitted script and reverting to something that we heard at this morning's first session.  We were concerned to learn that the automated part of the scheme as regards the targeted approach will not be ready for September.  I must emphasise that this is a major issue.  The introduction of ACS is a key aspect of the development of Ireland's child care infrastructure.  We have gone from the potential of having a win-win scheme to the significant risk that parents' expectations will be raised by a communications plan and cannot be delivered upon by the scheme.  We must be cautious about a communications plan around a scheme that is not ready so that it does not become a failed expectation or experiment at the outset.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the change from a 48-week a 52-week funding model, which we had suggested from the start, and we will continue to advocate on issues of concern to our members, many of whom we will probably hear about at this meeting.  These issues are: the hourly subsidy and hourly fee; the assumption around parents' access to and competency with computers and technology; the administrative burden on services; the requirement on providers to police absences and changes in child care provision; and, most importantly, the inadequate cost model from the outset with no consideration for professionalisation.<br\/><br\/>We are scrutinising the heads of the Bill, the general scheme of the ACS and the revised FAQs and we look forward to working with the committee and the wider Oireachtas membership so as to ensure robust legislative scrutiny and that the scheme, when commenced, represents a move towards a model of child care that can deliver the best quality for children in their formative years, viability and sustainability for early years services and their staff, and access and affordability for parents to child care facilities and services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#M01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Heeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Heeney.

The Association of Childhood Professionals, ACP, is a professional body representing practitioners in early years and school age care and education.  We are a voluntary organisation and all of our council members give freely of their time so that we can fight for the profession that we value so much, but that is at the bottom of the pile when it comes to recognition, respect and remuneration.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the concept of a single affordable scheme.  Such a scheme facilitates the streamlining of existing schemes and provides a platform for investing in early childhood education and care.  Increased investment is important if we are to provide high-quality, affordable services to the children and families with whom we work.  Given the focus of our association, we have reviewed the ACS from the perspective of the early childhood education and care workforce.<br\/><br\/>When child care was first offered outside of the family, it was generally provided by the woman who lived down the road and took in a few children to supplement the family income as she raised her own children.  There were no requirements in terms of qualifications, regulations, inspections, observations, curriculum planning, continuous professional development, community involvement, etc.  This woman kept the child happy, safe and fed, and then her job was done.<br\/><br\/>The vista of early childhood education and care is vastly different in 2017.  The practitioner is now a professional person whose role extends beyond care work with children.  Professional responsibilities include supporting the child and family during this critical stage of development and, as a result, the early childhood professional is now an early childhood educator, administrator, curriculum planner, researcher, cleaner, counsellor, communicator, parent coach, nurse and facilitator.  The list goes on.  As the CoRe report reads, &quot;[Early childhood education and care] is increasingly expected to fulfil societal expectations regarding active citizenship and democracy, offering a strong foundation for lifelong learning, contributing to reducing child poverty, realising equal opportunities, and strengthening creativity and innovation in young children.&quot;  The amazing thing is that all of these professional services and societal contributions are provided by capable multi-taskers who earn little more than the minimum wage.<br\/><br\/>The language of the draft ACS document reflects a serious disregard for staff working in early childhood education and care.  At one point it states, &quot;Efficiency can be achieved through combining part-time places ... and through managing staff resources ... at different times of day and different times of the year&quot;.  In practice, this would require the introduction of zero-hour contracts and further reduce the job security of an already underpaid, primarily female, workforce.  The ACP views this as contrary to the Government's stated objective of supporting the professionalisation of the early years workforce and increasing quality provision.  It is well documented nationally and internationally that working conditions and pay are central to providing high-quality early childhood education and care.  The quality of the relationships between the children and the workforce are a key indicator of high-quality provision.  Attracting and retaining a professional workforce are vital if these relationships are to flourish.<br\/><br\/>The draft ACS document sets a subsidy rate based on current schemes available in early years.  This assumes that current subsidies cover the cost of delivering schemes.  As many recent reports have indicated, there are serious sustainability issues in many services, meaning that existing subsidy levels are generally insufficient to meet current costs of provision.  There is no allowance made for increasing wages that arise as a result of professionalising the early years workforce.  Qualification requirements have been introduced to our profession, yet subsidy rates remain at pre-qualification levels.<br\/><br\/>The wage rate used in the draft ACS document is &euro;10.79 for practitioners, although this figure is likely to be reduced due to the Minister's announcement that the scheme will now employ a 52-week as opposed to a 48-week funding model.  While this figure is slightly above the average rate currently being paid, it is still significantly below the living wage and will provide little incentive for attracting or retaining a qualified and motivated workforce.  The most recent Pobal early years sector profile indicates that 18% of staff were working in their respective centres for less than one year.  Pobal believes that this is an indicator of significant staff turnover.  The report also states that more than half of the staff are aged between 25 and 44 years.  This is the time when many are hoping to buy a home and start a family.  Current pay and conditions will not support these aspirations and, as such, will result in a loss of professionals from the workforce or push them into poverty.<br\/><br\/>Providing a high-quality early years service requires significant planning, documentation and continuous professional learning.  There is little provision for these in the costing for the ACS.  If the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is serious about ensuring high quality, there needs to be adequate provision for this in the ACS document.  The Department is committed to providing an independent review of the cost of child care, but it makes no sense that this review would happen after the ACS begins.  True costs need to be established before the new funding model is introduced.  Unfortunately, the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme has proven that, if a scheme is not costed properly before its inception, conditions will continue to deteriorate, as there is little Government appetite to redress the difficulties imposed on providers and their staff.<br\/><br\/>The draft ACS document makes reference to the use of an hourly rate for child care subsidies, thus encouraging providers to charge an hourly rate for child care.  The use of an hourly rate is not consistent with sustainable provision and thus further endangers the security of the workforce.<br\/><br\/>The early childhood workforce is at breaking point and can no longer afford to deliver this level of service for the pay it receives.  This and successive Governments are taking advantage of good people who are committed to providing support to young children and families throughout the country.  It is exploitation, pure and simple.  It has to stop.  As one early childhood professional stated:<\/p><blockquote>I wonder why I bother; I am often on the verge of tears with exhaustion and frustration.  Then I think of how much I love my job and the incredible enjoyment and fulfilment I get from working with young children.  The government, both past and present, are taking advantage of my commitment and of the commitment of hundreds of other early years workers.  I feel a fool to keep going.<\/blockquote> <p>Many have to take on a second job and increasing numbers are making the difficult decision to leave the profession that they love but in which they cannot afford to remain.  Car loans, mortgages, pensions and medical insurance are unaffordable.  Employers struggle to take a wage themselves after they pay all of the costs associated with delivering high-quality early childhood education and care.  Wage bills account for 60% to 80% of these costs even though many are on little more than the minimum wage.<br\/><br\/>The young children of this country have a right to high-quality early childhood education and care.<\/p><p>Their families have the right to societal support in rearing their children and the professionals providing this high-quality early childhood education and care and support have the right to be recognised, respected and remunerated for their work.<\/p><p> In the context of the workforce development plan for the early childhood care and education sector in Ireland,  the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, former Deputy Barry Andrews, said, &ldquo;The development of the ECCE workforce has been identified as a key 'pillar of quality' alongside sustained financial investment in service provision.\"  He also stated, &ldquo;The challenges are undoubted but the rewards are also clear; a better prepared, skilled workforce in our early childhood care and education settings will improve the quality of centre based early childhood experiences of our children and impact positively on the lives of the children and their families.&rdquo;  The document highlighted that, &ldquo;National and international research has established that the skills and qualifications of adults working with young children is a critical factor in determining the quality of young children&rsquo;s early childhood care and education experiences.&rdquo;<\/p><p> Unfortunately all this rhetoric was followed by, &ldquo;While issues such as the status and the terms and conditions of employment of people working in the sector-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Marian Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I must stop Ms Quinn.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Eugene Waters.  We represent the 30 national city and county child care committees, CCCs, throughout the country.  We welcome the opportunity to bring forward our views on the new single affordable child care scheme to be introduced this year.  The CCCs welcome the introduction of this national scheme, which will provide much needed financial support towards the cost of child care for parents.  The targeted supports in the scheme for working parents will help remove one of the barriers to employment for many parents.  Parents who qualify for these supports will have access to subsidised wraparound care on an annual basis.  This will enable eligible parents to choose and plan the best care for their children for up to a maximum of 40 hours per week over 52 weeks.<\/p> <p>  The universal supports are a welcome intervention for parents who are not in employment.  The new scheme recognises in particular the importance of child care services for children under the age of three.  The parental choice aspect of the scheme ensures parents have freedom to choose the best care for their children whether it be a structured full day care service or a child minder in the home-care setting.  The shift in the nature of eligibility will provide access to subsidised child care for many working families with low income levels who do not qualify for support under the current programmes such as the community childcare subvention, CCS, scheme and the training and education childcare, TEC, subsidy.<\/p> <p>  The streamlining of eligibility criteria will benefit both parents and child care providers.  The benefit to parents in work or education will be that eligibility will be based on one clear process for one scheme instead of the current process, which uses a set of complex criteria for each programme, CCS, the child care employment and training support, CETS and TEC.  CCS eligibility is based on the parent being in receipt of a social welfare payment.  CETS eligibility is based on the course the parent is attending being recognised by the education and training boards, ETBs, as eligible for the subsidy.  We expect this change to determining eligibility will greatly reduce the levels of administration for the child care providers, given that they will be required to have only one fee policy as opposed to one for each programme, which is the current practice.<\/p> <p>  While the new scheme will cater for existing programme users and bring a new cohort of working parents into subsidy benefit, there will be a small cohort of vulnerable children who will no longer qualify for subsidy support.  In particular, children whose parents are unemployed and currently availing of vital early intervention supports from community child care provision.  It is important that such cases are explored further to mitigate any possible negative impact on the welfare and outcomes for such children.  An example is stand-alone community after school services in areas of high disadvantage.  These services provide key intervention supports to primary school children helping meet their educational and social needs.  Head 5 of the new scheme allows for Tusla to support children on child welfare or child protection grounds.  Some of the children using the services will fall outside of Tusla&rsquo;s threshold but most definitely require support.<\/p> <p>  CCI recommend policymakers consider alternative supports for these child care services providing supports to vulnerable families.  Our UK neighbours operate targeted supports direct to early years services which are providing essential early intervention to vulnerable children.  This type of support is not new to Ireland.  Before the introduction of the current child care programmes, community services received block funding from the HSE to ensure that child care places were available to vulnerable families in need of support.  These children were usually referred by the HSE team, for example social workers, community workers and public health nurses.  Today, we have the Meitheal programme within the Child and Family Agency that is committed to supporting families where there would be a child welfare or safety concern.  This service could be a vehicle for identifying the child care needs of a family and making a referral to support the child's access to the child care service.<\/p> <p>  CCI expects to provide an increased level of support to child care services in the area of financial advice and support during the transition phase of this new scheme.  This will be necessary to ensure services can sustain themselves and remain open in light of the fluctuation in child enrolments as we move from a snapshot enrolment core funding model to the funding following the child based on parental income.  The CCCs have well established systems in place to provide this type of support.  For example, our recent work with community services to address the issues of reliance on community employment staff, supports this.<\/p> <p>  Members will have heard from some sectoral groups the call for support for parents to be assisted with online applications to the new scheme.  These supports are already in place through the CCC structure.  My colleague, Mr. Eugene Waters, will elaborate further on the supports provided by CCCs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Woods"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>The CCCs act as an information hub for parents regarding current child care programmes.  We publish a parent guide to child care programmes annually and there are regular updates on our websites and social media.  We also provide one-to-one telephone support and, importantly, a physical presence throughout each city and county in the country.  We provide hot desk supports to child care providers who do not have access to the Internet, reside in areas where broadband is poor or need IT support.  CCCs have been increasingly dedicated to locally managing the administrative processes associated with the various schemes.  CCCs have direct reach into all 4,500 child care services nationally, and, importantly, a county identity for parents.<\/p> <p>  The CCCs have remained focused on responding to local need but, equally, they have been very responsive to the implementation of a range national programmes on a consistent basis.  Since the introduction of the programme implementation platform, PIP, the CCCs have supported over 4,500 early years services to access and administer their compliance requirements via this online system.  This is often by way of one-to-one support on requirements such as fees policies, contract renewal and child registration.  The new access and inclusion model, which was launched in June 2015, offered a multi-level, inter-agency approach to increasing access, inclusion and supports for children with disabilities to the government&rsquo;s Early Childhood Care and Education, ECCE, scheme.  During the development of the model, CCCs were involved in the development of all seven tiers of the model via representation by CCI on behalf of its membership.  On commencement of the model, all CCCs have undertaken delivery of actions aimed primarily at levels 1 to 3 but also general information and support for parents throughout the counties.  CCC staff members have received training of trainers in preparation for the roll-out of equality, diversity and inclusion training across the country, which is already under way.<\/p> <p>  CCCs have assumed responsibility from Tusla for the roll-out of the Always Children First child protection training programme for early years settings with a stated aim of ensuring staff from every service throughout the country receive accredited child protection training.  The roll-out of this training is co-ordinated and delivered at city and county level by CCCs.  More than 12,500 early years practitioners were trained by the end of December 2016.<\/p><p>We welcome the proposal that Pobal undertake the administration of the scheme in light of their existing and long-standing relationships with the city and county childcare committees and the child care providers nationally.<\/p><p> The value of a local delivery agent in the form of the child care committees, CCCs, working with the sector is an important building block for the sector and remains so.  It is a cost effective model for the local delivery of national policy.  For example, the recent introduction of the expanded ECCE programme was supported by CCCs, which are working closely with the Department and local providers to confirm there remains sufficient capacity to cater for eligible children.<\/p><p> This approach has been further strengthened through our national network, Childcare Committees Ireland, CCI, which provides a coherent structure for various bodies, in particular the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, to plan and implement its national policy brief.  CCI, as the national network, works closely with a range of stakeholders to ensure we put in place strong, effective systems to support parents with our partners, Pobal, the national early years quality development service, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Social Protection and Education and Skills and the voluntary child care organisations.  We look forward to supporting the successful implementation of the new scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Waters","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Waters.

I am not sure whether the other two groups had an opportunity to follow the questioning of the Department and Pobal this morning on the issue of whether the IT systems will function appropriately for the targeted element of the new scheme.  I find that alarming and I know providers will find it very alarming, as will parents.  Is it possible that the universal element of the scheme will be rolled out?  I know there is a transition for people who can stay on the older schemes if they are more beneficial.  I would welcome the views of witnesses on the issue of which we have only become aware this morning.  We will be dealing with the legislation as it moves forward and wish to reflect the views of people involved in the sector in terms of the capacity of the scheme in September and whether there should be some modification of that.<\/p> <p>  The other piece of information we teased out this morning relates to people not being able to access the scheme when the money runs out.  I seek the witnesses' view on that issue.  While the Chairman indicated that we are not to talk about the general problem of people working in the sector, there are elements of this scheme that touch on it.  I quoted from the presentation of the ACP to the Department and Pobal this morning about the fear of zero-hours contracts and I was given an explanation by a departmental official.  I am not sure whether the witnesses heard the response but it was said that it was just about facilitating parents who need afternoon sessions, for example.  I would welcome more elaboration from the witnesses about their concerns that the scheme could lead to zero-hours contracts because none of us would wish to see that happen.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the child care committees, Mr. Waters spoke about dealing with the capacity of the system and that part of their work is to advise the Government and the Department on the capacity of the system in different parts of the country.

It is not beyond our remit to remark on that.<\/p> <p>  My first three or four questions are primarily for the ACP and Early Childhood Ireland and then I will ask one or two short questions of the child care committees.  Reference was made to the fact that ECCE is not being incorporated from the get-go.  Why do the witnesses believe that is the case?<\/p> <p>  I support what was said in terms of approximately 10% of administration costs needing to be factored into the cost of child care.  A point that was regularly referenced previously about child care workers is that there were difficulties with people involved in the sector having to go to the Department of Social Protection during the summer months.  Does this scheme improve the situation to some extent or will there still be a difficulty because people require fewer hours during the summer?  What way is that likely to play out in terms of engaging with the Department of Social Protection on such payments?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made in the ACP submission to the effect that we should not be talking about hourly rates but should take a much broader view and consider a salary approach.  I would welcome a comment in that regard.  As things stand, given the first-come-first-served element of the scheme, how do the two organisations see this playing out in September?  Will it be chaotic or just difficult?<\/p> <p>  The Minister made reference to the fact that the CCCs will administer a sustainability fund of approximately &euro;1 million for community facilities due to changes in regulation.

It must be able to make preparations.

I think it was included in its pack today.  We engaged an accountancy firm to carry out an investigation into the cost of child care.  I imagine that the information is quite similar to some of that the Department intends to gather to inform the affordable childcare scheme.  One of the key findings in our report was that the issues of affordability, sustainability and quality were entirely interconnected.  As we know and Senator M&aacute;ire Devine has just said, if there is a high turnover of staff, it has huge implications for quality.  The reason there is a high turnover of staff is 14% of staff in early years services are on 38-week contracts and required to go on the dole during the summer.  While I accept that we are here to talk about the affordable childcare scheme, it has, as Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire said, been calculated, costed and budgeted for on the basis of the minimum wage.  Staff working in services are earning just over &euro;11 per hour.  If someone has a degree, he or she is likely to receive &euro;1 more.  That is the reality and the reason it forms an intrinsic part of this conversation.  We cannot talk about the affordable childcare scheme without talking about the delivery mechanism.  It must be recognised that parents and children are the beneficiaries, but they can only become the beneficiaries of the scheme if there are adequate staff and operators in the sector to deliver it for the Government.

I will ask Ms Gaynor to speak about this because she is one of our members who operates a service.  What we know is that parents have heard something about the introduction of the scheme and want to know the details.  That presents a very significant problem if the targeted element will not be available in September because parents are already booking their children into services on the assumption that the scheme will be available.  For example, if a parent expects to have access to the targeted element in September and the calculation is not made until the January, will there be a shortfall?

However, as providers, they expect us to be the experts and have that information available.  It is very difficult to support families and parents if we know nothing about a scheme.  Knowing about it in September will be way too late for us.  There is a huge influx of ECCE children in September; therefore, the enrolment element must be looked at also.  From a parents' perspective, the information needs to be available much sooner - by May at the latest - particularly for services that operate on a sessional basis and that operate from primary schools which may be closed during the summer.  I work in a service that operates from a primary school.  We also offer a full day care service, but as many parents do not use our service during the summer, we close.  Parents need the information before September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Valerie Gaynor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Ms McArdle will answer some of the other questions asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Heeney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I will address the question asked by Deputies Anne Rabbitte and Kathleen Funchion about the cost model to be used.  The difficulty we see with it is that the current figures and model underpinning the affordable childcare scheme have been conceived on the flawed or inaccurate premise that the current financial models in the early years sector are working.  We know that they are not on the basis of a report we produced entitled, Doing the Sums: The Real Cost of Providing Childcare - the committee has received a copy of the executive summary - as well as a report entitled, Breaking Point, produced by the South Dublin County Partnership, among others, that looked at sustainability in community settings.  Unfortunately, the findings made in these reports have been referenced in support of the cost model the Department has used, but that is not what was intended.  The message is very clear.  We have found that the current financial models are helping to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>whereby services, at best, break even - many are struggling even to do this - and highly professional staff are on low pay and employed on part-time and 38-week contracts.<\/p><p>There was a question from Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire as to whether this scheme had the potential to alleviate the numbers of staff drawing social welfare payments in the summer months.  That will only happen if the funding is sufficient for staff to be maintained over a 52-week basis.  Again, that depends on the funding that underlies the scheme.<\/p><p> Consideration needs to be given as to whether the scheme should be halted until the independent review takes place.  It is extremely important.  The success of the scheme will be hugely undermined and the survival of the sector will be called further into question if we do not get the cost model right from the start.  What is really important about that independent review is that it actually states as part of the commitment in A Programme for Partnership Government that it will be consistent with the principle of ongoing professionalisation of the sector.  As the committee probably knows, we are striving towards a graduate-led early years sector, with 60% by 2025.  In a Pobal report on a survey of the early years sector, only 18% of early years educators have a level 7 qualification or higher and this is all related to staff pay, poor pay and poor conditions.  The ability of the sector to retain and recruit staff is intrinsically linked to the pay and conditions in the sector.  Ultimately the success is undermined if all of that is not addressed and dealt with from the outset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Amy McArdle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I want to comment on some of these points, Chair.  For the vision of the affordable childcare scheme, ACS, to be realised, it requires significant expansion.  We in Early Childhood Ireland certainly have concerns that we do not currently have capacity planning infrastructure or workforce planning infrastructure.  The existing early years infrastructure in the country, while already big and growing, is not sufficient to deliver ACS to all of the families to which it hopes to deliver.  That requires the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and probably the whole of Government to look at what size they think the sector needs to be to deliver for all of the families it envisions being able to access the affordable childcare scheme.  It has to ensure that no existing services are displaced while developing a capacity plan.  There is currently no provision for that in the form of new contracts or new entrants into the free pre-school year contract and potentially into the affordable childcare scheme contract.<\/p> <p>  Currently we have a situation where there could be 25 services in Ennis, for example, and another ten could open without a point of view being taken about assessment of need in Ennis for Government-funded programmes.  That all speaks to a need to develop a capacity plan and a definition of what we mean by our early years sector, what we want it to do for children and families and how we want to staff it and ensure that there are sufficient staff.  When we have that capacity planning considered and policy developed, that will inform the development of a workforce planning strategy.  Currently, while we sit here and talk about there being an issue with the workforce, the reality is there are not sufficient numbers of staff to deliver the affordable childcare scheme.  There is a huge crisis of recruitment into the sector and a huge crisis, as we heard earlier, of retention within the sector.  The advent of the new regulations, where people have to have a Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, level 5 qualification, has created an acute shortage of new entrants at level 5 but at the same time, because the salaries are so poor at level 7, people are leaving the sector.  There is a real problem about whether or not we can actually deliver the affordable childcare scheme because we do not know if we have enough staff.  We do not have a workforce planning process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Heeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Does Ms Quinn want to answer any questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#R00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I will address comments and questions about the cost analysis.  The draft document for the ACS refers repeatedly to decisions based on price-capping or whatever else about the cost basis being subject to an independent review.  All the figures are estimates and guesses.  Some are based on flawed evidence and some are based on more robust evidence.  It acknowledges left, right and centre throughout that the decisions that need to be made and the proper investment is all subject to the independent review.  It seems fundamentally flawed that the review is going to happen afterwards.  It is as if one is saying one will put something in place for now and then get the costing right when one looks at it down the line.  The difficulty with that can be seen with what I alluded to in relation to the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme.  It was similar in that the figure was not costed in respect of the costs on a nationwide basis and for some people it was sufficient while for others, it made their services unsustainable.  It has stayed since.  It actually was reduced and then the figure was reviewed again and that reduction was changed.  That has been since 2010 and it is now 2017.<\/p> <p>  The costs of delivering a service have increased over the years.  We continue to talk about insurance having gone absolutely crazy.  There is professionalisation, the cost of resources, materials, all of the things, as well as regulations that require more and more to be delivered for a higher quality service.  Every single bit of that is right if one is looking for quality but it all costs.  We have had seven years of having pretty much the same amount of money.  One can throw in on top of that an increase in the minimum wage - as there should be - and we should not even be talking about minimum wage when it comes to this profession.  We have all those costs across a seven-year basis, which has meant that scheme, which was eventually expanded, has made it more unsustainable for everybody that is in it and has compromised the level of quality that people can, want, and need to deliver.  They still have to do it within that pot.<\/p> <p>  Our concern, and that of many people to whom I have spoken, is that we will introduce this ACS as is, because we will then see what can happen afterwards, where it can go and what level of investment is needed as it is a platform for the future.  We are talking about the reality of now, however.  We have been looking at that reality in respect of what happened with the ECCE scheme for seven years and with no sign of that changing.  It got worse.  Where will we be in another seven years?  That takes us to 2024, 2025 or whenever for funding that would be available for increasing the model based on an independent review.  We cannot wait.  We cannot have that expectation or not know where or how things are going to be.  At the moment we have people hanging on by their fingernails in terms of being able to stay open and to provide quality services and all that goes with providing those services.  They are only holding on because they think that things have to get better.  For years they have been saying that things have to get better.<\/p> <p>  Now we are finding that people are closing because they are going.  It is the double-edged sword of professionalising in that people are saying hang on a second, I have this qualification, I will get extra, for example, as a support person in early years child care.  People did not get into working in the early years sector because it was going to be a big money spinner or anything.  They got into it because they want to deliver a high-quality service for the children and parents.  That has been compromised and despite the fact that the ACS document talks about quality often, it also simultaneously makes references to working to minimum ratios and all of those things can impact on quality.  If one has 11 children in a service and one provider with those 11 children, one can provide a service.  If there is an extra staff member covering, floating, whatever, then an extra quality service can be provided.  This is going for the minimum and we are aspiring for quality.  That is a concern and that is why the cost analysis coming afterwards would be a big difficulty.<\/p> <p>  The matter of zero-hour contracts is a reality that we are facing.  Page 105 of the ACS document refers to reducing staff members in times of low demand during the day, week and year in order to maintain high occupancy rates, and that is the concern.  What happens if children get a bout of chickenpox?  I do not know because we do not know the details of how this is going to work.  If there is a bout of chickenpox, every provider will say that it will go through the service and it is down a certain number of children.  Does that mean a staff member can come in on such a morning and be told to go home because the service will have fewer children and to not get paid because only a certain amount of money is available?  It is a concern.  Not having to sign on in the summer has the potential to make the job more stable.  Again that is double-edged because there is the fact that if people are signing on for the summer, at least they do not have their child care cost, which is substantial.  However, if they have a child care cost then maybe what they are earning in the service will not cover the child care cost for them in many cases.  How will they manage to keep their family sustainable and out of poverty?  There is a real fear about zero-hour contracts.  For some places, it will be more a reality than others.<\/p><p>We do not have any information on the review, the cost analysis.  We have asked when it will be rolled out.  I do not know; other people might know more.<\/p><p> There was a question about why the ECCE scheme was not included from the start.  I can understand the logic for not including it from the start given that it was such a tight timeframe to get the other schemes in place.  There was so much difficulty rolling out the ECCE scheme, which was massive.  I would not say it is completely bedded down; it is just about sorted.  At least we have got one thing going right now after all the time.  However, it would make sense if rolling out a scheme to have it all in there.  That was part of the rush to get it out for September.  As has been alluded to, there is a difficulty with that September date in terms of timeframe.<\/p><p> There is a big difficulty with the hourly rates.  My colleague, Mick Kenny, has seen it already.  He is managing a service in a seriously disadvantaged area.  He is already looking at providing a sessional service, a part-time service and a full-day care service.  Some parents have booked their high-needs children in for the part-time or full-time service because the children can get a meal.  It is a warm environment for them and they are not getting that in their home environment for various reasons.  So they are able to provide that level of support.  If a parent collects a child early - for example, after 4.5 hours rather than five hours - that brings down his subsidy rate.  Pobal is looking for that in its compliance audits.  It is pointing out that on those days when the child is picked up early, it only counts as part-time, resulting in a reduced subsidy to the service, which means the food and heat and general support they provide for the children are threatened.<\/p><p> Regarding that hourly rate, how does one fill it?  If somebody wants their child in for three hours and nobody wants the lunchtime space for whatever reason and then one wants them afterwards how does one fill it and how is one sustainable in that regard.?  It will create a difficulty with the rate.<\/p><p> There are higher costs depending on the geographical areas.  That will be a really difficult challenge.  We know that the people's cost of living and the costs for buildings are huge.  How do we get the balance for that?  If a figure in between is picked, some services will do well and other services will effectively close.  As was alluded to earlier, it is really disappointing that the reports that are evidence in terms of the costing and this document are those that point to sustainability.  This is what it currently costs to deliver per unit and it is unsustainable.  Some of the services based on this cost structure will be closing in three months, six months or a year.  That is the costing that is put in which would be a real concern for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Marian Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I will answer Deputy Rabbitte's question even though she is not here.  Regarding the true cost of child care and the issue of sustainability, it is important that the CCCs are here as a Government-funded support to the child care.  We are not mandated in any way to speak for the child care services, which is what Ms Heeney and Ms Quinn do.  The true cost of child care is subject to many complex variables in terms of the structure of the delivery, the geography and how providers offer their service.  We will obviously await the outcome of the independent Department of Children and Youth Affairs review.<br\/><br\/>This not the first major change to child care.  Previously, community services were in receipt of a staffing grant and that moved to the community subvention, which was a major shift in the model.  Equally, the launch of the ECCE scheme represented a seismic shift.  Over the years, the CCCs have had a long history of working locally within their various counties to support those services.  They have built up robust and evidence-based tools that are used.  They are used by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in the context of the CE programme, in respect of which Ms Woods will answer Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's question.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked about capacity.  As Ms Heeney mentioned, the majority of parents who may access this new programme are <i>in situ<\/i>.  It is not all new parents.  It is important not to underestimate the capacity within the scheme either.  Just over a year ago the Government announced it had expanded the ECCE programme which increased the numbers eligible for the scheme by almost 100%.  There would have been questions over the capacity in the sector to meet those demands at the time.  Working with the services and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the CCCs were able to locally monitor whether there was capacity for that ECCE expansion so that no child who was eligible for the ECCE programme was unable to do that.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has been very responsive where the sector has identified small policy changes that are required.  For example, the service providers mentioned that they needed to be paid higher capitation by room as opposed to by whole service and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs responded to that.  Equally, there have been and continue to be capital investment programmes supporting the expansion of capacity within the sector.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Funchion asked if we thought the scheme should be held up while we wait.  I am not mandated to speak on behalf of the earlier services because our role is in terms of providing support.  I am not sure if everybody in the room is familiar with the PIP scheme where the service is used to register children, calculate payments, etc.  As Ms Quinn said, that has taken time to bed in.  However, it now calculates, for instance, how much subvention is available per child and when those payments are due.  There is a schedule that works around any fluctuations in that.  Services having had support have got used to that.<br\/><br\/>When that was first announced, there were great expectations for what it might do on day one.  It has taken until day 101 to achieve some of that functionality.  The CCCs did some of that manual paperwork behind the scenes to ensure the children were registered and the paperwork was done even if the interface of it was essentially IT-based, some of the functionality of it happened through a paper exercise.  It would be a shame to delay the benefits of the scheme to parents, which people have acknowledged, when by working together and utilising the supports available, those challenges are not insurmountable.<br\/><br\/>I will ask Ms Woods to speak now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Waters"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan referred to the IT systems not being in place.

There will be that saver year where they retain benefits.  It is not ideal that the IT system will not be ready.  However, the current system is paper based for parents anyway, whereas it is online for the child care services.<\/p><p> In regard to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's question about CE sustainability funding, that is finalised and is on the Minister's desk to be signed off.  We expect to hear about that very shortly.  Pobal has in place the mechanisms as to how that will be drawn down.

In my own county, we are talking about perhaps seven community services out of the 110 services in the county.  They are services for children who will not meet the Hardiker model of child protection at level three for the current Tusla support, which is mentioned in the scheme.  They come in at levels one and two, which is family supports.  Their parents will not qualify under the current eligibility criteria, that is, they are not in work or education.  We are not talking about a significant number of services but they provide significant supports to vulnerable children.  There are models and ways of working with that.  Historically, there have been supports, through funding directly to community services, for booking places specifically for children who may be referred for some sort of family support but who are not necessarily going to need the support of a social worker.  We do not expect it to be a significant number.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017020800002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Woods","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":274,"content":"<p>We are up against the clock but we will return to these issues.

Our non-domestic customers are generally all metered.  Our domestic household customers, as the Deputy mentioned, are roughly 50:50 with meter or still pay on the basis of the local government property tax or the rateable value of the property.  A small number of customers are not metered because it is technically difficult to do so.  In such cases, we have what we call \"an assessed charge\".  We assess what the likely consumption is given the number of people in the household and they pay on that basis.<\/p> <p>  The household bills, whether they are non-metered or metered, are kept in sync by our pricing formulas.  That means a metered customer with the same consumption pays slightly more because of the additional costs of having, maintaining and reading a meter.  The vast majority of our metered customers have either moved into a new property or voluntarily asked to be metered.  That tends to mean that their consumption is lower than average.  In practice, the average bill for a metered customer is less than the average bill for a non-metered customer.  The nature of those customers tends to mean that their water consumption is quite a lot less than the unmetered customer.  They are either in a new property with more water efficient devices or they have self-selected or opted for a meter as they are a small household.  That is how our system works.  One pays on the rateable value basis as a default.

What we have in Scotland is born out of the fact that water was in local control in Scotland until 20 years ago.  Therefore, the basis for charging was linked to the way in which local authorities raised finance for their services.  <\/p> <p>  Customers are charged by reference to what we call council tax bands, which is the property charge based on the size of the property.  Although customers are charged on that basis, and their bills are raised and the money is collected by local authorities on our behalf, the charge levels are there purely to cover the costs of their water and wastewater services as set by an agreement between ourselves and our economic regulator.  Both those charges and the cash that is collected from those customers is remitted directly to us.  The points of commonality with local authority taxation are purely that we use a similar charging structure as it does through council tax bands.  In addition, on grounds of efficiency, a customer or resident in a property gets one bill partly for local authority services and partly for water and wastewater services.  When one looks at the face of that bill, it is very clear what the charge is for local authority services and, distinctly, what is the charge for water and wastewater services.<\/p> <p>  The second question was on using meters to drive down consumption and realise efficiencies.  We effectively have no metered household customers in Scotland.  We only have 600 out of 2.4 million households, which is negligible.  Like Mr. Jones said about Wales, we have a large metering penetration among business customers.  We have found that meters in district meter areas have helped us to understand leakage, drive down leakage levels and realise efficiencies.  Metering is a powerful tool but it does not necessarily need to be done at property level and can be done at district level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Douglas Millican"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I have a question on the charge element of the local property tax or local household charge or bill.

As the Senator may know from the material that we have submitted, Welsh Water is slightly unusual because it is a private and non-shareholder company.  Our corporate purpose is to further the interests of our customers and water conservation plays a key role.  We work in partnership with our customers to conserve water.  One of the reasons that we set our company up in this way 16 years ago was because we thought we would get better buy-in and support from our customers.  We hoped they would see that our purpose was fully aligned with theirs and it is part of our mission to encourage our customers to understand the value of water and the role that they can play in conserving water.<\/p> <p>  As we mentioned in our material, all children in Wales at key stage two will have a day's education with Welsh Water on one of our sites.  The excursion is very popular with teachers.  It is an opportunity for children to visit one of our education centres and learn the important skill of conserving water.  We have a mocked-up African village where children can get a sense of what it is like to live in a Third World country where one must walk to a river to collect water and then bring it back to the village.  We encourage our customers to help us and to value and preserve our water resources.  <\/p> <p>  In response to the second part of the Senator's question, none of our activities would be powerful if we were not seen to do everything that we can to conserve water.  The terminology that we tend to use is \"leakage\".  We analyse how much water we lose through our supply system.  It has been a major effort of focus for our company for the past couple of decades.  I am pleased to say that leakage has never been better under control than it is today.  Our leakage level is around 40% of where it was a couple of decades ago.  We have substantially reduced it.  Key to our success, as Mr. Millican has referred to, is control of the network.  We have multiple metering points in the network and a smart network to analyse all the data in real time.  We have computer algorithms that constantly look out for unexplained changes, fluctuations or variations in flows through the network as they suggest a leak has opened up.  We have further to go with this technology but we are looking at reducing leakage by 4% or 5% over this period.

I cannot comment on the position in Ireland as I am not aware of the background.  In Wales, the final pipe to the customer's property is the customer's legal responsibility.  However, as part of our water conservation activities, Welsh Water will fix a customer's pipe at least once every two years if there is a leak to ensure water is conserved.  We are able to identify leaks because we have a meter for each district of between 50 and 200 properties.  If a leak opens up on a supply pipe, we can spot it relatively quickly, even though there may not be a meter on the property in question.  In cases where people have a meter on their property, a reading of the meter will pick up supply pipe leaks, at which point we will intervene to help the customer deal with the leak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Jones"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486560600,"counter":294,"content":"<p>In terms of the broader system, I will, to a large extent, echo Mr. Jones's comments, because they also apply to us in Scotland.  The point about legitimacy cannot be stressed enough.  Before a company can begin to speak to customers about saving or conserving water, it must ensure it has its own house in order.  The whole issue of customer engagement is interesting.  One of the materials that we use is a document featuring an image of a child wearing a raincoat in torrential rain under the slogan \"Saving water in Scotland.  Really?\"  Saving water is a challenge because when people see abundant rain falling from the sky, they wonder why they need to save water at home.<\/p> <p>  We have been using a number of different conservation measures, one of which is to help people to understand the linkage between their use of water and their energy bills.  A significant percentage of an energy bill is derived from heating water.  We are working with the Energy Saving Trust in Scotland to convince people to think about water efficiency and energy efficiency at the same time.  There is also a rich seam that involves trying to influence building standards.  We have worked with the Scottish Government to try to have building standards tightened to ensure homes built in the future will be more water efficient than homes built in the past. <\/p> <p>  Another area in which we have been working is the social housing sector.  In Scotland, social housing stock is typically refreshed with new kitchens, bathrooms and so on every ten years.

This policy is, therefore, a form of proxy for affordability.  Second, this approach avoids the inherent overhead costs of having meters installed, to which Mr. Jones alluded, including the cost of fitting, maintaining and reading meters.  This is a way of keeping total system costs down, thus improving affordability for all customers.  We are doing a trial to identify what levers could give most effect to water conservation and whether providing a financial incentive gives a sustained benefit.  As the trial is at an early stage, I cannot comment on whether, on balance, metering would provide a sustained incentive for substantially lower consumption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020800002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Douglas Millican"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions.

This is the recommendation the joint committee is considering.  In Wales, approximately 50% of domestic customers have a water meter.  Mr. Jones, responding to a question from Deputy Colm Brophy, indicated that excessive use was roughly the same for customers with a meter and those without a meter.  How does Welsh Water measure usage among people who do not have meters?<\/p> <p>  Perhaps I misunderstood Mr. Jones's point, but I am interested in finding out how usage can be measured in the absence of meters.  I am aware that Welsh Water and Scottish Water use district meters, which are useful for identifying leaks and so forth.  However, as the committee must grapple with the recommendations of the expert commission, I am interested in finding out how excessive use would be measured in the absence of meters.

The simple fact in respect of non-metered customers is that we do not know what each individual household takes.  What we do is measure consumption for a neighbourhood.  A district is sealed area into which water is piped.  This allows us to see how consumption varies and gives us a good idea of average consumption in each district.  If there are businesses and so on in the district, their demand is netted off because they are metered, often in real time.<\/p> <p>  While we have a good idea of average consumption, we do not know what an individual property that is not metered consumes.  However, in the context of where we are coming from, that has not been the number one issue for us.  The main issues for us are getting control of the distribution network in order to reduce leakage in the network.  We have made major strides in this area through technology, focus and investment, which have made a significant difference.  We have reached what is known in the jargon at the economic level of leakage.  This is effectively the level of leakage which minimises bills to customers.  In every one of our zones, we make our calculations based on the cost of the water lost as against the cost of finding, fixing and so on so as to identify what is the optimal level.  That is the point we are achieving in all our zones, which means we are able to tell our customers that leakage is well under control and costing them the least amount possible.  That is probably the key point. <\/p> <p>  In terms of water conservation literature, as a not-for-profit company, we are very keen to work in co-operation with people elsewhere.

Scotland is unique in a European context in that it does not have domestic metered household charges based on consumption.  To further tease out Deputy Brophy's questions, I am interested to know how much of the local authority charge goes to the water component.  Is it a percentage depending on which band one is in?  How is that calculated?  Did it increase when Scottish Water was created or was it just that council tax bills were demarcated so that people were paying the same amount of money but knew what the portion going on water was?  Has there been any difficulty with the European Commission in terms of Article 9 of the Water Framework Directive and the polluter-pays principle or is it satisfied that notwithstanding the fact that Scotland does not have a domestic metered water charge that it is meeting its other obligations through the river basin management plan and the core objectives of the directive?<\/p> <p>  My questions for both sides are very simple.  We would be interested to hear the overall funding model of both Welsh Water and Scottish Water in terms of operational costs and capital programmes, in terms of revenues from domestic or commercial users and exchequer revenue vs loans, etc.  I would be interested to know average household consumption in both cases and overall leakage rates in the distribution system.  Here we have approximately 40% overall.  Senator Clifford-Lee referred to water poverty.  Do the companies track water poverty or have figures for the rates of water poverty in both Wales and Scotland?<\/p> <p> On metering, there is a body of international research which suggests that when meters are introduced there is an initial drop in consumption before it starts to move back to its original level as people become accustomed to it.  Is that something the witnesses have looked at and do they have an assessment over a period of time as to how meters changed behaviour?<\/p> <p>  My last question is to Scottish Water.  We have a similar situation here in the sense that local authorities were traditionally responsible for the delivery of water services.  One of the tricky issues has been the transfer or non-transfer of assets and staff from them to Irish Water.  That is an experience Scotland went through.  Can Mr. Millican tell us a bit about that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020800002#E00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486560600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I will kick off with the Scottish-specific questions.  The way charges are calculated is straightforward in the sense that for any given six-year period, which used to be a five-year period, we have a service to deliver and a whole set of improvements we need to make through investment that are set for us through a process of ministerial direction reflecting the priorities of our customers and water quality and environmental regulators.  We prepare a business plan as to what we think that will take and what it will cost and we then go through a process to agree that with our economic regulator and customers.  Then what is called the \"determination\" is set.  That sets the maximum charges we can levy on our customers each year for the next six years.  It is that and that alone that determines what goes into any individual's bill.  It has nothing to do with local authority finance raising at all.  It is purely through a discrete water process.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the issue of charging and the European Commission, that would be handled between the Commission and the Scottish Government rather than with Scottish Water.  However, I am certainly not aware of any particular pressure on the Scottish Government around our arrangements for charging.  To pick up the last question on the transfer I need to go back 21 years ago to April 1996 when water transferred from local authorities to Scottish Water.  What happened then was that it was a clean transfer of all the assets, rights and liabilities, including any loan debt.  At that point, it was transferred from the then 12 regional authorities into three regional water authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020800002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Douglas Millican"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Did that include the staff?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020800002#E00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486560600,"counter":307,"content":"<p>The staff engaged in water services transferred at that point 21 years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020800002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Douglas Millican"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486560600,"counter":308,"content":"<p>To pick up on some of the factual questions there, the key point to start with on financials is that we are a private company.  All of our funding has to come from charges to our customers or money we raise in the private capital markets.  In rough terms, we spend approximately &pound;300 million a year on operating and maintaining our business and service to supply a population of approximately 3.5 million people.  We spend getting on for &pound;350 million to &pound;400 million a year investing in asset legacy issues and new environmental and water quality standards.  Our investment is more than our running costs, which is unusual.  We then have just shy of &pound;150 million to service the debt we have raised in the past to fund our previous investment.  That is how our financials work out.<\/p> <p>  Without boring the committee with our history, one of the reasons we are set up the way we are is that we started off, unusually, as an exercise on a blank sheet of paper.  Myself and my colleague who set the business up in this way thought the key thing to do was secure long-term secure funding for investment.  Our business has a massive infrastructure need.  We are 27 years into that programme and our asset condition has improved hugely as have our standards and the leakage situation.  Leakage is about 20% on our network which is about the economic level for us in a rural network.  While we have made massive strides in all those areas, we continue to have a major investment programme for the foreseeable future.  For us to get that access to secure finances was crucial.  We are not in the government sector so we do not have, for good or ill, the option of government financing.  Our not-for-profit non-shareholder business model was all designed around making a virtue of that.  People are very keen to invest in long-term infrastructure if it has a secure revenue source to go with it.  That is why we are structured as we are.<\/p> <p>  Water poverty is a significant issue for us.  Large parts of Wales are not relatively prosperous.  As a consequence, approximately 15% of our customers are in what we consider water poverty which is that above a threshold, perhaps 3% of their disposable household income goes to pay water and wastewater charges.  As a company, we are helping approximately 65,000 customers a year currently with loosely subsidised charges, which is to say a lower level of charge because they have a lower level of household income.  Our aspiration is to grow that to the target we have set of 100,000 customers by 2020.  Ultimately, our aspiration is that every customer has a bill which is affordable.  To achieve that, we will need the support of government and others to have access to the data which shows who actually needs and deserves that support.  We have done a great deal of customer research around this issue and have strong buy-in from our customers to support those who genuinely cannot afford to pay.  In part that is because we are a not-for-profit company and customers have confidence that we are putting some of our money into supporting those customers and keeping the bills of the disadvantaged down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020800002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Jones"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486560600,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Our charging structure is designed, on foot of a government policy decision, to support affordability right across the customer base.

Much of the work we are doing, in formulating our opinions, is with the aim of having as fair a model as possible while ensuring that we have a system that is fit for purpose into the future.  Following on from Deputy O'Dea's comments, the fairness question arose in my mind when I envisaged two pensioners on a low income living in a large, old house compared to a younger family in a smaller house where there are two earners and that potentially the people in the bigger house pay more.  How does that fairness aspect work out?  Mr. Millican said there is a 25% discount for a single occupancy but what is the position for people in those circumstances?<\/p> <p>  Taking Mr. Millican's points on metering, it is fair to say there is no way of dealing with excessive usage by individual properties through the charging mechanism.  I take it from what Mr. Millican, based on goodwill, that the responsibility is not put back on the public to play their part in conservation as part of the charging mechanism?  Would that be a fair comment?<\/p> <p>  Mindful that the witnesses are sitting beside our regulator, what type of regulation do they come under?  Does it fall back on the Minister or do they have a regulator who plays a role?<\/p> <p>  The focus of all the questions so far has been on the water element as opposed to the wastewater element, which is half of our interest here.  How many septic tanks would the organisations be dealing with in Wales and Scotland?  How much of a consideration are they?  When both Welsh Water and Scottish Water were established, what type of wastewater problems did they encounter and inherit?  What progress have they made in dealing with those problems?  In Ireland, raw sewage is going into our watercourses at 40 points.  We have a huge legacy issue, for various reasons, in that regard and these issues have to be addressed.  That will be a key consideration for us.<\/p> <p>  Finally, what way does a charging mechanism impact on the wastewater element?

It is a self-selected group so the people who have meters have either moved into a new property, which tends to be more water efficient, with less supply pipe leakage etc., or, unlike in Mr. Millican's case, we have approximately 10,000 customers a year who opt to go on to a meter.  That is because they are low users so to go back to the previous question about a single occupier, the way one gets recognition in our system is to go onto a meter and because one is a low user one will then have a lower bill.

We would see a change in flow or pressure and we would hope to pick that up before customers are aware of it.  We would use a variety of communication techniques to let them know, but, in particular, we would send a text message to all the customers in that area.  In our system we can quickly work through from the hydraulic model, if there is a burst there, where our customers will be impacted and send information directly to them by text, social media or whatever way they have registered to let them know about such issues.  That is in the immediate area.  If we have planned works, which often are around aged water infrastructure, pipes, sewers or whatever, so working in someone's street, then we will go to a lot of effort to ensure that we have communicated face-to-face, by letter, and also with community events, drop-in centres and so on, so that the community knows and has had an input into how we are planning that work to minimise disruption.

We have a central control centre and call centre so anybody ringing in or on live chat or whatever would go into a central area.

We generally have local hubs as well, where case management officers would then pick up that customer's issue and liaise with him or her directly, and in particular provide the information to anybody who is actually visiting the customer at their property and therefore has got the full history of the issue and so on.  It is a mixture of centralised and local.  The point is that there are good communications through the systems between all those points of contact.<\/p> <p>  The sewer network is a massive issue for us in Wales.  We have a combined sewer network generally, much of which goes back to the period of industrialisation, certainly in south Wales and north-east Wales, the post-industrial areas.  Those systems have not had the investment over decades that they need to maintain steady quality.  We have done a lot of work and research on the implications of climate change and changing land use patterns, particularly on more impermeable areas in our towns and cities, such as people paving over their front garden for car parking, for example, and those sorts of issues.  The amount of run-off is increasing and due to changing weather patterns, the amount of storm events is increasing.<\/p> <p>  We took a decision about seven or eight years ago that we needed to put in place what we call in the jargon a sustainable urban drainage strategy for the long term.  We have come up with an approach called rainscape, which is about going into neighbourhoods and separating out the combined sewer network so that the rainwater and stormwater element is separate but retained within the local environment where it goes into planting areas, greens and things like that.  It is absorbed into the local environment rather than going into the combined sewer network and causing problems of spills because the system is overcharged and cannot cope with the volume.  That is something we have been doing successfully for the past five or six years, but we see this as being a generational investment programme.  Ultimately, we will go into every urban community in Wales and apply the rainscape approach, so that the drainage system can cope with the sorts of climatic experience we expect in 20 or 30 years' time.  On the back of that, there are really positive benefits as well to the wider community in terms of how it makes it a much greener environment, much better for biodiversity, quality of life and so on.  It is disruptive of the local community and one has to work closely with it, but we have had extremely good support where we have been pioneering this sort of work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020800002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Jones"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Just to be clear on that, for what part is Welsh Water responsible?

The data came from a data set based on actual meters installed on the Irish Water network.  As I said to Deputy Paul Murphy, the data derives from quarter two of 2016.  As to the households that were identified as having high consumption, the data set we have identifies whether those households have a leak.  That is based on the fact that the meter has a leak alarm.  During periods when one would expect there to be no water consumption, it will measure whether there is in excess of six litres per hour, or minute.  I will correct it later.  Basically, it will detect whether there is a leak.  What tends to happen is that households with very high consumption levels tend to have a leak.  As to whether that has been tackled, under the first fix free scheme, every household with a leak is notified and has the option of a free fix as long as the leak is between the outside of the dwelling and the meter.  If the leak is internal to the dwelling, it is up to the householder to fix the leak.<\/p> <p>  It is too early for us to extrapolate in terms of what we anticipate the progress being over time.  As part of our revenue control, Irish Water has submitted to us its expectation regarding leakage reduction over the coming two years.  We will hold Irish Water to that in terms of the overall financial settlement we have given it.  Irish Water has an ambitious overall target regarding leakage levels over time.

Our policy approach is that we allow anybody with a private supply to connect to the public system.  The support that we provide is capped at what we call the reasonable cost, which is effectively the function of the next ten to 12 years worth of revenue.  Any cost in excess of that would have to be met by the householder, the customer or the community connecting onto the public system.  There is no doubt that this is an area our Government is looking at as to whether there are further steps to be taken, recognising that in many cases the private water supplies do not meet the requisite EU regulations.

There is not much happening on the water supply side at the moment, but the waste water side is equally important.  Where there are septic tanks or small rural networks, there is a legislative provision there that a community can apply to the environmental regulator to put a duty on us to connect them up to the public network, and then there is a cost-benefit analysis as to whether the environmental benefit of that is worth the often substantial cost of joining them to the public sewer network.  Clearly these are quite rural, isolated communities, otherwise they would be on the public network anyway.  That is a process that communities can go through.

Mr. Millican seems to be saying there is no effective way of enforcing conservation because his company has no meters.  I understand why it has no meters because it is charging between &pound;200 and &pound;800 for a meter and between &pound;100 and &pound;300 for the survey, which seems an astronomical charge considering that his Welsh colleague is providing a meter to homes for free.  He said that one could detect leaks through district metering but these are a key consideration of the cost of production of water, as well as pipes and maintenance.  There is no way of encouraging a reduction in water usage through a meter charge and there is no incentive to people to lower their bill, given that it costs over &pound;1,000 to get a meter.<\/p> <p>  I gather that Scotland has the second highest per litre charge for water in the EU and that only Denmark is higher.  There seems no real way people can lower their bills so it seems to be an ideological choice at Government level not to allow easy access to meters for people who, for environmental and cost reasons, want to pay less for their water.  They have to pay a very high cost structure so that there can be an unmetered charge.  Mr. Millican spoke of the tap left running but there is no reason for someone to switch off the tap.  Without a domestic meter, the charge would be exactly the same as all other households in the area who turned off their tap.  Is that right?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020800002#M01300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486560600,"counter":461,"content":"<p>The example I gave of the tap left running was an isolated case I came across on one of the islands.  It is undoubtedly a policy choice on the part of the Scottish Government to support an unmeasured household charging structure.  It did that for reasons of social policy and to support affordability, especially for low-income households.  It is also to support a lower total system charge because we do not have the costs of the metering infrastructure and that benefits our customers.  Scotland has one third of the Great Britain landmass but its household charges are the second lowest in Great Britain and that shows the benefits to every customer of avoiding the overheads of the metering infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  All the charges for putting in a meter are regulated by our economic regulator to reflect the cost of installing meters.

I am seeking the joint committee's approval for the opt-in to the provisions of the directive as provided for under Protocol 21 to the Lisbon treaty.  The directive is part of a package reforming the legislation on new psychoactive substances.  In short, the purpose of the directive is to add new psychoactive substances, often known as \"head shop drugs\" or \"legal highs\", to the list of drugs subjected to criminal law provisions on illicit drug trafficking.<\/p> <p>  From a public health perspective, this is a very important measure.  New psychoactive substances pose significant public health and safety risks.  In 2009, 24 new substances were reported to the European early warning system.  By 2015 this figure had increased to 98, bringing the total number of new substances monitored to more than 560, of which more than 400 have been detected in the past five years alone.  The consequences for those who use these drugs are often fatal.  In 2014, the most recent year for which figures are available, there were 13 deaths resulting from the use of new psychoactive substances in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The effect of the directive for Ireland is that prohibited psychoactive substances will come under the standard criminal regime for dealing with drug trafficking under Irish law which is provided for in the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977.  Under this legislation, new psychoactive substances are controlled either by name or by generic definition, a precise definition of a group of substances which share the same compounds or molecular structure.  This approach has served Ireland well and ensures a quick response to new emerging substances.  While the substances are already illegal under Irish legislation, the directive will streamline and clarify the EU framework and ensure a swifter and better co-ordinated response at EU level for the benefit of all member states, including Ireland.<\/p> <p>  As well as extending the criminal law provisions which currently apply to substances covered by the UN conventions and synthetic drugs to new psychoactive substances, the directive also includes a definition of \"new psychoactive substance\", a provision to include new psychoactive substances in control measures and a provision which allows member states to maintain or introduce national control measures.  The directive is part of a legislative package designed to improve the European Union's response to the rapid emergence of new psychoactive substances.<\/p> <p>  There is an accompanying regulation which is designed to improve monitoring, early warning information exchange and risk assessment for new psychoactive substances.  Taken together, the legislation will ensure a quicker response to the emergence of new psychoactive substances by EU member states, including Ireland.  The European Council adopted its position on the package in December and negotiations with the European Parliament are expected to start shortly.<\/p> <p>  Under Protocol 21, Ireland has discretion to opt in to measures relating to criminal justice co-operation on a case by case basis.  Prior Oireachtas approval is required in accordance with Article 29 of the Constitution.  As the legal basis used for the directive, Article 83(1), is a Title 5 measure covering freedom, security and justice, it is subject to the opt-in clause.  This is the first time my Department has managed an opt-in process under Protocol 21 and it is also the first time the committee has had to consider such a request.  Under normal circumstances, the process is handled by the Department of Justice and Equality.  However, as it is the misuse of drugs legislation which falls under my Department that will be used to give effect to the directive, it was agreed by the two Departments that my Department would take the lead.  Therefore, the process involves motions being placed on the Order Papers of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, either for debate or referral to the appropriate committee.  In this instance, the motions were referred to the committee for consideration.  If approved, the directive will then be referred back to the Houses of the Oireachtas with the recommendation to approve.  Once approved formally by the Houses, the EU institutions will be notified.<\/p> <p>  I am here to ask the committee to approve Ireland&rsquo;s opt-in to this important public health measure.  The directive will allow for a more effective and efficient EU response to new psychoactive substances which appear on the EU market at an unprecedented pace and pose a risk to public health and safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#C00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Do members have observations to make or questions to ask?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#C00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>If it helps the joint committee, I approve of the motion.

The terms of reference were as listed in the published final report, which the committee has received.  Following preparatory work, I visited UHW on 7 June, Cork on 16 June and had separate detailed meetings with representatives of the acute coronary syndrome, ACS, programme, the Department of Health, the national ambulance service and the Health Service Executive.<\/p> <p>  I applied the following principles to the work: the primary concern is the quality of care that patients receive; conclusions and recommendations will be driven by data; and conclusions and recommendations will reflect scientific evidence as summarised in the published guidelines of relevant professional bodies.  The terms of reference required me to assess the needs of two distinct groups of patients, those undergoing planned, non-emergency procedures - approximately 96% of the patients - and those undergoing an emergency procedure called primary PCI, amounting to approximately 4% of the patients.  Regarding the 96% of patients who required planned, non-emergency procedures, my analysis indicated that the effective catchment population for the UHW cath lab was 286,147.  The cath lab procedural needs of this population could be accommodated in 12 weekly cath lab sessions of four hours each.  Hence, a second cardiac catheterisation laboratory at UHW was not justified on this basis.<\/p> <p>  I made the following recommendations.  The range of planned cath lab work that UHW currently undertakes for its catchment population should continue.  The cath lab service at UHW should be funded and staffed to provide 12 sessions of planned cath lab activity weekly.  A contingency for radiological equipment failure during a procedure, such as a portable fluoroscopy unit with an image intensifier, should be established if it is not in place already.  The cardiology services in the south-south west hospital group, and especially the teams at UHW and Cork University Hospital, CUH, should agree a strategy that makes best use of their combined excellent skills, cath lab facilities and teams in order to optimise clinical outcomes for all of the patients across the hospital group.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the 4% of patients who undergo emergency procedures, I concluded that the limited-hours, daytime primary PCI service at UHW does not meet the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society, BCIS, minimum standard of 100 cases per year.  BCIS has since updated its guidance and the absolute minimum standard is now 150 cases per year unless there is extreme geographical isolation.  The updated BCIS guidance has been made available to the committee.<\/p> <p>  It was, and remains, my opinion that expanding the service to provide 24-7 cover is not a sustainable solution.  Of the options available to resolve this situation, I concluded that UHW should cease the provision of primary PCI and that the interventional management of patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI, from this region should be consolidated in CUH and St. James's Hospital, Dublin.<\/p> <p>  I made the following recommendations.  The current limited-hours provision of primary PCI at UHW should cease so as to allow the centre to focus on the much larger volume of planned cath lab work.  Patients arriving to the emergency department at UHW should be considered as within a 90-minute drive time of CUH and should be transferred there for primary PCI without delay, irrespective of the time of day or night.  The interventional cardiologists at UHW should continue to make their primary PCI skills accessible for the benefit of patients by taking part in the 24-7 primary PCI rota centred in CUH.  A group of local clinical stakeholders, including representatives of the ambulance service, should review the current operation of the optimal reperfusion protocol for patients with STEMI in the south east who are more than a 90-minute drive from a 24-7 primary PCI centre.  The group should design the best future reperfusion protocol for these patients and should be led by the ACS programme of the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Herity"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Herity.

I thank the committee for facilitating that.<\/p><p>As Dr. Herity will be aware, there has been considerable fallout since the publication of the report.  The consultants working in UHW believe that it is flawed and have rejected its findings.<\/p><p>In 2012, Professor John Higgins wrote clearly on page 87 of his report:<\/p><blockquote>Waterford Regional Hospital will continue to provide invasive cardiology services for the South East population.

Why did Dr. Herity not consult him before undertaking this report?<\/p><p>I wish to address the apparent undercalculation of the catchment area.  In Dr. Herity's report, his stated opinion was that 286,147 was the referral population for planned cardiac cath lab procedures.  The 2016 census puts the catchment population at 582,000.  I put it to Dr. Herity that the catchment area is somewhere between 350,000 and 400,000 people, that is, anyone living within 90 minutes of UHW.  The report makes no reference to the 40% of patients who have private cover and travel to Dublin and Cork because there is no available capacity in UHW.  The calculations used did not take into account all of the factors and the review is inadequate, given that it is based on incorrect population figures.<\/p><p>One of the most worrying aspects is the note prepared by the HSE prior to Dr. Herity commencing his deliberations.  The note reads: &quot;it has been the view of the Department that providing additional facilities and extending PPCI (angioplasty) services, in a geographical area which does not have the population base to justify such a service, would be wasteful of very limited resources.&quot;  It is clear that the HSE was attempting to point Dr. Herity in the opposite direction prior to him commencing his deliberations.  This was gross interference in an independent review.

I have a number of substantive questions for Dr. Herity now.  I am trying to contextualise the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  Please forgive me if I oversimplify them and if I am wrong in my analysis of the report, Dr. Herity can correct me.<\/p> <p>  If I am reading this right, from Dr. Herity&rsquo;s report and his opening statement, he quite rightly makes a distinction between patients who are coming in for planned work and emergency work.  We have one lab in University Hospital Waterford.  At the moment it does emergency work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, and planned work as it can.  Dr. Herity recommended that the hospital should focus on planned work almost entirely and that emergency work should be done in Cork.  Essentially, all emergency patients in the south east should, at any time of the day or any day of the week, go to Cork or to Dublin.  That was his recommendation.  Would that be a fair summation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#E00800","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486560600,"counter":518,"content":"<p>Yes, it would.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Herity"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":519,"content":"<p>Dr. Herity&rsquo;s report has essentially been torn up because the Government is now saying that the emergency services - the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. services - which are currently available at University Hospital Waterford will remain in place.  The Minister and the Department have said that.  If that had been in Dr. Herity&rsquo;s terms of reference from the start and if he had known, while doing his work, that this was the outcome with which the Minister would run, would that have altered the final report?<\/p> <p>  The whole logic of Dr. Herity&rsquo;s report is that the hospital should focus on planned work.  How is it, then, that almost all of that planned work is now being outsourced to hospitals in Cork?  We know that 130 patients who needed planned work have already been outsourced.  I received a reply from the HSE which says that there is a service-level agreement in place between a number of private hospitals and a public hospital in Cork for the referral of patients from Waterford and that 130 have already been sent to Cork.  The reply goes on to say that there will be three more phases, with 87 patients in phase one, 120 patients in phase two and 124 in phase three.  What is happening in practice is the complete opposite of what Dr. Herity proposed and in that sense, we are getting the worst of all worlds.  My simple question to Dr. Herity is a very obvious one.  The logic of his proposition was that University Hospital Waterford should only provide for planned work and that emergency work should be done in Cork.  However, the Minister is saying, quite rightly in my view, that Waterford should not lose any services and should hold on to its 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. emergency cover.  The planned work is being outsourced to Cork.  How is that in line with what Dr. Herity has recommended?  Indeed, given that it is not in line with what he recommended, does that not show that this is a complete mess?  If Dr. Herity had known what the outcome of the Minister&rsquo;s interpretation of his report would be, maybe his analysis and observations would have been different.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the people of the south east and Waterford in particular were very upset with Dr. Herity&rsquo;s report.  Dr. Herity will justify his report but the people were upset for very obvious reasons.  One thing that upset them the most was the notion that patients can get from any part of Waterford or the south east generally to a hospital in Cork or Dublin in 90 minutes.  If a person has a heart attack, he or she has to call an ambulance and the ambulance has to come to his or her house.  That takes time.  The person then has to get into the ambulance and be transported to Cork.  I do not know if Dr. Herity has used the Cork to Waterford road recently.  It does not bypass a lot of towns or villages.  When the person gets to the hospital, he or she has to be taken out of the ambulance and so on.  What evidence does Dr. Herity have to show that this can be done in 90 minutes?  In the context of those patients who have to be airlifted, did Dr. Herity know that helicopters cannot land in University Hospital Waterford or in any of the hospitals in Cork?  They land outside the hospitals and patients have to be transported to and from the helicopters by ambulance.<\/p> <p>  I hope Dr. Herity will appreciate the wider point I am making.  He published a report, which recommends that the hospital in Waterford prioritises planned work and outsources emergency work to Cork but the policy, it seems, is now the complete opposite of that.  I ask Dr. Herity to respond to that point when he gets a chance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#E01000","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Thank you Deputy Cullinane.

The British Cardiovascular Intervention Society, BCIS, recommends that 100 to 150 cases should be seen per year.  Perhaps Dr. Herity, in his professional capacity, could explain to the committee the basis for that figure.  I would imagine, as a health care professional myself, that it is related to throughput of patients and maintaining skill levels.  I also ask him to explain what the BCIS is and the relevance of the guidance that comes from that body.  I ask him to outline how guidelines from certain bodies are fed down as best practice to clinicians.  In the case of psychiatry, orthopaedics and so forth, guidance comes a particular body, is fed down and clinicians take that guidance on board.  Clinicians do not just make up their own way of doing things as they go along.<\/p> <p>  I ask Dr. Herity to expand on his own background and experience.  Questions have already been posed as to where he worked previously but I am interested in his professional experience and why he would be considered an expert in this field.

Some of the questions will require a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer.  Did the review take into account the clinical risk and safety?  Is it not general practice that the clinical safety of the patient is paramount in the review?  Does Dr. Herity believe the recommendations of the report would have been different if clinical risk and safety were explicitly included in the terms of reference?  I will refer to the briefing note from the HSE which was sent to Dr. Herity.  It said the second cardiac laboratory at University Hospital Waterford, UHW, was not a top investment priority.  Did Dr. Herity take this note into account when conducting the review?  Did it influence the outcome?  Was the HSE's reluctance to commit to the second cath lab raised during the various conversations that took place between Dr. Herity and the HSE officials?  They are fairly straightforward questions.<\/p> <p>  Does Dr. Herity accept the methodology used to calculate catchment population for cardiac services in the south east and patient flows to the unit in Waterford did not take into account constraints on the capacity of UHW, which all of the consultants have noted?  I am almost finished.  In the report, it said it would be a mistake to assume the effective catchment area for UHW was represented by every resident of the counties in the region, as this would take into account the different levels of cardiac care provided by the different hospitals.  Is it general practice to use the effective catchment area while undertaking reviews?  Has Dr. Herity ever used this process previously?  <\/p> <p>  I have two more brief questions.  Dr. Herity said he did not make contact with the consultants, whom I have met, in Wexford and Tipperary, and they were not visited.  Will Dr. Herity tell us why?  He gave a direct answer and said he did not so I would like to know why.  Does Dr. Herity accept that their inclusion would have brought the UHW unit above the minimum requirements?  Cork University Hospital, CUH, performed 650 PCIs, which are cardiac stent procedures, in 2015, while UHW performed 580.  In addition, CUH has a minimal waiting time for angiography, while wait times for patients in the south east averaged 18 months.  Does Dr. Herity think, based on that alone, that there is a case for an additional lab at UHW on the grounds of equity of access?  <\/p> <p>  Perhaps Dr. Herity will come back to me on the \"yes\" or \"no\" questions when he is replying.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#F01400","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Herity.  I will follow up on something the Minister of State and Deputy Cullinane mentioned earlier with regard to the fact that 40% of the workload undertaken in UHW is performed by consultants Dr. Niall Colwell from South Tipperary General Hospital and Dr. Aidan Buckley.  Why were these consultants not spoken to or consulted with?  I would have thought it prudent for all stakeholders to be included in this process.  Second, one of the recommendations in the report is an extra eight hours weekly in the cath lab in Waterford.  It would take between 12 and 18 months using these eight hours to clear the current waiting list.  This is not a solution; it is a sticking plaster.  Why only eight hours?  How many preventable cardiac deaths or events will have occurred in that 12 to 18-month period?  In 2013, the lack of a second cath lab in UHW was noted by the HSE as being a \"critical clinical risk on its risk register\".  Did Dr. Herity consider this when undertaking his report?  In March 2016, the south west hospital group approved a second cath lab as a priority.  It was signed off by the CEO and it was queued for funding?

Given what we heard in Dr. Herity's opening statement and his analysis regarding population and catchment, I want, with the Chairman's permission, to put on the record of the House some commitments that were given to me in writing by significant people in the Department of Health and the HSE.  In February 2013, the architect of the hospital reform group, Professor John Higgins, stated in his report:<\/p><blockquote>Waterford Regional Hospital will continue to provide invasive cardiology services for the South East population.  Working in collaboration with the cardiology service in Cork the current service should be extended with new joint appointments of cardiologists. <\/blockquote> <p>On 13 May 2013, in a letter to me, the former Minister for Health, Senator James Reilly, stated:<\/p><blockquote>The establishment of Hospital Groups will enhance cardiology cover in Waterford regional Hospital.  At present, this is provided 9am to 5pm.  The increased flexibility of staff across the group will enable us to achieve our goal of providing cardiology cover at Waterford Regional Hospital 24 Hours a day, 7 days a week.<\/blockquote> <p>On 14 April 2014, the CEO of the south east hospital group, Mr. Gerry O'Dwyer, wrote to me about interventional cardiology services stating:<\/p><blockquote>The Cardiology Department of Waterford Regional Hospital is the regional service for 500,000 people and offers a comprehensive range of invasive and non-invasive diagnostic services including: E.C.G., Exercise Stress Tests, 24 hr. Ambulatory monitoring, Permanent Pacing and Follow up ... The provision of invasive cardiology procedures is both a clinical and political priority.  It is essential that this service is located at Waterford Regional Hospital to serve the population of the South East.<\/blockquote> <p>Finally, I will read from a letter from the director general of the HSE who is still <i>in situ<\/i>.  On 16 October 2014, in a letter to me, he wrote:<\/p><blockquote>A business case has been prepared and was forwarded as part of the 2015 Estimates, for expansion to a twenty four hour service, seven days a week ... and the associated requirement for a 2nd Cath Lab.  This will be re-examined in the 2015 Service Planning process. <\/blockquote> <p>He then goes on to speak about the costs.<\/p><p>My question to Dr. Herity about those very significant written commitments, which are now on the record of the Houses of the Oireachtas, is when he was doing his analysis of the population and catchment, were those same sentiments from the Department of Health, the HSE CEO of the hospital group and from the director general of the HSE made available to him in his analysis of the population and catchment?  It is a critical and fundamental issue in this debate.<\/p><p>Regarding the throughput, Dr. Herity says University Hospital Waterford is below the minimum of 100 per year.  I take it he takes that standard from the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society.  Is it any surprise to Dr. Herity that it is below 100 a year when it is a service that only operates between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., five days a week?  Would he contend it would be in excess of the 100 per year throughput if it had a 24-7 service, which would then justify the requirement for that full-time service at that location?  Will Dr. Herity answer that question?  The standard referred to by the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society refers to where there are exceptions, such as where there is geographical isolation.<\/p><p>I strongly contend - as, I am sure, would other colleagues - that the south east is being treated in a geographically isolated manner in the context of the provision of this vital and critical service, which, for some, can mean the difference between life and death, and how people can access it.<\/p><p> Dr. Herity is an expert in his field and 90 minutes is often referred to as being the critical period in terms of cardiac care.  He refers in his report to the fact that a patient can travel from Waterford city to Cork on the N25 within that 90-minute period.  Has he ever driven from Waterford city to Cork city and, if he has, how long did it take?  Is he aware that there are many bottlenecks on the N25, with which we are very familiar?  I contend that it is impossible to reach Cork University Hospital from Waterford city in 90 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#F01600","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":539,"content":"<p>Quite a number of questions have been put to Dr. Herity and he might address them in so far as is possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#G00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486560600,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I will try to answer the questions in logical sequence because there was some overlap among them.  However, I will first speak about my own background.  I am an interventional cardiologist and I practise in this field of medicine on a daily basis.  I have been an interventional cardiologist for about 25 years.  The centre where I work, which is the Belfast Trust, is a very large interventional cardiology centre, one of the largest in the United Kingdom.  In addition to being a full-time practising interventional cardiologist, I am also the clinical director of cardiology in Belfast.  This means that in addition to considering the work I do for the patients who come to see me, I also have an overarching responsibility for ensuring the quality of care in the service, which is delivered not just in the Belfast Trust but for patients across the Northern Ireland region, which is the population we serve.  As part of my work as the clinical director of the Belfast Trust, I have overseen the merger of some very large hospital services, namely, the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast City Hospital and the Mater hospital into a single entity - the Belfast Trust.  I found many striking observations when I was considering not the merger but the grouping of the Waterford and Cork teams and the opportunities this provided.  That is my personal background and experience.<\/p> <p>  In the context of how I came to be asked to undertake this work, the Department of Health in the Republic of Ireland made an official approach to the Department of Health in Northern Ireland to nominate somebody who was thought to be an expert in this area.  It is was on that basis that I was asked to consider whether I would take it on.  In doing so, I asked a few questions of myself, including: whether I had any conflict of interest - the answer to which was \"Absolutely not\"; whether I had the expertise and experience, or more importantly, was there anybody else in the health service in which I work who has more expertise and experience in this field and my judgment on that was \"No\"; and whether I had the opportunity or the time to take on this job for the Irish Government, the answer to which was \"Yes, I could make the time given that it is such an important consideration\".  That is my background and how I came to be asked to undertake this work.<\/p> <p>  Many of the members have made reference to the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society, BCIS, as have I.  The BCIS is a professional body.  It is not constituted by the Government, rather it is a body representative of the interventional cardiologists across the United Kingdom.  That includes England, Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland.  I am a member of the BCIS, which has many hundreds of members, pretty much all of whom are interventional cardiologists.  As part of its remit as an interventional cardiology grouping, it produces standards in the field of interventional cardiology, to which most centres in the United Kingdom will refer and will seek to comply.  It is interesting that even since this report has come out, the minimum volume standard which had been, as was pointed out, set at 100 cases per year for the emergency workload has risen to 150.  If I was asked does that have a legal background, I would reply that it does not.  What it does have, however, is a professional background, namely, that it is the considered view of the expert professionals in this field that when undertaking high-stakes emergency work in the context of patients who are very sick and have acute myocardial infarction, those patients should be treated at centres that have high-volume services and the minimum in that regard has been set at 150 cases per year.  It is described as an absolute minimum.  The professionals in question point to extreme geographic isolation.  In the United Kingdom and every other country, there are percentages and populations that live outside a 90-minute travel time to primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, centres.  My sense is that when they refer to extreme geographic isolation, they are not talking about mainland towns or cities but to people who live on islands or in other extremely isolated areas.<\/p> <p>  A few questions were asked about who I consulted as part of the six-week process.  I visited University Hospital Waterford on 7 June.  I gave notice that I was coming and I made no restrictions on who should be invited or who should attend.  This was absolutely at the discretion of the team in the University Hospital Waterford.  If it was thought that the most suitable people to attend would be patient representatives, elected representatives, journalists, clinicians and hospital managers, this was entirely at the discretion of the team from University Hospital Waterford and I placed no restriction on that.  As it turned out, there was a very representative team and a very representative presentation was given.  At the time, the views of the teams from both Wexford and South Tipperary hospitals were, in my opinion, well represented.  I left with the strong impression that the teams from Wexford and South Tipperary hospitals were very satisfied with the support they get when they work in University Hospital Waterford, that they do very high-quality work there and that they would be more than happy to continue both this work and referring their patients to Waterford.  I also placed no restrictions on how long I would stay.  I arrived at about 10.30 a.m. and had it been necessary to stay until 10 p.m., I would have been happy to do so.  As it turned out, the meeting finished in the early afternoon at the decision of the local team.  Subsequent to that, I travelled back to Belfast, but I would have been more than happy and delighted to meet anyone from the local area who could have been invited along on that day to meet me.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the catchment area was raised a few times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Herity"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":541,"content":"<p>On the issue of consultation, Professor John Higgins was the architect of the hospital groups and it is important that Dr. Herity addresses that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#G00400","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":542,"content":"<p>A huge number of questions were put to Dr. Herity and we should give him an opportunity to reply to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#G00500","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":543,"content":"<p>He was moving on from the consultation phase there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#G00600","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":544,"content":"<p>With respect, it is a bit disingenuous for Dr. Herity to say that he turned up at the hospital and he was at people's mercy.

I direct members to figure 3.5 on page 19 of my report, which they should have before them.  I want to take members through the method for calculating the catchment area of this cath lab.  Figure 3.5 is so important because it contains the data that were provided to me by the team in Waterford itself.  It shows that patients coming for cath lab procedures from the south east tend to fit into a fairly defined geographical profile.  For example, a large number of patients come from Wexford, Waterford and Tipperary South, a smaller number of patients come from Kilkenny, and then a very small number of patients come from Tipperary North, Carlow and Wicklow.  These data were a good start to make a calculation of the effective catchment population for this cath lab.<\/p> <p>  I now go back a page to table 3.4 which shows a separate data source looking at the patients coming for cath lab procedures through the cath lab in Waterford, broken down by county.  The second column from the right shows that during 2015, a total of 346 patients attended any cath lab for a cath lab procedure.  The majority of these people actually attended the cath lab in St. James's Hospital in Dublin.  A proportion did attend University Hospital Waterford.  The last column on the right shows that proportion was 6%.  We then go to Kilkenny, a larger county with a larger population.  A total of 458 people attended a cath lab, of whom the majority, 307, went to St. James's Hospital in Dublin, but a proportion, 26%, did go to Waterford.  From Tipperary North, the vast majority of patients went to Limerick.  A smaller number of people went to other centres listed, including 9% who went to Waterford.  Then 53% of Tipperary South, 86% of Waterford and 69% of Wexford procedures were done in University Hospital Waterford.  The value of this table is that it comes from a completely different source, the HIPE dataset.  It shows a pattern that mirrors exactly the data demonstrated by the Waterford team.  That is likely to validate the accuracy of both datasets.<\/p> <p>  I now go forward two pages to page 20 to show how this percentage calculation is applied to the 2016 census.  The 2016 census report came out during the week I submitted the report.  I deliberately held it back because I knew the report was scheduled.  We were able to produce exactly up-to-date data on the population of this area.  It shows that the overall population of the six counties, including Tipperary split into north and south, was 582,440.  If we then break down the effective catchment population of each of those counties, Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary North etc., based on the percentage of patients who attended Waterford cath lab during the calendar year 2015, we found that the 6% for Carlow translated to 3,413, the 26% for Kilkenny translated into 25,771 and on down, giving a final effective catchment population of 286,147.  That is the basis on which that catchment population has been arrived at.<\/p> <p>  Somebody mentioned private patients.  I did not have any available data for the movement of private patients.  In a mixed health care economy, as the Irish health care economy is, certainly there are private patients who move from one county to another and get treated in different places.  However, these data specifically refer to the public hospital population.<\/p> <p>  There were questions about undue influence, interference and briefings.  I received multiple documents and briefings as part of this process.  I received briefings from as many sources as I thought was relevant, including published documents in the public domain, including Professor Higgins's report, briefings from the Department of Health, and briefings and presentations from local clinicians and consultants, the Health Service Executive and the acute coronary syndrome programme of the Health Service Executive.  All this background information provided context for my review.<\/p> <p>  The other background information was the professional advice issued by international guideline groups, such as the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, the European Society of Cardiology, BCIS that we mentioned, the Irish Cardiac Society and so on.  All of these background documents and briefings provided context for my review and I took all of it into account.  However, my conclusions are completely independent.  They do not reflect any one or single aspect of that briefing or those background documents.  Everybody I met was at pains to point out the independence of my position in regard to writing this report.  Nobody tried to influence the process inappropriately.  I am happy to have reached the conclusions I did and they remain my conclusions.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about the Minister's response to the report and the implementation or otherwise of the report.  It is now a judgment for the Irish health care system, the Government, the Minister for Health and anybody else whether and how to implement the report.  I do not have any views on that.  I would not agree with the terminology that the report has been torn up.  I do not think that is the case.  I am not in day-to-day contact with anybody in the Department of Health or with the Minister, having submitted the report.  It is now a matter for the Irish health care system to take forward.<\/p> <p>  Two people separately asked about the travel times from Cork to Waterford.  They were taken directly from real world emergency ambulance journey times from Cork to Waterford which actually took place between October 2015 and June 2016.

The management of the ST segment elevation myocardial infarction programme that has been set for the Republic of Ireland as a whole includes a certain number of standards.  I will outline the standards.  First, the programme should be provided on a 24-7 basis.  Second, patients who are brought to a centre should be within a 90-minute travel time in order to be brought directly for primary percutaneous coronary intervention.  The British Cardiovascular Intervention Society, BCIS, standard I have recommended is that patients should be treated in high-volume centres.  Each of these aspects feeds in not only to the programme in the south east but to the programme throughout the country.  This is the reason that these are the circumstances in which best quality care is delivered.<\/p> <p>  It is absolutely the case, not only in Ireland but in every country, that a percentage of the population sits outside those 90-minute isochrones.  This is the case in the United Kingdom, Denmark and the Netherlands.  It is very much the case in countries like Canada.  In those countries, the health care systems implement targeted systems for those populations to ensure they get equal quality of care.  I referenced some of those towards the end of the document.<\/p> <p>  I outlined the options.  The first option is to do what they do in Denmark: accept that people may have an extra five or ten minutes of travel time and transport the patient anyway.  The second option is to give a specialised drug, which committee members will be familiar with, called thrombolytic therapy, then put the patient in the ambulance and transfer the patient immediately to the centre that provides the service.  That is called drip-and-ship.  Another option is to look at alternative means of transport.  The example I gave was the helicopter system implemented fairly successfully in Donegal, as I understand it, for bringing patients to Galway prior to the establishment of a 24-7 centre in Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Derry.  I did not reach any final conclusion on how that additional protocol should be implemented for the patients of the south east because I thought it was too much work to reach a sensible conclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Herity"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":566,"content":"<p>Is that not the nub of the whole situation?

I cast no aspersions on whether Dr. Herity has any conflict of interest &ndash; I do not believe he does.  I have not doubted Dr. Herity's professional experience.  Let us park that for a moment, if we can accept that much.  That is not at play.<\/p> <p>  What is at play is what Dr. Herity has stated in his report and what he has said in his opening statement.  We have a responsibility to put robust questions to Dr. Herity on behalf of the people we represent.  I am keen to be clear on that.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to what I said to Dr. Herity earlier.  Dr. Herity glossed over it and somewhat ignored answering the question.  However, Dr. Herity cannot ignore the implementation of his report or the selective implementation of his report from the logic of it.  That would amount to standing logic on its head.  Essentially, Dr. Herity is telling us that one laboratory is good enough for the south east to service planned work and that all emergency work should go to Cork.  In other words, what Dr. Herity described as the drip-and-ship effect should be in operation 24-7 for people who live in the south east.  If an emergency arises, the person goes to Cork or Dublin.  In the case of planned work, the person goes to Waterford.<\/p> <p>  The problem is that the Government does not agree with Dr. Herity.  If the terms of reference stipulated that 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. PCI cover in University Hospital Waterford was non-negotiable and was not going to be touched, would that have affected the outcome of Dr. Herity's report?  How can one laboratory service the planned work, as well as the PCI work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.?  Dr. Herity's report maintains that it cannot.<\/p> <p>  I wish to go back to the demographics referred to by Dr. Herity and population mass or criteria that he used.  The Higgins report states that University Hospital Waterford should be the regional provider of invasive cardiology services for all of the 500,000 people of the south east.  Page 18 of Dr. Herity's report cites, rightly, that patients in Carlow and Kilkenny are going to St. James's Hospital in large numbers and that patients in north and south Tipperary are going to University Hospital Limerick and Cork University Hospital.  The reason is that we have only one laboratory.  If we had a second laboratory in Waterford, then those hospitals could refer patients to University Hospital Waterford.  The whole logic and recommendation of Dr. Herity's report was, in a sense, a self-fulfilling prophesy.  If we only have one laboratory, how can we take patients from Kilkenny or Carlow?  How can we take patients from Tipperary?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Herity missed the point entirely in respect of the criteria.  He ignored the promise made and the policy set out &ndash; it was policy &ndash; to the effect that University Hospital Waterford would be the regional provider of invasive and interventional cardiology for the entire south east &ndash; for 500,000 people.<\/p><p>Will Dr. Herity respond to the specific issues of population mass, whether, if we had a second lab, we could take those patients who are being transferred elsewhere, and whether, if it had been made very clear in the terms of reference that the 9 to 5 PCI was non-negotiable, that have put a different interpretation on his recommendations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#J01700","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486560600,"counter":578,"content":"<p>On the first question, it probably drifts into speculation.

During the review, did he know how many were being referred out of hours?  Could he tell me how many he thought were being referred out of hours or were being referred to other hospitals?  Was that taken into consideration in the review?  This should be a very simple answer.  When Dr. Herity undertook the review, did he have these numbers?  Forget about what was going into the part-time cath lab up to 5 p.m.  Does he have the numbers there in front of him, or did he have them, of people that were being referred out of hours to other hospitals?  That should be a very straightforward answer.  He should have statistics.  I cannot see them in his report.<\/p> <p>  Second, is  Dr. Herity saying that, based on the figures and in his experience, if there were a second cath lab, would there be a higher volume of people using the service?

As I recall them they were on clinical risk, the number of patients referred out of hours and whether more patients would come if there were more capacity.  On the last question,  I would make no assumption that would be the case.  The reason is that the referral patterns of cardiologists or other specialists to specialist centres focus on many different aspects.  I am a referral cardiologist and a referring cardiologist so I know exactly how this works.  Much of it has to do with where those cardiologists practise their cath lab sessions.  In the case of south Tipperary and Wexford, naturally the patients follow them to Waterford because that is where they have their cath lab sessions.  Similarly for patients from Carlow and Kilkenny, naturally those patients gravitate towards St. James's Hospital in Dublin because that is where the cath lab sessions are.  The patterns also reflect many years of experience of how good a service has been received from the various options that they have referred patients to and, indeed, long-standing interpersonal and interprofessional relationships.

I have a waiting list and pretty much everybody I work with has one too.  I saw during the week that the number of people on waiting lists across the NHS in the UK has now risen to 3.5 million.  It had been as low in 2007 as 2.2 million.  Unfortunately, rising numbers of people on public hospital waiting lists is not a problem unique to Ireland.  It is certainly a feature of life in the United Kingdom as well.<\/p> <p>  All of us would say we would prefer nobody was on a waiting list.  It does seem to be a factor of where demand outstrips available capacity across the health care system.  In terms of clinical risk, one can imagine somebody who has got a diagnosis of cancer and who is waiting for potentially curative surgery.  The longer they wait on a waiting list, the greater their clinical risk.  Undoubtedly, that would be the case and, accordingly, what happens for cancer patients is that they get clinical prioritisation.  People with cancer do not wait a long time.  There are certain standards and expectations which are typically met.<\/p> <p>  The people on my waiting list would be similar to those on waiting lists for procedures in Waterford, Cork, St. James&rsquo;s or anywhere.  These are typically people with suspected coronary artery disease who are awaiting a coronary angiogram, which is an investigative procedure and not necessarily a therapeutic procedure.  A proportion of those patients will then go on to have a stent inserted or a bypass operation.  These are not life-saving procedures.  There is absolutely no evidence that people who undergo stent procedures or that most people who undergo bypass operations in the elective setting are actually at any less risk of having a heart attack or dying or surviving afterwards than if they had not done so.<\/p> <p>  A small number of people on my waiting list, and undoubtedly on waiting lists in Cork and Waterford, are at greater risk.  I would particularly draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to people with aortic valve disease, particularly severe aortic stenosis, structural heart disease or people with an adverse finding from a non-invasive investigation where we think they have multi-vessel disease.  In those circumstances, we apply clinical prioritisation.  I do not leave someone with severe aortic stenosis on my waiting list but bring them forward because I understand the benefit.  Clinical prioritisation is extremely important.<\/p> <p>  One point which has not come up which I want to draw some attention to is that when I visited both cardiology services in Waterford and Cork, I was visiting them as part of the South\/South West hospital group.  Separately I met with the chief executive of the hospital group.  I recognise that hospital groups, as they are constructed in the Republic of Ireland, are at a much earlier and less formed stage than hospital trusts in the United Kingdom.  The point about any hospital grouping is that they provide a clinical opportunity.  The opportunity they provide is that one gets a critical mass of capacity available across the hospital group to do, potentially, a better job for the patients across the group.  When I met with the clinicians in both Waterford and Cork, it was clear to me that at that point they had not worked out the best way to pool their combined and greatly skilled resources to do the best job for patients.  I understand that in the interim there has been work between the two sets of clinicians to make best use of that critical mass and the capacity across the hospital group.  I am heartened and reassured that this has taken place.  I do not believe it has threatened anybody.<\/p> <p>  What that means is that certain patients on the waiting list in Waterford, particularly, are now being offered their procedures in Cork.  I am seeing that, however, as a short-term measure to address the large number of people on the waiting list rather than a long-term measure to somehow divert patients away from natural patient flows.  In my report, I recommended that the capacity of the Waterford lab be increased from ten to 12 sessions.  That was in recognition of the increased need for the catchment population.  I am heartened to see the clinicians on the ground have taken up the opportunity to combine their resources for the benefit of patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Herity"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I am deeply disappointed with what I have heard from Dr. Niall Herity with regard to the levels of consultation he had before he prepared and finalised his report.  I find it unbelievable he did not consult with the cardiologists in Wexford and Tipperary.  I find it completely unbelievable that he did not consult with Professor John Higgins, the architect of the hospital group reconfiguration and who published a report on it in 2013.  That was a fundamental mistake.  Why did Dr. Niall Herity not do that?  It was his strategy which the Government and the Health Service Executive, HSE, adopted in creating the critical mass and efficiencies within the hospital group networks.  We are talking about a regional hospital with a legitimate aspiration to level four.  This is not a county hospital we are talking about.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the catchment population, the chief executive of the hospital group told me in 2013 that the provision of invasive cardiology procedures is both a clinical and political priority.  Did he say the same to Dr. Niall Herity when he met him before the report was drafted?<\/p> <p>  While I do not doubt Dr. Niall Herity&rsquo;s expertise, according to his analysis, if one cath lab is open 40 hours a week and draws a catchment population of 280,000, then that figure would not increase substantially if that cath lab were open for 168 hours a week, which is 24-7, with a second laboratory available.  I contend it would.  Any logical person would too.  If it is available, then people will obviously use the service. <\/p> <p>  With regard to the 90-minute golden time to which we all refer, I find it deeply disappointing that Dr. Niall Herity has a two-minute margin in his recommendations to transfer people from University Hospital Waterford to Cork University Hospital.  That is a critical life or death intervention but Dr. Herity allows a two-minute margin without any allowances for ongoing roadworks on the N25.  More importantly, there is no allowance for people in my area who have to travel ten miles to get to University Hospital Waterford in the first place.  It probably takes them 45 minutes to get there.  They then have to add another 90 minutes on top of that, all going well.  These people are outside the critical time.  I respect Dr. Herity&rsquo;s professionalism but he said he did not have the time to see how he would recommend that these patients outside the 90 minutes receive the best care.  I am sorry but these people do not have the time either.  They have had a heart attack and need critical intervention.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Herity, as a professional, had a clinical opportunity to give an entire region adequate cover for cardiology intervention.  I do not doubt his aspirations and all he stands for but I am telling him passionately that there is a region left in deficit.  He referred to other regions in the north west but they are also in deficit.  In time, they will also have to be addressed.  Here was the opportunity to address the south-east region, not a county, a parish or a little village.  This is a regional and national issue.  I am deeply disappointed this opportunity was missed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#L00800","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I kicked off questions earlier today.  Like my other colleagues, I am disappointed that two of the three questions I asked were not answered.<\/p><p>My first question relates to Professor Higgins.  We all have the book.  Dr. Herity was tasked with carrying out an independent clinical review of the provision of a second catheterisation laboratory at University Hospital Waterford.  He stated he was the clinical director of cardiology at Belfast HSC Trust.  I assume, therefore, that he would be the go-to person if there was a review taking place in Belfast.  When one considers the likes of Professor Higgins who produced the report on the transition of hospital groups to independent hospital trusts and is the chief academic officer of the hospital group, how was Dr. Herity able to formulate his position when he did not speak to him?  It beggars belief.  I cannot believe and understand Dr. Herity could not speak to the chief academic officer of the hospital group.<\/p><p> My second point which I made clearly still concerns me and I do not believe it has been answered by Dr. Herity.  It relates to the note issued by the HSE which stated that, in its opinion, Waterford would not benefit from having a second catheterisation laboratory.  This had to have had some impact on Dr. Herity before he undertook the review.  He had to examine all of the facts and figures he had been given, but the HSE told him that, from a financial point of view, it would not be in the best interests of Waterford to have a second catheterisation laboratory.  That had to have had an effect and an impact on him.  Dr. Herity did not address that point?<\/p><p> I would like to go back to the figures referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan.  Dr. Herity has told us that the new BCIS minimum is 150, but, when he undertook his report, it was 100.  At the time, 62 emergency procedures were undertaken when the laboratory was opened in Waterford, but 77 procedures were bieng undertaken when the laboratory was closed.  That gives us a figure of 139.  The BCIS minimum was 100 and we had 139, but I do not think Dr. Herity included in his calculations the 77 emergency procedures that were taking place when the laboratory was closed.  I do not doubt his integrity or abilities for one minute, but we are talking about the south east which has a population of 500,000.  We can dispute the figures all we like, but, no matter how we go at the issue, there are still 350,000 or 400,000 people who will have nowhere to go in an ambulance if on a Friday evening at 5 p.m. someone has a heart attack except to Cork or Dublin.  As everyone has stated, it is not possible to get to either place within 90 minutes.  <\/p><p> I would appreciate it if Dr. Herity were to answer these questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#L00900","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":634,"content":"<p>Am I reading it right that 4% of the procedures were emergency procedures and that 96% were regular or scheduled procedures?

What impact does that have on the health outcomes for patients?  Let us take someone who arrives in an ambulance in under 90 minutes to University Hospital Waterford.  He or she is in the 4% category and does not have access to the cardiology backup services.  Does Dr. Herity have data on the outcomes for such patients?  I assume that they are worse than if they were taken to a centre of excellence.<\/p> <p>  In reference to what many colleagues have stated, I am not disappointed with Dr. Herity's answers.  From what he has stated, I am happy that he took all data into account.  Perhaps he did not meet everyone, but I am happy that he took the Higgins report, etc. into account.  I accept his professional view that increasing capacity does not necessarily correlate with an increased throughput of patients.

The more procedures the centre performs, the more rapidly the difference in the likelihood that someone will die as a result of a primary PCI procedure diminishes.  That is the key part.  This is not about a single operator but the team in the catheterisation laboratory and the support services available to them.  That is why the BCIS recommends that these procedures be undertaken in high volume centres with concentrated expertise.  It is the performance of the entire team that determines the outcome.  The relationships between high volume and better outcomes are absolutely clear in the case of this procedure.<\/p> <p>  On there being a single point of failure, it does happen.  The impact of an emergency PCI procedure on daytime activity is far greater than it is on night-time activity.  That is the reality for all of us.  In the centre where I work there are eight catheterisation laboratories, all working full-time.  What happens is that notice is received that a patient is coming.  We have enough time to complete a procedure; we do not put the next patient on the table and wait for the next patient to arrive.  That is how one deals with it.  I thought the Minister of State was referring to a single point of radiological failure; in other words, a failure of the radiographic equipment.  I made a specific recommendation that backup radiographic equipment be provided in the catheterisation laboratory in University Hospital Waterford, a recommendation also made by the BCIS.  <\/p> <p>  On meeting Professor Higgins, it is not obvious to me that the chief academic officer of a hospital group is necessarily the person I would be going to, but I want to assure people that I read the Higgins report and made my own decision on whether I needed to consult him specifically about the matter.<\/p><p>I decided that he was not someone who would change the content of the report.

I am a cardiologist in Waterford University Hospital and I am joined by Dr. Aidan Buckley, a consultant cardiologist from Wexford General Hospital, Dr. Niall Colwell, a consultant cardiologist at South Tipperary General Hospital in Clonmel, and Dr. Mark Doyle, consultant in emergency medicine in University Hospital Waterford.  <\/p> <p>  Again, we thank the committee for the opportunity to talk today about the cardiac services in the south east.  The committee will know the narrative of how we got here today from the news coverage and the briefing document I submitted earlier this week, which hopefully it will have had the chance to review.  The essence of the matter at hand is the parlous state of the cardiac services in the south east.  We all work in different hospitals in the south east and all can testify to the great difficulties we encounter in trying to do right by our patients.  We have come to realise that the unacceptable wait times we encounter for outpatient and inpatient care are seriously detrimental to their well-being.  These delays arise solely because of the lack of an additional catheterisation laboratory facility on the UHW campus.  This risk was identified by the HSE over several years, with the lack of a second facility identified as a critical clinical risk on the formal HSE risk register.  As a result of this, we sought expansion of the service in the south east, with the building, staffing and running of a second catheterisation laboratory to increase our case volume to levels commensurate with the demand for service we encounter.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Health and the then Minister chose to ignore the HSE risk rating and submitted business case in this regard and instead commissioned an independent report into the matter.  It is our contention that the report was not independent.  It was constrained by its terms of reference.  The reviewer's instructions were prefaced by the Department in biased terms.  The review itself is flawed in its methodology, assumptions and, therefore, its conclusions.<\/p><p>I have outlined these in the accompanying briefing document.<\/p><p> In brief, we contend that the reviewer excluded a large number of patients from his counting of the catchment population for the cath lab, leading to a gross under-estimate, of the order of 50%, of the true value.  The determination of the infrastructure needed for meeting with our actual service demand was based on non-real world estimates of the time required to perform procedures; the true estimate shows a need for just over two cath labs, running 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  The evaluation of the primary PCI programme - for treatment of acute heart attacks - at University Hospital Waterford actually exceeded the terms of reference of the review.  The recommendation arrived at, however, is to withdraw the service as it exists and replace it with an unworkable alternative.   We feel that this is an extraordinarily one-sided view, and does not take into account potential alternatives that would retain this vital service in the south east and with minimal investment would allow it to meet the minimum requirements of the national strategy, which would fit seamlessly into the broader picture of enhancing service delivery for cardiac care in the south east.<\/p><p> The report does not even mention the hard reality of a single cath lab, performing large volume and complex procedures.  It is a single point of failure, and provides inadequate contingency for breakdown and co-incidental acute illness presenting to its doors.  This has already happened on a number of occasions.<\/p><p> There is an assumption made by the people of the south east.  It is that their Ministers must make decisions for the overall greatest good for the greatest number of people, but must also sometimes make decisions that appear to run contrary to their interests.  Nowhere is this more the case than with health care.  There is also an obligation, however, to ensure that the evidence on which these decisions are based is correct, irreproachable and stands up to robust scrutiny.  I am sure that all would agree with that, not least Dr. Herity, the author of the report. <\/p><p> It is our contention that this review, on which so much depends, is indeed flawed, and draws conclusions that are therefore invalid.  The Department went to great lengths to prevent the report being seen prior to publication and adoption as policy; so much so that the consultants who sit here today were not shown the document prior to its adoption as policy and were given no right of reply.  My two colleagues from Wexford and Tipperary were not even consulted during the review process, although in fairness this was not identified as a necessity in the terms of reference.  It is our contention that had either of those eventualities occurred, the flaws would have been identified and corrected and a more considered report would have been forthcoming that, importantly, would have reached a different conclusion.<\/p><p> It is within the terms of reference of this body to make representation to the Minister, and perhaps also to those who are unelected, unseen and unanswerable in the Department and who are at the heart of this matter.  I would ask that representation be made, for the sake of the people in the south east of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Owens","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Owens.

It had been up to the hospital management or clinicians in Waterford to inform people that this consultation was on and it was up to people themselves to come on that day.  Dr. Herity said that he had been in a position to make himself available from 9 a.m. right up to 10 p.m. that evening but because there was only a smaller number of people with whom he engaged he was actually out by lunchtime.

In any event, the witnesses have clarified that they were not even informed that this day of consultation was happening.  I have tried to condense the report down into very simple language and a simple proposition because we could overly complicate this, but essentially Dr. Herity's main proposition is that there are two distinct sets of patients in the south east, the patients who need planned work and those who need emergency work.  I also asked him if he had ever worked in, or been responsible for, a hospital or unit that has one cath lab, and he said \"No\".  Obviously he had to do a piece of work for the south east and specifically for the University Hospital Waterford.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Herity's whole logic is that it is not possible for a single hospital with a single cath lab to do both planned and emergency work.  It is not possible and this is why he recommended that all emergency work be outsourced to Cork so that University Hospital Waterford would not do any emergency work on any day of the week.  All of that work would be transferred to Cork.  People in Tipperary, Carlow and Kilkenny who would have gone to Dublin would continue to go to Dublin, and all of those in Waterford city and its hinterland would go to Cork.  Waterford University Hospital would specifically deal with all planned cath lab work.  Given that one cannot divorce implementation from the recommendations, it is also the case that the Government, the hospital and the south-south west hospital group have decided that University Hospital Waterford will continue to provide 9 a.m to 5 p.m. emergency cover.  On the basis that Waterford University Hospital will continue to provide PCI cover Monday to Friday, and all the planned work that it already does, Dr. Herity conceded that this was not viable.  His recommendation is that emergency work was to be shipped out to Cork.<\/p> <p>  We have heard from Dr. Herity as a clinician, and nobody is doubting his integrity, experience or work in this regard - I certainly did not doubt it and I am sure the witnesses have not.  The witnesses here are also cardiologists and clinicians with experience.  Dr. Herity's proposal is now not happening because, thankfully, Waterford will now maintain its 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. PCI cover at least but we want to go beyond that.  In the witnesses' opinion is it sustainable for the University Hospital Waterford, with one unit and one mobile lab, to do both the planned work and the emergency work in the future even with the effective population criteria that he proposes? Is this feasible and possible?<\/p> <p>  Me second question concerns the scenario if the recommendation had been to not look at the effect of population criterion but to look at the entire south east with patients from Kilkenny, Wexford or Tipperary who are being transferred to Limerick, Cork or Dublin.  If Waterford University Hospital had a second lab - we are moving towards enhanced services - would it be feasible for these patients to be referred to Waterford University Hospital?  Would this increase the patient throughput into University Hospital Waterford?  I know this is in two pieces, but can the witnesses understand the logic of it?  The logic of the report is that one cannot do both, it must be one service or the other, in Waterford with one lab.  That is now not the case so would the witnesses agree with Dr. Herity that it is not feasible in the first instance?  Given that it is now the case, if we had a second lab, do the witnesses believe in their own professional opinion and the opinions of those who work in the south east, that patients who are currently being diverted elsewhere, would be referred to University Hospital Waterford?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#P00600","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for attending the committee today to address this very important issue.<\/p><p>Whereas much of this has been said already in Waterford and the south east, this will be on the record of the House now, which is very important.  On 17 October last, I wrote to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health to request that it examine the Herity report and to invite the relevant stakeholders.  We are all aware of the fallout from the publication, and as has been stated by the consultants and clinicians working in University Hospital Waterford, UHW, and other places, the report is flawed and the findings are rejected.  Senator Swanick, who is a doctor from County Mayo, in the earlier session asked Dr. Herity, as one doctor to another, whether he believed lives were in danger in the absence of a second catheterisation laboratory in Waterford and the lack of provision of 24-7 care.  Dr. Herity replied he did not and that patients should be treated in high-volume centres.  I seek the witnesses' views in this regard.<\/p><p> Dr. Herity also spoke about the length of time it takes to get from Waterford to Cork and referred to real world ambulance times, which he stated were 88 minutes with blue lights flashing.  While Senator Swanick put it to him that this target time is an aspiration, Dr. Herity did not accept that.  I seek the witnesses' thoughts on that as well.<\/p><p> Some of the questions I will ask have been answered before, but I think it is important that it is stated on the record in the House.  Dr. Owens has said that the fundamental problem in Waterford and the south east is a capacity-demand mismatch, and I would appreciate it if he could elaborate on that.  What happens if a patient is undergoing a treatment in the catheterisation laboratory in Waterford and another patient presents on an emergency basis?  What happens to both patients in that instance?  I ask Dr. Owens to talk us through that important point.<\/p><p> Is this a single point of failure when trying to perform the duties of a cardiologist?  In the absence of a second catheterisation laboratory and 24-7 cardiac care, are lives being endangered?  Will people die as a result?  The last question is for any witness who wishes to answer.

It is important that we hear their views on the record of the Oireachtas, and to publically acknowledge their efforts to address what they see as a deficit in terms of equality of access for patients in the south-east region.  I believe they are delivering a public service beyond their remit.<\/p> <p>  A critical risk associated with a lack of a second catheterisation laboratory in UHW was identified.  Who compiles the risk register, and who in the HSE has the authority to change the risk register?  A critical point identified is that it has changed and this needs to be answered in the interests of transparency.  <\/p> <p>  The Department was mentioned, and it was stated the instructions were \"prefaced by the Department in biased terms\".  Can Dr. Owens explain how the Department has been biased on this very significant national and regional issue?<\/p> <p>  On the effective catchment population, there is a serious divergence of view between Dr. Herity and others.  I am interested in hearing from the professional witnesses, being cardiologists and emergency services personnel, what is the definition of an effective catchment population?  Is it, as Dr. Herity outlined, the existing patterns of throughput of patients to services at the hospital, or is it what I would consider the access within a 90-minute timeframe, which is the critical timeframe for percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, for a catchment around a particular service?  Some clarity on that point would be appreciated.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Herity puts much store in the BCIS, also known as the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society.  That is from where he takes his standard.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on that.  Is it agreed that it is the recommended standard?<\/p> <p>  Regarding those who are outside the 90-minute PCI radius, the recommendation from Dr. Herity's report, without any specifics, is that those who cannot receive PCI within that critical timeframe of 90 minutes would receive what he calls an optimal reperfusion protocol.  My question to the witnesses, as professional cardiologists and consultants, is on whether patients who are outside the 90-minute PCI and are transferred into that protocol are at a disadvantage in terms of survival rates?  Has there been an analysis of patients in the past who received PCI versus those who received the reperfusion protocol, and what does that tell us about survival rates and where services should be located? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#Q00200","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486560600,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I will answer in reverse order and start with the concept of effective catchment area.  The first line of the report describes how the determination of any catchment area is a matter for interpretation, and that is true.  The catchment area is almost a misnomer.  What is important in any analysis of need is to identify the need of a given population.  In a sense this report does things the wrong way around.  What is needed initially is to identify the geographical area which feeds into UHW, to the south-east catheterisation laboratory service in this instance, and then apply normative data, which means to apply the percentages per million requiring angiograms, stents and pacemakers, and then work out what the actual need would be for that population.  The value of doing it that way around is that the need is identified first.  The need drives it.  What has happened here is that the number of people who have had procedures has been counted but need has not been recognised.  Delivery of service is recognised rather than the need for service delivery.  The analogy I used several months ago was it is like trying to determine the number of people wanting to attend Croke Park on all-Ireland final day.  What this methodology does in the report is that it counts the number of people in the stadium and concludes that is the number of people who want or need to be there.  It completely ignores the fact that there are people streaming around shouting at touts and people in the pub watching the game because they know they will not get in.  There is a need that is not being met, and a demand out there that is simply not being addressed because of the constrained nature of the service.  The evidence for the constraint on the service is the fact that there was a 700-strong waiting list at the end of the year in which the report was done.  This methodology cannot be applied to a constrained service; it simply is not logical.<\/p> <p>  Halfway through the report the logical inconsistency of that is borne out.  Dr. Herity, having identified this catchment population, discusses briefly whether the activity carried out is consistent with that catchment population and finds that it is perfectly consistent.  However, as he has determined the catchment population on the basis of number of procedures done, it is a completely circular argument that holds no water and is nonsensical.  In fact, the only group of procedures upon which he did not make a judgment about the size of the catchment was pacemakers, which involves a separate technique we use in the lab.  Not angiograms, not stents, but pacemakers.  This was not used in his calculation of catchment.  The pacemaker implant rate was far beyond what one would have expected for his calculated catchment.  In other words, the strong implication is that his catchment area is a gross underestimate.  The effective catchment area, therefore, is not correctly calculated.  The methodology was never going to provide an accurate figure.  It looks at the wrong thing.  This should be a needs-based assessment, not an assessment based on treatment delivered.<\/p><p> There was another question on travel times.  Dr. Doyle has carried out some independent assessments of the travel times from Waterford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Owens","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486560600,"counter":699,"content":"<p>We looked at the travel time issue when the acute coronary syndrome programme was first set up, because obviously there were implications for Waterford then.  The determination in this report that an 88-minute timeline is somehow acceptable is totally unacceptable to me.  Moreover, this is an average time.  If that is average, by definition some of those times were well over the 90 minutes.  For a clinician in the emergency department in Waterford to say, \"you will probably get there in 88 minutes so I will let you off\", is not an acceptable clinical scenario and it is not one the doctors in Waterford will stand over.  That is one piece that simply does not stand up.  Last week, members of the committee who live in that area will be aware that there were major road works on the road to Cork and there were huge traffic delays.  Somebody told me that they saw an ambulance get through, but it got through slowly.  It certainly was not going to get there within the timelines described.  Again, the 90 minutes is an absolute figure.  What should happen is that people should get this treatment as close as possible to when the diagnosis is made because every minute that passes without treatment is loss of heart muscle.  One can pick this timeline but, in fact, that travel time is only a surrogate in any case from the internationally recognised time which is from point of diagnosis to point of the vessel being opened.  When one adds in those parts at each end, the time is well exceeded.  To assert that this timeline of 88 minutes is acceptable is just not okay, for a start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Doyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486560600,"counter":700,"content":"<p>As a clinician and an interventional cardiologist I will talk about the single point of failure that was mentioned.  The catheterisation laboratory is, by definition, a single point of failure.  There is only one table and only one patient comes into the room at any single time.  If a patient is on the catheterisation laboratory table and is having an angiogram or a stent inserted, the duration of a procedure can be very long.  Somebody could be on the table for a couple of hours or more during complex procedures.  Once one starts the procedure one cannot stop, or at least not safely stop.  If somebody is brought in as an emergency to the emergency department or, indeed, is blue lighted in as a code STEMI - ST-elevation myocardial infarction - which is the phraseology for coming in with an acute heart attack, that patient must be accommodated as quickly as possible but if somebody is on the table that cannot happen.  It is not just acute heart attacks.  It might be somebody with a life threatening rhythm disturbance or with what is called a tamponade, which is where there is a fluid collection around the heart, and these all must be addressed.  If there is only a single unit they must wait or one must stop one's procedure, wheel the patient out and take the acute emergency in.  That has happened.  Having two catheterisation laboratories greatly diminishes the chances of that eventuality.<\/p> <p>  Then there is the more obvious sense of single point of failure, which is that if the catheterisation laboratory breaks down everything grinds to a halt.  If the laboratory is closed for maintenance, for example, which it was on Monday two weeks ago, the service stops.  It does not stop just for emergencies but also for inpatients who are admitted with acute problems, need their procedure carried out but who must wait another day in their hospital bed.  All of that has repercussions and knock-on effects on bed occupancy.  Single point of failure is a major issue.  The reason that ours remains the only unit in the country with a single catheterisation laboratory is that all the other laboratories and units realise that this is an issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Owens"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I asked a question that was not answered.

Wexford is the most geographically isolated part of the south east.  We are outside the so-called golden 90 minutes all of the time if Waterford were to close for primary PCI.  We will never be inside that 90 minutes.  Currently, we have access for primary PCI from Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  If one is fortunate or unfortunate enough, as the case may be, to have a heart attack during those hours, one will have one's primary PCI performed in Waterford.  If it happens outside those hours, one will be put in an ambulance and brought to one of the Dublin hospitals.  Under Dr. Herity's recommendations, that 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. service will be taken from us altogether, so we will have 100% of nothing.  He alludes to the point in his report that perhaps some type of arrangement could be made to transport these patients faster.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the optimal reperfusion protocol.  That is a misnomer because it is a sub-optimal treatment.  Thrombolytic therapy, which is the old-fashioned way of dealing with heart attacks, is an inferior treatment.  That is not my personal opinion, but has been proven in trial after trial.  We are now saying it is acceptable for the people in the south-east region to have an inferior treatment and then be shipped on for delayed treatment in one of the centres in Cork or Dublin.  If the same logic were to be applied to Castleknock or Montenotte, I doubt that we would be having this conversation.  The same should apply to the people of the south east.  They should have access to optimal treatment in the real sense.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about emergency and elective or planned work.  There are two parts to emergency work.  There are the acute heart attacks, or the code STEMIs, and the patients who come to the hospital with undiagnosed chest pain.  They might not have a heart attack but a condition called unstable angina.  When the catheterisation laboratory first opened in Waterford we were able to provide a very timely service for angiography for these patients, because it was building up.  However, as the volume of referral increased the capacity was outstripped.  Now we have the scenario where patients who come to Wexford hospital with undiagnosed chest pain who require angiography must now wait a week to ten days in hospital.  This is a matter of public record in terms of data from Wexford about inpatient stays for people with acute coronary syndromes.  These are people who are not having acute heart attacks but who have had chest pain that remains undiagnosed.  They are occupying a hospital bed for ten days.  The internationally recognised timeframe in which these patients should have angiography is 24 to 48 hours, at most.  We are far away from that now because these patients cannot access the care they need in Waterford.  Let there be no doubt about this - going to another hospital in Dublin or Cork is not an option.  We ring these hospitals daily.  There are no beds, as anybody who has been listening to the news in the last few months knows.  They cannot take our patients, so it is not an option for the people of Wexford.  Waterford is our only option.  This is not emotion.  It is reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#R00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aidan Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1486560600,"counter":706,"content":"<p>I mentioned that the Senator, Dr. Swanick, had asked Dr. Herity, doctor to doctor, whether he believed that lives are in danger as a result of there not being a second catheterisation laboratory and Dr. Herity said he did not and that patients should be treated in high-volume centres.

The specific number, for the record, is 805.  I suspect what Dr. Herity may be referring to is high-volume centres for primary PCI.  Primary PCI, for clarity, is PCI for the acute heart attack and that is a very small percentage of the total work we do.  The current recommendations are that the bare minimum a unit should be doing is 100 primary PCIs per year, although I understand that there may be moves to increase that number.  In terms of the 100 value, we did 75 in 2016 out of total of 102 code ST-elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI activations.  In other words, 102 patients were flagged as needing to get into the unit, 75 of whom ended up having heart attacks and stents.  Some of those 102 patients would have had other diagnoses.

Meeting Dr. Herity earlier has copperfastened my opinion in that regard.  The objective of inviting the consultants here today was to put everything on record.  In the last six months, the consultants have been - on both local and national media - comprehensive in their analysis of the Herity report and of its failings and flaws.  There is no point in me going through the list of questions I put to Dr. Herity and putting them to the consultants because they have answered them in the media time and time again.<\/p> <p>  I would like to point out that I received information from the National Roads Authority, NRA, that there has been a 40 minute delay in Killeagh, on the road from Waterford to Cork, since last September and that this delay will persist for the next three months.  That is Dr. Herity's 90-minute timeframe shot down straight away.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the recommendation to increase the opening hours of the lab from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., do the witnesses think there is a danger that it could actually pose an increased risk to patients, in the sense of heart attack patients being delayed outside the door of a single catheterisation lab while waiting for the facility to be vacated by cases that are already on the table?  That is very important because great store is being put in this 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. proposal.  I am aware already that many of the consultants here today are working way beyond the official hours.<\/p> <p>  What do the consultants want this committee to do?  What recommendations do they think the committee should make?  Committees can make recommendations.  I am not a member of this committee and I thank the Chairman for allowing me to attend this meeting and to speak at it.  It is imperative that the consultants tell the committee what recommendations it should make in terms of pushing forward.  I am particularly interested in hearing their views on the 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#S01200","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486560600,"counter":720,"content":"<p>The recommendation is to extend the hours from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday to Thursday, which is, effectively, an addition of 12 hours per week.  The catheterisation lab would already regularly go over the current 5 p.m. deadline.  I would not see 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. as a meaningful increase in the capacity of the lab.  It certainly would not get within a mile of what is actually required; it would make no dent into that.  Waiting lists have been in the news recently.  A waiting list such as ours, which has accrued over the past three years, is directly as a result of a lack of capacity but an additional 12 hours a week would not address the pressures that have created that waiting list.  It really would not even come close.  One of the criticisms I would have of the Herity report is that the historical waiting list does not feature in it at all and the waiting list itself only features towards the end of the document.  It is not included, at any stage, in the catchment calculations.  There are patients who, by definition, have a need for the service and yet they are not identified in the calculations.

In that context, we now have a situation where that report has been more or less accepted as the basis upon which we will provide cardiac services in University Hospital Waterford.  One of the reasons I was anxious to bring this issue before the committee, on foot of representations from Deputy Mary Butler and others, is that a review of cardiac services nationally is also planned.

I am sorry for leaving but I had to be in two committees at the same time.  I am not sure if I am done with hearts or water at this stage.  When I came in somebody was answering a question on the effective catchment area so I will not go over it again, but in any other assessment in which any of the witnesses have been involved throughout their professional careers have they used the effective catchment area metric?  That is my first question.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses may not have Professor Herity's report in front of them but on page 20 he outlines the census figures and then the effective catchment figure.  The 2016 figure indicates that 582,440 people live in the area.  I would assume that that involves all people.  I am not being smart but there is an age when heart attacks generally tend to occur.  I assume that if this is a census figure it includes children.  One could not argue, although I could be wrong and the witnesses are experts on this, that we should not be including a group of the population in this that will never want to access to catheterisation laboratory facilities.  I respect the witnesses' views on effective catchment but in terms of these figures, I assume that children are not suited to be treated in their facilities and that they go to a children's hospital or wherever.  This data, therefore, is not the right data either because it is looking at everybody in the area, including people who are highly unlikely to require the services.  I contest that using the total population data is flawed also.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses explained very well the need for the second laboratory if one breaks down or somebody is admitted in the middle of that or whatever but I refer to the wider argument of the hospital group idea, and it is still just an idea.<\/p><p>If we had two catheterisation laboratories in Waterford or one laboratory with six or seven consultants operating 24-7, with Cork operating as the centre of excellence, would it be okay to have this level of cardiac care within one hospital group?  The legislation does not provide that the current configuration of the hospital groups will remain in place.  While I may be wrong, the proposal has the potential to be a move towards having two cardiac centres of excellence in a region covered by one hospital group.  Is that the direction in which we are moving?  Is what the witnesses are asking for okay or is it part of a wider plan to expand cardiac services in University Hospital Waterford, which may result in two cardiac centres of excellence being provided in one hospital group?  Obviously, all the witnesses are interested in saving lives.<\/p><p>  The latest information is that 150 patients per day is definitely the new minimum standard.

The international standard is to express normative data, in other words, the number of heart attacks in a certain population and the number of stents required`, on a per million basis.  I guess this reflects the fact that, historically, it has been easier to count totalities than to subdivide and count people aged over 40 years or whatever it happens to be.  Incidence rates for myocardial infarction, the need for angiography and so forth are expressed in per million population.  Hence, the total number of 500,000 is the number to which one would apply the normative data.<\/p> <p>  As far as two cardiac centres of excellence are concerned, I see the issue not in those terms but in terms of need.  It is as simple as that.  A centre of excellence is another phrase that is subject to interpretation.  I consider it to mean a centre with a very strong academic cardiological pedigree.  Cork has such a pedigree and that is great but the purpose of expanding the service in Waterford is not to set us up as a competitor but simply to deal with the work we have to do.  It is worth pointing out at this point - this is particularly acute for Wexford and I am sure Dr. Buckley will  speak to this issue - that Wexford is outside the South-South West hospital group, yet its activity funnels into the catheterisation laboratory for the south east in Waterford.  This is one of the unintended consequences that have followed from the Higgins report in that the report identified University Hospital Waterford and South Tipperary General Hospital as being in one group, yet answering to the need of a much wider population that crosses borders.  This is an incredibly messy solution but that is where we find ourselves.  Professor Higgins identified it as a messy solution but one that required the service in Waterford to be developed to the point where the hospital could answer to the population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Owens"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486560600,"counter":762,"content":"<p>To follow on from Dr. Owens, there is no suggestion of empire building in Waterford.

This ratio can be increased a little by giving other medications.  While we routinely give these medications, one is still talking about a 55% to 65% chance of opening the artery.  Primary PCI gives as close as one can get to a guarantee that the artery will be open.  Patency rates, the rate at which the artery is rendered open, would approximate to around 95%.  That is one way of expressing the comparison.<\/p> <p>  Primary PCI is clearly a highly superior treatment for opening the artery.  The critical issue is that it takes longer to do using primary PCI because of the transfer time.  It is for this reason that the whole concept of the time delay to treatment has come to the fore.  While this is something of a generalisation, essentially what the figure of 90 minutes represents is the time point beyond which there is no superior benefit from primary PCI.<\/p><p>That does not mean, however, that at 89 minutes one accrues the entire benefit.  It means that the benefit arguably is one ninetieth of what it might otherwise be.  The 90 minute goal has become a hackneyed phrase and its meaning must be seen in those terms.  It is a question of relative benefit and the relative benefit is felt to be lost once the 90 minutes has elapsed, but the benefit is so much greater if one is at 60 minutes.  Perhaps an under-emphasised element of having a primary PCI unit in Waterford is that people from all over the south east, including south Tipperary and west Waterford, are within the 90 minute window for Cork, for example, or for St. James's but they are within a 60 minute window from Waterford and arguably a 30 minute window and that implies a much greater benefit from the procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017020800002#U01800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Owens","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486560600,"counter":779,"content":"<p>Could I also add that thrombolysis is contraindicated in a large number of people so it is just not an option for them because it is too dangerous.

I thank the members also.  We are delighted to have been invited to address the joint committee and to hear that prisons, penal policy and sentencing are on its work programme for 2017.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, is Ireland's leading non-governmental organisation campaigning for rights in the penal system and the progressive reform of Irish penal policy.  Our vision is of a penal system that is just and humane, that protects and promotes human rights, equality and social justice, and that only uses prison as a sanction of last resort.<br\/><br\/>I would like to begin with an overall observation that <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">reforms achieved since 2011 mean there is now a strong foundation on which to work towards a progressive penal system in Ireland - one led by innovation and best practice not crisis management, one that addresses and does not merely compound social inequalities.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Taken together, the cross-party consensus achieved in the<\/font><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality report on penal reform from March 2013, and the cross-agency consensus achieved in the strategic review of penal policy final report in July 2014 means there is a strong <\/font>basis for reform.  Indeed, implementation of the recommendations in both reports would represent significant advances in achieving a just and humane penal system, which would in turn contribute to safer and more equal communities.<\/p><p>Ireland's penal system is characterised by the systematic overuse of imprisonment as punishment.  Although our daily prison population is of average size by European standards, at approximately 79 per 100,000, our rates of committal to prison, and consequently our rates of release, are among the highest among the 46 countries of the Council of Europe area, and third highest in the European Union.  Our rate of release is the highest.<br\/><br\/>Ireland's prison population is characterised by mental health issues, addictions, homelessness, poverty, unemployment, educational disadvantage, chaotic family backgrounds and social marginalisation.  In this context, it is not surprising that re-offending rates on release from prison are high.  This does not mitigate the harm that is caused by offending, nor does it minimise the impact of crime on victims and the community.  However, if Ireland's criminal justice system and penal policy are to realise the goal of having safer communities, they must have at their centre a means of addressing the causes of offending behaviour, and not just punishment.<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> <\/font>As an overarching recommendation, IPRT calls for a clear Government commitment to evidence-informed criminal justice policy grounded in data and evidence of what works to reduce crime and improve community safety.  There should not be knee-jerk punitive responses to serious incidents.<br\/><br\/>It is worth restating two principles that underpin penal reform.  First, the deprivation of liberty is the punishment, and prison conditions must not be used as further punishment.  Second, at its core, prison is damaging in itself, and the negative impacts of prison on individuals, families and communities mean it should be only a sanction of last resort, reserved for the most serious offences and for those offenders who continue to present a serious risk to society.<i><\/i>Therefore, the emphasis of a progressive, just and humane penal policy should be on the following: investment in early intervention, prevention and diversion strategies; investment in community-based sanctions and non-custodial alternatives; protecting human rights and meeting best practice standards in prison with robust independent oversight, in cases where prison is the only appropriate response; and greater investment in rehabilitation services and post-release supports.  In all cases, provision must be on a nationwide basis and not solely concentrated in Dublin.<br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">There have been positive reforms in the prison system but, despite these, many serious issues remain, including c<\/font>rowding in a number of prisons, including Cloverhill and the two women's prisons.  Some 45% of prisoners do not have access to private toilet facilities, and 45% are sharing cells, which does not contribute to prison safety.  The majority of prisoners are locked up for 16 or 17 hours per day, with 72 prisoners in solitary confinement, which involves being locked up for 22 hours or more per day.  Thirty prisoners with serious mental health issues are awaiting transfer to acute psychiatric facilities.  In some locations, prison health has been found to be in a state of crisis.  The parole board has not yet been established, and decision-making on releases remains in political control.  The systems of accountability are weak.  In this regard, p<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">risoners still do not have access to an independent complaints mechanism; Ireland has not yet ratified the optional protocol to the convention against torture, which it will have signed ten years ago in October 2017.  We have not<\/font>seen a prisons<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">inspection report by the Office of the Inspector of Prisons published by the Minister since September 2014, which is two and a half to three years ago.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> <\/font>Robust independent oversight is crucial to the prevention of torture and degrading or inhumane treatment out of sight behind prison walls, and strengthening Ireland's systems of prisons accountability must be a priority.  To this end, we would like to see progress on the implementation of<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">the proposal of the Office of the Inspector of Prisons that the general Ombudsman be able to receive individual complaints from prisoners.  We would like to see progress on the inspection of places of detention Bill, including legislative change that would allow the Office of the Inspector of Prisons to publish its report directly to the Oireachtas.  We need to see ratification of the optional protocol to the convention against torture and the establishment of the national preventive mechanism.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> The optional protocol makes provision for a state to ratify the UN convention against torture and then establish the national preventive mechanism within three years.  We will be examined under the convention in July 2017.  Ratification of the optional protocol before that would show a Government commitment to meeting Ireland's obligations in this regard.  It would also give us a timeline of three years for the establishment of the national preventive mechanism.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> I thank the committee for its invitation to speak and for its attention to penal reform issues.  We will be happy to respond to members' questions as best we can.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms F&iacute;ona N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":821,"content":"<p>Even to me, as a member of the justice committee, I must admit some of the figures Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide outlined were a bit startling.

Has the delegation any comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#B00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":822,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Brien.  All his points are pertinent.  I will begin with his point on HIQA.  The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture stated in its report of November 2015 on its last visit to Ireland, in 2014, that health care conditions in some prisons were in a state of crisis.  Prior to that, the committee called for an independent audit and oversight of prison health care.  We are extremely concerned about the state of prison health care.  The committee mentioned HIQA.  The strategic review of penal policy implementation oversight group stated in its report that HIQA has said it cannot currently do it as proposed.  This is very disappointing.  If it is only a question of resources, those resources should follow.  For some other reason, this needs to be explored.  At a minimum, we believe the Department of Health should be involved in commissioning an independent external audit of prison health care.  Ultimately, we believe responsibility for prison health should move to the Department of Health.  The lack of independent external oversight and published reports from which we can tease out that there is public scrutiny and accountability across the whole system is often the basic issue.<\/p> <p>  With regard to committals, last year saw the highest number of individuals sent to prison, at 14,182.<\/p><p>This relates to 17,206 committals.  We have not seen this level since around 2011-2012 when we thought committals had reached their peak.<\/p><p> Fines and committals affect these figures.  Last year, 9,883 committals were for fines.  The Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 was only finally implemented in January of this year.  We will not know the full impact until the annual report of the Irish Prison Service is published in the spring or summer.  Last week, the director general of the Irish Prison Service gave evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts.  On that occasion he said that there had been a 15% reduction in fines committals during 2016.  It is a positive move but only brings the number down to about 8,000 fines committals.  We have called for an amnesty in the past.  There are hundreds and perhaps 1,000 outstanding warrants for fines.  This matter needs to be addressed.  It is a completely damaging and wasteful practice.  In most cases people are committed to prison for just a small number of hours because they do not present a risk to society.  These are people where the judge, in the original case, decided that prison was not an appropriate punishment for the offence committed.  When one removes the fines committals from the figures, the number of people sentenced by the courts rose by a smaller amount in 2015, across almost all sentence lengths.<\/p><p> We are concerned about the drop in the annual number of community service orders.  Research must be conducted into the reason for the decrease.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, has commissioned a Iongitudinal, long-scale, three-year report that we will publish in April.  We will welcome an opportunity to present its findings to the committee at that time.  The report focused on the lack of provisions.  We found that there was an inconsistent provision of community service orders or an inconsistent use of them by the courts throughout the country, a fact that needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> The Probation Service in its 2014 report found that the average cost of a probation order was &euro;5,000 and a community service order cost in the region of &euro;2,500.  The community payback or work that was done in the community was not included in the assessment.  Crimes are committed in the community so it is good that there is a community payback.<\/p><p> The Probation Service, also in its 2014 report, calculated the hours of community work conducted through the community return programme.  It estimated that community service orders were worth &euro;4.5 million to the community.  That is a significant sum that must be considered.  Prison is often spoken about as a cost-neutral solution to crime.  It costs just under &euro;70,000 per prison per annum, not including education and other costs.<\/p><p> We strongly welcomed the introduction of the Parole Bill 2016 by Deputy O'Callaghan.  We look forward to making submissions and detailed amendments in this regard.<\/p><p> I was unaware of the Sentencing Council Bill and thank Deputy Jonathan O'Brien for flagging it.<\/p><p> Bail is always a controversial issue in the media.  For example, the Department of Justice and Equality has mentioned Garda statistics that claim 75% of burglaries were committed by 25% of offenders.  The data and evidence to support the claim have not been published.  Therefore, we need to see the data and evidence on which policies are based.<\/p><p> A fundamental principle of our justice system is that one is innocent until proven guilty.  Prison should be a sanction of last resort in all cases and particularly pre-trial or before one has been convicted.  Having said that, there are reports that there are high offending rates while people are on bail.  This matter needs to be addressed sensibly and effectively.  We believe that where a judge believes there is a high likelihood that a further offence will be committed, the first resort should be tailored conditions and an individualised approach to bail conditions.  The IPRT has conducted research on bail courts and conditions handed down.  We have found that there tends to be a whole suite of bail conditions handed out to every individual before the courts and that they are not tailored to individuals' needs.<\/p><p> Bail supports have been proven to reduce offending by people who are out on bail.  We need to shorten the time between arrest, charging and the court date.  Bail supports are an opportunity to address offending behaviour, especially among groups who struggle to meet bail conditions, such as women, people with addictions and young people.  There is a big issue with young people not being given clear enough information about the consequences if they do not meet their bail conditions.<\/p><p> Good examples of bail supports include bail information schemes, bail support supervision schemes, remand fostering and bail hostels.  In Scotland supervised bail has led to a reduction in offending behaviour because 80% of the people who completed the bail supervision period did not go on to receive a custodial sentence.  The projects that take a view that the bail period is a time when offending behaviour can be addressed are much more successful in the long term.  Let us remember that locking a person up costs money and is not cost neutral.  We believe that moneys should instead be invested in services and supports that have been proved to be more effective at addressing crime.<\/p><p> I hope I have answered all of the questions posed by Deputy O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms F&iacute;ona N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":824,"content":"<p>Would Ms Martyn like to contribute to the debate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#C00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":825,"content":"<p>Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide and Deputy O'Brien have spoken about community-based sanctions.  Next week Ireland will be examined by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.  We will highlight the following to the committee: the disproportionate number of female prison committals for non-violent offences; the fact recent media reports indicate that the highest percentage of female committals continue to be for fine defaults; the lack of gender specific alternatives to custody; the annual decline in the number of community service orders for women for the years 2012 to 2015, inclusive; and a recent psychology report compiled by Dr. Porporino that states 60% of the women on a community return programme had returned to prison.  We believe women need a more specific focus because they are the most vulnerable in society.  Many of the women come from a background where they have suffered childhood sexual abuse or have care histories.  Men are more able to focus on their addictions but women have caring responsibilities or may be involved in abusive relationships.  The IPRT would like to see more gender-specific programmes for women.<\/p> <p>  I want to highlight the lack of post-release supports for women.  There is no open prison or open conditions for women.

I was looking forward to this debate but I am not so sure now.  Having heard the presentations I feel seriously depressed and it is only 9.30 in the morning.  This is the first of our modules on this topic.  It is great that we are airing these issues because they do not get enough attention.  This is a vast area for discussion.  It is hard to get a handle on these matters because we are only starting off.  We as a committee might have to be a little strategic on how we deal with this area.  I believe sending people to prison does not work.  It is not cheap and is harmful.  Our automatic starting point should be providing alternatives to prison.  I am constantly surprised that the austerity agenda has not developed this view more because society would be better off on a whole number of fronts if we did not have prisons or had substantially fewer of them.  Understanding the circumstances that lead people to prison is key to addressing this issue.<\/p> <p>  Last week, Mr. Michael Donnellan, the director general of the Irish Prison Service, attended the Committee of Public Accounts.  He said that two thirds of inmates have some form of addiction, either drug or alcohol related.  A large proportion of the prison population have seriously psychotic mental health problems.  These are the people whom society previously put into asylums.  Some of the prison population should not be in prison at all.  They suffer with health issues and that is how they should be treated.  The committee needs to consider these aspects.<\/p> <p>  In terms of sentencing people who have been found guilty of drug offences or whatever, there is no non-custodial treatment penalty in Ireland and the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act allows for that to happen.<\/p><p>Rather than people being sent to prison, they agree to sign up to a counselling or addiction programme to get them drug free and they have supports.  However, that does not seem to exist.  Only one person at a time can be taken from a prison to the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum when there are 30 other seriously psychotic prisoners who urgently need treatment.  When that prisoner comes out after several weeks, the next fellow can go in but by that stage, the fellow who had been sent back is probably ready to go back in again.  The harm being done in that regard is criminal.  How does the Irish Penal Reform Trust see that element being addressed?<\/p><p> There is no doubt that when a woman goes to prison, the impact on society is far greater.  Studies have shown that when a man goes to prison, the family pulls together with the woman saving money to make sure the man has his smokes and the children can visit him.  When a woman goes to prison, the children quite often end up in care or the family unit&rsquo;s accommodation is lost.  The idea of no prison for women or of small community residential units, replicating family life while maintaining links with people&rsquo;s families, are key to the rehabilitation process.  Are there measures the Irish Penal Reform Trust believes should be pushed to keep contact with the family?  When someone goes to prison, it is stressful for their relatives.  If keeping the family connection helps someone not to re-offend, what can be done to bring the family unit on board?<\/p><p> I put down many parliamentary questions on medical care in prisons.  Many of the medical positions in the prisons are vacant or are filled by locums.  What is the problem with this?  Is it a terms and conditions matter?  The replies to my parliamentary questions state it is not a question of resources but still the positions are not filled.<\/p><p> In getting a sensible policy on prisons which helps everyone, the media must be called into question as they are responsible for holding back serious discussions on this issue.  They sensationalise crime and those in prison.  They think of demeaning names and slang for them, which is used to sell newspapers against the background of declining newspaper readership, and they are completely irresponsible.  In my experience, some people in the Department who would push for reform are afraid that they will be portrayed in the media as being soft on crime and will receive the full wrath of the public as a result.  The media should be called to account for their irresponsible coverage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#C00500","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":829,"content":"<p>In 2012, the Irish Penal Reform Trust issued a report, &ldquo;Picking up the Pieces&rdquo;: The Rights and Needs of Children and Families Affected by Imprisonment.  Subsequently, children affected by imprisonment were identified in the national policy framework for children and young people as having specific needs and a commitment was made to them.  Approximately, 6,000 children are currently affected by parental imprisonment and 17,000 are affected every year.  That is a large number of children.<\/p> <p>  Since our report, the Irish Prison Service has set up a family imprisonment group and looked to improve prison visiting conditions for children and families.  As Deputy Clare Daly said, children and families are key to rehabilitation.  From the beginning of a sentence, children and families should be involved and relationships should be maintained through sentence management and after release.  The children in question are more likely to have mental health problems or end up in the criminal justice system themselves.<\/p> <p>  From our interviews with young people affected, we learned they cannot hear their parents in prison.  Accordingly, they like the special visits because they can hug the parent.  Another issue is inconsistency in the conditions across the prison estate.  The last report from the D&oacute;chas Centre visiting committee recommended financial support should be given to families visiting because female prisoners tend to come from further away as there are only two female prisons, namely, the D&oacute;chas Centre in Dublin and the female wing in Limerick Prison.<\/p> <p>  Apart from the Bedford Row Family Project in Limerick, there are no other support agencies for families of prisoners across the country.  Savings can be made for the State if supports are provided.  In the UK, the Prison Advice and Care Trust, PACT, has shown a social return on investment of &pound;11.40 for every &pound;1 of public money spent on family supports for prisoners.  The Scottish Government invested &pound;1.8 million over three years providing proper visitor centres to ensure children will attend them.  Children and families are the most important factor in rehabilitating a person, particularly for long-term and life-sentence prisoners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Martyn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":830,"content":"<p>Deputy Clare Daly raised the issue of drug offences and the estimated 70% of people in prison having addiction issues.  This comes as no surprise.  It is a well-known international phenomenon.  Drugs need to be treated first as a public health issue and second as a criminal justice issue.  The problem starts with the lack of residential treatments in the community.  In prison, there are issues around waiting lists for access to addictions treatment.  Often prisoners present with dual diagnosis, both addiction and mental health issues which need to be treated at the same time.  Our recommendation is that there needs to be investment in community mental health and addictions treatment and services.  There should be a diversion of people at the first point within the criminal justice system, that is, with the Garda.  On committal to prison, there needs to be an assessment and diversion to more appropriate therapeutic treatments and services.  Prison conditions and regimes need to be improved, along with improved training for staff.  There needs to be the establishment of vulnerable care units in all prisons, modelled on the successful high support unit in Mountjoy Prison and a shift from pharmacological treatment towards therapeutic interventions.  There should not be waiting lists.  All prisoners who want to address their addictions should be able to access treatment, not only methadone but detox beds, drug treatment landings and counselling.  At root, it is a public health issue first.  I know the previous justice committee examined the Portuguese model in this regard.  That research would be a good first point.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Penal Reform Trust does not know why there is a difficulty in filling the health placements in prisons.  There are issues with security, staff ratios on a given day and prioritisation of details.  For example, the Midlands Prison is a super prison with 820 prisoners but it has fewer resources than Wheatfield Prison, which has fewer than 500 prisoners.  There are concerns about prisoners&rsquo; ability to access psychological and psychiatric health care interventions.  Often when a doctor is called, he or she cannot get to the landing because of security and the prison officers are not available.  This is an issue experienced by all prisons and much of it comes down to court escorts etc.  The Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention recommended a review of this, which I understand is ongoing.<\/p><p>One is filling the positions, the other is having the staff available to bring the doctors down.<\/p><p> On Deputy Daly's point about the media, we know this.  The former press ombudsman, Professor John Horgan, was very clear on this.  Murder makes up 0.05% of crime but makes up 15% to 20% of media reports.  The vast majority of crimes committed are not serious or are less serious or minor offences.  They get resolved and never come to light again.  It is a huge problem.  We are very concerned, particularly around the conversations about parole reform.  We wonder if the media is not, to some extent, exploitative, in going to victims' families at the seven-year point.  We all know that the likelihood of any prisoner who is sentenced to life getting out at 15 or 20 years is very slim, so it is very questionable that they approach families to seek their response on that.  We find that highly problematic.  It underlines the importance of parole reform and the progress of the Parole Bill 2016.  We have to release decision making from political control because people who are reliant on the public to vote them into office are more likely to be concerned about public perceptions of their actions.  It is unfair that media reporting should influence a decision around a prisoner's suitability for release, which should be based purely on risk-assessment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms F&iacute;ona N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":832,"content":"<p>On the issue of women, has there been any attention given to what is called in other jurisdictions, conjugal visits?

There have been a number of reports before in respect of the area of penal reform, for example, the Whitaker committee report around 30 years ago and the Oireachtas sub-committee report in 2013.  I am conscious that at the end of this process this committee is going to produce a report.  It is such a huge area and there is so much academic research.  Many of the characteristics of people who are in prison are quite obvious.  People come from very similar backgrounds with regard to educational disadvantage.  In terms of what we can do as a committee, I would like to hear Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide's views on whether we should just concentrate on two or three areas.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses have said that there are over 9,800 committals for people who did not pay fines.  That is over 50% or 60% of the committals per annum.  It is obviously a huge amount.  From a political point of view, most people in the country would think that it is a waste of money and that it is wrong that people should go to jail for not paying fines.  What would Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide think about the committee focusing on two or three issues, one issue being fines, rather than producing a general report that covers everything?  I would also ask what recommendations she would have for us as to how we should deal with the issue of fines?  In the case of a minor offence, like a road traffic offence, for which obviously a people should not go to jail, they get a fine.  If they do not pay the fine the law is undermined and the effectiveness of the law is lost because people know that at the end of the day nothing happens.  One does not go to jail, one does not have to pay a fine.  I would be interested to hear what Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide thinks as to how that should be dealt with in terms of fines.<\/p> <p>  Another area where there seems to be a large prison population, and where the general public would also be sympathetic, is people with drug addictions.  Some would have minor drug addictions but come out of prison with major drug addictions.  How do we cope with that, bearing in mind that some people who have drug addictions can be convicted for very serious offences?  <\/p> <p>  It is important, and I would be interested to hear Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide's point of view, that obviously we have to try to produce a report that will get broad support so that we can change the law.  There is no point in us coming out with a report which the Irish Penal Reform Trust will think is great but which other groups will say is an affront to victims' rights because it is a political issue as well.  To look to America, there are victims' rights groups, which are really advocates for the death penalty, and there are prisoners' rights groups.  It is important that this committee tries to get somewhere in the middle ground and deal with one or two issues.  I would be interested to hear what Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide has to say in respect of fines and individuals who have drug addictions when they are going into prison.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#E00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":835,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Callaghan.  We completely agree that we do not need more reports proving the value of penal reform: the Whitaker committee report, the management of offenders from 1994, the Oireachtas sub-committee report in 2013, which we thought was extremely strong, and the strategic review of penal policy.  What we need now is implementation.  I agree with the Deputy.<\/p> <p>  Regarding what could be useful to address fines, it takes a while for practices to change.  We had concerns with the two fines Acts; the Fines Act 2010 initially, that was not fully implemented, and then the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014, which was only fully implemented in January.  We would have questions on these.  For example, we believe the threshold of &euro;100 is too high for payment by instalment and that there should be no limit.  For people coming from certain circumstances at certain times of year coming up with &euro;100 on the spot can be very difficult, for example two weeks before Christmas when getting Christmas presents for the kids.  We would remove that &euro;100 as a base.  The original Fines Act 2010 had provision for payment by instalment of fines over two years in certain circumstances.  That was reduced to 12 months in the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014.  We would extend it.  We see no reason it should not be over 24 months.  We hear again and again from people who want to pay but who cannot pay upfront and in full.  People should be facilitated to pay.  We agree that it is a completely wasteful practice that puts an enormous burden on the Prison Service.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy is completely accurate that committals for non-payment of fines made up more than 50% of total committals in 2015.  Nobody agrees that this is the best way to go.  There are provisions in the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 for alternatives.  There is now provision for attachment of earnings orders if people do not pay.  We would wonder slightly why people are continuing to be sent to prison but it could be based on the date that they received the fine.  There are attachment of earnings orders for people who are in employment.  There is provision for community service alternatives for people who are not in employment.  There are recovery orders.  There is a suite of measures.  Essentially an evaluation is needed.  It has been in operation for a year now, so the first point would be an evaluation of its success and to see if those other provisions are being used or if the default is still prison even though that is not in accordance with the legislation.  That would be a very useful thing to do.  <\/p> <p>  I agree completely that justice needs to be done and needs to be seen to be done, and anything that enhances public confidence in the system is to be welcomed.  It would also be useful to do more research on community-based alternatives, to look more closely at them and to invite groups in to talk about them.  Some work was done by the previous Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and a proposal was accepted by the then Minister regarding community courts.  To return to something that Deputy O'Brien asked initially, community courts are expensive to set up in the first instance but this is about the longer game.  This is about saving money but re-offending rates are a very narrow way of looking at the success of any provision.  One needs to consider that if people do not go to prison they are maintained in their community, they stay with their families, the impacts on the children are minimised and, if they are in employment, they can maintain their job.<\/p><p>It is better for the community and it is less damaging.<\/p><p> Mindful of Ireland's obligation to implement the European Union victims directive, which the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, welcomes, we would have concerns about legislation that seeks to go beyond the EU directive but victims are less well served by the Irish criminal justice system.<\/p><p> Restorative justice has been found to be extremely beneficial to offenders and victims alike, with reported satisfaction rates of 90% which, compared to satisfaction rates in the criminal justice system, are multiples of that figure.  There is provision in the EU victims directive for restorative justice.  We are only now commissioning analysis of the victims Bill as published but we believe the restorative aspect is quite weak in that Bill and should be strengthened.  It would be very valuable to talk to groups like Facing Forward.  Restorative justice is not new to Ireland.  The Nenagh reparation project has been running for the past ten years but we are a great country for successful pilot projects that never get national provision.  In 2009, the National Commission on Restorative Justice agreed unanimously that that should be rolled out nationwide.  More focus on restorative justice and more examination of the benefits for victims and offenders alike would be valuable.<\/p><p> We mentioned the community courts, community service and restorative justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms F&iacute;ona N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":837,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Chinn&eacute;ide for her answer.

While he seemed happy with the answer, I have a problem with a particular aspect which I would like to tease through with the witnesses.  There is a constant reference to minor offences that are deemed by certain groups or whatever to be low impact or not affecting victims.  However, the reality in terms of victims of crime and communities is that many of the offences the witnesses or the system might deem to be minor are high impact on both the victims and the communities when they are committed repeatedly.  I refer in particular to the impact of the crime of burglary.  A single act of burglary can destroy an older person's entire life.  It can destroy their home, where they live, relationships within families and their ability to live independently in a community.  I do not believe they care much for the terminology to the effect that it was a one-off, low impact, minor or non-violent crime because for them the impact is almost as great as violence.<\/p> <p>  In the event of somebody committing multiple offences such as burglary, and without going back to the entire system that got them there, particularly if they are affected by drugs, what is the witnesses' view as to what they should do in that situation?  Fining the person will not work.  I do not believe that keeping them within a community will necessarily work if there is not a willingness to change a behavioural pattern.  I agree with a host of what the witnesses advocate in terms of the reform process, the resourcing process and so on.  What worries me is that when giving a number of answers they seemed to step over to a certain point with which I have a real difficulty, namely, the lack of recognition of the impact of crime on victims and how there must be an element of recognition of that by the State through the judicial process.  They are correct to say there is a cost in terms of imprisonment but sometimes there is a real cost to society from non-imprisonment.<\/p> <p>  Another area on which I would pick a fault with the witnesses, and I am on record as having said this previously, is that the behaviour in terms of some of the media coverage here amounts to nothing short of the glorification of crime and the creation of almost Kardashian-like characters who, while being vilified by \"media sources\", are almost portrayed as people we should look up to and whose lives we should be interested in and follow.  On the other hand, they went a step too far when they queried the right of anybody to ask the victim of a violent crime their view on parole for the person who committed that crime.  There is a right to have that voice heard and if the way that voice is heard is through the media, that is a right.  I put in the first caveat clearly but I strongly disagree with the witnesses that there is no role further down the line for the family of a victim of a murder to have their voice heard on how parole should be decided in the future.  I would like the witnesses to come back on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#F00700","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":843,"content":"<p>To clarify, I did not mean to say there should not be a right.  My question was specifically about the seven year first parole hearing point when we know that no prisoner will be released at the seven year point.  There is an unofficial policy that it will be a minimum 15 years so I wondered whether it is exploitative to ask the question at seven years, but I completely agree that there should be no deprivation of rights in terms of people being heard.<\/p> <p>  Also, I said in the opening statement that in all our points we do not seek to minimise the impact of crime on victims.  It is important that victims' needs are heard and met, and we completely support the full implementation of the EU victims directive so we are clear on that.  We believe victims' rights and prisoners' rights can be respected at the same time.  To clarify, it was about the seven year first parole hearing.<\/p> <p>  Many assumptions are made and a good deal of research has been done on what victims want.<\/p><p>Professor Joanna Shapland has done a lot of research in the area and her findings are that victims and offenders often want the same thing from the criminal justice system, which is, essentially, fairness.  As I mentioned, it has been found that there are high rates of satisfaction reported by victims with restorative justice, but it is important that their involvement is voluntary.  There should never be an obligation on victims to engage in the process.  However, it gives an opportunity to victims to ask questions that remain in their minds.  In the case of burglary, it might be, \"Why was I targeted?\" or \"Was I being watched?\"  A victim will not get closure on the impact of crime but will see that the offender has come face to face with the impact of the crime committed.<\/p><p> We talk about \"less serious offences\" rather than \"minor\" offences in recognition of the fact that there is always a victim at the end of an offence.  In one regard, none of them are \"minor\"; they are all \"less serious\". <\/p><p> The issue of re-offending and burglary was raised.  Burglary is an interesting case in point.  Professor Andrew Coyle has noted that a doctor would not just keep increasing the dose, doubling and trebling it, if he or she finds a medicine is not working.  Recidivism rates of people imprisoned for burglary offences are the highest on release from prison.  The most recent report had the rate at just under 69%.  The statistics come with a warning from the Central Statistics Office, which is that its collation of data has been improved over the years, so they are not completely reliable.  A rate of 69% for re-offending suggests that prison for burglary is not working.  It is not comparing like with like, but the equivalent probation statistics are 45%.  The other serious issue revealed by recidivism statistics is that a significant proportion of those who have been put in prison for different offences are coming out of prison committing burglary for the first time.  We would, therefore, question the effectiveness of prison as a blunt response or an overall response to burglary in particular.  <\/p><p> We very much welcome restorative justice initiatives such as the joint agency response to crime, which has proven successful.  This involves joined-up thinking and case management with offenders and repeat offenders or, to quote the T&aacute;naiste, \"serial offenders\".  We think these initiatives are more effective.  We must focus on reducing crime and not just punishing it.  The two must happen at the same time.<\/p><p> Tougher sentencing is often proposed as a response to crime but it is very limited in its deterrent effects.  It is effective in terms of incapacitation for the length of time that the person is in prison.  It has been estimated that the prison population would have to be increased by 25% to reduce crime by 1%.  It is not a practical, cheap or cost-effective way of addressing crime.  We agree about the impact of crime on victims and believe more research needs to be done.  Perhaps the committee would consider inviting before it the Victims Rights Alliance, which is a great organisation in that regard.  Often what victims want is to know that the offender will not re-offend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Ms F&iacute;ona N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":845,"content":"<p>I listened to what Ms. N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide said and I accept some of it.

However, there is a whole raft of views on why repeat burglary offences are committed by those who come out on what are very short burglary sentences.  It is perhaps an area for another day.  Leaving out the drugs side of it for a second, if someone is consistently committing less serious offences, to use Ms. N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide's term, or minor offences or whatever and that situation is not being resolved by other means, there seems to me to be a need for a custodial-type regime at that point that protects the public as well as just focusing on different areas in terms of rehabilitation of the offender.

I will speak about addiction.  I have worked in D&oacute;chas Prison and with women who have been in recovery from addiction.  I hear what the witnesses are saying and I have a couple of questions, but first I will tell them why I am asking them.  I worked with a family that was devastated by their son's addiction.  He was a lovely young lad, except that, when he was in his addiction, he would act recklessly and was in and out of prison.  He came to them one day when he knew he had a sentencing hearing.  At last he came and said, \"Look, if there is any chance that I can get into treatment, I really want to do it\".  If he could choose, he would go into treatment rather than prison.  Unfortunately, the family found it very difficult to get him into treatment because there was nowhere available for him.  It was a real struggle.  Then they decided to ring the Joe Duffy show.  It was only then, having gone to the media, that he got into treatment.  I will be going to his graduation.  He will be a year clean and sober this month, which is fantastic and a perfect example of what recovery can do.  He is now in a relationship and is leading a really good life and his family are in a great place.<\/p> <p>  What evidence or reports are available on people who have stepped into recovery and stopped going in and out of prison and not re-offending?  Is there any evidence or reports on the cost associated with it?  It would have cost the prison service &euro;70,000 if the lad had gone to jail for the year but treatment probably cost less than half of that sum.  Is there any evidence on that matter?<\/p> <p>  Why have the recommendations in the last report not been implemented?<\/p> <p>  I apologise if it was addressed earlier, but I have one other question.

They are the two things that generally tend to be obstacles.  There is progress on the strategic review of penal policy.  There have been two reports published on implementation.  We can see positive engagement by the Prison Service and the Probation Service in this regard but progress is slow.  Other agencies are not responding in a like manner.<\/p> <p>  We are disappointed in particular by the statutory bar on temporary release for people sentenced to mandatory or presumptive ten years for drug offences.  There were two recommendations that the situation should be changed.  The Law Reform Commission in its report on mandatory sentencing in 2013 made such a recommendation and the strategic review group echoed that.  The oversight implementation reports that the proposal was made to the Minister for Justice and Equality and that it was rejected and it will be resubmitted.  More clarity is required in this regard.  Progress is slow.  It is a case of baby steps.<\/p> <p>  Five key points were made in the report of the Oireachtas committee on penal reform.  The first was a commitment to decarceration to reduce prison numbers.  There has been progress in this regard.  In 2011, the numbers were 4,600 and rising.  Yesterday, there were 3,734 people in prison and that represents an increase of 80 to 100 people on the previous month.  It is never certain that progress has been made but overall there has been a reduction.  We believe it should go further and that the daily prison population, which is currently 79 per 100,000, should be reduced to 60 per 100,000 or even 50.  The director general mentioned that reoffending rates in Nordic countries is 35%.  The Nordic model is more successful overall so we welcome all moves in this direction.<\/p> <p>  The second point made by the Oireachtas committee is that prison sentences of less than six months should be commuted and replaced with community service orders.  That did not happen.  It is a good recommendation.  The Probation Service needs to have resources in order that as its remit expands, as we believe it should, given that community-based sanctions are much more effective in many cases, it gets the resources to be able to meet that need.<\/p> <p>  The third point is to increase standard remission from one quarter to one third and introduce an incentivised remission scheme of up to one half.  That recommendation goes back to the Whitaker report from 1985, which Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned.  Remission is not something that enjoys wide public or political appeal.  There has been a very successful introduction of what is known as the community return programme.  Prisoners who are deemed eligible, who are serving longer sentences, can be released into the community at the 50% mark to complete their sentence in the community.  That greatly aids resettlement in the community.  There is a saving on the &euro;70,000 per year cost of individuals being in prison while gaining from the community payback.  The programme has been enormously successful.  The reports are that compliance rates are 90% although we remain very concerned about why women are being returned to prison in 60% of cases when men are only being returned in 10% to 15% of cases.  The issue must be examined.  The programme is very positive.  The numbers are beginning to fall, and the suggestion is that all those who are eligible have engaged with the programme.  A total of 450 prisoners were released into the community return programme in 2014 and it was 370 in 2015.  We have proven the model and shown it works.  Let us expand the criteria and get more prisoners released in this way.  The initiative has been very successful.  Internationally, people are looking at Ireland as a model in this regard.  It is a rare good news story.<\/p> <p>  The fourth recommendation is the introduction of legislation providing for a structured release, temporary release, parole and community return.  Community return has gone ahead but there has been very little progress on parole.  There had been none until Deputy O'Callaghan introduced his Parole Bill in June 2016.  Again, it is a case of baby steps.<\/p> <p>  The final recommendation is to address prison conditions and overcrowding and to increase the use of open prisons.  Prison conditions have improved in many prisons but they continue to be substandard and unfit in many prisons.  We are very concerned about conditions in Cloverhill Prison.  We have not seen an inspection report.  We have seen a visiting committee report on the prison and we understand the Inspector of Prisons completed an inspection report on the prison but it has not yet been published.  We need inspection reports to be published in order that we can tease them out and learn what is going on.  We are very concerned about the Midlands Prison.  Half the prison population there are protection prisoners who have vastly reduced access to regimes.  The regime is not considered to be a restricted one because the prisoners are not locked up for 19 hours a day but they are spending a lot of time on landings not able to access education and training workshops.  They also report reduced access to medical treatment.  We have many concerns about that.  There has been no improvement in terms of increasing the use of open prisons.  Yesterday, I worked out that just under 8% of prisoners were in open prison facilities.  We would like to see the goal to be a rate of 30%, especially with reference to the Nordic model.  As Ms Martyn said earlier, the lack of provision of open prison facilities for women in particular is something that needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms F&iacute;ona N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":858,"content":"<p>Why do the witnesses think there is a lack of political will in particular in implementing the report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#H00300","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":859,"content":"<p>I might be a little unfair in saying that because there have been bold moves and there has been progress which must be acknowledged.

The witnesses have touched on so many problems with how policing is done.  When we present a large number of issues to a Department or to the Government, much of it gets lost.<\/p> <p>  Many would agree that the prison system is not working.  That is a problem not just for the prisoners but also for the victims because people reoffend.  We seem to have been very slow to learn from international best practice.

What do the witnesses think could be done to address the fact we are in the Dark Ages in this country in terms of how we deal with prisons and prisoners?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses touched on the poor behaviour of the media and the unbalanced coverage of issues.

Is there any way to address the challenges in this regard?<\/p><p> My third question is about the community service orders.

With regard to the media, there are challenges as we know.  The media has a very important function in terms of the public interest, but that is separate from what the public is interested in.  There are huge problems with crime sensationalism.  Cruel and unusual things have high news value, so when we have a media that is dependent on sales that is where the emphasis will be.  Crime coverage is almost equal to entertainment.  For example, a study of the <i>Irish Daily Star<\/i>found that most coverage was given to sport, next was entertainment and after that it was crime.  It is among those categories, so I do not believe there is a golden nugget there.  There are some good publicly funded investigative journalism projects that are very hopeful for the future.  I point members to the TheDetail.TV which did the investigative journalism to reveal the lengths of time individuals are spending in solitary confinement in Ireland.  That was the first time those figures had been made available.  Not all media are bad.  In that case it revealed that of 51 men held in solitary confinement in January 2016, 24 had been so held for more than six months and nine for more than one year.  Peter McVerry has said that individuals have been held in solitary confinement conditions for years in some cases.  The media have a very important role in terms of transparency and public interest, so we do not wish to tar them all with the same brush.<br\/><br\/>Regarding community service, the 2016 statistics and annual reports will not be published until spring or summer.  In 2015, there were 1,937 community service orders made.  That compares with 2,190 in 2014 and 2,354 the previous year.  I do not have the previous report but it was higher again in 2012.  There has been a year on year decrease in community service orders being handed down.  There are big questions as to why that should be the case.  The IPRT will publish research in April this year, which we will be delighted to share with the committee, which examines those factors.  Much of it is due to the role of information among the Judiciary and confidence in the Judiciary in the community service order options that are available locally.  Community service should happen in the community where people live and our understanding is that community service is not consistently applied, available or used around the country.  Again, we are back to the evidence base.  We must look at the evidence, see where the problems are and address them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Ms F&iacute;ona N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":869,"content":"<p>I wish to make an additional point about the media.  It involves all of us trying to work together to educate both the media and the general public about crime and prison.  In Sweden, for example, the newspapers have subscription rates so the issue with many tabloids does not happen there like that.  In the case of prisoners, the media might say it is a public interest story when perhaps the prisoner is going to university after release, and then that upsets the rehabilitation goals.  I do not know what the solution is but everybody must work together to try to address it.  This issue is wider than just the prison.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Martyn"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":870,"content":"<p>I agree that the media have the potential to be an incredibly positive influence in a society.

I do not know if that system is used in Ireland.  I am not sure how it is done which is why I asked what the structure is.  For example, we are reducing the number of people involved in direct labour for the local authorities and there has been a huge move towards privatisation for a number of years.  I do not know if the local authorities here were ever used for that purpose but the Europeans use such a system.  There is potential for community service orders to be used in that area through that system.  Let us say a judge orders a person to do 200 hours community service.  How does the person do it?

There is a difference, believe me.  Senator Black talked about people who go into recovery and emerge from it and mentioned that one third end up relapsing.  Very little research has been done on the reasons that they relapse.  The reasons are very broad and they vary.  People can relapse when they come out of a rehabilitation or residential centre and they face one of the major obstacles, which is housing.  In many cases, they have no option but to go back into homeless shelters where drug use is prevalent and that contributes to them relapsing.  There are many other issues, but I agree there is very little research.<\/p> <p>  The issue I wish to discuss is drug addiction within the prisons.  A total of 85% of women and 70% of men in the prison population have an addiction.  Why is that?  I believe it is because we have a system in which addicts are criminalised.  Over 80% of all drug convictions in the State - it I believe it is 86% but I am open to correction - are convictions for being caught with drugs for personal use.  If we addressed that, what impact would it have on penal reform and sentencing?<\/p><p> I have a follow-up question to that.  When one gets a drug conviction, it is a conviction for life.  Even if those convicted go into rehabilitation, come out clean and never reoffend, they have drug convictions hanging over them for the rest of their lives, which can have very severe consequences for those individuals for the rest of their lives.  What role do spent convictions have in this regard, particularly for those individuals who have addictions?  This Government and the previous Government have talked about spent convictions a lot but we have seen very little action in this regard.  I believe spent convictions have a huge role to play in penal reform and sentencing.  The goal should be to try to avoid a prison sentence.  However, if somebody is convicted, I do not believe that the conviction should stay with him or her for life.  One gets a conviction and does one's time and punishment.  Part of this is being rehabilitated back into the community.  It is counterproductive on the one hand to try to rehabilitate those convicted back into society to stop them from reoffending but, on the other, to tell them they must carry convictions for the rest of their days.  The latter is just wrong.  What are the witnesses' opinions on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#J01300","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":876,"content":"<p>At root, we do not believe that people with substance misuse issues should be criminalised in order to access treatment.  That is a fundamental issue.  The same applies to women in particular.  There is a cohort of women for whom prison is a place of respite.  There is no more damning indictment on society than the fact that anybody should think prison is the safest place to be.  There is a huge issue beyond prison concerning the provision of safe, supported housing in the community that needs to be addressed.  The same applies to children.  There is documented overuse of remand for children in order to access mental health assessment in Oberstown, which is another issue.  Approximately 50% of children in the detention school system are on remand at any one time.  This compares with 15% of the adult population.  Put simply, nobody should be criminalised to access treatments and services they need in the community, and that is a full stop.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the decriminalisation of drugs for personal use.  We do not believe this would necessarily have a huge impact on the prison population.  We know that CityWide and other groups that are better informed than we are in understanding the paths of desistance towards recovery of addictions have proposed this, so we stand by their proposal.  If somebody has addiction issues, I do not think personal use will be the problem; the problem will be all the other crime that comes with an addiction, namely, shoplifting, burglary and other crimes.  To that end, I could not agree with the Deputy more about spent convictions legislation and the need to acknowledge and respond to people who have demonstrated that they have moved away from their offending behaviour.  We ask people to stop offending and we need to acknowledge when they stop and reduce any barriers they might continue to face through having a criminal record, such as in accessing jobs, training, education, travel and even home or car insurance.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust has campaigned on this issue since at least 2008.  It is a huge issue.<\/p> <p>  The Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act was finally introduced in January 2016, signed into law in February and commenced in April.  We find it extremely disappointingly limited.  We acknowledge that it will be of benefit to many people but it is extremely limited in its application and we believe it fails to support rehabilitation of people with more serious offending.  As it stands, there is no limit to the number of minor motoring offences and public order offences that can become spent, but only one other conviction can become spent.  If one has two or more other convictions, neither can become spent.  It is a huge issue.  The current position does not take into account in any way the circumstances that may have contributed to a person's offending behaviour at the time, which could have been youth, addictions, poverty or any range of other circumstances.  It presumes that one contact with the criminal justice system is enough for people to escape all these circumstances of disadvantage and marginalisation, which we know is not the case.  We also know that people grow up, move away from crime and move on.  We hear from people so often who are now in their late 20s, have got married and have kids.  They want to move to Australia and they have moved away from the impulsive, low-self-regulated immature behaviour they engaged in when they were 18, 19 or 20 but these convictions pursue them 20, 30 or 40 years after the fact.  If one has two separate convictions for shoplifting, for example, from 20 years ago, they are still on one's record indefinitely.  We would strongly welcome a review of, and more attention being paid to, this issue.  We have generous provision for offences committed by people when they are aged 18 or younger, and there is a proposal, reported in the newspapers last week, that these provisions could be extended up to the age of 24 at a minimum.  We would strongly recommend this as a first point, but the overall point is whether we are giving people second chances.  Are we acknowledging that they have moved away from their offending behaviour?  No one is suggesting that convictions be removed from one's criminal record overnight.  One demonstrates that one has moved on, and then society needs to acknowledge people's efforts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017020800002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms F&iacute;ona N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":877,"content":"<p>An example of that would be a person with whom I was dealing and who has applied to join the Army but who had a motoring offence for driving with no insurance ten years previously.

There was another fatal accident yesterday and I express my sympathies to the family, as I did in the Seanad yesterday.  I also thank the committee for the invitation to come here today to discuss what may be the most emotional subject in my Department.  Saving lives is a very high priority, if not the top priority, and that is what we are here to do today.  If any member of the committee wants to make suggestions or talk to any of my officials afterwards about certain situations they think could be remedied in a certain way, they are welcome to do so.  I am happy to give a certain amount of time to people to talk in private and public about this issue because it is so important.  I hope they will take that in the spirit in which it is meant.<\/p> <p>  I think we all agree that the increase in road fatalities in 2016 to 188 is deeply disappointing.  The number of fatalities as a result of a road traffic collision in 2015 was 162.  While this was the second time in the past five years that record low numbers were seen, the reality is that each of those deaths is one too many.  Notwithstanding the fact that has also been an upward trend in road fatalities over the past few years in Europe and in the US, we must all work to ensure that the upward trend at home is reversed.  I think people should realise that despite the fact that 2015 was a good year, the two preceding years were bad.  It is never a good year but 2015 was an improvement while 2016 was a continuation of the upward trend in road fatalities we have seen in the past four years.  That is a very serious acknowledgement.  My officials, the Road Safety Authority and I are working to tackle the main causes of serious road collisions causing death and major injuries.  We have identified the four main causes of death and serious injury on our roads.  They are speeding, intoxicated driving, use of mobile phones and non-wearing of seat belts.  Our road safety strategy must place a renewed focus on addressing these four killer behaviours.  We are launching a sustained attack on drunk drivers.  <\/p> <p>  To improve road safety, we need to keep up the pressure on all fronts - enforcement, engineering, education and awareness, driver training and vehicle standards.  On all these fronts, I am actively considering what measures can be introduced to curb the devastating rise in road deaths last year and to reverse this trend.  My Department, local authorities and I continue to push forward with this multi-pronged approach.  The Road Safety Authority, the Department of Justice and Equality, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities, the Health and Safety Authority, the Office of the Attorney General and I are now meeting quarterly, which is a doubling of meetings in a year, to tackle the upward trend in road deaths.  I convened the latest meeting of the ministerial committee on 12 January as a meeting that was not scheduled and have arranged a further meeting that will take place next month as a direct result of the figures that are coming in.<\/p><p>The figures for this year have not improved.  They are the same today as on this day last year.  We are five or six weeks into the new year.  <br\/><br\/>At our last meeting, in January, I very much welcomed the assurance by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that there will be an increase of 10% in the traffic corps during the course of 2017, resulting in more checkpoints and greater enforcement of traffic law, and that road safety enforcement is a priority in the 2017 Garda policing plan.  Resources are somewhat sparse but the Garda has responded to these figures in a way that is meaningful and that I hope will produce results.  <br\/><br\/>The road safety strategy for the period 2013 to 2020, which sets out the Government's plans for road safety and contains 144 separate actions, is currently undergoing a midterm review, and a meeting of stakeholders to facilitate this review was held in Dublin Castle last November.  I attended part of it.  The Road Safety Authority is currently completing a report on this review, which I understand will be presented to me in the coming weeks.  Reports and reviews are no longer enough, and reports about reviews are no longer enough.  We are committed to taking action now in a very proactive way, as seen from the programme of legislation and other measures that I will outline.  <br\/><br\/>Regrettably, there is no single action or silver bullet to decrease the number of deaths and serious injuries from collisions on our roads.  There are heavy penalties under road traffic legislation to ensure those detected are severely punished.  The new Road Traffic Act 2016, just passed, contains further measures to make our roads safer.  That Act, which was signed into law on 27 December 2016, includes new road safety measures dealing with drug driving, mutual recognition of driving disqualifications with the United Kingdom and a new optional 20 km\/h speed limit in built-up areas.  These new provisions will be commenced as soon as humanly possible.<br\/><br\/>I am extremely concerned over the statistics on intoxicated driving.  I am determined to tackle this area, and it is being tackled as a matter of urgency.  The RSA's research indicates alcohol was a contributory factor in 38% of collisions in the period 2008 to 2012.  These figures may be out of date but they are alarming and the most up to date available.  Anecdotal evidence is that alcohol is a contributory factor in an even higher proportion of fatal accidents.  <br\/><br\/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's recent drink driving campaign, which ran from 1 December to 8 January, resulted in 961 arrests for drink driving, a 35% increase on the same period last year.  Driving under the influence of alcohol therefore continues to be a major problem, and the highest risk group identified comprises young male drivers, as members will know.  Drivers under the age of 44 accounted for 70% of the intoxicated drivers in 2015, with 81% of all intoxicated drivers being male.  We have not solved that problem.  If anyone suggests we did so in earlier times or decades, it is a delusion.  More shockingly, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety data for 2015 indicate that 60% of those detected driving while intoxicated were over twice the legal alcohol limit.  Some 20% were three times over the legal limit, and 22% were four times over the legal limit.  While various hard-hitting measures, such as mandatory alcohol testing, the lowering of the drink driving limit and the introduction of tougher penalties, have had a profound effect on the vast majority of drivers, there are still, on average, 152 drivers arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence every week.  Clearly, this is simply not acceptable.  With that in mind, I am concerned that in certain cases where people have breached the alcohol limit while driving, the awarding of three penalty points sends out the message that it is not a serious offence.  I therefore intend to remove the current penalty and replace it with a disqualification period so all people who are found to be drink driving will receive an automatic disqualification from driving.  Amending the law to ensure all those detected engaging in such dangerous behaviour will receive a disqualification will help to send a message that driving under the influence is never acceptable.  This is an absolute.  <br\/><br\/>My Department has drafted the heads of a Bill to provide that all drivers who are caught drink driving will receive this mandatory disqualification from driving.  This has been circulated to Ministers for comment by 9 February, and I intend to bring it to the Cabinet on 14 February, next week.  I am determined that this Bill will be enacted as quickly as possible.  I propose to ask both Houses for their co-operation in this matter by not prosing amendments on this single issue and to this very focused Bill.  We want to get it through quickly because we believe it will actually save lives quickly.  One of the legitimate complaints made about road safety legislation is that it has been delayed by various measures that have delayed more immediate measures that are necessary.  While we will consider every proposal, we ask members to regard this important legislation as a matter of urgency and not to introduce any amendments that would take a long time to address and delay its passage.  <br\/><br\/>My officials working in the road safety area are also working on four other Bills this year.  This is somewhat unprecedented but entirely necessary.  The urgency with which we regard this problem is certainly indicated by the amount of legislation to tackle this problem.  <br\/><br\/>The road traffic (prompt decisions) Bill 2017 relates to the exchange of vehicle registration and driver data for the purpose of combating cross-Border crime and terrorism.  This Bill will provide the legal basis for one element of the requirements under the legislation, with the legal basis for the exchange of fingerprint and DNA data coming under the remit of my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  I intend to bring a memorandum to the Government in that regard as soon as possible.  <br\/><br\/>The Road Safety Authority (amendment) Bill 2017 will provide for other road safety matters, including the provision of a database of disqualified drivers, and strengthen the <i>vires <\/i>of the functions of the Road Safety Authority.  The preparation of this Bill is currently under way and I hope to bring the draft heads to the Government later this year.  <br\/><br\/>The road traffic (master licence record) Bill 2017 will provide the necessary <i>vires <\/i>for my Department's national vehicle driver file master licence record project.  The master licence record project will, for the first time, link vehicles to drivers and make this information available to other stakeholders, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which will be of considerable assistance in road safety enforcement.<br\/><br\/>Work will commence in the coming months on a road traffic (compulsory motor insurance) Bill to help clarify, simplify and improve existing motor insurance legislation, including an examination of the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland and its role regarding uninsured driving.  Possible amendments of legislation arising in the light of recent European Court of Justice decisions will also be included in that Bill.  <br\/><br\/>I am determined that in 2017 we will reverse the trend in road deaths we saw last year in co-operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  I am particularly encouraged by the recent assurances I have received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the T&aacute;naiste that there will be an increase of 10% in the traffic corps during the course of 2017, resulting in more check points and greater enforcement of traffic law, and that road safety enforcement is a priority in the 2017 Garda policing plan.  <br\/><br\/>If the message that one will be caught if one drives and drinks is not already loud and clear, we want it to out.  If one is caught, one will be disqualified.  Ireland is currently ranked fifth best for road safety across the European Union.  While I recognise that in light of the recent fatalities trends, maintaining that position will be very challenging, I believe that if we all refocus our efforts we can reverse the upward trend and save more lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017020800002#D00300","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":890,"content":"<p>The Fine Gael grouping has 15 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017020800002#E00200","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":891,"content":"<p>It is very disappointing to note the number of road fatalities is on the rise again and that alcohol continues to be a major factor in these deaths.

Everybody who is found over the limit will be disqualified.  People will not have to go to court if they decide not to but they will have to accept the disqualification.

The introduction of the 20 km\/h speed limit in housing estates has received a great deal of attention lately and is broadly welcome.

It is called Nr Rubber Products Limited and it is based in County Louth.  It uses 100% recycled Irish rubber to manufacture ramps.  These have been tested to the EU standard and are currently in use across Europe in countries such as Italy, Spain and Portugal.  This company is willing to supply its products for a pilot project in Louth to demonstrate the its suitability for Irish conditions.

I fully understand that there is a difference between rural and urban views sometimes, certainly in the interpretation of drinking and driving.  The whole culture is somewhat different.  I do not think that one can say there is any excuse for driving when over the limit, regardless of where one lives.  I know this is harder to take in some places than in others where there is a tradition which exists and where the pub is so important to people's social lives.  The Senator said that there are exceptional cases.  I do not believe that there are any exceptional cases.  I believe this is an absolute rule.  If one is over the limit in Dublin, then one is over the limit in rural areas as well, although I sympathise with the difficulties which some people will face in this situation.  They must accept that the dangers posed by people getting behind the wheel when over the limit are the same in one place as in another.  The dangers of fatalities are the same because the impairment to driving is the same.  I appeal to them in these situations to make the necessary arrangements to be able to have a good social life in the local pub but also to be able to get home safely.  I presume that would mean sharing cars with a companion who is not drinking.  They could hire a bus or perhaps the local publican could arrange for them to get lifts home.  Those arrangements will have to be made.  It may be inconvenient.  However, inconvenience is worth it in the interests of saving innocent lives.<\/p><p>It must be said absolutely firmly that there cannot be any exceptions because of where one lives.  While we understand, and I understand fully, the difficulties this may cause, it is about life and death.<\/p><p> The primary focus of the 2016 Bill we passed in December, which was signed on 27 December, concerned drug driving.  It is an initial step which includes various drugs, but particularly cocaine, cannabis and heroin.  It is very novel because, as with alcohol, it sets an absolute level beyond which, if one has the substance in one's blood, it automatically becomes an offence.  One does not have to prove anything else except that the motorist has a certain amount of a certain drug in his or her blood.  This is revolutionary.  The legislation will probably be commenced in the next three months.  The administration is now being organised to do that.  I hope to commence the legislation in the next three months when the Garda and the equipment are ready to do this.  I hope it will attack the problem of which the Senator speaks because the anecdotal evidence is that it is a big problem.  We reckon it is a big problem and we reckon it causes death, which is why we are acting on it.  This measure is not reflected in the latest figures because it has not been enacted or implemented yet, but I very much hope it will come to be reflected in the figures.  I presume the committee does not wish to go into the details of the Act now but I can give a fair summary of it if the committee wishes.  If the measures are effective when introduced, they will affect the figures.  It is quite tough legislation, and deliberately so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017020800002#F01900","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":912,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  I wish to concentrate on one aspect, namely, implementation and enforcement, to which he himself drew attention.  In recent weeks there have been some shocking figures to the effect that half of summonses for speeding are not being served.  I know this is a matter for the Garda, but 30,600 summonses have been struck out because they were not served.  I think the figure for Monaghan is 61% of summonses for speeding not being served, and the figure for Kerry is 59%.  I will not go through the statistics for any more counties.  Regarding the use of a mobile phone while driving, 71% of those convicted or caught are not prosecuted for some reason.  I remember in 2000, when penalty points were first introduced, that one could literally see the slowdown on the roads because everyone presumed they would get their penalty points.  However, this quickly dissipated, and when people read these figures, they will tell themselves that even if they are caught, they will get away with it anyway.  The fear is that these figures would send out that message.  Just as drink-driving has been attacked or dealt with, this needs to be dealt with as well.  Judges throwing out Go-Safe van summonses and so on has been a factor in this regard, and the matter has not been addressed.<\/p> <p>  What is the state of road deaths for January?

They are exactly the same as last year.  There is absolutely zero difference.  At least they are very close to last year's.  I monitor them daily.  As of today, they are exactly the same as last year's, which is not encouraging and not good.  However, none of the measures we have taken, as I said to Deputy Fitzpatrick, has been commenced yet, so they will not even start to have an effect for about six weeks, but what he said is important in this respect.  Enforcement is vitally important because it creates the right atmosphere in which people think they will be caught or, if they have already been caught, have to go to court.  I do not believe this atmosphere exists yet.  I think there is a feeling, especially among young males, that they will not be caught and that, even if they are caught, there is a good chance of getting off for various reasons.  The fact the Garda has increased its patrols by 10% - the figure may not be up to 10% yet as it is for the entire year, but the Garda is increasing its patrols - and the fact it did this at Christmas is very encouraging.  The figures for Garda activity that came in at Christmas were encouraging, but the figures for the results were quite staggeringly bad.  There was a 35% increase in people drink-driving in the six weeks surrounding Christmas, so we have a huge amount of work to do but we are tackling it.  The Senator is absolutely right that there is a problem with enforcement.  Some of this is simply due to the fact that people feel the measures will not be enforced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017020800002#G00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":914,"content":"<p>There seems to be an amazing discrepancy in the serving of the summonses.

Of the remaining 20%, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can only at best, for a number of reasons, including non-availability of up-to-date addresses and details in some cases, serve approximately 50% of summonses, so the Senator is absolutely right about that.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is examining ways to increase the rate of summonses served, including examining the possibility of serving them electronically.  The note points out that the rate of summonses served for more serious road offences is prioritised over minor offences.  The Senator has identified this, and it is absolutely true, but the Garda is on the job in this regard.  It is a significant number, but we are well aware of it.  Enforcement is to some extent a matter of perception, but not totally.  We are tackling this perception.

Every one of us here wants to see a reduction in the number of road deaths.  We need to see evidence-based policies.<\/p> <p>  I share the Minister's concern regarding drink-driving.  I do not drive after having any drink but I do feel there is a difference between someone who has a glass of wine with his or her meal and then drives a car and somebody who has a bottle of wine and then drives his or her car.  Regarding the 38% of people who lost their lives between 2008 and 2012 and were deemed to have drink in their systems, is that quantifiable in terms of the units of alcohol in their bodies?  Were these people who, as I said, had a glass of wine with their meals or were they people who were significantly over the legal limit and driving?  It is understandable if the Minister does not have that information to hand today, but we need to see it before he brings forward the legislation he proposes for later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017020800002#G00800","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":919,"content":"<p>The answer to the question is that I do not know.

The Deputy has sought a perfectly legitimate figure.  We know that where persons were arrested for drink driving as much as 60% of them were over twice the legal limit, 20% of them had over three times the legal limit and 22% of drivers were over four times the legal limit.  That is not the fatal accident figure.

Given that road deaths are increasing and we are not having the effect we would like to have, does the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport have to continually lobby the Minister for Justice and Equality for Garda resources?  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport said we have not yet got the 10% we were promised for this year.  The number was almost halved in the past five or six years.  The Minister is making a good effort to bring in new laws and penalties in the Road Traffic Bill but without enforcement they are nothing.

When the Minister said the figures from January to date are the same as last year, there is his answer.  There is nobody to enforce the laws.  I know it is not strictly his remit but are the Government and the Minister for Justice and Equality taking it seriously?  We may not have that 10% until December if we even have it.  <\/p> <p>  There might be a drink driving campaign at Christmas or Easter with all out media coverage focusing everybody's mind but the statistics show that in January it is as you were, back to normal.

I have the impression that the National Transport Authority, NTA, has no interest in bringing in the legislation about the rickshaws because it has had ample time to do that before now.

There is really serious crime going on in the inner city and in other areas where the Garda is also under-resourced.  There are other areas, such as combatting burglaries and patrols in my own constituency, where the Garda is critically under-resourced.  Whereas the T&aacute;naiste is certainly irritated, I am sure, by my constantly being at her about the traffic corps, she and her Department also have massive demands on those limited resources.  However, I will continue to push for not just the 10%, which I gather is 10% every year over the next three years, but for more than that.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Deputy not to misunderstand me.  This will go on.  I am determined to get these figures down.  I believe it is as important, if not the most important thing in my entire portfolio because it is a question of human life.  When we argue about other things, they are nothing like as simple as this one because of the human tragedy involved.  Therefore, we will absolutely strive and push for an acceleration in this.  We are only into February now and the numbers in the traffic corps are definitely going up.  The number of breathalysers is going up.  There was a Christmas campaign that had great intensity and a public relations value.  Though I am very cynical of public relations in terms of enforcement, it is very important because it creates that sort of an atmosphere.  I will not let up.  Deputy Munster can come back at me every time to ask me for figures.  If she wants something raised at that ministerial meeting on road safety, I am very happy to do so.  That will be with all of the people who are really making the decisions.  The issue of the 10% will be raised at every single meeting, as it was at the last one.  In fact, I welcomed it the last time in December.  We will certainly push for further measures and resources.  That is very important.  However, I ask the Deputy to remember the competing claims that the T&aacute;naiste has.  It can be seen from the crime figures elsewhere how difficult it is.<\/p> <p>  There is the issue of the unaccompanied learner drivers, on which the Deputy produced a measure in the D&aacute;il.  We accepted her amendment.  I would be massively disappointed if there was any long delay in that.  That provision has gone for legal advice and an interpretation but I see absolutely no reason why it should not be introduced shortly.  A large number of the proposed amendments have gone for legal opinion from the Attorney General, not to obstruct them, but in order that they are implemented properly and to make sure that they are robust and cannot be challenged.  Every single amendment, particularly in the road safety area where alcohol is involved, is challenged one way or another in the courts.  That one is now being considered by the Attorney General as well to make it as robust as possible.  The Department will engage and has been engaging with the Attorney General on that.  However, we are looking for early commencement.<\/p> <p>  I have spoken to Deputy Munster several times about the rickshaw legislation.  It has a problem with definitions.  It is redefining various vehicles to mean one thing in one Act and another thing in another.  We are trying to reconcile that.  There is an untoward delay in the regulating of rickshaws.  I will try to get this pushed along.  That particular measure is now difficult to commence.  I will read Deputy Munster the departmental note I have which explains what the situation is.  Is that all right?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017020800002#K00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":941,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017020800002#K00300","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":942,"content":"<p>During the course of its proceedings, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann voted to include an amendment proposed by Deputy Munster providing for the regulation of rickshaws.

I believe this is what I argued when we were going through with it.  I am not reluctant to put it through and I would be very happy to, but I think it may cause other difficulties.  It will be recalled that at the time the amendment was proposed, concern was raised about the amendment, given that it was not drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel or approved by the Office of the Attorney General for its legal robustness, as would normally be the case.

I listened to the Minister in a television interview after Christmas following an admittedly tragic period of a major number of road accidents and fatalities.  It is like what we had yesterday with regard to the hospitals.  Is this throwing good money after bad to fix a problem?  Is it a knee-jerk reaction to enforce a total ban on drink driving?  Is the Minister going down the right road?  It is ironic that he is also the Minister responsible for tourism.  One of the flagship advertisements abroad is about the hospitality that people get when they come to this country in local pubs and bars when they can meet the local people.  No one condones drinking and driving to the extent that has happened.  Of the increasing rate of accidents the Minister mentioned, I do not know what the drink levels in these people were.<\/p> <p>  Other issues should be looked at.  There is no mention in this of whether there is more money going to our roads.  There is no mention of the fact that in the last couple of years, there are more people driving on the roads as there are more people back at work, be it in the night time, the morning or whenever.  What is the Minister doing with regard to our road infrastructure?  It is coming under pressure.  I am concerned.  No one condones driving over the drink limit and never did.  The issue is whether we are taking another shot a rural Ireland.  Rural Ireland is coming under pressure.<\/p> <p>  It is a great document.

He will be aware that the amount of money we have been able to spend on our roads in recent times has been very limited.  We are awaiting the capital review.  It will be 2018 or 2019 when things really improve.  It is a constant struggle to keep the condition of our roads at a steady state.  I have asked my Department to identify specifically dangerous spots - there are some in the Deputy's area - where there have been a large number of fatalities so that we can regard them as priorities in the fight against road deaths.  The condition of our roads is otherwise an issue that we will address in the capital review.  The Deputy will be familiar with the trend there.  It will be accelerated in 2019 and 2020.  It is a difficult battle with the condition of our roads because of the lack of resources.  We do not have the money to do exactly what we want.  We are doing what we can with the resources available.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy said it was a kneejerk reaction.  Nobody can be forgiven for having a kneejerk reaction to tragedies on the road.  Of course there is a kneejerk reaction, but there is also a long-term reaction.  They are both fairly similar in the case of most people, which is that it is top of the list in terms of priorities when people get killed.<\/p> <p>  I do not accept - perhaps the Deputy was not saying this - that tourists should be exempt or that any special arrangements should be made for what tourists do on the roads.  Obviously, as Minister with responsibility for tourism, I am perfectly happy that the hospitality should be as generous as possible, but it should not in any way affect the rules of the road or the alcohol limits.  If I am misunderstanding the Deputy, I apologise.  This is not related to tourism, nor will it damage tourism in any way.  In response to any suggestion that there should be any different rules for tourist, no, we will not do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017020800002#L00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":950,"content":"<p>I am talking about the image being portrayed of the few locals in the pub and the people who come back from America.

There is absolutely no doubt about that.  They will get a fixed-charge notice.  They will still be detected in exactly the same way as we are.  They are subject to all that.  There is the application of penalty points.  I will tell the Deputy what my brief states on this because I specifically asked for this before coming here today.<\/p> <p>  Discussions began in 2012 between officials, North and South, regarding the possible establishment of mutual recognition of penalty points between the two jurisdictions.  There is no agreed international framework for such mutual recognition and no successful known precedent is in place elsewhere between two or more jurisdictions.  It is an extremely difficult project to deliver on, particularly because no precedent exists elsewhere that might assist.  This is to do with the penalty points harmonisation.<\/p> <p>  Since late 2013 the main identified obstacle, but not the only obstacle, to North-South mutual recognition of penalty points is service of summonses to an address outside the respective jurisdictions.  The serving of summonses and evidence of such service when the case arrives at a court hearing is central to the success of the project.  This is a difficulty as the Deputy can understand and I am sure he comes across it in his area close the Border.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have met representatives from the Office of the Attorney General on a number of occasions this year to discuss the difficulties encountered by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na concerning the serving of summonses on individuals residing in Northern Ireland over road-traffic offences which occurred in Ireland and regarding ensuring the attendance of defendants residing in Northern Ireland at court proceedings in Ireland.  This is work which is ongoing.  In other words they do not turn up, obviously, much of the time.  It will be necessary to successfully resolve the issues and challenges in this area before other legislative changes to enable mutual recognition of penalty points could be considered further. are not attending court.  It is an issue that is being addressed and we are conscious of it.  There is no precedent for being able to do it, but we are trying to tackle it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy put his finger on something.

When will they be filled?<\/p> <p>  I would appreciate if the Minister could come back to me with the details I have requested about the number of fatalities linked to alcohol in the system and the level of alcohol was in the system.  I accept that he cannot furnish that today.<\/p><p>My colleague, Senator O'Mahony, talked about summonses going out.  I think that when a fixed penalty notice is issued it should be done by registered post.  In that way there could be no ambiguity over whether it arrived.  When it is issued by registered post someone has to sign for it.  There is a traceability factor through the post office to ensure that someone has signed for it, so they cannot turn up to court and say: \"I didn't get it.  It was never delivered.\"  An Post has a 93% success rate in turning mail around, but post sometimes goes missing given the volumes involved.  However, registered post is one way of ensuring that people would receive their fixed penalty notices.<\/p><p> The publication of disqualified drivers is welcome.  I understand that the RSA requested it last year.  I submitted an amendment to the Road Traffic Bill which would have given effect to that, but it was not accepted.  I am glad that is coming down the track now.<\/p><p> Drink driving legislation comes under the Minister's aegis and something needs to be done to support public transport in rural Ireland.  I know that buses will not be going through every rural town or village at night time or at weekends, but we need to be innovative in how we approach this matter.  A person in receipt of social welfare might retain that payment if they provided a transport service for a certain number of nights during the week, if there was an incentive through the local enterprise office to help with public liability insurance.

I was involved in a push to save Garda stations - and I would have left garda&iacute; to do their own job - but rural stations closed.  Garda&iacute; know how to target the issues through criminal profiling which reduced crime.  Garda stations do not effectively stop crime, but it can be reduced through the way in which Garda resources are utilised.<\/p> <p>  I like to see Garda checkpoints.  When there was a threat to this State 25 years ago, I was delighted anytime that garda&iacute; operated checkpoints because it was effective law enforcement.  I am a little concerned, however, that we are increasing the traffic corps by 10% to stop people drink driving, when there should be a lot more undercover work and criminal profiling.  I am concerned that we are doing this just to look good.  We may be using modern technology for speeding, but is the Department aware of alternative technology?  We need to examine a system whereby if a person has taken two or three drinks they simply cannot drive their car as modern technology will detect the alcohol and shut down the engine.

I spent an awful lot of time last autumn trying to set up a scheme in my rural community, which is an isolated rural community in the Dingle Peninsula.  It was called the \"cars for bars\" scheme and had 20 volunteers, who I had lined up.  Everyone was willing to go Monday to Thursday when a hackney was difficult to get in the area.  They were on a roster in the local pubs and were available to pick people up, free of charge, and drop them home between the hours of 6 p.m. and midnight.  They were all insured drivers.  The impediment came at the very end when the insurance company said drivers were not covered if they were on a roster.  As the Minister's Department is liaising with insurance companies, will he try to circumvent that?  It is a road safety measure and an anti-rural isolation one.  It is shameful that it is the impediment to a very progressive policy in terms of road safety and addressing rural isolation.

It is a good opportunity for me to do so in the early part of the year following a disappointing year in 2016, given the significant increase in the number of people who lost their lives compared to the previous year.  As of today, 8 February, a total of 18 people have been killed on the roads in 16 fatal crashes, which is the same number as last year.  The fatalities consist of seven pedestrians, eight drivers and three passengers.  While we are still monitoring the data with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na it is too early to draw any conclusions.  In reviewing the figures for 2016, overall there were 188 deaths of which 74% were males.<\/p><p>Driver and passenger deaths made up 64% of those deaths and, in fact, they account for approximately 85% of the increase in 2016 compared to 2015.  It is very much a car occupancy increase.  While there was a marginal change upwards in vulnerable road users, the real area of concern is car occupants.  We have included a chart in our submission to show the breakdown compared to 2015 in the different categories of road users.  July has traditionally been a more dangerous month of the year not just in 2015 and 2016 but also in previous years.  It is attributable to a number of factors such as fine weather, people on holidays letting their guard down, tourist involvement and many more vulnerable road users using roads for pleasure and health purposes.  People are probably more relaxed and probably more alcohol is consumed during holiday periods as well, so people take chances.  Those are the areas of focus for 2017 with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as other factors such as the time of the day and the day of the week.  In 2016, the weekends - Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays - were the most dangerous period.  The majority of the crashes that occurred in 2016 were of a social nature.  Evening and afternoon on Sundays still remain a very high risk period for motorcyclists.  The period of 5 p.m. on Friday to 5 a.m. on Monday is a particularly dangerous time.  That reflects the relationship between alcohol and serious fatal crashes in this country.<\/p><p> Over half of the crashes resulting in death for vulnerable road users occurred during hours of visibility and daylight, but preliminary figures show that of the vulnerable road users, only two of the 35 pedestrians killed in 2016 were confirmed as wearing high visibility clothing.  That speaks for itself.  We heard previous speakers mention driving along roads where people are wearing dark clothing and cannot be seen.  The lack of high visibility clothing is very much a factor for vulnerable road users.  Dublin and Cork were the counties with the two highest figures, with 21 in each.  The difference was that Cork had more vehicle and car occupants whereas almost all of Dublin's figure were vulnerable road users.  Again, it is a location with much higher density of vulnerable road users.  Donegal, as we have learned, is still a county that has issues with road safety and dangerous driving behaviour.  It featured again in 2016.<\/p><p> A significant proportion of the fatalities occurred in rural areas, at more than 70% compared to urban areas, even though population densities are very different in this country.  The rural areas of Ireland are still suffering road deaths at a disproportional rate.  There has been a significant increase in the number of fatalities that have occurred in the 50 km\/h zones.  It is an increase of 15 deaths in 2016.  We often hear criticism of the Gatso or Go-Safe vans placed in these zones as being money earners, but they are placed there for a reason.  These are the vulnerable areas where the pedestrians are being killed.  Of the 16, almost half of all of the pedestrians were killed in those zones.<\/p><p> In terms of age profile, we see the younger age profile again, predominantly male, making up the deaths in 2016.  The second highest was in the over 66 age group.  These are more frail physically and if involved in a crash, even if it is a minor collision, it can have devastating consequences compared to those for somebody much younger and fitter.  This group features as one of the significant age groups in terms of deaths.<\/p><p> I will refer to our historical performance.  While 2016 was a very disappointing year, it is important to look back and not lose hope.  The 2013 to 2020 road safety strategy set a target to reduce deaths to 124 per annum, which is 25 deaths per 1 million.  We also have a target for reducing serious injuries to less than 330.  We are still aiming for those targets and the long-term trend overall shows that we are making progress.  Ten years ago, in 2007, there were 350 people killed on the roads.  While last year was not a good year, we are still making progress.  In 2006, 365 people were killed, which was one person a day.  In 2015, we had probably the lowest number of deaths on our roads.  We believe that when we can resource it and tackle the killer behaviours we will achieve the target by 2020.<\/p><p> There are factors that influenced the increase in 2016.  They are affecting much of Irish life and society.  One is the fact that the economy is recovering and, as a consequence, there are far more vehicles on the roads, more people at work and more younger people at work.  The latter still constitute the higher risk group.  More kilometres are being travelled as a result of accessibility to accommodation and employment.  People have to make a longer journey now.  The recession had an impact on resources and our ability to implement the full road safety strategy.  We heard from members today about issues with the road network, the continuation of new roads, the maintenance of existing roads, road improvements and re-engineering.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is probably one of the most important elements in the success of the strategy but it has been hit severely with the reduction of numbers in the traffic corps.  As with many public services, it suffered from a reduction in the number assigned to road safety duties.  It is now called the national roads policing division and the Garda is addressing that issue, but it has affected the number of deaths on our roads.  That pattern is common to many European countries.  The European Transport Safety Council, which represents the 28 EU countries involved in the road safety strategy, has acknowledged that it is happening in many jurisdictions.  With border security and other terrorism demands, resources are being spread very thinly and, unfortunately, road safety has been affected by that.<\/p><p> We can take heart from the recent campaign in December and early January.  The Gillian Treacy for Ciar&aacute;n road safety campaign in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority and in collaboration with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na saw a significant increase in the number of mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, checkpoints.  The message that Gillian Treacy and her family conveyed reached every home in Ireland and affected many people.  We believe that saved lives.  We have statistics to suggest that there was a significant reduction, compared to 2015, in the number of people killed on the roads during the six-week Christmas campaign.  There was a far more visible Garda presence and wall-to-wall coverage of the Gillian Treacy campaign.  We can take heart from the fact that when we have the resources and put them into effective campaigns it makes a difference and lives are saved.  There was a 27% decline in the number of deaths compared to 2014 and a 34% reduction compared to the safest year on record, which was 2015.  Everybody would acknowledge that the message got through to everyone in Ireland and people made better choices.  In addition, I do not doubt that many people who took chances were caught and will suffer the consequences in the near future from engaging in killer behaviour such as drink driving and drug driving.<\/p><p> In terms of Ireland's performance in an EU context, we are punching above our weight.<\/p><p>We are fifth in the performance table.  Ireland is recognised as a country that has made significant progress in improving safety on the roads over the past ten years.  We have a very robust road safety strategy.  It is respected, replicated and copied in many other jurisdictions.  The recent mid-term review, which was finalised in November, looked at the areas we need to prioritise if we are to bring the trend back in line with where we want to be.  A number of other countries have seen a slight improvement.  These are early days - we are only in February - but we are getting feedback from many countries, especially in the top tier of the performance table, that are also seeing increases.  Sweden, which has traditionally been at the top of the European table for road safety and road safety improvements, has seen an increase.  We are watching and looking to see what is happening elsewhere.<\/p><p> The economic analysis conducted by the Road Safety Authority has revealed parallels with other improved economic climates.  As unemployment levels go down, there are increased numbers of people on our roads.  Economic downturns are traditionally associated with reductions in traffic volumes and disproportionate reductions among high-risk groups.  Many young people have emigrated to other countries.  We hear about those people being involved in road crashes in other jurisdictions, which shows that this problem can travel.  It is in the nature of young male individuals in all jurisdictions that they are more prone to taking risks.  A downturn in the economy also sees a reduction in disposable income.  When young people are less likely to have their own cars to drive at the weekend, they might borrow cars from their parents or other people and it is likely that they will be more careful with those vehicles.  When the economy picks up, many new vehicles come on the roads and used vehicles come in from the UK at a very attractive price.  This makes driving much more accessible to young people.<\/p><p> We saw in 2013 and 2014 that the same factors were involved in serious and fatal crashes, with alcohol playing a significant part.  Alcohol was a factor in 38% of fatal crashes between 2008 and 2012.  That broke down into 29% drivers and 9% pedestrians.  We have an issue in this country with alcohol and pedestrians.  Speed is also a prevailing issue.  There is a combination of factors in many instances.  When alcohol is on the scene, speeding and risk-taking behaviour is more likely to be a factor and seat belt use is less likely.  Unfortunately, the whole issue with alcohol almost predetermines other outcomes as well.  When a person who has been drinking gets into a car, he or she is more likely to forget to put on a seat belt, to speed and to lose all consciousness of the risks he or she is taking.  People in such circumstances seem to think they are invulnerable.  It is important to note that people who engage in one element of bad or risky behaviour generally have other elements of bad behaviour as well.  Almost a third of those who drive after consuming alcohol have no insurance.  Approximately 15% of drink-drivers are on learner driver permits, which indicates that this is a higher risk group.  Some 7% are disqualified at the time when they are caught drinking and driving.  This is one of the reasons we are pursuing the publication of the names of disqualified drivers.  We feel the deterrent that is present at the moment is insufficient in addressing this issue.  We have also seen from the statistics that disqualified drivers are involved in a completely disproportionate number of serious and fatal crashes.<\/p><p> Research we have carried out in conjunction with the Health Research Board points to other key contributors, such as driver actions like the non-wearing of seat belts and vehicle defects.  All of our interventions are based on empirical evidence from our research and the investigation files we receive from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is clear that we need to do something that will make a difference.  There is no point in spending money on the wrong areas of road safety.  As a result of our research, and having worked very closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we have committed in 2017 to highlighting the role alcohol consumption by drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and tractor drivers continues to play in serious and fatal crashes.  Some Deputies have mentioned tractor drivers.  Our research shows that 25% of such drivers who are involved in crashes have consumed alcohol.<\/p><p> We intend to work with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to make progress with our proposal to organise a rehabilitation programme as a means of raising driver awareness.  This will involve requiring first-time offenders, including drink-drivers, to do a course.  We will promote the wearing of high-visibility gear.  We need to do more with the public, the vintners' associations and the pubs to try to spread the message that one can get high-visibility gear from the Road Safety Authority at any point.  We want to promote that as much as possible.  We will continue to work with cyclists and drivers on cyclist safety.  It is a shared environment.  We want to promote safe behaviour by younger and older drivers.  We want to reinforce the message about the importance of seat belts as lifesavers.  We want to try to eliminate the issue of people driving while disqualified, primarily by transmitting the message that one should not engage in behaviour like drink-driving or dangerous driving in the first place.  The primary objective of the proposed Bill is to warn people that they will end up on a public database if they engage in such behaviour.  The secondary objective is to ensure people will be aware that their employers, their communities and their families will know that they have chosen to engage in this behaviour and, as a result, they will experience peer pressure and community pressure when they are not allowed into their cars until they have served the duration of the disqualification.  We will also be working with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to promote the further roll-out of 30 km\/h zones.<\/p><p> We took emergency measures in late 2016 as a result of the level of alcohol involved in crashes.  There has been a change in this regard.  Some young people who are new to driving are not aware of the message that has gone out for many years about the anti-social and negative connotations of drink-driving.  We have to go back to basics here, starting at the theory test.  We have introduced a new module of questions for theory test candidates.  We have just awarded the contract for the theory test to a new supplier.  There will be a full revision of all the questions in the theory test as part of that process.  The questions about alcohol will be more robust and will relate to matters such as the consequences of engaging in drink-driving, including its impact on future employability.  I have mentioned the publication of the names of disqualified drivers.  We are working on the privacy impact assessment at the moment.  We will be bringing out a code of conduct.  We have prepared draft heads of a Bill.  All of those matters will dovetail.  We hope to have this in the pipeline in the first half of the year.  We are working with and taking guidance from the Data Protection Commissioner on how to observe all the protocols around personal data to ensure what we do is appropriate, saves lives and benefits society.<\/p><p> In conjunction with the Garda national roads policing bureau, we will engage in a series of education and awareness activities this year to finalise the joint education and enforcement plan for 2017.  Members of our research and media team are at the Garda College in Templemore today to make presentations and provide research on road safety data.  That is something we will be doing throughout 2017.  Personnel from supervisory and management levels of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be briefed on these issues at today's meeting in Templemore.  We think there is a role for the Road Safety Authority in giving the whole Garda corps the same research information and updates on legislation as we give the public.  That is very much welcomed by the Garda Commissioner and the assistant commissioner for roads policing.<\/p><p> We have agreed that the focus this year will be on the main killer behaviours, including alcohol-impaired driving, speeding, failing to wear seat belts and using mobile phones.  We will support this by rolling out a number of campaigns that we started in 2016 on foot of the pre-crash reports.  This will support the actual activity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There will be targeted enforcement and messaging.  We will support the introduction of chemical roadside testing, also provided for in a Bill that was signed into law in December 2016.<\/p><p>We will liaise with the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, on that.  We will also raise awareness of the danger of the misuse of seat belts through an online campaign.  That will be very much targeted at young women as well as young men because there is a prevalence among young people of wearing their seat belts under their arms or across their laps, which can have devastating consequences in terms of injuries.  We will also address the findings we have pulled from the report on motorcyclists, which have found that speed and alcohol played a very significant part in those deaths.  <\/p><p> Yesterday we commenced a new campaign with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health and Safety Authority that is targeting employers.  If a person drives for one's work, be it on a professional basis or if one drives a company car, a truck or bus, that person is 40% more likely to be involved in a serious crash than a motorist who does not.  There is a need for employers to get involved and to take responsibility to ensure that they have proper measures in place, that their employees take proper rests, that they are properly inducted into whatever vehicle they drive and that they are very responsible in terms of the number of hours they drive and how they use the vehicle.<\/p><p> The Chairman referred to the introduction of a potential app.  We are working with Toyota Ireland to roll out an app that will promote safer driving.  It would be completely autonomous for all vehicles.  It would not be specific to a Toyota vehicle and could operate in all vehicles.  There would be benefit in that.  Such an app was very successfully implemented in Japan.  It would be an awards-based scheme for people who would download it and operate on a safe driving profile.  That would help improve behaviour.<\/p><p> We have a number of key dates in 2017, including a number of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na \"Slow Down Days\", the UN global road safety week and the European Traffic Police Network, TISPOL ,and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na \"European Day Without A Road Death\".  We will also host two major conferences, the focus of one will be on alcohol and road safety and the second one will deal with the 30 km\/h zones.  If we see a need for a specific theme to be addressed as the year progresses, we will address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017020800002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moyagh Murdock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486544400,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Murdock for her comprehensive opening statement.

In case anyone thinks I am blaming garda&iacute;, who will presumably be in with us on this, that is not the case.  Is there something in our legislation that makes it difficult?  The figures are phenomenal.  In 71% of cases where people are caught using mobile phones, there is no conviction whether as a result of the failure to deliver summonses or because people claim they did not get them.  Would a legislative change help?  In relation to speeding, Deputy Fitzpatrick said there was a perception among Northern Ireland drivers that they would get away with it down here.  The message these figures send out is that even if one is caught with a mobile phone or speeding, one might not end up being fined or having penalty points.  It is also the case in relation to the GoSafe vans that certain judges have thrown out multiple cases.  Is there a need for new legislation to get rid of that for once and for all?  It would be a major plus if that happened.  If people think they will be caught or not caught, they will act accordingly.  Road signs with a picture of a speed camera on them should also include the speed limit at that point.  Often times one wonders when one sees it if it is 80 km\/h, 100 km\/h or 120 km\/h.

If they are appearing in court to tell the judge that they never got the ticket, it means they got something.  Now, they will have a third payment option of settling the penalty notice up to seven days before the court appearance.  That will address a significant number of issues and improve efficiencies through the court.  The new MLR project to link the master licence file with the vehicle will create a much better hit rate in terms of linking who was driving the vehicle with the person who says he or she got the ticket but that \"It wasn't me, your Honour\".

While last year was not the most successful year in the area of road safety, the trajectory over many years has been downward, which is very welcome.  As I have to leave the meeting shortly, I ask the witnesses to respond first to my questions to allow me to leave.<\/p><p> I raised with the Minister the composition of the board of the Road Safety Authority on which there are a number of vacancies.  He conceded that at least two vacancies should be filled, one to provide accountancy expertise and a second to provide advocacy expertise.  The Irish Road Victims Association, which has done great advocacy work on road safety, is one possibility.  Would the filling of these vacancies be sufficient to ensure the board is able to do its work to its full potential?  Are any of the vacancies impeding its work?<\/p><p> Ms Murdock alluded to pedestrians and cyclists.  I raised the issue of pedestrians with the Minister because seven or 40% of the 16 deaths on the roads so far this year have been pedestrians.  This is a very high figure.  While advocacy is fine, rules and regulations are required to ensure people take necessary precautions.  Anyone who walks along a roadside at night wearing dark clothing is behaving just as dangerously as someone who chooses not to wear a seat belt or to break another rule of the road.  What should be done in this area?  Should legislation be introduced to make high visibility clothing mandatory?  Should mandatory distances be introduced for different speed zones in respect of drivers overtaking cyclists?<\/p><p> The Road Safety Authority is responsible for the inspection of commercial vehicles.  I understand it has introduced a new system using red, amber and green coding.  Under this new system, RSA inspectors will be alerted to persons with poor road traffic records by a code red and they will then carry out on-the-spot checks.  Code amber is obviously not as bad as red and code green will appear where the driver has a good record.  I am informed that the RSA does not publicise the criteria by which the different codes are applied.  While someone in code green will be fine as he or she does not need to make improvements, someone with an amber code will find it difficult to find out which changes are needed to change his or her code to green.  I ask Ms Murdock to elaborate on this system.<\/p><p> The Chairman and Minister discussed the issue of a driver app in the previous session and Ms Murdock also referred to the issue.  I am aware that the RSA is working with Toyota on this issue, albeit not exclusively for Toyota vehicles.  Many other businesses have developed apps and they are willing to work with the Road Safety Authority on a pilot basis to identify how their apps could be of assistance.  An app would be beneficial from the point of view of tracking driver patterns and enabling this information to be collated for future policy formation.  People with a good track record would then be offered support, perhaps through reduced insurance premiums.  How far advanced is the RSA in terms of piloting such an app?  Is it ready to go out to tender or seek expressions of interest and tangible proposals from various parties?  How long will it take to reach this point?<\/p><p> On drink driving, I asked the Minister how often alcohol was found in the system of those killed in road traffic accidents.   As the RSA collates this information, it is probably more appropriate to put the question to it.  Can we quantify the level of alcohol involved?  As I stated, there is a significant difference between someone having a glass of wine with dinner at 7 p.m. and driving to pay someone a visit at 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. and someone who drinks a bottle of wine before driving.  Does the RSA have data showing how often alcohol has been determined to be the cause in fatal road traffic accidents?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017020800002#V01300","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486544400,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>I will start with the Deputy's question on the Road Safety Authority board.

That particular campaign was very effective, but the figures for this year, January to now, are exactly the same as last year.

New legislation, hopefully, is coming through about unaccompanied drivers.  In Dublin, there is an 18-month waiting list for driving tests because of the lack of test centres.  In the context of Drogheda, there is only one test centre in County Louth.  The system is all the time on the back foot.  If a person is waiting 12 to 18 months for their driving test the temptation is there to drive unaccompanied.  We need to have all our ducks in a row.

We are undertaking a value for money review at the moment.  A full review of the driving test system and the service provided by the RSA was previously carried out, as I understand it, in 2012.  That review found that it was a value for money service.  However, a commitment was made at that time to carry out a further review in a number of years.  The review was due to be done again in 2016 and it is being completed as we speak.  The review was not done with a view to outsourcing anything.  We have approximately 110 driving testers in-house, carrying out approximately 1,800 driving tests per annum.  The number of tests that they have delivered increased by two per week following the Haddington Road agreement.  We are providing a very efficient service.  We were subject to the recruitment embargo, like every other public service in recent years and that resulted in a diminishing number of driving testers being available.  We have just recruited and fully trained up an additional ten driving testers.  We got sanction for a further seven driving testers and they are undergoing training, which takes approximately ten weeks.  We hope to have them in place in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  The majority of test centres are still delivering a test waiting time of between ten and 13 weeks.  In some of the smaller centres the waiting time has extended out to 15 to 17 weeks but it is nowhere near 18 months.  Some of the smaller centres might have reached an 18 week waiting time but we are confident that with the additional testers that have been recruited and with the provision of additional overtime at weekends over the past few months, we will address that problem.  Anybody who needs a driving test quickly can be accommodated on a short-term waiting list.  Unfortunately, quite a significant number of people cancel their tests.  Approximately 17% of people who book tests do not show up, which means that we have the capacity to take people in at short notice if they are available.  While some of the centres have increased waiting times, we fully anticipate bringing them back into line now that we have been given sanction to recruit additional testers.  <\/p> <p>  We fully appreciate that it is very important that young people reach the basic standard of driving competency.  It is not a matter of fast-tracking them through the system.  They need to do the six-month period of mandatory driving, plus the 12 essential driving lessons.  Then they are ready to go for their test.  Some people need longer than that and some of those waiting times are as a result of people choosing to wait longer.

I have received texts from people who have been watching today's proceedings asking if the witnesses know that bad roads cause accidents.  Ms Murdock's document makes reference to speeds signs and control.  Would she acknowledge that our road infrastructure is well behind that of other countries?  While there was an increase in fatalities last year, there was also a substantial increase in the number of vehicles on the road.  There are more vehicles on the road now and there is far more congestion.  I see that when I am travelling up and down to Dublin.  Every week when I am travelling home the N8 is blocked up because of crashes at the Naas interchange due to excessive traffic volumes.
