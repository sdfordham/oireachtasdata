First, all Members share a determination to ensure that as many of these unoccupied units as possible will become occupied and will become homes for people.

It is a question of trying to provide for the existing need in as effective a way as possible.  While I am unsure whether the Deputy actually asked the question, I will provide him with the figure.  The cost of leasing is approximately \u20ac7,400 per annum whereas were one to attempt to build houses, one would get an awful lot of leasing units for the cost of building a single house.  Moreover, the Government must make do and, given the times, must try to house as many people as possible by whatever method it can use.  The leasing arrangement provides housing for people.  I admit all Members would probably prefer to be able to build more houses but we cannot because we do not have the money.  In addition, only 80% of the market rent is paid under the leasing agreements.  Consequently, the entity which owns the house, be it NAMA, a receiver, a property developer or whoever, does not get the full market rent.  There is a possibility of purchase although that varies depending on the different units.  It is a complex issue but the Government is trying, in so far as possible, to get as many such units as possible for social housing to provide homes for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400005#C01300","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1354630800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Everything, including bank debts, can become complex when we try to do something but we must try to make this simple.

We will get no money from the builders, the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and so on.  Insurance companies should have dealt with many of these cases.  If we pursue people, we will need to go to the ends of the earth.

Had the Minister not thought of them when he cut the funding?  Did he not think about people telephoning radio stations this morning to report that no salt gritting had been applied to many roads throughout the country?  They were not taken into consideration when the Minister made the decision to cut local authority funding in the manner in which he did.  In my local authority, for example, this year more than \u20ac500,000 has been taken from a budget that it had agreed in good faith this time last year.

In a number of instances responsible builders are directly undertaking remediation works.  Remediation work is also being undertaken under structural defects insurance and other types of insurance and as a result of arbitration and mediation processes.  Similarly, where pyrite has been identified in social housing schemes, the relevant housing authorities are pursuing a range of actions to have the necessary repairs carried out by the contractors in accordance with the terms of their contracts.

It is deeply traumatising, months after the report was published, that uncertainty continues as to what we propose to do with regard to the establishment of the resolution board and standardised testing.  This is very important to residents not only in my constituency, but in the Minister of State's and right across Leinster.  I am deeply concerned that, a number of months after the pyrite panel's findings were published, we are still uncertain as to who has not engaged with the Minister or with the panel with a view to finding resolutions to the issue.  <\/p><p>  We now learn that an amber category has been created.  Residents in this category, many of whom live not far from myself, are aware of structural movement in their properties that does not conform with drying out or settlement but have not had their properties tested and do not have the means to have them tested.  They are probably affected by the issue but because they are in the amber category, their homes will probably not be checked for pyrite.  That is unacceptable.  I agree that it is entirely the responsibility of the construction companies to ensure that the properties are up to standard.  Given that the report is on the public record, however, the State should cajole those individuals into providing the testing that so many residents are seeking.  The standardisation of testing is also important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400012#K00100","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speech","time":1354633500,"counter":120,"content":"<p>A key factor is that only five of the 1,200 quarries in the country have been identified as being involved in pyrite.  I am not making little of the problem when I say that a total of five quarries are involved.  The known spread of pyrite is around Fingal, counties Dublin and Kildare and parts of Meath and Offaly.  It is a serious problem for anyone who has it.  There can be pyrite heave when the building has actually moved.  We saw in the report the appalling vista people face when their walls move out of place and doors cannot open.  This is very significant and is adversely affecting thousands of people.<\/p><p>  I accept what Deputy Farrell is saying about the amber category.  There are estates where pyrite is definitely present and where there is absolute evidence of pyrite heave or movement.  That does not mean every house in the estate has a pyrite problem.  Pyrite reacts with water at a certain temperature to form gypsum and increases to twice its size.  In such an estate, because the mix in the floors came from different locations, some houses may not be affected.  Such houses are in the amber category.  Every house where it is believed pyrite is present is watched.  If there is actual movement in a house, it will definitely be dealt with.  If there is not actual movement, the house will definitely be observed and watched.  In Ireland, this observation can take between one and nine years.  In Canada, for geographic and climate reasons, I understand it can take up to 20 years for something to happen.<\/p><p>  It is fundamental to the Government and to the Minister that the issue is being dealt with.

Wide-ranging schemes of demolition and rebuilding, public realm upgrades including addressing areas of anti-social behaviour, and significant investment in social regeneration activities are all proposed.

I will not take the Taoiseach through all the issues but there is a particular annoyance about Government leaks that there will be more cuts to child benefit, on top of last year's cuts and on top of cuts introduced by Fianna F\u00e1il in its time in office.

Deputy Boyd Barrett will appreciate the Greek Government now has a target of reaching a debt-to-GDP ratio of 124% by 2024, whereas the Irish Government expects to exit its programme in 2013, to retrieve its economic independence and to be able to grow the economy.

This is the reason the Government, in the circumstances it faces, will do its best to ensure that the budget is as fair and as equitable as possible.  Not everything can be done tomorrow and it is a case of putting this budget clearly on a platform of progress for the entire country and the economy in order that investment and jobs can be created.

The visit was part of the Government's ongoing efforts to drive economic recovery and employment by delivering the message to international business people and investors, and to the diaspora, that Ireland is open for business.  This was my first visit to Philadelphia as Taoiseach and I was delighted to meet Mr. Tom Corbett, Governor of Pennsylvania, on Friday morning.  We noted the special relationship that Ireland enjoys with the state of Pennsylvania by virtue of the presence there of so many people of Irish heritage.  We noted in particular the significant contribution of successive generations of Irish people to the building of Philadelphia.  I briefed the governor on Ireland's progress towards economic recovery and on our current bilateral business relations with the United States.<\/p><p>  I met some of the leading supporters of the American Ireland Funds in Philadelphia.  I recognised the contribution made by the Ireland Funds to worthy causes in Ireland as well as to supporting links between Ireland and the US.  I addressed the Brehon Law Society symposium on Doing Business in the US and Ireland, attended by over 200 experts and business people.  In my address I spelt out how Ireland has become more competitive and represents an excellent investment opportunity for US companies.  Later that morning I performed the official opening of the Philadelphia office of Zenith technologies, which is an excellent example of a high-tech Irish indigenous company which is making significant headway in the US market.  I am convinced that it is ambitious exporting Irish companies such as Zenith that will drive Ireland's economic recovery.  While in Philadelphia I also met briefly representatives of the Irish American Business Network and a number of Irish community groups.<\/p><p>  Later I travelled to Cleveland for a series of further engagements, including an address at the City Club of Cleveland, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year.  In this address I again outlined the positive measures being taken by the Irish Government to stabilise our finances and to return our economy to competitiveness and growth, while highlighting the attractions of Ireland as a location for business and investment.  I emphasised the importance of transatlantic trade and investment links between the United States of America and the European Union.  These links are vital to both the European and American economies, especially given the crucial importance to both of us of growth and recovery.  I said that I strongly believed that concluding a comprehensive trade agreement between the United States and the European Union would take this relationship to a new level and I will be aiming to make as much progress towards this goal as possible when Ireland assumes the Presidency of the European Union in January 2013.<\/p><p>  While in Cleveland I participated in a number of other business events to support Irish companies expanding into the US, as well as to promote Ireland as a location for inward investment.  Some of these Irish companies are doing business with the prestigious Cleveland Clinic in the health care and technology sectors.  I was greatly impressed by the first class facilities which I saw at the clinic, where I also met with senior clinical and research teams who outlined the practices and research being undertaken there.  While I was in Cleveland, I was delighted to officially announce the new strategic partnership between the Enterprise Ireland supported company i360 Medical and the Cleveland Clinic, including an investment from the Cleveland Clinic in the company.<\/p><p>  On Saturday morning, I met the Mayor of Cleveland, Mr. Frank G. Jackson, at the City Hall.  Following our meeting we both attended a public event at the Irish Garden, which is part of the Cleveland Cultural Gardens.  The gardens represent the contribution that immigrants have made to the heritage of the US over the centuries.  Mayor Jackson and I both addressed representatives of the Irish American community at this landmark Irish site.  I also met members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, where we discussed immigration issues and the prospects of an Irish E3 visa being agreed.  I was delighted on Saturday evening to have an opportunity to attend and address the eighth annual charity ball hosted by the Mayo Society of Greater Cleveland and to honour the bonds that connect Cleveland and County Mayo.  I returned home later that night.<\/p><p>  While in the US I also used my various speaking opportunities to promote The Gathering 2013 throughout the region and was very encouraged by the reaction we are getting to this important initiative, which will be held during the course of 2013.  I am delighted that British Prime Minister Cameron has confirmed that next year's G8 summit will be held in Lough Erne, County Fermanagh, as this will no doubt give a great boost to the region.  Although it is too early to speculate on an invitation being extended to American President Obama to make a state visit to Ireland around that time, when I recently spoke to the president on the telephone to congratulate him on his re-election, I mentioned my firm hope that he would be in a position to visit Ireland again following his very successful visit last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400020#S02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1354637400,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I take it that as Ireland will hold the EU Presidency, the Taoiseach will be invited to participate in the G8 summit.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that?  Prime Minister Cameron's decision on the location of the summit is important and I welcome it.<\/p><p>  The positive relations between the US and Ireland are beneficial in an ongoing sense, taking in social culture and economic life in both nations.  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach made the visit and established contacts as outlined in his reply.  Such engagement is extremely important but it is also vital that we use such contacts and visits to push for strategically important matters for this country.<\/p><p>  As we can see from the debates leading into the American presidential election, corporation tax loomed large in rhetoric and articulation of policy by President Obama and his team.  Has the Government put in place any new initiatives to withstand the pressure that will arise with regard to corporation tax on the American side, particularly repatriation of profits, disincentivising the establishment of companies overseas and so forth?<\/p><p>This occurred during the previous presidential election when the Government of the time put key IDA personnel in our embassy in Washington to lobby effectively on Capitol Hill and among political contacts in the United States on the issue of corporation tax, which is extremely important to our capacity to attract inward investment.<\/p><p> On immigration, the Taoiseach met representatives of the Ancient Order of Hibernians.  When I was Minister for Foreign Affairs my Department launched the E3 visa initiative which, owing to political difficulties on Capitol Hill, moved away from a blanket demand for the immigration issue to be resolved.  An E3 visa programme would enable us to create a legal framework to prevent illegal inward migration into the United States.  From the contacts he made during his visit to the United States, will the Taoiseach indicate the position in respect of advancing the E3 visa and assisting those who are illegal in the United States?<\/p><p> I am pleased the Taoiseach met representatives of Zenith Technologies.  Having met representatives of the company many years ago, I am pleased to note it continues to make good progress in the United States.   Zenith Technologies illustrates the importance of small and medium sized Irish enterprises which can develop products and services that are needed worldwide and provide solutions to worldwide challenges. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400020#S02900","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354638000,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I know Deputy Martin is familiar with Zenith Technologies.  It is doing a wonderful job and is an example of a company that is growing in importance.  As a consequence, it is able to expand its business and employ more staff.<\/p><p>  Prime Minister Cameron indicated to me a number of months ago that it was his intention to hold the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.  He also stated he would extend to me an invitation to me, as Taoiseach, to attend.  If and when his invitation arrives, I will be very happy to accept it.<\/p><p>  I raised the issue of corporate tax with the American companies I met, pointing out that the issue is our business and that a number of other countries in Europe now have corporate tax rates below 20%.  While some corporate tax regimes are more complex than others, Ireland's rate has been very straightforward, simple and transparent for many years.  It is 12.5% and the effective rate is 11.9%.  I raised this matter with all American businesses with which I had contact in terms of their requirement for clarity and a horizon against which they can plan.  As we have pointed out at European level, there will not be any change in Ireland's corporate tax rate and we do not have any intention of moving away from it. <\/p><p>  I noted the comments made by President Obama following the first meeting of the new US Cabinet.  The Administration's focus is clearly on the so-called fiscal cliff, on which the Republican Party, or GOP, presented its options yesterday.  I mentioned the difficulties and challenges President Obama faces when I called him on the telephone.  The US Government is clearly anxious to have this matter resolved before the end of the year.  I hope it achieves this objective which is in everybody's interest.<\/p><p>  I did not have an opportunity to discuss immigration policy with the President, although I discussed it with the Irish ambassador who accompanied me in Philadelphia and Cleveland.  It is important to allow the new Administration to settle in, as it were.  Various members of the Senate and Congress have commented on this issue and the President also spoke about wishing to have a resolution to the immigration problem.  I am aware that Deputy Martin and other Members have been involved in this issue and would like a resolution to be found.  Once the President has been inaugurated again and his Administration established, this issue will be followed through as a priority.  I hope in the case of undocumented Irish emigrants residing in the United States and Irish people who wish to emigrate to the United States that we will be able to follow through on a path that will bring about clarity and provide an opportunity to have their status legalised and be documented.  This will be a major issue for the Government.  It is clear from comments made by the United States Administration that it will focus on this matter.  However, its priority at present is to deal with the so-called fiscal cliff.  The Government will take up this issue in the new year, including in its capacity as the chair of meetings during the Presidency of the European Union. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400021#T00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1354638000,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the interest the Taoiseach has taken in Irish-America and note the good work done during his recent visit to the United States.  I visited the east coast of the United States and Canada last month on the back of super-storm Sandy.  The Taoiseach will be aware of the devastation the storm wreaked, including in traditional Irish communities.  Hundreds of homes were destroyed on Breezy Point and Staten Island.  The House should extend condolences to Damien Moore from Portnoo in County Donegal and his wife, Glenda, whose two sons, Connor and Brendan, were swept from their mother's arms and drowned.  Have our consular services been engaged in providing assistance to any Irish passport holders caught up in the storm?<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach's visit to the United States is proof that Irish-America has a major contribution to make to recovery here, although this should not be reduced to a financial role alone.  Successive Governments have ignored the plight of the undocumented Irish in the United States and Australia.  It is disappointing, therefore, that the Taoiseach did not discuss the issue with the Administration.  While it may not have been opportune to do so in the thrust of an election, the Government should raise the issue on a consistent basis. <\/p><p>  With The Gathering imminent, when will the Government fulfil its promise in the programme for Government to enact legislation to allow for the publication of the 1926 census?  This information would be a valuable resource for those who seek to explore their Irish heritage.  <\/p><p>  I read Prime Minister Cameron's remarks on the forthcoming G8 summit in which he outlined three main themes for the meeting, namely, the fight against protectionism in global trade, action against tax avoidance and promoting greater transparency and openness.  While these are commendable objectives, the Prime Minister misses the point.  The G8 must address the economic crisis facing the world, in particular the poor of the developing world.  I ask the Taoiseach to raise the grave situation in the Middle East and the failure thus far of the international community to intervene in the conflict there.  In this regard, I commend the Government's decision to vote in support of the Palestinians at the United Nations General Assembly last week.  Surely it would be opportune to raise this matter when world leaders come to Ireland where we have a successful peace process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400021#T00300","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1354638000,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Adams for his comments.  The US Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, is due to attend an OSCE conference in Dublin this week, which will bring to Ireland the largest number of foreign ministers ever to visit the country.  High Representative, Baroness Catherine Ashton, will attend on behalf of the European Union.  The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, will also attend, as will the British Foreign Secretary, William Hague.  I expect to have a short meeting with Secretary of State Clinton at which I will raise the immigration issue, as I have already indicated.<\/p><p>  Publication of the 1926 census is a matter of cost and the 100 year rule.  I would like it to be published as it is of great interest to millions of people the world over.  However, there is a hefty cost attached to doing so and consideration must be given to the rule precluding publication for 100 years.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, is dealing with the issue.<\/p><p>I spoke to President Obama and sympathised with him in the same way as Deputy Adams has about people from Ireland and other countries who lost their lives.  I made the point to him that Breezy Point, Staten Island and New Jersey have significant Irish communities.  I said to the President that we had significant numbers of very skilled people here in the country, many of whom were unemployed following the collapse of the construction sector.  Be it small numbers of Army personnel dealing with logistics or people who are skilled at driving machinery, demolition experts, roofers or whatever, I said to him that perhaps we should look at the question of what kind of assistance Ireland could give in that context.  The President was, I think, very taken with the suggestion.  What we agreed was that both the ambassador in Washington, Ambassador Collins, and his counterpart in the Administration would look at how best Ireland might actually be able to contribute in that fashion to restoring and rebuilding the areas that were devastated by Hurricane Sandy.<\/p><p> I have seen some of the documentaries.  Significant areas are entirely Irish, or are certainly Irish connected.  In that sense when one looks at a home that was completely flattened as if the place had been by a series of bombs, clearly people are very upset and want to get back to being able to live their lives where they have been for so many years.  That issue is being followed through on behalf of this country by our ambassador with the US Administration and we will be happy to assist Deputy Adams in any way that we can in that regard.  I think that, with the numbers of skilled people that we have here, we could make a significant contribution.<\/p><p> To be honest with Deputy Adams, the reason that I did not have an opportunity to discuss with the Administration the question of the E-3 visas and immigration was that I left here on Thursday night to fly out, was busy all of the following day and came back on Saturday night after the last function.  I got here on Sunday morning.  On this occasion, there just was not the time to fit it in.  Next time, hopefully, and with a new Administration in office in the US, we will be able to devote more time and follow through on the new connections that need to be made very diligently.<\/p><p> I might point out that, from Deputy Adams's party, Deputy Martin's party, our own, the Labour Party and everybody else's party, there have been delegations to Washington over the last 15 to 18 months.  We will keep that up because it requires constant contact.  As Deputy Adams is well aware, now is the time to do this - at the start of President Obama's second term in office.  Hopefully, we can bring about a resolution to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400021#T00400","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354638600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach, particularly for dealing with the part of my parliamentary question that asked the Government to invite President Obama for a formal state visit next June.

I spoke to President Obama to congratulate him on his re-election and the start of a second term in office.  I expressed the wish that, during the course of his term, he would have the opportunity to visit Ireland again formally with Michelle, his wife, and his delegation.  It was not the time to say that I was formally inviting him, but I did say that I hoped he could come back to Ireland.<\/p><p>  The President has said on a number of occasions that his visit last year had an extraordinary impact on him and was one of the most exciting days of his presidency.  In its own small way following that, the Irish community across the United States seemed to have borne this in mind in terms of their support as well.<\/p><p>  I recall how, while I was a young lad, President Kennedy came here in 1963 and spoke from this spot.  At that time, he quoted poetry: &quot;to come back and see old Shannon's face again.&quot;  That opportunity did not present itself for him.  I wrote to his daughter just last week about the celebrations that will take place in Wexford, to which I have committed my involvement.  A number of the Kennedy family are travelling for that.<\/p><p>  When I had the opportunity to speak at the Kennedy centre in Boston, I said that perhaps we should look at doing something next year, but in a forward thinking and forward looking way, on the 50th anniversary of the President's anniversary to Ireland, which was the last before the great tragedy of his assassination.<\/p><p>  Deputy Keating is quite right.  It is an opportunity for us to promote the country fairly strongly in terms of The Gathering.  There is a big effort going in there at the moment.  I hope that it will pay the dividend that I have heard about.<\/p><p>  When the protocol of the visit becomes a little more clear and when the President's schedule becomes known, we can reflect on that suggestion.  I hope that, during his Administration, he will have the opportunity to come back to Ireland, spend a little longer here this time and, if he could arrange the opportunity, address both Houses.  Let me confirm to Deputy Keating that we are working with the American Administration and the Kennedy centre in Boston to do something in June or July of next year in the Kennedy centre with the theme of looking forward for the future as to the significance of that visit and how one might build on the platforms that are there to create a better world for everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400022#U00700","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1354638600,"counter":310,"content":"<p>If it is the Taoiseach's intention to invite President Obama, I ask him to raise two matters with the President.

In the context of the American Government's examination of this matter, would it not be useful to have substantial co-operation between Europe and the US on increasing the corporate tax take and breaking from the policies of tax piracy and tax competition between Europe and America and within Europe that are destabilising the global economy and robbing states, be it this one, European states or the US, of revenues that they could use for stimulus programmes and employment?

We are in an above-board, transparent and legal corporate taxation framework.  In the aftermath of the presidential election there will be an anti-outsourcing lobby in America which believes that jobs are leaving American shores.  In many ways it is a protectionist approach to what is a globalised economy.  In order for American companies to gain additional custom and to sell their goods and services they set up overseas in major markets.  They have set up in European markets for some time and we have been a beneficiary of that.  There is a need for an initiative to be taken.  Have we taken any initiative to counteract a campaign that will be under way in the aftermath of the election?  After the previous presidential election such a campaign involved situating key expert personnel in our embassy in Washington in order to support the ambassador in dealing with legislators on Capitol Hill and bringing a greater understanding of what is the situation in this country.

I support the two-state solution.  Will the Taoiseach take the opportunity to put that on the agenda?  Notwithstanding our difficulties - everything is relative - will he also raise the issue of poverty?  He is aware that people in the developing world, in particular the Continent of Africa, live in extreme poverty, almost like our Gorta M\u00f3r.

It is an issue on which we will work with the organisations and the Administration through our consular offices, the ambassador and the lobby groups in making connections on the Hill, both in the Senate and the Congress, to see how we can play our part in bringing about what is the best and most appropriate outcome for Ireland, whether that be part of a major comprehensive immigration reform policy and platform or something more appropriate to deal with our particular case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400024#W03800","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Constitutional Convention","time":1354640400,"counter":372,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400025#X00050"},{"type":"question","time":1354640400,"counter":373,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[45693\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400025#X00100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he has approached persons to chair the Constitutional Convention and\u00a0the responses that have been received;

Deputies will agree that Mr. Arnold's personal commitment, qualities and experience make him an ideal choice to lead the convention.  Mr. Arnold paid a courtesy call on the T\u00e1naiste and myself on 5 November last when we thanked him for agreeing to chair the convention and wished him well in this important role.<\/p><p>  The convention held its inaugural meeting in Dublin Castle on Saturday, 1 December.  The T\u00e1naiste and I attended the meeting to wish the members well in their work, as did other party leaders.  The convention operates independently of the Government and will report directly to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It decides on all matters relating to its operation, including its rules and procedures, the timing of its meetings and, subject to the resolutions passed by the Houses, the prioritisation of its work programme.  I understand these matters were discussed in private session at the inaugural meeting.<\/p><p>  The Government is keen to ensure the views of the diaspora will be heard as part of the convention process and I understand the convention's website has been designed specifically to facilitate the involvement of those currently abroad.  I am told the convention secretariat is working to ensure our network of embassies and community groups abroad will receive as much information as possible about the work of the convention, which can then be widely disseminated.<\/p><p>  The convention is a new and exciting way of considering constitutional reform.  For the first time, ordinary citizens will work side by side with elected representatives from North and South in a dynamic approach to examining constitutional change.  I am sure every Member will join me in wishing it well in its work.  I also trust that Deputies who are members of the convention will be anxious to work co-operatively with the convention chairperson and the other members to ensure the convention carries out its tasks in an exemplary manner.<\/p><p>  I met citizens who have been selected to work with the convention.  They are excited about it and many see it as a brand new opportunity for involvement in the political system and working towards improvements, if that be so, of a document that belongs them, the Constitution.  It belongs to the people and no one else.  I felt a sense of excitement among those nominated as citizens and I wished them well in their endeavours.  While it is a completely independent operation, we will respond appropriately when the convention reports to us.<\/p><p>  The following information was provided under Standing Order 40A.<\/p><p>  The Resolution passed by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 10 July (and by Seanad \u00c9ireann on 12 July), agreeing to the setting up of the Convention, set out the matters to be considered by the Convention, including provision for same-sex marriage.<\/p><p>  The Resolution also noted that, not later than two months from the date of the first public hearing held by it, the Convention will make a report and recommendation to the Houses of the Oireachtas on each of the following (two) matters set out in the Resolution: reducing the Presidential term of office to five years and aligning it with the local and European elections; and reducing the voting age to 17.<\/p><p>  As I said in my reply on 4 December, the Convention operates independently of the Government and will report direct to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It decides on all matters relating to its operation, including (subject to the Resolutions passed by the Houses) the prioritisation of its work programme.  Accordingly, once it has reported on the two matters mentioned above, it is a matter for the Convention to prioritise its consideration of the other matters referred to in the Resolution, including the issue of same-sex marriage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400025#X01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1354640400,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I welcome the appointment of Mr. Tom Arnold.  On Saturday, it became clear that there is a restricted agenda imposed by the Government on the work of the convention.  It has undermined the idea of radical reform of the Constitution.  The difference between the rhetoric of the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste and the reality of the agenda was striking.  On Saturday, the Taoiseach gave a commitment to a Government response to the recommendations but not a commitment that the D\u00e1il or the people will have the chance to decide on recommended amendments.  It appears we are talking reform but keeping all power in the hands of the Government.  Can the Taoiseach state whether he will allow the D\u00e1il and the people the right to vote on the convention's recommendations, irrespective of the Government's view on the recommendations?<\/p><p>  I am pleased with the chairperson but I am concerned there is no formal requirement that groups on whom decisions of the convention will have an impact are involved in all stages of discussions.  With regard to marriage equality, it would be shocking if same-sex couples were only heard as outsiders rather than entitled to be there for detailed debate.  The same applies to the diaspora.<\/p><p>  There is a major suspicion that marriage equality is being put into the convention to be kicked down the road for a while.  Is it the understanding of the Taoiseach that groups affected by issues such as this will be included in the convention's deliberations, regardless of whether they are members with votes?  Is it the understanding of the Taoiseach that the marriage equality recommendation will go to the people and will be dealt with during the lifetime of this Oireachtas?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400025#X01200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1354640400,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I have discussed the matter with Deputy Martin before.  The convention is set up and is independent in how it does its job.

I wanted that to happen so that the convention, of which Deputy James Bannon is a member, could see how effectively it works.  We may have to tweak its capacity to do its job well.  The convention has had a discussion in private about how it wants to conduct its business.  We have said that, if there are other constitutional issues the convention thinks it appropriate to raise, it is the remit of the convention to do so in working with the convention chairman.<\/p><p>  I am not sure what Deputy Martin meant when he referred to the convention making a recommendation to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The commitment I gave on Saturday, which will be honoured, is that the Government will respond within four months.  If there is a positive response, we will set out a tentative timeline.

If the chairman and the convention wish to reorganise the priorities attached to particular issues, it is their right.  They are not set beyond dealing with the first two to see how effective it is in the order in which it does its business.  I had said that we will hold the children's rights referendum separate to it and that, next year, we will hold a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad.  Beyond that, the convention, the chairman and its members are fully entitled to say they consider D\u00e1il reform, electoral reform and whether the electoral system should be proportional representation, PR, or straight vote to be the priority.

The citizen delegates, along with the rest of us, were buoyed by the great privilege of being able to fulfil the patriotic role they were asked to complete.  That is all to the good.  However, the Government has put the convention on a very tight leash.  Voting age and the length of the presidential term are important issues but we do not need a convention to tell us what to do about it.  There are more contentious and difficult issues such as marriage equality, which Sinn F\u00e9in believes is a civil rights issue for same-sex couples, and the role of the diaspora.<\/p><p> We were talking earlier about the diaspora.  The importance of President Obama coming to Ireland, whatever part of the island, is not just because he is the President of the United States of America, although that is a huge thing because the US is such a powerful nation, but because of the connections we have with the USA.  Despite this, we have no place for the diaspora in the convention.  Next year we will ask them to come for The Gathering and we ask them all the time to assist us in our economic regeneration.  We know of all the nascanna idir an oile\u00e1n seo agus an Oile\u00e1n \u00dar.  The Government must repair that.<\/p><p> The issue of our ethnic minority is not raised very often.  Our ethnic minority, the Traveller community, are treated dreadfully.  They are discriminated against dreadfully and yet they are part of what we are and, rightfully, demand to be treated as an ethnic minority.  Could that not be looked at by the convention?<\/p><p> Similarly, there are new folk who have come to live on this island.  Some people refer to them as the new Irish.  They bring great colour, history and culture to mesh with our won history and culture.  Do we not do outreach with them?  Why can we not go into the North, into Gaeltacht areas or the Border corridor?  Why can we not make this a living example of what a constitutional convention can be? <\/p><p> On a previous occasion I commended the approach of the conference put in place in South Africa as it moved into democracy.  A wonderful job was done there.  We, obviously, have to do it within our own lights.<\/p><p> I throw these ideas forward.  I commend and congratulate Mr. Tom Arnold and I wish him well in his role as chairman of the convention.

People with disabilities were hit very hard as a result of the flawed nature of the Estimate.  Personal assistants were taken from people who wanted to live independent lives, and many people had access to hospital and medical facilities delayed.  During the week, I met nurses at the opening of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation centre in Cork.

In deciding the amount of compensation in a civil claim, the courts resort to two headings of damages - general damages and special damages.<\/p><p>  General damages is that part of the award which compensates a person for the injury up to the date of the court hearing and also as to the future, which is at best a guesstimate since the effects of the injury can be borne by the injured party right through until he or she dies.  This is, therefore, encompassed by a lump sum award which, despite public perception to the contrary, is not unlimited as there is a court defined cap on general damages in civil claims.<\/p><p>  The second heading of an award is special damages which encompasses various items which can be calculated with reasonable accuracy with the aid of expert evidence provided by an actuary.  Such items include the loss of earnings, both past and in the future, and can be based on the likely future earnings and the possibility of not always being in employment as is currently the position, and this must also be factored in to this estimate.  Special damages also includes future medical expenses and in the case of very serious physical injuries, the cost of equipment, the modification of a dwelling house, the requirement for an automatic car, the requirement for home care help, and the cost of specific medical assistance and aids.<\/p><p>  Under the system as currently constituted in the Irish jurisdiction, it means that awards in these types of serious cases consist of a lump sum which is a once-off amount of money paid.  In so far as the amount awarded in respect of special damages, this is especially problematic as the amount for special damages is intended as a capital sum which, if invested wisely, would yield enough annual income for the person so injured to pay his or her medical and other expenses and live comfortably in the context of his or her injury.<\/p><p>  The Judiciary has been active and vocal in this area for the past three years or so.  Mr. Justice Kearns, President of the High Court, established a working group on medical negligence and periodic payments under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice John Quirke, who is now retired.  Indeed, the first module of this report concerning periodic payment orders was presented in October 2010.  This has been available for the past two years.  Notwithstanding the urgings of the members of the Judiciary in recent months, most notably Ms Justice Mary Irvine, who has taken a number of these cases for ruling, to bring forward appropriate legislation to implement the recommendations of this report, nothing appears to have happened today, and I hope the Minister will change that this evening.<\/p><p>  The House will be aware that since 2005, in England and Wales, personal injury awards in catastrophic injury claims may be based on structured settlements or periodic payments.  A structured settlement is, in effect, an annual payment or annuity purchased from an insurance company to meet the obligations in an agreement to provide periodic payments.  Periodic payments are the payments made as a result of a personal injury claim which are made by way of a future stream of payments.<\/p><p>  The executive summary of the working group makes 13 specific recommendations.  The group was unequivocally clear that a single lump sum award is inadequate and inappropriate in such cases where a plaintiff has been catastrophically injured in the long term or, indeed, permanently, a where this person will require ongoing care and medical treatment in the future.  Therefore, I urge that legislation be enacted to empower the courts, as an alternative to lump sum awards of damages, to make consensual and non-consensual periodic payment orders to compensate injured victims in cases of catastrophic injury where long-term permanent care will be required, for the cost of future treatment and future care and the future provision of medical and assistive aids and appliances.<\/p><p>The order should apply to the whole or part of an award in any case where, having regard to the nature of the injuries in respect of which the award is being made and the circumstances of the person to whom the award is being made, the court considers it appropriate in the best interests of that person that such order should be made, provided that the parties have been given an opportunity by the court to make submissions and be heard in full on the relevant issues.  The court should be empowered to make periodic payments orders to compensate for future loss of earnings only with the consent of all of the parties to the relevant claim.<\/p><p> I look forward to the Minister's reply.  This is an innovative area in which I expect the Minister will bring forward legislation as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400031#DD00600","speaker":"1063","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354644000,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Penrose for raising this important matter.  As Deputies may know, the programme for Government has a commitment to legislative reform in this area.  The commitment is to empower courts to make provision for structured settlements in circumstances where lump sums are currently awarded as a consequence of individuals suffering catastrophic injury because of the negligence of another.<\/p><p>  In our legal system an award for damages, in other words monetary compensation, in personal injury cases is restitutory in purpose.  It is the most common form of redress pursued in civil claims.  The bedrock principle underlying the awarding of damages in our legal system is that the amount of compensation should restore the injured person, in so far as money can do so, to the position he or she would have been in if he or she had not sustained the wrongful injury.<\/p><p>  In general, damages awards are paid by way of a single lump sum.  Damages are awarded under two headings: special damages and general damages.  Special damages are damages specifically claimed and proven to have been sustained in the circumstances of the particular wrong to the plaintiff.  They cover pecuniary losses like medical expenses or loss of earnings, including loss of future earnings.  General damages cover non-pecuniary loss that the law presumes follow from the type of wrong complained of.  This loss includes pain and suffering, loss of amenities and loss of the expectation of life.<\/p><p>  A one-and-for-all lump-sum award has a number of advantages.  It is final, simple and allows the plaintiff to be flexible in deciding for himself or herself the order of priority in relation to his or her different needs and wants.  This straightforward approach, however, often results in over-compensation or under-compensation.  The calculation in court by reference to average life expectancy may bear little relation to the real life expectancy of the individual plaintiff involved.  A claimant may die long before his or her expected time.  In that event, the defendant cannot take back the excess of damages paid, and the excess becomes a windfall for the plaintiff's family.<\/p><p>  The converse is that a plaintiff may live longer than expected.  In that event, his or her damages may simply not be sufficient to meet his or her needs during the last phases of his or her life.  This is likely to happen later in life when the effects of having insufficient resources will be particularly hard to handle.  Out of excessive prudence, a plaintiff may become so concerned about exhausting the lump sum that he or she does not spend the required amount of money on their needs.<\/p><p>  There are other variables we must keep in mind.  Investment returns will depend on the person's investment strategy and the prevailing financial and economic climate.  A plaintiff's needs may change from those assessed at the time of trial or settlement.  The costs relating to care that were assessed at rates or values operative at the time of the trial date may increase substantially later on.<\/p><p>  Judges do their best to ensure that a catastrophically injured plaintiff is adequately provided for, whatever the future holds for him or her.  However, the pressure on judges in many cases to turn to what is in effect guessing what the future holds for the plaintiff is unreasonable.  In this area, accuracy and legal certainty are important values.  It is desirable to have a system of compensation that is better able to meet future needs as and when they arise.<\/p><p>  To meet some of the difficulties of the current system and, in particular, to ensure that plaintiffs are safeguarded against the danger that at some time in the future their damages might be depleted, a new means of paying damages by way of periodic payments orders needs to be developed.  This would allow the courts to structure awards or settlements in a more realistic way.  It would provide a guarantee for a plaintiff that he or she will continue to receive regular annual payments for the duration of his or her life so his or her damages will never be exhausted.<\/p><p>  The Deputy specifically referred to the work undertaken by the Working Group on Medical Negligence and Periodic Payments, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice John Quirke.  I welcome that work and acknowledge its importance.<\/p><p>  On periodic payments, the working group recommended that legislation be enacted to empower the courts, as an alternative to lump sum awards, to make consensual and non-consensual periodic payments to compensate injured victims in cases of catastrophic injury where long-term permanent care and treatment will be required.  The working group also recommended that periodic payment orders should only be made where the court is satisfied that continuity of payment under the periodic payments order is reasonably secure.<\/p><p>  The viability of a statutory scheme for periodic payments requires the establishment of a financial infrastructure to ensure that continuity of payment is secure.  In this regard the working group recommended that the State, through the agency of the National Treasury Management Agency, be empowered to provide injured victims with the necessary security for periodic payments, either by the provision of annuities to insurers and others or in such other manner as may be appropriate.  Alternatively, it was recommended that consideration be given to the introduction of a statutory scheme whereby payments made under periodic payment orders will be statutorily protected and guaranteed.<\/p><p>  The NTMA has recently concluded an actuarial review on the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the State acting as an annuity provider to insurers and indemnity providers in personal injury actions to enable compliance with the security-of-payment principle.  The NTMA report is currently being considered by my Department in consultation with the Department of Finance with a view to the development of legislative proposals by my Department.  Subject to the outcome of these consultations, which I expect will conclude shortly, I intend to bring to Government for its approval in the coming weeks concrete proposals for the preparation of the scheme of a Bill to amend the Civil Liability Act to give courts the power to make periodic payment orders in appropriate cases.<\/p><p>  I regard the enactment of such legislation as of particular importance.  I very much appreciate the comments made by members of the Judiciary underlining the need for this matter to be adequately and fully dealt with by this House.  I hope we will see the legislation enacted during 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400032#EE00200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1354644000,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and for taking this matter on board.  I am concerned about cases where plaintiffs live for longer than expected and the imposition that would create where an award would be insufficient to meet their needs.  That can put a lot of pressure on parents and others concerned.<\/p><p>  In any such legislation, provision should be made for the appropriate indexation of periodic payments.  The working group recommended that this should include the introduction of earnings and cost-related indices which would allow periodic payments to be index-linked to the level of earnings of treatment and care personnel and to changes in the cost of medical and assistive aids and appliances.  That would ensure plaintiffs were able to afford the cost of treatment and care into the future.<\/p><p>  The working group also recommended that the Central Statistics Office is uniquely qualified to compile and maintain the indices required in this regard.  It is important that these matters should be taken on board.  I thank for Minister for his reply.

There is little point in putting in place a structure which facilitates the making of such payments unless it is ensured that those payments are secured into the future.  This is one of the issues, among others, which is being examined.  The reality is that there is no financial product available to insurers in this area at present.  A new financial infrastructure will be necessary to make the legislation workable.  This is quite a complex area involving a whole range of issues that need to be addressed.

I call on the Government to consider establishing a State body to co-ordinate and develop the oil industry.  I am anxious to see a proactive State effort to ensure the Irish people will derive the greatest possible benefit from our oil reserves.<\/p><p> Recent significant oil-related developments off the Cork and Kerry coasts signal major potential and Members must ensure the most is made of it.  Significant opportunities now present themselves before any oil is actually extracted and preparation and exploration could prove to be significant money spinners and employers for both regions and the State as a whole and Members must be alert to this.  They should not wait any longer as the opportunities are there now.  This is coming in the midst of the greatest economic crisis the State has ever known and oil and its associated benefits offer great hope.  This must be harnessed and put to tangible good use for the people of the country and this is the reason I call on the Government to consider the establishment of this State body to co-ordinate and maximise the potential of the oil industry.<\/p><p> Historically, State bodies such as Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Bord na M\u00f3na have delivered major benefits for the State by making the most of the natural resources available to their respective sectors.  I envisage this also would be the case in this regard.  Oil now offers a massive wealth opportunity to the people and the State must step in and make the most of it for this and for future generations, who will benefit therefrom.  This agency should comprise professional expertise brought from the oil industry and it would act as a one-stop shop on oil-related matters.

In preparing this report, the joint committee sought advice from the Norwegian oil ministry and the Norwegian ambassador and other interest groups also appeared before it.  The report is available and I understand it is probably in the Minister's office.  It should be considered in respect of exploiting this potential for the benefit of all the people and not for the oil companies or for a golden circle.  The potential of two discoveries off Dunquin and off the South Porcupine Basin offers quite substantial hope for the economy if they are used properly for the common good.  The tax regime that forms part of that potential should be consistent with the proposals in the aforementioned joint committee's report.<\/p><p>  I also wish to bring to the Minister of State's attention that Fenit Port, County Kerry, has a history and a great track record of servicing oil rigs off the west and south-western coasts from the 1970s and 1980s in particular.  It also has available skilled personnel who worked as roustabouts or roughnecks or who worked in galleys or as derrick men and so forth.  Many people there still have such experience and some people continued to work right up until the late 1990s by travelling to Aberdeen and so on.  County Kerry has almost twice the national average rate of unemployment.  Moreover, it received no visits from the IDA this year and nothing has come into the county in recent years.  Consequently, from the perspective of the local economy, it would be essential for Fenit to be considered as a port for supplying the oil rigs off the coast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400033#FF00500","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1354644600,"counter":519,"content":"<p>While I must ask the Minister of State to respond, I will revert to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400033#FF00600","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1354644600,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I thank both Deputies for putting this matter before the House for debate.  It is an important and current debate and I wish to refer to some of the facts.  The first fact obviously is that were oil to be discovered off the Kerry coast or off any other part of the coast, it would indeed be good news.  I can confirm for Members that there has not, as yet, been a discovery of oil off the Kerry coast and the last time an exploration well was drilled in this area was more than a decade ago in 2001.  Unfortunately, that well was dry.  On a more positive note, I can inform Members that planning for an exploration well in 2013 on the Dunquin prospect is being advanced.  There has been quite a deal of media coverage on the topic of oil and gas exploration in recent months, including some articles about potential major fields.  In some instances, these articles have related to exploration authorisations where the holders have yet to commit to exploration drilling or even to acquiring new seismic data.  Forecasts made in such circumstances must be put into perspective.  In order for a discovery to be made, there must first be exploration drilling and such drilling in the Atlantic is expensive and involves a high financial risk.<\/p><p>  Over the past decade, there has only been an average of a single exploration well per year.  In recent years, however, there has been an increase in the number of exploration authorisations granted in the Irish offshore area.  In the coming years, this should result in an increase in exploration activity and in exploration drilling in particular.  As a consequence of the current low level of drilling activity, there are no offshore drilling rigs permanently based in Ireland.  While the current level of exploration activity provides some employment opportunities in ancillary supply and support services, along with specialist port services, there is unlikely to be a substantial oil industry based in Ireland until there is a much higher level of exploration drilling in Ireland's offshore areas.  Not alone has drilling activity been low, but it does not all occur in one area and this has implications in terms of anticipating where support services should be located.  Clearly, a drilling rig off the coast of County Donegal is likely to be supported from a different port to a drilling rig off the County Kerry coast.<\/p><p>  Ireland has a clear policy of actively encouraging investment in oil and gas in order that we can enjoy both economic and energy security.  A reasonable increase in exploration activity levels resulting in further commercial discoveries of oil and gas certainly would result in increased employment and economic activity generally.  It also would result in significant financial benefits to the State from the higher rate of corporation tax that applies to profits from production of oil or gas.  For the present, however, one must remain realistic regarding both the pace and nature of the exploration effort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400033#FF00700","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1354644600,"counter":521,"content":"<p>One does not need to wait for oil to start flowing for the money to start flowing as in itself, exploration is a major industry that offers a massive spin-off to local communities.  For example, airports, seaports - as were mentioned - and local hotels could benefit greatly from such exploration.  Now is the time to be proactive in this regard and to put in place a one-stop shop for the industry to co-ordinate this effort.  There is a need to be proactive in this respect and I am very hopeful that there will be major reserves that can be brought to the surface at some point.  However, the very fact of finding it will cost a great deal of money.  As the Minister of State indicated, there will be massive expenditure involved and Members must ensure that before any oil is brought to the surface, the people of the country will benefit from such expenditure.  This is the reason the particular conduit I have proposed should be put in place for the industry.  I again ask the Minister of State to reconsider the matter and to give serious consideration to this proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400033#FF00800","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speech","time":1354644600,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I interrupted Deputy Ferris earlier.

A number of exploration wells were drilled there and oil was discovered.  However, because of the depth of water at which the oil was discovered - I believe it was approximately 1,700 ft. - modern technology was not then available to deliver the oil to the surface and to the shore and the find was capped and left there.  I assume the Petrel Resources company has returned to those areas on the south Porcupine Basin, where it is due to start drilling in the new year.  Based on its findings as a result of the two licences it purchased last year, Petrel Resources has stated it believes the area in which it intends to drill has the potential to deliver 1 billion barrels of oil.  If that is true, one would be talking about a monetary value of between \u20ac85 billion and \u20ac100 billion, which would be a significant start.  In addition, Providence Resources also has claimed to have made a big discovery off Dunquin.<\/p><p>Both of those will probably start next year and work together.<\/p><p> It would be remiss of us as elected representatives not to make the point that the resources which exist should be for the common good and the greater good of our people; they should not just be for the people who exploit resources for their own good.

We have resources in the Department, and the petroleum affairs decision is very much involved in the issue.  The Department has sponsored, along with the Canadian Government in the Labrador area, a study of geological backgrounds and the possibility of new exploration based on reversing plate changes.  In an Atlantic margin round, 12 new companies have taken up options to examine seismic data.  I announced recently that the Department is in discussions about a major new seismic analysis taking in thousands of kilometres off the Atlantic coast to determine what may be under the sea.<\/p><p>  We must be realistic and remain factual.

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, for her attendance for this topical issue.<\/p><p>  The people of County Wicklow, relative to other parts of the country, have been poorly served by the level of palliative care available.  In counties such as Limerick, Clare, Tipperary, Donegal and Sligo, the health spend on specialist palliative care services in 2011 was roughly \u20ac30 per head of population; in my county of Wicklow, the figure is a paltry \u20ac3.  Currently, Wicklow does not have the resources to provide a service seven days a week and it cannot provide a weekend on-call service.  Whereas the standard of care provided by home care teams of nurses is exceptional and very much appreciated by families in need of such a service, we have experienced weeks in Wicklow where services have been suspended in parts of the county due to staff leave and vacant nursing posts.<\/p><p>  Despite this, an amazing group of dedicated and committed people have come together in Wicklow to set up what is known as the Wicklow Hospice Foundation.  They have worked day and night and, to date, they have raised in excess of \u20ac2.5 million to provide a hospice in Wicklow.  They have even obtained a site for the hospice, very kindly donated by nuns, in Magheramore.  They now expect to be able to meet all the capital costs of building a hospice through fund-raising, an incredible achievement, particularly in the current economic climate.  That makes me very proud to represent such a community in this House.<\/p><p>  The people in the Wicklow Hospice Foundation, the residents of Wicklow and I must know where is the provision of the hospice in the view of the HSE and the Department of Health.  What consideration has been given to the possible funding streams to staff, equip and maintain such a Wicklow hospice?  If the community can build the hospice and has raised funding voluntarily, as well as finding a site for the hospice, where can the Department of Health and HSE meet the community in progressing the work?<\/p><p>  I wish to emphasise a few points and seek answers.  In 2009, the HSE carried out a major consultation process on palliative care and produced a five-year implementation plan.  The list emanating from the plan was based on population, need and clinical opinion on where the hospice facilities should be built, as we cannot build a hospice facility in every town.  County Wicklow was included as a location, so the need has already been recognised by the HSE as far back as 2009.  Will the Minister of State indicate where the implementation of the five-year plan stands?<\/p><p>  The Government's health document, Future Health, has just been published and it has a strong commitment to develop potential funding channels for palliative care.  Will the Minister of State elaborate on the issue and will the funding mechanism be based on the model of money following the patient?  It is clearly enshrined in the programme for Government and I know both of our political parties campaigned heavily on it in the last general election.<\/p><p>  The provision of a Wicklow hospice is clearly right morally and from a societal perspective.  It is also right from an economic view.  We all know the cost of acute hospital care is far more than the cost of palliative and community care.  Will the Minister of State address that point?  The provision of a Wicklow hospice is a perfect example of a partnership approach to the delivery of important community health services.  The community has played a leadership role and there is significant buy-in and pride in the project.  Residents in County Wicklow have put their money where their mouth is and raised more than \u20ac2 million.  The nuns in the county have played their part and contributed a site, which has been approved as being suitable by the HSE.

The development of such services is informed by various sources including, for example, the Report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care 2001 mentioned by the Deputy, the ongoing wider reforms for the health service generally and service priorities and resource availability generally, as indicated in the agreed HSE annual service plans.

Approximately 75% to 80% of this is being provided to the main voluntary organisations.  Palliative care is also additionally funded through both acute and community services.  The HSE service plan for 2012 specifically identifies the following deliverable outputs which are of relevance to the Wicklow area.  These are the development of a national standardised admission, discharge and referral criteria which will improve uniformity of care; development of a systematic process of assessment of need which will result in improved care plans; development of a benchmark which will ensure improvements from referral to first point of contact; development of integrated care pathways to improve access; development of guidelines and pathways to improve out-of-hours services; and production of readily available information on palliative care and bereavement services which will be provided to individuals and organisations to enable them better access to local services.<\/p><p>  The HSE palliative care services five year or medium term development framework for 2009 to 2013 identified the need for an inpatient hospice unit for Wicklow, together with associated staffing and revenue.  The HSE is keenly aware that the current level of service available is less than optimal.  The local Wicklow Hospice Foundation has been engaged in extensive fund-raising for capital to build a hospice.  However, in order to staff and operate such a service, it would be necessary to secure substantial revenue funding and staff.  The Deputy is aware of the budgetary pressures currently facing this Government and the HSE and all new developments have to be considered against the current budgetary and fiscal constraints.  The executive must also to take account of other palliative care issues, such as capital projects approved in the national framework for all areas which face similar service and resource pressures.  Nonetheless, the executive is continuing to engage with the hospice to see if it is possible to address funding issues in the context of any flexibility for this from 2013 onwards.  In these circumstances the Department and the HSE will continue to keep the matter under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400034#GG00400","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1354645800,"counter":529,"content":"<p>This is an issue of equity for people in County Wicklow.  As I indicated, spending on palliative care in the county is \u20ac3 per head of population as opposed to \u20ac30 per head of population in counties Donegal, Sligo and Limerick.  While we do not begrudge people in these counties such expenditure, some degree of equity is required.  The lack of equity was evident when palliative services in north County Wicklow where I live were suspended during the summer owing to staff leave.  Moreover, the Health Service Executive, having carried out interviews for vacant nursing posts, decided not to proceed to fill the positions.  While I am aware of the current budgetary difficulties, I ask the Minister of State to convey to the HSE my concerns regarding its failure to fill the relevant nursing posts.  Addressing this matter in the first instance is important.  However,  it is also important to address the issue of equity.<\/p><p>  One of the Minister's key commitments is to move to a funding model under which money follows the patient.  If we are serious about shifting to such a model, money should leave some of our hospitals with patients and go to hospices.  In 2011, the percentage of patients in hospice home care programmes who died in hospital was 6% in Limerick and 40% in Wicklow.  As Deputies are aware, it is more expensive to care for patients in hospitals than hospices.  If we were to introduce a funding model whereby money follows the patient, some financial resources should follow patients being discharged from acute hospitals into hospices. <\/p><p>  Politicians are always asked whether Departments have lists of projects.  Does the Department have a list setting out where the next hospices will be built?  If so, where does County Wicklow feature in the ranking?

Niall Comerford was a young man who had a routine operation lasting for 15 minutes in Kilcreene Hospital on 24 September 2012.  His parents complain that he was not given pre-operative advice and information on his after-care was not provided on discharge.  He was simply asked to return to the hospital within ten days and visit his consultant six weeks later.  On 1 November 2012, Niall died as a result of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.  Professor Beverley Hunt, who has written many papers on deep vein thrombosis, states that the condition can be avoided or addressed by following appropriate advice.<\/p><p>  The death of Niall Comerford has been shocking for his family who decided to wait until after the autopsy last Friday before raising the case publicly.  I listened carefully to Walter Comerford speak on my local radio station in recent days.  Despite his loss, Mr. Comerford is dealing constructively with his son's death and has asked publicly for an independent inquiry.  When I met him before the autopsy more than a week ago he was thinking along the lines of seeking an inquiry but chose to await the outcome of the autopsy.  He has since issued a public statement requesting an independent inquiry.<\/p><p>  It is difficult to believe the Health Service Executive did not contact the Comerford family until after the autopsy.  I believe it was for this reason that the family concluded it did not have confidence in the HSE.  Put simply, I support the family's request and urge the Minister of State to support the family during this very difficult time by immediately establishing an independent inquiry to ascertain precisely what occurred.  Such an inquiry could be carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400035#HH00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1354645800,"counter":533,"content":"<p>Before referring to the notes provided to me, which are, by necessity, very short, I extend my deepest sympathy and that of the Department to the family of Mr. Comerford.

The Health Service Executive expresses its deepest sympathy to the family on the death of this young man.  On 30 November 2012, the Waterford city coroner recorded a death of acute cardiac failure secondary to pulmonary failure, which was caused by deep vein thrombosis originating in the left calf.  The orthopaedic consultant involved in the case met with the family separately approximately one week before the inquest.  Following the verdict of the inquest, HSE representatives contacted the family and offered to meet them.  The family are to refer back with a decision as to whether they will attend a meeting.  The family have expressed their dissatisfaction and requested an independent review of the case.  The HSE has confirmed that this case is being escalated to the national incident management team for completion of a review.  The family will be consulted as part of this process.

Ireland Case: Statements","time":1354646400,"counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400036#JJ00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1354646400,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make this statement on the report of the expert group on the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in A, B and C v. Ireland.<\/p><p>  The reason for this debate - more than 20 hours have been set aside for statements to be taken in the Houses of the Oireachtas on this topic - is that the Government is committed to allowing all Members of the Houses the opportunity to make a statement on this issue.  Time for this purpose has now also been allocated in the Seanad, where a discussion will take place on Thursday afternoon.  Following this discussion, the Government will make a decision before the D\u00e1il goes into recess on the option to be pursued to implement the judgment in A, B and C v. Ireland.  The public hearings to be held by the Joint Committee on Health and Children in the new year will give us a further opportunity to discuss the option for implementation that the Government will have chosen.<\/p><p>  We are conscious that this is a sensitive issue and most of us hold strong personal views on it.  However, it is important to bear in mind that the Government has consistently stated its commitment to implement this judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.<\/p><p>  I must also reiterate that the Government is committed to addressing this issue within the confines of Article 40.3.3\u00b0 of the Constitution and its interpretation by the Supreme Court in Attorney General v. X.  As we all know, this case involved a 14 year old girl who became pregnant as a result of rape and was suicidal.  The court deemed that, where it was established on the balance of probabilities that there was a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother and that such risk could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, such termination was lawful.  This included where there was a clear and substantial risk to the life of the woman arising from a risk of suicide.<\/p><p>  Recent comments inside and outside of this House have addressed other unfortunate situations where pregnancy might arise cut of traumatic incidents such as rape or incest.  At this juncture, these scenarios per se do not come within our constitutional and legal provisions and, therefore, were not and could not be addressed by the expert group or, indeed, by the Government through the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.<\/p><p>  Before I move on to discuss the background to the report and its merits and implications, I wish to put on record once again my gratitude to the expert group, in particular to the honourable Mr. Justice Se\u00e1n Ryan, for its commitment and dedication to this work and for the invaluable contribution it has made in bringing clarity to this complex and sensitive issue.  While it is true that a number of other bodies have previously addressed the issue of how to provide for the X case, the House would agree that the report of the expert group presents with consistent clarity and lucidity the many complex issues that need to be resolved in order to bring clarity to the provision of medical treatment to pregnant women whose lives are at risk.<\/p><p>  In December 2009, the European Court of Human Rights heard a case brought by three women in respect of the alleged breach of their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights in regard to abortion in Ireland.  This is known as the A, B and C v. Ireland case.  All of the applicants were women who unintentionally became pregnant and who travelled to the UK for abortions.<\/p><p>  The European Court of Human Rights accepted that Article 40.3.3\u00b0 of the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, provided that it was lawful to terminate a pregnancy in Ireland if it was established as a matter of probability that there was a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother, which can only be avoided by a termination of the pregnancy.  This provision has not been altered by the judgment.<\/p><p>  The court found that there had been no violation of their rights under the convention in respect of the first and second applicants, Ms A and Ms B, and it dismissed their applications, and that there had been a violation of the right to private and family life contrary to Article 8 of the convention in the case of the third applicant, Ms C.  The court held that there was no accessible and effective procedure to enable her to establish whether she qualified for a lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with Irish law.  The court ruled that &quot;no criteria or procedures have been ... laid down in Irish law ... by which that risk is to be measured or determined, leading to uncertainty...&quot; and held that further legal clarity was required.<\/p><p>  The establishment of the expert group and publication of its report fulfil an important commitment in the programme for Government.  The expert group was established in January of this year and its terms of reference were as follows: to examine the A, B and C v. Ireland judgment; to elucidate the judgment's implications for the provision of health care services to pregnant women in Ireland; and to recommend a series of options on how to implement the judgment taking into account the constitutional, legal, medical and ethical considerations involved in the formulation of public policy in this area and the overriding need for speedy action.<\/p><p>  The group was composed of experts in the fields of obstetrics, psychiatry, general practice, law, professional regulation and public policy.  It met nine times from January to October and submitted its report to me on 13 November.<\/p><p>  The expert group's report starts off by clearly indicating that, in order to stay true to its terms of reference, it would not recommend one particular solution for the implementation of the judgment in A, B and C v. Ireland, but would suggest a number of options.  Sticking closely to its remit, it explicitly stated that it did not see it as its task to consider or recommend changes to abortion law in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The expert group report then gives a clear and concise overview of the current legal provisions governing termination of pregnancy in Ireland and meticulously outlines the historical background to the legal developments that have taken place on abortion in the past 30 years.<\/p><p>The report then describes the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in A, B and C v. Ireland and its legal implications.  The report maintains: the State is under obligation to do the following: <\/p><p>A. Provide effective and accessible procedures to establish a woman's right to an abortion as well as access to such treatment.<\/p><p>B. Establish criteria or procedures in legislation or otherwise for measuring or determining the risk.<\/p><p>C. Provide precision as to the criteria by which a doctor is to assess that risk.<\/p><p>D. Set up an efficient independent review system where a patient disputes her doctor's refusal to certify that she is entitled to a lawful abortion or where there is a disagreement between doctors as to whether this treatment is necessary.<\/p><p>E. Address sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.<\/p><p>In essence, the expert group indicates that the State is under legal obligation to put in place and implement a legislative or regulatory regime providing effective and accessible procedures whereby pregnant women can establish whether they are entitled to a lawful abortion in Ireland.  Furthermore, it asserts that: &quot;It would obviously be insufficient for the State to interpret the court's judgment as requiring only a procedure to establish entitlement to termination without also giving access to such necessary treatment.&quot;  The expert group then openly and explicitly presents the principles adopted in its deliberations and reflected in the proposals it puts forward for the implementation of the judgment.  These are very clear principles and they are fully in line with our constitutional, legal, ethical and medical requirements.  These are: <\/p><p>Principle 1. The entitlement to have the right to lawful termination of pregnancy ascertained should be established.<\/p><p>Principle 2. The State's constitutional obligations under Article 40.3.3\u00b0 should be reflected in the options proposed to implement this judgment.<\/p><p>Principle 3. Termination of pregnancy should be considered a medical treatment regardless of whether the risk to the life of the woman arises on physical or mental health grounds.<\/p><p>Principle 4. It will always be a matter for the patient to decide if she wishes to proceed with a termination following a decision that it is clinically appropriate medical treatment.<\/p><p> I believe that these principles taken together provide a clear and humane framework on which to base the provision of lawful terminations of pregnancy in Ireland.  Moreover, in adopting as one of its principles the constitutional obligation under Article 40.3.3\u00b0 and reflecting its provisions throughout its report, the expert group has shown us that there are ways in which the right to life of the pregnant woman can be protected, while requirements are also put in place to ensure that due regard is given to the right to life of the unborn, and that the dignity of the foetus is respected in cases where this can be achieved without compromising the woman's right to life.<\/p><p> Therefore, although the report clearly supports the Supreme Court judgment in the X case as the correct criteria to assess whether a woman is entitled to a lawful termination of pregnancy, that is to say when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, and this risk can only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, it also explicitly states that, as part of the test, the treating doctors will have to consider whether it is practicable to preserve the life of the unborn in the process of terminating the pregnancy without compromising the right to life of the woman, and evidence of this consideration must be documented.  The report also rejects the arguments often put forward that the judgment in Attorney General v. X establishes a right to an abortion at any gestational age.  The expert group argues that the judgment indicates that where a woman has a pregnancy that places her life at risk and her foetus is or may be viable, she may have a right to have the pregnancy brought to an end but not a right to insist that the life of her foetus be deliberately ended and that this approach also reflects an obstetrician's medical obligation to care for both of his or her patients, namely, the pregnant woman and the foetus.  Therefore, for example, a pregnancy that has reached or is approaching viability could be terminated by early induction with appropriate neonatal care to follow.<\/p><p> The four principles outlined in chapter 5 underpin the detailed procedural options presented in chapter 6.  This chapter illuminates possible avenues for the assessment of an entitlement to lawful termination of pregnancy in Ireland and for the delivery of this medical treatment.  It discusses the possible qualifications of the doctors involved in the process, the number of doctors who would be responsible for reaching a decision, what their different roles might be, and the locations where terminations might take place.  It also extrapolates potential exceptions to the process, such as in the case of an emergency or when dealing with conscientious objection.  In addition, this chapter provides a lengthy discussion on a formal framework to review the initial clinical decision, which is one of the main requirements emanating from the judgment.<\/p><p> The expert group correctly emphasises that any system that would be put in place should be duly monitored.  It indicates that from a clinical perspective there is a need to keep records on the number of women who might seek and be given terminations and the medical reasons that gave rise to such treatment.  In addition, statistics are also required to inform policy, as well as to ensure that the legal and constitutional principles and requirements of the system are being upheld.<\/p><p> The final chapter of the report sets out four options for the implementation of the European Court of Human Rights judgment in the A, B and C v. Ireland case and these are: guidelines alone, regulations alone, primary legislation alone, and primary legislation coupled with regulations.  It is those options that are now being considered and discussed by the Government and the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> I take this opportunity to restate the Government's firm commitment to implement the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C v. Ireland case and bring the required legal clarity to the issue of lawful abortion in Ireland.  That does not mean abortion on demand.  That is doubtless one of the most divisive issues in Irish society and yet we must try to discuss it in an even and calm manner.  We must protect the life of the pregnant mother and yet vindicate the right of the unborn child.  We must clarify what is available by way of treatment to the women of Ireland and clarify what is legal for the professionals who must provide that care.  As a Government we are elected to act, and we will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400036#JJ00400","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354647000,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I welcome the holding of this debate and the opportunity to address the report of the expert group.  It is appropriate that time is allowed for legislators, medical bodies and the wider public to consider the issues raised in the report in advance of the consideration of specific measures.  In the modern world there are few more passionately debated and divisive topics as abortion.<\/p><p>Ireland is very far from being the only state where there is an active debate about abortion.  It is an issue which can cross through ideological and party boundaries like almost no other.<\/p><p> There are many people on different sides who operate with an absolute certainty as to how they believe the issue should be handled.  Often this leads them to dismiss the sincerity of those who do not share their certainty.  There is also a small minority which takes quite an extreme approach \u2013 a fact well known to many Deputies and Ministers over the years who have experienced highly intimidatory tactics directed against them in their constituencies.  I hope that in this debate Deputies will show respect for the sincerity of each other\u2019s views and not seek out ways to caricature those with whom they disagree.<\/p><p> This report was due out last July but the group asked for more time and presented it to the Minister, Deputy Reilly, in the middle of November at the time when the sudden death of Savita Halappanavar was coming to national and international attention.  There has been an absolutely appropriate wave of shock among the Irish people about Savita\u2019s tragic death, and our profound sympathy is with Praveen and the Halappanavar family.  None of us in this House knows the full facts of what happened.  Two reports are being prepared, and the Government has said that it may consider an independent inquiry.  It is still not too late for the Government to recognise the exceptional nature of this case and to move to immediately establish such an inquiry.<\/p><p> Many people have automatically blamed the lack of legislation for Savita Halappanavar\u2019s death.  Nobody is in the position to claim that without seeing detailed final reports from medical experts and the outcomes of the inquiries.  Unfortunately, there have been other individuals who have also had tragic stories, and that includes the women who are known as A, B, and C.  These women as a group lodged a complaint to the European Court of Human Rights alleging that restrictions on abortion in Ireland were in breach of their human rights.  These were women who according to the report &quot;became unintentionally pregnant and who travelled to the UK for abortions&quot;.  The Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, supported the women who took the case.<\/p><p> &quot;A&quot; was a mother of four who lived in poverty and whose children were already in care.  She was trying to reunite her family.  She became pregnant accidentally and travelled to the UK for an abortion.  &quot;B&quot; was a single woman who became pregnant when emergency contraception failed.  She believed she could not care for her child and travelled to the UK for an abortion.  &quot;C&quot; had been treated for cancer and had been in remission when she accidentally became pregnant.  She was unable to get clear medical advice as to the effect of the pregnancy on her health-life and was very worried that the cancer would return.  She decided to travel to the UK for an abortion.<\/p><p> As Deputies will know, while there have been Private Members' Bills, I was the last Minister, and indeed the only Minister, to introduce legislation relating to the X case.  The indication, therefore, that nothing occurred in the past 20 years is not factual.  Quite a lot occurred at different periods.  That proposal was rejected by the people but no one can claim that, as a decision, the result clarified the matter.  The &quot;No&quot; side on that occasion included arguments that the proposal was too liberal as well as not liberal enough.<\/p><p> If the Minister believes that there should be no restrictions whatsoever on abortion, then obviously deciding on a response to the A, B and C v. Ireland judgment is not difficult for him.  The same goes for those who believe there are no difficult cases and that a simple ban is all that is required.  My position is that I do not believe in the provision of general access to abortion in the way that it is available in many other countries.  I do not see this as in any way a conservative or outdated view.  A growing respect for life is perhaps the greatest achievement of the modern age and it should extend to the unborn.<\/p><p> When woman are pregnant they should have no less protection for their life, and it should be the duty of the medical profession to ensure that their lives are protected.  According to the Supreme Court, this principle is reflected in our laws but the question is whether it is reflected in such a way as to give certainty to doctors and patients alike.  The answer to that has been found to be &quot;No&quot; by the European Court of Human Rights.<\/p><p> Public opinion has moved over the years, but no one can say that it is clear.  In fact, it may be more confused now than at any point in the past 30 years.  As the poll published on Sunday shows, a substantial minority, although still a minority, believes in allowing for wide access to abortion.  In contrast, two thirds favour it being more restrictive.  The poll showed strong majorities in favour of each of the options of maintaining, restricting and going beyond the X case ruling.<\/p><p> It is also not true that this is an issue where people divide along gender lines in their opinions.  There is little difference between men and women in their opinions on the main choices, with women slightly more against the introduction of widely available access to abortion.  Nobody in this House has the right to claim that they know for sure that their position has the support of the public, except to say that a consistent and strong majority of the public wants there to be no doubt that the life of a pregnant woman must always be protected.<\/p><p> It is a myth that nothing has been done on the issue over the past 20 years.  The expert group report gives a detailed account of what has occurred in the past 20 years.  It is true that this issue has not been resolved, but it is untrue to say that no one has done anything.<\/p><p> In the X case of 1992 a majority of the Supreme Court members held that if it were established as a matter of probability that there was a real risk to the life as distinct from the health of the mother, and that this real and substantiated risk could only be averted by the termination of the pregnancy, such a termination was lawful.  The stated risk to the mother\u2019s life in that case arose because she had threatened to commit suicide if she had to continue with the pregnancy.  In the 1992 referendum two amendments were carried to allow for information and the right to travel, but people voted against the exclusion of suicide as being a reason for abortion.<\/p><p> In November 1997 there was a ruling on the C case.  This involved a raped pregnant teenager who was allowed to travel for an abortion.  At that time the Government decided to produce a Green Paper on abortion and that was published in September 1999.  That was then considered by an all-party Oireachtas committee chaired by the late Brian Lenihan  Over 100,000 submissions were received by the committee which held hearings from all the various groups and published a report in November 2000.  Subsequently, there was a referendum on both a text for the Constitution and a supporting legal framework to allow medical practitioners intervene to save the life of the mother where there was a &quot;real and substantial risk of loss to the woman\u2019s life other than self-destruction&quot;.  <\/p><p> It also included repealing sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.  That Bill outlined that the doctors had to be registered medical practitioners.  The procedures would have to take place in approved licensed hospitals to prevent clinics being introduced in Ireland.  A section of it dealt with conscientious objection at the request of the medical profession.  The then Government thought this was a moderate proposal that excluded suicide being a reason for requesting abortion and it was rejected by the people by only 10,000 votes.<\/p><p> As I mentioned earlier, there was no single reason for the proposal being rejected as it was voted against by groups who held diametrically opposed views.  It was fully acknowledged that a wider response was required, including providing key support services for women.  As Minister for Health and Children at that time, I established the Crisis Pregnancy Agency to assist women who found themselves in a crisis pregnancy.  It did widely acknowledged positive work in educating people on how to avoid crisis pregnancy, and in supporting organisations that worked with women, but also advised and counselled women.  There was a reduction in the number of women who travelled to the UK as a result.  Over a decade, the number of women who travelled to the UK fell by nearly 40%.  In addition, regulations were enacted to allow the morning after pill to be available over the counter to allow women buy that in pharmacies across the country if required.<\/p><p> Ireland is not a country which ignores the interests of pregnant women.  Ireland has one of the lowest incidence of maternal deaths in the world.  That is something we should acknowledge, be proud of and always strive to improve upon.<\/p><p> In addressing this report I am conscious of the attitudes of the medical profession.  Whatever we do here, it is the medical profession that will be responsible for dealing with specific cases.  Members of the profession, and predominantly the Institute of Obstetricians &amp; Gynaecologists, are now requesting a proper legal framework to allow abortion in limited circumstances where there is an emergency and where the life of the mother is in danger.  They are also considering the expert group report recommendations this week, and I hope they will make their views and preferences known.<\/p><p>It is not the case that there is no guidance at all available at present and that there is a deep uncertainty in all cases.  Doctors follow the Medical Council guidelines that were most recently updated in 2009.  Section 21.1 states:<\/p><p>Abortion is illegal in Ireland except where there is real and substantial risk to the life (as distinct from the health ) of the mother.  Under current legal precedent, the exception includes where there is a clear and substantial risk to the life of the mother arising from a threat of suicide.  You should undertake a full assessment of any such risk in light of clinical research on this issue.<\/p><p>Section 21.4 states:<\/p><p>In current obstetrical practice, rare complications can arise where therapeutic intervention (including termination of a pregnancy) is required at a stage when, due to extreme immaturity of the baby, there may be little or no hope of the baby surviving.  In these exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to intervene to terminate the pregnancy to protect the life of the mother, while making every effort to preserve the life of the baby.<\/p><p>These guidelines could provide the basis for bringing certainty and clarity to Ireland\u2019s response to the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, judgment.  The ECHR judgment and the expert group outlined their reservations about only having guidelines as it opened up the possibility of \u201ccriminal conviction and imprisonment\u201d.  While there were advantages to the guidance documents, they concluded that the legal uncertainty arising from the 1861 Act could be subject to legal challenge.  Under 7.4.3, the report outlines approaching this issue by introducing the ability of the Minister of Health to issue regulations by legislation: \u201cThe Oireachtas would provide the principles and policies and the enacting legislation would give the Minister the powers to issue such regulations.\u201d  The Minister spoke of four options but placed heavy emphasis on paragraph 7.4.3, which states this approach would satisfy the requirements of the implementation process of the judgment in the A, B and C v. Ireland case.  It adds that \u201cthe advantages of this option are... it provides for appropriate checks and balances between the powers of the legislature and the executive, and would be amenable to changes that might arise out of clinical practice and scientific advances.\u201d  The expert group report goes through advantages and disadvantages of various scenarios involving legislation on its own or legislation with regulation.  It also outlines the scenarios of both repealing or updating the 1861 Act by replacing it fully or retaining the Act but amending it by legislation providing for the judgment in the X case.<\/p><p> The preference is to change the 1861 Act as there is a lacuna in protecting the life of the unborn and, according to the report, \u201cunder Irish law, currently, the life of a baby who is in the process of being delivered is not clearly protected under the offence of murder or the offence of abortion\u201d.  There is no doubt the expert group did a thorough synopsis of what options are there to enable the Government and the Oireachtas to respond to the A, B and C v . Ireland judgment.  I acknowledge this and thank the group for its work.<\/p><p> In his introduction to the report, Mr. Justice Se\u00e1n Ryan wrote:<\/p><p>Abortion is a difficult painful issue in this country and elsewhere.[...]  Intense ethical, religious, social political and intimate personal issues coincide.  <\/p><p>The public wants to ensure women who are pregnant receive the best hospital services possible and do not want women\u2019s lives to be put at risk in the absence of a legal framework.  The people have already been consulted twice on excluding suicide and have rejected the proposals.  I do not believe the Irish public envisages abortion clinics being available in Ireland and the contradictions in the RED C poll show this.  Wrestling with our consciences should not delay us doing what is required.  There needs to be certainty in whatever framework is decided to allow the medical profession to use professional judgment in emergency situations to save women\u2019s lives.  It is important for the House to remember Mr. Justice Ryan\u2019s comments in the expert group report when he stated:<\/p><p>The group consisted of people with expertise in the medical, legal and administrative fields and that obviously it is not possible for us to adjudicate on legal or medical controversies and it is absolutely not our business to try to decide political controversies.  The members of the group who are doctors are not settling legal issues; the lawyers are not deciding medical controversies and the administrators are not adjudicating on the medical or legal questions.<\/p><p>As legislators, we have a responsibility to consider in full the options that were laid out in the expert group report.  We have a responsibility to address the issue in an honest way.  We must take on board all of the expert advice.  When the Government outline its response, we should listen to the rationale and engage as constructively as possible with our responses.  <\/p><p> On page 25, paragraph 4.7 of the report, the implications of Ireland\u2019s obligations are outlined:<\/p><p>Arising from the judgement, Ireland is under a legal obligation to put in place and implement a legislative or regulatory regime providing effective and accessible procedures whereby pregnant women can establish whether or not they are entitled to a lawful abortion in accordance with Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case, and by necessary implication access to abortion services in the State.  It would be insufficient for the State to interpret the Court\u2019s judgement as requiring only a procedure to establish entitlement to termination without also giving access to such necessary treatment.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach has said he would not be rushed into responding to the report.  The T\u00e1naiste and the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, are on record as saying there will be a legislative response to meet the recommendations of the expert group report and this will be made known before Christmas and debated at the Joint Committee on Health and Children in the second week of January.  I presume the Institute of Obstetricians &amp; Gynaecologists will publish its submission on its preferred option so there can be no doubt about the safety of women\u2019s lives in Ireland\u2019s maternity hospitals.  As part of the response from Government, it should outline whether the Medical Council has been consulted and whether it is satisfied with the Government\u2019s proposals.  The medical profession must be fully satisfied with what is being proposed as it will be faced with taking decisions in individual cases.  We need to be sensible about this issue and not try to score political points.<\/p><p> The Fianna F\u00e1il Party believes clarity and certainty needs to be brought to this sensitive issue.  We will be consulting members and considering our approach to the report over the coming weeks.  We will be constructive and will fully partake in the debate both in the Chamber and at committee level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400037#KK00200","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354648200,"counter":543,"content":"<p>The issue of abortion and the failure of successive Governments to legislate for the Supreme Court decision in the X case has come centre stage in recent weeks due to the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar in Galway University Hospital on 28 October.  Her tragic death did not come to public attention until nearly three weeks later.  By a remarkable coincidence, the report we are discussing landed on the Minister's desk the evening before the story broke publicly.  Since the tragic death of Savita there has been an outpouring of grief for and solidarity with her family from across the country and across the globe.  Once again, I extend my sincere condolences to Savita's husband, Praveen, and her family on their loss.  It is a shame it took this tragic death to refocus minds on the need to deal with the outworking of the X case judgment 20 years after it was made.  Two weeks ago, Sinn F\u00e9in tabled a Private Members' motion seeking the publication of this expert report and a commitment from the Government to introduce legislation in line with Supreme Court judgment in the X case.  The Government should have published the report but I hope the report will spur the Minister to do what successive Governments have failed to do for the past 20 years, which is to introduce legislation in the area.<\/p><p>  Sinn F\u00e9in supports the introduction of legislation in line with the X case, as well as in circumstances of rape and incest.  I welcome indications from the Government that it will set out how it plans to proceed on the issue before Christmas.  The expert group was established in early 2010 in response to the European Court of Human Rights decision in the A,B and C v. Ireland case in December 2009.  The terms of reference of the group were to provide a range of options as to how the judgment was to be implemented in Irish law.  In the report, the expert group offers a range of options.\u00a0  In our view it would have been preferable if it had been allowed to make recommendations, so we would not have to read between the lines to see what options the group may favour.  It would be useful if the authors of the report were available to address the Joint Committee on Health and Children in the New Year and to answer questions.<\/p><p> In all of this we need to remember that real women are affected by this grey area in Irish law.  These are not letters in an alphabet or statistics.  One of these is Ms C, who brought Ireland to the European Court of Human Rights.  The court found that her constitutional rights had been violated.  Ms C had cancer for which she had been treated with chemotherapy for three years.  She had wanted children but her doctor had advised her that a foetus could be damaged by the ongoing chemotherapy.  She became pregnant at a time when the cancer was in remission.  She was unable to get clear advice from her GP as to the effect the pregnancy would have on her life or health or about the effect any further medical treatment would have on her baby.  She was reduced to consulting the Internet and eventually decided to travel to England for an abortion.  It is simply unacceptable in this day and age that a pregnant woman, suffering from a life threatening illness like cancer, is left in a medical and legal grey area where she has to surf the net to make these decisions.  One can only imagine the trauma and stress this citizen suffered.  It is wrong and we, as legislators, can and should do something about it. <\/p><p> The court in Strasbourg held that there was no accessible and effective procedure to enable this citizen to establish whether she qualified for a lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with Irish law.  The European Court found that the failure of successive Governments to legislate on this issue violated this woman\u2019s rights.  No more women should be left in these grey areas where their lives are at stake.  Any legislation being brought forward by the Government, in line with the X case, would be very restrictive.  The expert report points to the Supreme Court judgment in the X case which said that a termination of pregnancy was permissible if it was established as a matter of probability that \u201cThere is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother; and this risk can only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy\u201d.  These are the tests to be applied if a termination is to be lawful. <\/p><p> The X case ruling and any legislation arising from it do not comprise a formula for a liberal abortion regime.  Sinn F\u00e9in is not in favour of abortion.  We are talking about a right to a termination in very limited circumstances where a woman\u2019s life is at risk and where this is the only way to save that life.  The expert report outlines a number of options for Government on how best to implement the judgment in the A, B and C v. Ireland case and to bring legal clarity for pregnant women and medical professionals.  Sinn F\u00e9in favours the option of legislation plus regulations as being the most appropriate. <\/p><p> In relation to the other range of options put forward, the Government needs to strike the right balance between the need for speedy interventions where a woman's life is at risk and ensuring the highest possible standards.  A careful balance will have to be struck between making legislation too prescriptive and leaving too much to be dealt with by regulation.  There is also a requirement to deal with what the report describes as the chilling effect of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.  This is a 150 year old English Victorian statute.  The 1861 Act leaves both women and doctors open to criminal prosecution.  It fails to provide any protections for the right to life of a woman whose life is at risk due to her pregnancy.  The expert report also sets out a number of options for making clinical decisions on whether a woman\u2019s life is at risk.  These options need to be considered to ensure the correct balance is struck between ensuring the required safeguards are in place and making allowance for speedy action in the case of emergencies.<\/p><p> The people spoke in two referendums in 1992 and 2002 and firmly placed responsibility on the Oireachtas to deal with this issue by means of legislation.  In his remarks to the D\u00e1il last April, the Minister for Health acknowledged that no action had been taken by six successive Governments and he did not want this Government to be the seventh.  The Government needs to move beyond rhetoric.  Sinn F\u00e9in has made its position absolutely clear, having debated it as recently as at our Ard-Fheis in May.  We believe all possible means of education and support should be put in place in order that the difficult choice to terminate a pregnancy can be avoided by as many women as possible.  We are against any attempt to criminalise or to be judgmental of women who have had abortions.  No woman wants to be in such a position.  The women like Savita, Ms C or, 20 years ago, Ms X is could have been my mother, wife, sister, aunt or any of my women friends.  It is time for legislation to be enacted that will protect the rights of these women, as decided by the Supreme Court in 1992. <\/p><p> The publication of this report is a vital step along this road, but it cannot be allowed to gather dust as so many other reports did down the years.  One of the striking things about the expert report is the litany of bureaucratic delay in the 20 years since the X case.  The people in 1992 rejected a referendum which would have rolled back the X case and exclude suicide as a ground for a lawful abortion.  There was the constitutional review group report in 1996 which recommended legislation.  Nothing was done.  A Cabinet committee was set up to draft a Green Paper on abortion which proposed seven options and was published in 1999.  It received 10,000 submissions.  The Green Paper was referred to the All Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution which reported, giving three options.  This report was then forwarded to another ministerial sub-committee from which nothing emerged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400039#MM00200","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354648800,"counter":545,"content":"<p>It did.

We have had 20 years of delay after delay, of reports and referendums and six Governments all dodging their responsibilities.<\/p><p>  I earnestly hope this will not be the seventh Government to dodge this issue.  This means facing up to the reality highlighted by pregnant women who are confronted with life-threatening illnesses and have to cope with awful dilemmas.  The expert report sets out the options for the Government.  It is clear from the report and the European Court decision that Ireland violates the rights of its women citizens and residents by failing to provide an accessible and effective procedure to enable them to establish whether they qualify for a lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with Irish law.  The decision by the European Court has made clear there is an onus on the State to legislate under the terms of the 1937 Constitution and the decision in the X case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400040#NN00500","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1354648800,"counter":549,"content":"<p>With the agreement of the House I will share my time with Deputy Joan Collins.<\/p><p>  We have discussed this issue several times in the past number of weeks and I think the Minister and the Government are trying to present it as a positive that we will have 20 hours of discussion on this topic in the next number of weeks.  The reality is that we have had 20 years of waiting for successive Governments to legislate for a woman's legal and constitutional right to an abortion in Ireland where her life is in danger, including from a risk of suicide. <\/p><p>  Other Deputies have said it is a scandal that this issue has been ignored for so long, which it is, but I see our discussion in the next number of weeks as a further delaying tactic.  Every opinion poll and survey and the outpouring of emotion and discussion in the past number of weeks show that people in Ireland support the provision of lawful abortion where a woman's life is in danger, as they have done in successive referendums.  Members of the Government are merely saying they will let us know before Christmas what they are going to do about it, and not that they are actually going to do anything.  They will simply tell us what they will do.  That is not good enough.  <\/p><p>  This is not rocket science.  It is pretty straightforward.  We now have the findings of the fourth expert group and - surprise, surprise - they are not dramatically different from the findings of the many other expert groups, because the reality is quite straightforward.<\/p><p>  Comparing the actions of the Minister with the reaction of the British Government to the Leveson inquiry tells an interesting tale.  The British Government launched an investigation into cultural practices and the ethics of the press.  The inquiry presented a 2,000 page report which was published immediately and the Government made a statement on it within hours.<\/p><p>Here we have an expert group set up, issuing a report with 58 pages with a few pictures and graphs thrown in for good measure that was months late.  With weeks to release it, the newspapers got it before the D\u00e1il, and weeks later we have still not had an official response from the Government on what it will do on an issue that is decades old.<\/p><p> That sums up the systematic ignoring of the issue that has gone on over decades.  This is an opportunity to blood a few backbenchers, let them get their fears off their chests and appease their constituents, talk to whomever they want and then, in the new year, the Government will whip them into line because everyone knows there must be legislation.  There is no way out of it in terms of the European Court or any other basis to fail to act.  In that sense, it is regrettable that the Government did not take the opportunity to support our Bill progressing to Committee Stage last week because that gave the basis to frame legislation that we could have amended later on to bring in this most basic of provisions.<\/p><p> As the expert group has said, we are talking about primarily medical decisions that have been caught up in a legal quagmire.  Let us be honest - this is the case because of the traditional interference of the Catholic Church in the running of State matters in Ireland.  That is why we are in this mess, with the original 1983 referendum and the unwelcome amendment to the Constitution.  That is the nub of this.  These issues should never have been in the Constitution in the first place; these are private mattes between women and their doctors and there should be no basis for interference here.  Many other jurisdictions manage to deal with this simple medical practice by guidelines and medical procedures as they do for many other medical practices.  There is no need to get bogged down in difficulties.<\/p><p> The reason we are in difficulty is because of the constitutional situation.  As a result of that, we have succeeded in treating women, as the Minister for Justice and Equality said last week, as second class citizens with lesser rights to equality and whose health has been jeopardised.  We want to make it clear at the outset that if the Government does not come forward with legislation early in the new year, we will most definitely reintroduce our Bill.  I would like to see the Labour Party Members on the backbenches try to weasel their way out of this one if there is no provision for legislation.  Basic primary legislation can be added to using ministerial powers.  There is no doubt that is the way forward.  The dogs on the streets are asking how far we will move forward and if it will represent progress after all this time.  How could it be posed as a fundamental breakthrough that women have the right to have their lives protected?  The fact we are even debating this is quite insulting.<\/p><p> The tragic circumstances of the death of Savita Halappanavar have put on the agenda the circumstances for many women who find themselves pregnant in this country who have to choose to have an abortion.  It has opened the debate up beyond this.  It would be interesting to examine the mixing up of canon law in the background debate.  The church claims that it fully appreciates a woman's life must be protected and in such an instance where there is a termination, it is not really an abortion, dressing it up as if it does not have a problem.  That lie was exposed by stories highlighted in Arizona last week, where a Catholic bishop ex-communicated the head nun in a hospital and decommissioned the hospital as a Catholic hospital because it terminated a pregnancy for lifesaving reasons.<\/p><p> We have all heard the stories in recent weeks told by people who have gone on the airwaves, stories of women who have suffered the trauma of carrying foetuses with fatal abnormalities that they know at any minute could die and who have been driven out of the country at significant cost to march around the streets of Liverpool or Birmingham to have a termination.  One woman said that the ashes of her foetus that had been incinerated were sent back to her in a DHL package because they could not deal with that situation over there.  She could not acknowledge where she had been and this added further shame and trauma, an indefensible cruelty, as the Minister for Justice and Equality said last week.  I agree with him but I do not agree with the way he shrugged his shoulders and said he was sorry there was nothing the Government could do.<\/p><p> There are all sorts of reasons for women to decide to have an abortion - rape, incest, women who are too young or too old.  There are Irish abortions - they just do not happen in Ireland.  Well over 150,000 Irish women have been through this, thousands every year.  The people who have contacted us and who are out on the streets and have spoken in the opinion polls say this hypocrisy must be addressed.<\/p><p> This has touched a nerve.  I was contacted by a man from down the country during the week who told me the Savita case reopened old wounds for him and his family.  He told me how his mother died in similar circumstances in 1961 in the Coombe hospital, where she bled to death during her seventh pregnancy.  This man was six years of age, with sisters and brothers ranging in age from 12 to three.  The foetus died and as a result of his mother's death, his four sisters, his brother and himself were taken into the industrial schools because their father could not cope.  His brother and him ended up in Artane, and his sisters were sent to Goldenbridge.  They spent between five and ten years in those institutions before their father could get them back and try to put the family back together.  When they arrived back to the house, they had no change of clothes, no bedding or shoes other than the wellingtons they had on.  No one ever checked on them afterwards.  This is the legacy of how this State has failed to support families or women.  All that man wanted was that one day his story would be put on the record in the D\u00e1il and I want to do that now.<\/p><p> It is unacceptable that we continue to ignore the tragedy and trauma that goes on in life.  All that any civilised society can do is try to support its citizens in their decision making and in the difficult choices they must make, including the right to have children, have them safely and raise them in dignity without fear of poverty or stigma.  We have a lot to learn.  We have come a long way in some ways but in other ways we are stuck back in the years that man and his family had to endure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400040#NN00600","speaker":"1015","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354649400,"counter":551,"content":"<p>This is the fourth report and yet again it states what we know needs to be done: we must legislate for abortion.  Article 40.3.3\u00b0 is clear on that basis.  The dogs in the street know that needs to be done but we are still waiting for the smallest door to be pushed open to secure the right of a woman to have an abortion when her life is threatened up to the point of suicide.  The report once again makes the point that legislation is required to give effect to the rights of women under Article 40.3.3\u00b0.<\/p><p>  There are two issues - the Supreme Court judgment on the X case, and the European Court of Human Rights judgment on the A, B and C v. Ireland case - that place an obligation on the State to plan for the five main points in the report.  It must provide effective and accessible procedures to establish a woman's right to an abortion as well as access to treatment, which means facilities must be provided; establish criteria or procedures in legislation or otherwise for determining risk; make provision for the criteria by which a doctor is to assess that risk; and set up an efficient, independent review system where a patient disputes her doctor's refusal to certify that she is entitled to a lawful abortion or where there is a disagreement with her doctor as to whether the treatment is necessary.<\/p><p>  The Bill we introduced last week generally covered those points.  As Deputy Daly said, if this legislation is not introduced in the new year, we will have no problem reintroducing our Bill to the House.<\/p><p>The last point is to address sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.  They have been discussed at length in society in recent years in regard to legislating for the X case.  The only way to do this is to provide the legislation, possibly with regulations to back it up, as recommended in the report.<\/p><p> I want to deal with some of the arguments that I believe we will hear, including that Ireland is the safest place to give birth.  This has nothing to do with the debate on abortion.  The argument is irrelevant because the level of these deaths is extremely low in advanced capitalist economies.  Last week The Irish Times health section contained a very good report.  It stated:<\/p><p>Ireland, we have been told over recent weeks, is one of the safest countries in the world to be pregnant and have a baby.  According to figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for 2009, there were four maternal deaths per 100,000 live and still births.<\/p><p>However, experts here now say that figure is an underestimate and the rate is double that.<\/p><p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a maternal death as: \u201cThe death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.\u201d<\/p><p>According to figures in the Confidential Maternal Death Enquiry (MDE) in Ireland, Report for the Triennium 2009\u20132011, the maternal death rate here is eight per 100,000.  Dr Michael O\u2019Hare, consultant obstetrician at Daisy Hill hospital in Newry, Co Tyrone and chairman of the Maternal Death Enquiry group, says the higher rate comes from far more thorough data gathering than that gleaned solely from the civil register of deaths.<\/p><p>That figure can be compared with other countries in favourable and unfavourable conditions.  The Irish figures compare favourably with Britain, which had a death rate of 11 per 100,000 births between 2006 and 2008, though not as well as with Norway which had seven maternal deaths per 100,000 births, or Sweden which had five maternal deaths per 100,000.  These countries have different levels of abortion access.  Some countries have abortion on request and other areas are somewhat more restrictive.  I believe that contradicts the argument about Ireland being the safest place as measured by maternal deaths and using that as a reason not to have real discussion and debate, and bring in laws on abortion. <\/p><p> I dealt with the issue of suicide last week, but it is important to continue to make the point.  The anti-abortion side of the argument is trying to make an issue of suicide and abortion, and it is deliberately trying to distract the discussion away from the real issue.  Speaking on radio last week Anthony McCarthy, one of the country's most prestigious perinatal psychiatrists, made the point that while the risk of suicide is small, it is nonetheless real and must be addressed.  This is also the view of the other two perinatal psychiatrists.  This is a very important point to make because the idea that suicide is not an issue is ridiculous.  It is a real issue and one that people face every day unfortunately.<\/p><p> There is also an attempt by the anti-abortion lobby to mislead by arguing that abortion is a contributor to mental health problems.  This has nothing to do with this issue.  Last year, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges in the UK undertook a comprehensive review and the key conclusion was that the mental health outcomes for women who have an abortion are the same as for those women who go on to have a baby.  All those arguments are thrown in to distract from the real discussion, which is that the Government must legislate for the X case very quickly.  There is evidence that suicide is associated with unwanted pregnancies where abortion is not available.<\/p><p> The point was made that people's views in the debate on abortion have changed and I agree.  A recent RED C poll indicated that 85% of those polled said that legislation must be introduced to deal with a threat to the life of the mother up to and including suicide, as was proposed by Mr. Justice McCarthy following the X case.  The Government must now legislate.  It is no longer the privilege of Government to ignore the right of a woman in such a situation to have legislation allowing her to discuss the matter with her doctor and come to a conclusion that an abortion must take place.<\/p><p> Some 83% of those polled said that there should be access to abortion for women who became pregnant as a result of rape or incest.  The report of the expert group does not really deal with this aspect.  It does not really deal with the C case issue - A and B are not really part of the discussion from the point of view of the expert group.  We must broaden the scope, which can only be done by repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.  The Government must face up to that.  If we go back to Europe claiming we are dealing with these issues, we need to outline concrete steps as to how we will enact this and we must repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.  We must repeal the horrendous 1861 Act.  As I said last week, in India that Act was repealed in 1971.  One of the first things the Government must do is take that absolutely chilling legislation out of our laws.<\/p><p> We have heard of many cases of women who had fatal foetal abnormalities and they are not included in regard to having access to abortion here.  These women are still travelling to Britain in terrible and traumatic conditions.  I wish to read an e-mail I received from a woman:<\/p><p>Sunday the 2nd of December 2012 it will be one year to the day since I delivered my baby girl Aoife stillborn, after finding out 3 weeks before that she had a terminal genetic condition called Edwards Syndrome and would not survive outside the womb.<\/p><p>I was, and in ways I still am, devastated.  I miss her every day, and I probably always will.  Upon being given the news at 22 weeks in to my pregnancy, myself and my husband made the excruciating difficult decision to end the pregnancy early.<\/p><p>For us, it was the most humane and sanest choice, as I could not have functioned, knowing of her condition, spending every second of every day wondering if she had died inside me.<\/p><p>Nor could I see any kindness in bringing her into the world to watch her suffer massive organ failure and die in front of our eyes.  I would not put my baby through that. <\/p><p>This is a decision we should have been able to make in private, with the support of a medical team in Ireland. <\/p><p>But to do what we thought was best for our family and for our darling girl, we had to travel to Liverpool Women's Hospital, where we were treated with such kindness and compassion, it may be the only thing that saved my sanity.  I felt, and still feel, so hurt and frustrated that this situation continues, and unless cases like ours our considered along with the X case and ECHR judgements, this will continue to happen to several couples per week.<\/p><p>As a public representative, your laws added such unnecessary pain to what was already the worst time of myself and my husband lives.  Why?  To what end?<\/p><p>Our darling daughter, that we longed for more than any anyone else on this planet, was never going to live.  Yet we still found ourselves falling under Ireland's 'abortion laws'.<\/p><p>This needs to change now. <\/p><p>Please, do not forget about cases of fatal foetal conditions, when you are considering action on termination of pregnancy in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>This is a matter we must address.  We need to show responsibility and take on board the situations in which these women find themselves every day of the week.  The RED C poll indicated that 36% of people are fully pro-choice regarding accessing abortion in Ireland.  I cannot understand the hypocrisy of people saying they do not want abortion in Ireland.  If they felt that strongly they would be calling for a repeal of the laws on access to information and travel.  It is absolutely hypocritical for people for say we do not have abortion in Ireland because we send it away.  This debate must widen and we must be serious, responsible and mature.  I believe the people have done that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400041#OO00200","speaker":"1032","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354650000,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Funding of Disability Services: Motion [Private Members]","time":1354650600,"counter":554,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400043#QQ00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1354650600,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><p>That D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann:<\/p><p>recognises:<\/p><p>\u2014 the fact that there are over 600,000 people with disabilities in Ireland;<\/p><p>\u2014 the deep concern among those with disabilities that services affecting them may be cut or reduced further; and<\/p><p>\u2014 that it is unfair and unjust to cut services for people with disabilities;<\/p><p>notes pledges in the Programme for Government to:<\/p><p>\u2014 ensure that the quality of life of people with disabilities is enhanced and that resources allocated, reach the people who need them; and<\/p><p>\u2014 facilitate people with disabilities in achieving a greater level of participation in employment, training and education; and<\/p><p>calls on the Government to provide the appropriate funding and services necessary to honour all its commitments to people with disabilities.<\/p><p>I wish to share my time with Deputies O'Dea, Browne, \u00d3 C\u00faiv and McConalogue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400043#QQ00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1354650600,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

There are major concerns among service providers and users of those services.  There is no point in us pretending there have not been cuts to the area of services for people with disabilities, both physical and intellectual.  There clearly have been cuts in terms of provision of care and services.  We have had repeated statements from the Ministers concerned that front-line services will be protected, but the Minister acknowledged in the context of the budgetary statements and announcements last year and the health service delivery plan that there would be cuts to front-line services in intellectual and physical disabilities.<\/p><p>  I attended a meeting on Saturday in Our Lady of Good Counsel national school in Ballincollig.  It is very concerned because of the reconfiguration being proposed by the Government in terms of mapping services and ensuring the services and supports are in place such that everybody has access to the service.  Quite clearly, if the Government continues as it is, there will be very few services to share among anybody.  There is considerable despondency, anger and frustration.  Exceptional efforts have been made over recent years to provide services for people with physical and intellectual disabilities.  It has been acknowledged that we have made some ground,, but the idea that because we are now in difficult financial straits, we would row back on any of the advances we have made for the most vulnerable in our communities and society is very distasteful.<\/p><p>  We are talking about the service providers being asked to find further efficiencies.  Everybody accepts that efficiencies should be to the fore in ensuring there is a quality service and that it is delivered efficiently.  However, they are being asked to pay the increments out of the savings.  There has been no additional allocation from the HSE to the service providers to fund the increments awarded in the context of Croke Park.  When we talk about a 3% or 5% cut in the provision of services in real terms, we are talking about multiples of that simply because they do not have the ability to increase the efficiencies and at the same time fund their commitments in the context of Croke Park.  If we are to be serious and fair on the issue of providing services to people with physical and intellectual disabilities, the very least we should do is honour in terms of funding an increase in allocations this year to cover the increments awarded under Croke Park.  Otherwise, we will have a continual diminishing of services required by many people.  We are talking about up to 18% of people who have a disability of one kind or another.  Many of these people can get on and work their way through life but there are a huge number of people who are completely dependent on their families and the State for support.  Unfortunately, the State is reneging on its clear obligation to fund the services and provide the supports for the many people who need them.<\/p><p>  We were at the meeting to which I referred and one thing we heard continually from parents of children with physical and intellectual disabilities was that they were tired and burnt out.  They were fighting the system and consistently up against it.  Every time they thought they were taking a step forward, the State forced them to take two steps back.  That clearly is something that is unacceptable in modern times.<\/p><p>  I want the Minister of State to put a strong emphasis on services for people with physical and intellectual disabilities, provide a clear pathway of funding and ensure service providers do not incur the cost of the increments awarded to employees under Croke Park and upheld by the Labour Court and Labour Relations Commission by providing additional funding to cover those increments.  Let us introduce efficiencies in the system and make sure we map the resources and apply them in a way that is fair to everybody - those in the specialist streams and those in the mainstream.  If one continually divides these scarce resources, one will reach a point where they benefit nobody because they will not receive the specialist training in terms of occupational, physical and speech therapy, for example.  Clearly, that is what is happening.<\/p><p>  Our motion is very simple and straightforward.  It asks that the Government lives up to its commitments as outlined in the programme for Government - nothing more, nothing less.  It is simply what it said it would do in the programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400043#QQ00500","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1354650600,"counter":558,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400043#QQ00600","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1354650600,"counter":559,"content":"<p>We are not even asking the Government to live up to the commitments it made before the election given the wild abandoning of such promises made prior to the election.

The reason prior to this was that funding took account of the number of people who were going to leave and funding was provided accordingly.  Regardless of whether the place was guaranteed or not, the funding was in place to ensure they would have those services.  That funding has been cut and there is a diminishing budget, which is why the Government cannot guarantee places.  It simply does not have the resources applied to the service providers.  The key reason for that is that the budget last year was completely flawed, a failed entity from the word go and not sustainable throughout the year.  This was exemplified in the decisions of the Minister and the HSE to take special needs assistants from people, resulting in protests outside Government Buildings in September and now the attack on home helps and home care packages.<\/p><p>  The critical issue is that the resources were not allocated.  The savings and income streams identified in the budget this time last year could not be achieved from the word go.  We have highlighted that continually.  In this budget, the Government must put a strong emphasis on providing the necessary resources that sustain services and provide opportunity and hope to people with intellectual and physical disabilities.  If we continue down the path we are going, we will leave behind a generation of people who need our help and support.  We are also asking parents to make considerable sacrifices, and they do so willingly, day in and day out, but the State is not willing at this late stage at least to stand up to its commitments in the programme for Government.<\/p><p>  We have a situation where the HSE is writing to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The State is asking voluntary charitable groups to assist families who are under financial pressure.  It is unbelievable that we are in this situation.  In the 24 hours before the budget, I ask the Minister or Minister of State to make an impassioned plea to provide funding that lives up to no more and no less than the commitment the Government made in the programme for Government to ensure people have adequate supports and services and places will be available for the 700 plus people who will leave second level next July.  Otherwise, the Government is reneging on its commitment and on a basic commitment to decency in society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400043#QQ00900","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1354651200,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Billy Kelleher on tabling the motion.  As I have only a few minutes to contribute, I will concentrate on one aspect of provision for the disabled, namely, the domiciliary care allowance.  As the House is aware, the allowance is paid to the parents of children under the age of 16 years who suffer from a serious mental or physical disability to the extent that they need an inordinate amount of care to survive in ordinary society.  In the past two years, approximately since the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, took over in the Department of Social Protection, there has been a significant cutback in provision for those in receipt of domiciliary care allowance and this has been done by stealth.  Two or three years ago approximately 65% of applicants for the allowance were successful.  However, this figure has dropped to 35%.  The number succeeding has dropped from two in three to one in three, although the rules have not changed and neither has the incidence of physical and mental disability among children under the age of 16 years.  There is no evidence that fewer young people have autism; in fact, all of the evidence points in the other direction.  What has changed?  Why is only one in three applications being accepted now when the figure was two in three up until two years ago?  If one was cynical, which, of course, I am not, one would say a directive must have come from on high to officials to reduce costs.  It is the only possible explanation I can think of, but not being cynical, I will not say so.<\/p><p>  One of the Minister's first acts on taking office was to get the Department to write to thousands of parents of children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance to ask them to justify why their child should still be entitled to receive the allowance.  A number of the people concerned came to see me and I contacted the Department to ask what proof or evidence it wanted to receive.  I was told the family doctor should certify it and that if people wanted to submit further evidence, so be it.  What has happened in approximately 65% of cases in the country as a whole - I could instance a number of cases I have sent to the Minister - is that the family doctor has so certified and that people have also obtained reports from speech therapists, physical therapists and consultants to certify that not only is a particular child still entitled to receive the allowance but also that it is needed now more than ever.  However, a faceless bureaucrat in the Department has written back to state they are being cut off.  This is without interfacing with the child, meeting the family or knowing the circumstances involved.  Somebody in the Department just ticks a box - I believe it is called a desktop review - and cuts off the allowance to a child.  This is tantamount to the Department writing to the parents of a child suffering from a serious mental or physical disability, stating it notes what the experts and the family doctor have stated about the child needing the allowance now more than ever and that it believes the parents but that it has good news because, hey presto, it deems the child to be cured.<\/p><p>  I am very glad civilisation has evolved in the past 2,000 years.  We are now in the lead-up to Christmas and all remember the biblical tales of cripples who walked, deaf people who could suddenly hear and blind people who could suddenly see after the laying on of hands.  As we have now evolved, one no longer needs to lay on hands or even needs to meet the child, as all one has to do is tick a box at a desk in the Department and state the child has been cured.  This is a shabby, sordid, sneaky attack on some of the most vulnerable in the country and it is ironic it is happening under the aegis of a Minister of the Labour Party.  I remember a time in this House when I was trying to introduce legislation for people with disabilities and subjected to a most horrendous campaign outside Leinster House driven, conceived and led by the Labour Party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400044#RR00100","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1354651200,"counter":563,"content":"<p>The Deputy has some neck coming out with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400044#RR00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1354651200,"counter":564,"content":"<p>It convinced people that what people with disabilities were entitled to were absolute rights, regardless of the state of the finances of the country, something that did not apply in any other country and which by definition could not apply in any other country.

I tell Deputy Dominic Hannigan and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, it is a long way from seeking absolute rights, regardless of the state of the finances of the country, to slashing and cutting the inadequate provision made.

We are all aware of the serious difficulties faced by such persons.  I have a vested interest in this issue as I have a daughter who suffers from spina bifida and is confined to a wheelchair.  Because of this and also through the Irish Wheelchair Association, the spina bifida associations and many others in my area, I am very much aware of the difficulties faced.<\/p><p>  In the 1950s and 1960s the late Fr. Scallon who was a pioneer in looking after people with disabilities established the County Wexford Community Workshop, St. Aidan's Day Care Centre and St. Patrick's Special School in Enniscorthy and managed to find solutions to many of the problems faced by people with disabilities.  One can imagine what the difficulties were at the time, even in obtaining public recognition that people with disabilities should have a life, be living in the community, receive an education and be able to attend primary and secondary school.  Fr. Scallon broke down all of the barriers in Enniscorthy and throughout County Wexford.  We still have community workshops in Enniscorthy which 300 people attend on a daily basis to be trained, upskilled and facilitated, rather than sitting at home day in and day out with their parents.  They all tell me the same thing as was outlined by Deputies Billy Kelleher and Willie O'Dea, that they are put to the pin of their collar to provide services for people with disabilities.  Cutbacks were made last year and further cutbacks are threatened this year.  As a result, they will find it very difficult to provide services and I expect that many of the organisations will not be able to take in new applicants to be trained or upskilled.<\/p><p>  People with disabilities face many roadblocks in life.  They find it very difficult to access many of the services they require from the HSE and we are discussing the HSE making further cuts next year.  Most of those looking after young people with disabilities have already been notified to expect cutbacks in 2013, which will make it very difficult for services to be provided.  Last week the Disability Rights Coalition held a demonstration outside Leinster House.  It is anxious for the Government to implement the commitments in the programme for Government.  Many reports have been published, but people with disabilities and their families have not seen the impact of the changed agenda promised by the coalition Government.  They continue to believe they have no voice or control over the services they receive and they receive no information on how public moneys are spent on these services.  As the parent of a person with a disability, I attend many meetings of these organisations.  People with disabilities and their parents have seldom been consulted on what is best for them.<\/p><p>Any decision-making of the future should include in particular the parents who are very much aware of the difficulties and the decisions that need to be made and what is best for those with disabilities.  A one-size-fits-all approach certainly does not suit.  There are persons with mild disabilities and persons with profound disabilities.  Some are able to go to the ordinary primary and second school, and some are not.  It is important that the families of children with disabilities would be listened to and given a voice.<\/p><p> Before the last election both the T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, and the Taoiseach stated clearly that those with disabilities would be a priority for this Government.  The HSE service plan for 2012, on which Oireachtas Members in the south east are briefed regularly, is not living up to the ambitions of the Taoiseach and T\u00e1naiste prior to the last election.  Even on Friday last, I was at a meeting with the HSE service management of the south east where they were telling us there would be major difficulties in home help and help for persons with disabilities in 2013 because of the reduction of the budget in all of these areas.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Dea touched on the domiciliary care allowance.  It is practically impossible to get domiciliary care allowance under this Government and many have had their domiciliary care allowance withdrawn.  In many cases, the domiciliary care allowance is the difference in providing a reasonable standard of living for families looking after children with disabilities.  It is important that the review of domiciliary care allowance would be reviewed to ensure that those entitled to the allowance would get it.<\/p><p> The Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party stated prior to the election that they would provide certain job opportunities for persons with disabilities.  I have a criticism to make of local authorities and public bodies generally.  They talk about the 3% commitment but from my experience and from speaking to parents of persons with disabilities I can tell the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, that the 3% commitment is being met up nowhere in the country.  It is important that the Minister of State would speak to the county managers, the town clerks and the public service to see what can be done to encourage them to take on persons with disabilities.  Some of those with disabilities who I know are highly intelligent.  They are highly educated to second and third level, and yet they are at home without a job or an opportunity.  Many of them tell me they are getting \u20ac188 and that for a little extra, a substantially smaller sum than would be expected, they would be only too glad to go into the work environment, particularly in local authorities and the public sector.<\/p><p> The number of job opportunities for persons with disabilities is alarming.  If I ask a company to give \u20ac5,000 or \u20ac10,000 to the spina bifida association or any other association, more often than not it will give the money but if one asks it to employ a person with a disability one will be refused.  It is important that we would encourage employers, both private and public, to take on persons with disabilities.  They are highly skilled, highly talented and well able to work and they have a role to play in the Ireland of the future. It is important that would happen.<\/p><p> Deputy Kelleher's motion is important.  The areas of respite care, special needs teachers, opportunities for persons with disabilities to get what is their right, and to have a say in what is their right, are important.  The Government has failed to live up to the promises of the Taoiseach and T\u00e1naiste before the last election.  It is important that there be no further cutbacks.  Rather, there should be an increase in the budget tomorrow for persons with disabilities.  I am sure the Minister of State has fought at the table for that.  It is no more than they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400044#RR00600","speaker":"1096","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354651800,"counter":569,"content":"<p>This is a major topic in need of very serious consideration and detailed changes.<\/p><p>  The first issue we must confront is that every year, as the hospitals overspend in the health budget, funding is withdrawn, not only from the hospitals to try deal with the overspend but from primary care.  When one looks at primary care, all of the permanent staff have salaries, yet the Government moves on the easy touches such as respite care, home care packages and home help.  I believe that one structural change we need now is that from 1 January, no funding given to primary care can be removed to shore up overspends in the hospitals.  It is a simple structural change but it would avoid the constant shifting of funding by the HSE from the primary care front-line services to the hospital services.<\/p><p>  The second matter I want to deal with is work that I was doing as Minister for Social Protection.  I brought in the partial capacity provisions under invalidity pensions and for the first time, we were grading or separating those with a very severe disability, those with a moderate disability and those with a mild disability.  The idea was that those on invalidity pension could go back into the workforce and, depending on the level of disability, they could retain part or all of the payment.   The Minister has developed the regulation but I do not see any push to implement it on the ground.  That was meant to be the first step in trying to look at what we can do to help those with particularly severe disabilities or moderate disabilities.<\/p><p>  There had been talk for a long time about the cost of disability allowance.  Given the numbers who are in receipt of social welfare disability payments between invalidity pension and disability allowance, the payment of such an allowance across the board has significant cost implications.  It also, at the margins, has implications of migration.  However, if one follows what the Department was developing and what it advised me could be done, and one separates and grades it in the way that we were doing so for the partial capacity scheme, then it would be possible to ensure there would be a disability payment or whatever one would like to call it that would be graded according to the level of disability.<\/p><p>  On the Order Paper today there is a large Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Social Protection.  It understates the position because whether by accident or design, the Department of Social Protection takes inordinate amounts of time to process simple forms.  It takes a year to process an application for carer's allowance, and that is unacceptable.  It could not take that long to check the income details and the medicals.  In some cases, the medicals are so obvious there is no checking to be done on them.  The only logical explanation is that this is a handy way of kicking the can down the road in terms of payments, and this is unacceptable.  There was somebody in contact with my office in the past two days about a person who was going caring for a person with a terminal illness and it was put bluntly by the family to me that the person will be dead before a decision is made on the carer's allowance application.  That is unacceptable.<\/p><p>  It is important that we look at the effect of possible cuts on the disability service.  I was given details by the Brothers of Charity in Galway of the services they provide and the effect of a possible cut in the funding provided to them.<\/p><p>At the moment, they provide services for 943 people, comprising 428 children and 515 adults.  That does not include the 386 children in the Galway early intervention service provided in partnership with the HSE and Enable Ireland.  They have had budget cuts of \u20ac8.3 million or 18% in the last four years, which totally ignore pay cuts and the pension levy.  Therefore these are extra cuts outside the pay cuts because they are paid as public servants.<\/p><p> They have done everything to achieve efficiencies, including restructuring and reducing management and administration posts.  Staff posts have been reduced by 98.  They have also restructured rosters and have achieved savings of approximately \u20ac1 million on the skill mix.  Their back office support, i.e. human resources, finance, IT and quality, is about 2.61% of budget.  The Minister of State can look at her own Department to check how much that back office costs.  In my view, 2.61% of the budget is very efficient. <\/p><p> Some 85% of the budget is pay, while 91% of the jobs are exclusively front line.  If there is a 5% cut it will require the closure of 24 residential places, which would mean a discharge of 24 people, making them homeless.  It would mean the closure of 34 day places and, consequently, individuals would have to remain in residential services at an even greater cost.  It would mean the loss of 506 respite beds and the loss of 4,939 family support hours.<\/p><p> One would have to let 52 staff go but since these are covered by the Croke Park agreement there is no mechanism for doing it, even if the Minister of State wanted to cause all this devastation.  They have been benchmarked against a value for money report and the average costs have already been achieved in full.  Some 85% of the budget is pay and therefore there are no savings.<\/p><p> There has been a lot of loose talk about extra efficiencies and that they will somehow survive.  It is important to understand that whatever savings were there to be made by efficiencies have been made in recent years.  Possible savings in shared services which I am very keen on, including amalgamations, would be totally inadequate, slow to implement and insignificant.  I have a lot of data from the Department on how little money is being saved from all this quangoitis they told us they would get rid of.<\/p><p> There cannot and must not be any cuts to disability services this year.  The easy answer we will get is whether we cut money, and yes we did, but there comes a point when there is no more to cut.  There comes a point when an organisation does not have any more to give because it has cut everything that could be cut.  Therefore this year it is vital that there is no further reduction to organisations like that.<\/p><p> If the Minister of State goes around the country to other similar organisations dealing with people with moderate or severe disabilities, she will find that story repeated everywhere.  This year, no money was provided for school leavers and parents are wondering what will happen to next year's school leavers.  That was always looked after until 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400045#SS00200","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354652400,"counter":571,"content":"<p>Until 2008.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400046#TT00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1354652400,"counter":572,"content":"<p>We have a decision to make about values.

We are asking the Government to stick to the pledges it made in the programme for Government to protect disability funding and ensure that those who most require such support are provided with it.  I remind the Minister of State that the programme for Government is committed to ensuring that the quality of life of people with disabilities is enhanced and that the resources allocated reach those who need them.  The programme is also committed to facilitating people with disabilities in order to achieve a greater level of participation in employment, training and education.  Unfortunately, however, in the 18 months since taking office we have not seen the Minister of State live up to those commitments.<\/p><p>  While we know it is a difficult task in the current environment and these things are not easily done, we are asking the Minister of State to stand by that pledge in the programme for Government to ensure that funding for the disabled is not cut and that they will be supported as necessary.  We have put together our own pre-budget submission which does ensure such funding.  We accept the fact that there needs to be a \u20ac3.5 billion adjustment in the national spend this year, but we have ring-fenced a few important key areas which we feel need to be protected.  They are education, mental health services and disability services, which is the subject of our Private Members' motion.  We have taken hard decisions elsewhere in the budget in order to achieve the required targets.  I do not underestimate the difficulty in putting a budget together but we are asking the Government to ensure that this happens in tomorrow's budget.  We should not see the same mistakes being repeated that we have seen recently.<\/p><p>  Over the last 12 months many people with disabilities have been concerned about cuts.  They have had reason to worry.  In last year's budget the Minister attempted to remove the disability allowance from those aged 16 to 18.  Fortunately, due to pressure from many Deputies, including many in the Labour Party, that decision was rolled back on.  It was not consistent with what had been promised in the programme for Government.<\/p><p>  It has become increasingly difficult for the families of those aged under 18 to get the domiciliary care allowance.  In the first six months of this year, 63% of all applications for the domiciliary care allowance have been refused.  Up to half of applications for children with autism have been refused.  Such families have additional strenuous care needs, which are required for their children.  In many instances, it makes it more difficult for them to work and carry out everyday duties.  The domiciliary care allowance is there to assist them with the support their children need.  Unfortunately, the Government has adopted an approach of stealth, making it more difficult for those in need of the payment to receive it.<\/p><p>  The position of people leaving secondary education and seeking to continue in further education demonstrates a failure to deliver on promises in the programme for Government. <\/p><p>I refer to the position that obtained at the end of last year, where of the 700 people who were continuing on to further education, 57 young adults had not secured places by the end of August.  These young adults were left in a position in which they had no security regarding what would be their next step.  These are young adults who depend on Members at State level to ensure places are available and who will find themselves in similar positions in the future, unless Members can ensure the necessary hard steps are taken to ring-fence the funding and resources required to cater for their needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400046#TT00400","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354653000,"counter":575,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400047#UU00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1354653000,"counter":576,"content":"<p>Finally, I commend the motion to Members.

I welcome the opportunity to put on the record of the House the efforts that are being made to provide effective, accessible and responsive health and personal social services for people with disabilities.  At the outset, I note that Members in government share the concerns of Members opposite and of the concerned parents, individuals, relatives and friends of people with disabilities who are present tonight and throughout the country.  I strongly reaffirm the Government's commitment to the national disability strategy and to doing all that it possibly can to give persons with disabilities the services and support they need.<\/p><p>  I will begin by addressing the national disability strategy and other current developments.  The growing recognition by society of the right of people with disabilities to participate in and contribute to social and economic life has underpinned the development of services in recent years.  In line with the commitment in the programme for Government to publish, following wide consultation, a realistic implementation plan for the national disability strategy, I have established and am personally chairing a new national disability strategy implementation group.  This group includes representatives from across the Government, as well as the County and City Managers Association.  In this context, I take on board Deputy Browne's point on where people with disabilities live and on what has the greatest impact on their lives.  I believe local authorities do so, which is the reason the County and City Managers Association now has a representative on the national disability strategy steering group.  It also includes representatives from the National Disability Authority, a broad range of disability organisations and a number of individuals appointed in their personal capacity to bring their lived experience to the table.  I was astonished to find that until I was appointed Minister of State, the group did not include people with disabilities to speak for themselves.  I also convened a disability forum, under the stewardship of the National Disability Authority, to ensure the voices of people with disabilities, as well as their needs and concerns, are being heard.  In addition, a number of significant developments are ongoing, which touch on all aspects of services and supports for people with disabilities.  These include strategies for transferring people with disabilities from congregated residential settings into the community, putting in place a system of registration and inspection of residential centres, reconfiguring day services and supports, implementing the recommendations in the national policy and strategy for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services, reconfiguring autism services and services for children with complex disabilities and, of course, implementing the recently published value for money policy review of specialist disability services.<\/p><p>  At a time when the Government is trying to achieve more with less funding, changing attitudes and leading by example often can be achieved without any additional funding.  Some of the best practice on disability in both the public and private sectors has been as a result of a positive attitude, particularly if it comes from senior management.  I see examples of this nationwide every week.  The terms of reference of the national disability strategy implementation group include promoting positive attitudes towards people with disabilities and I will work with this group to develop an effective, measurable plan of action to achieve this.<\/p><p>  The HSE's national service plan for 2012, drawn up against the backdrop of significant funding challenges, was designed to reflect the changing priorities of the new Government and the significant programme of reform being undertaken.  The allocation for disability services has been reduced by 3.7% this year.  However, the level of service reduction has been less than the level of budget reduction as a result of efficiencies that have been delivered.  Again, this is very much down to the service providers.  While the aforementioned service providers have achieved some efficiency savings, reductions in services also have been unavoidable in day services and in residential and respite services.  The necessary reduction in 2012 unfortunately mirrors that applied across all areas of the health sector.  However, it is timely for me to remind Members of the highly significant levels of service provided for people with disabilities through the substantial investment of \u20ac1.4 billion by the Health Service Executive in 2012.  I note this is just part of what is spent on disability.  Without deviating from the script, I continually make the point that were all the money spent on disability concentrated in a single pot, there would be better outcomes.<\/p><p>  At present, more than 9,100 people receive care in residential places, most of whom are living in homes within their communities.  Moreover, 6,300 people are receiving respite residential support, 18,600 people are attending day services and 1.64 million personal assistant and home support hours are being provided.  Overall, the national intellectual disability database annual report for 2011 states that 26,831 people with intellectual disability were in receipt of services, representing 98% of the total population registered on this database and the highest number of people in receipt of services since the database was established.<\/p><p>  A major issue for the Government is to ensure it gets the best outcome for people with disabilities from the resources it puts into the health sector.  I published the report of the value for money and policy review on disability services on 20 July last.  The objective of the review was to assess how well current health and personal social services for people with disabilities meet their objectives and to recommend how these services should be delivered in the future.  Many of the most fundamental changes needed to support the full participation of people with disabilities in society will be achieved through the implementation of this review.  From the outset, public consultation was an important feature of the review.  The review team listened carefully to what people had to say, as well as to the advice of the expert reference group on disability policy and the thoroughly researched advice provided by the National Disability Authority.  As a result, the review recommends a significant restructuring of the disability services programme through migration from an approach which is predominantly organised around group-based service delivery towards a model of person-centred, individually chosen, supports and implementation of a more effective method of assessing need, allocating resources and monitoring resource use.  This will represent a seismic change in how services are funded and provided and will result in shifting choice and control from professionals and administrators to where it rightfully belongs, namely, with the individual with a disability or his or her family.  Work is now under way to put the necessary implementation plan in place to move forward the recommendations of the review in 2013.<\/p><p>  Even before the drawing up of the value for money review, major changes have been under way for disability services in recent years.  There has been a definitive move from an institutional and segregated model of service delivery towards a community-based and inclusive approach that aims to support people with disabilities in community-based living with maximum independence and choice.  A number of ongoing policy initiatives support this commitment.  For example, in July, I jointly launched with the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, the national implementation framework to support the Government's National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011-2016.  The development of the implementation framework underlines the successful collaborative approach involving my Department, the HSE and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in addressing the housing and related support needs of people with disabilities.<\/p><p>  While the Government continues to support people in institutional and other residential settings, the issue of standards and appropriate services arise.<\/p><p>I am pleased to say that progress has been made by HIQA on finalising draft standards during 2012.  The most recent draft was subject to a five week consultation process which ended on 21 November.  I expect to receive the final version of the standards document in the coming weeks and a likely launch date is envisaged in January 2013.  Work is also under way on the regulations required to bring the standards into law and further discussions are taking place now on the resources and staffing required by HIQA from 2013, with a view to having the new regulatory system up and running by mid-2013.<\/p><p> The Government is fully committed to facilitating people with disabilities in achieving a greater level of participation in employment, training and education.  In the area of special educational needs, the protection of front-line services for pupils is a priority.  Approximately 15% of the entire budget of the Department of Education and Skills - some \u20ac1.3 billion - was spent in support of children with special educational needs in 2011 and on training initiatives which I will also outline.<\/p><p> In line with the Government's commitment to front-line services for pupils with special educational needs, the current overall level of funding for special education has been retained at last year's level.  Services being provided from the education budget to support the care needs of pupils with special needs, including children with disabilities, include 10,575 whole-time equivalent special needs assistant posts in primary, post-primary and special schools; approximately 9,950 learning support and resource teacher posts to provide additional teaching supports; more than 1,100 teachers in specialist schools at much reduced pupil-teacher ratios; and early educational intervention for children with autism from 2.5 years.<\/p><p> The Department of Education and Skills now funds 76 early intervention classes for children with autism attached to mainstream schools, as well as the home tuition programme for children with autism who are unable to access placement in an early intervention class.  Funding is also provided for school building adaptations, special school transport arrangements and enhanced capitation rates which are payable to most special schools and special classes.  This funding underlines the Government's commitment to special education provision for children with special educational needs, including children with disabilities.  In addition, the education sector is working very closely with the health sector on the HSE's national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people, which was the issue at hand last Saturday.<\/p><p> In the health sector, the needs of school leavers have also been met this year.  Under the auspices of its national consultative forum, and with the co-operation of many agencies, the HSE has worked hard to accommodate the demand for school-leaver and rehabilitative training places, managing to find almost 670 places in 2012.  I wish to thank the HSE disability service and service providers for achieving this without any additional funding.  Contrary to Deputy Martin's comments, I have at no stage boasted about this.  The effort came through very hard work and the people in question must receive thanks for it.<\/p><p> In the area of training needs, the aim is to facilitate people with disabilities in achieving a greater level of participation in employment and training.  Along with the option of F\u00c1S mainstream training, training places are also provided specifically for persons with disabilities through specialist training providers.  In 2012, F\u00c1S will provide the same volume of training places allocated to these providers as in 2011.  The total F\u00c1S budget for specialist training provision in 2012, including training allowances, is \u20ac53.7 million, representing 12% of the overall F\u00c1S budget of \u20ac453 million.<\/p><p> Meeting training needs is only part of the journey that people with disabilities and special needs generally must face in order to obtain longer-term sustainable employment.  In the area of disability activation, the Government is committed to supporting people to participate more fully in training and employment in view of the particular challenges faced by people with disabilities.  The integration of the employment services and community services divisions of F\u00c1S into the Department of Social Protection is enhancing the delivery of employment services for all people, including people with disabilities, and will assist in overcoming some barriers in this area.  The Department of Social Protection provides an extensive range of income and work-related supports for people with disabilities and employers to facilitate greater participation in employment by people with disabilities.<\/p><p> The recently launched disability activation project, which aims to identify the optimum approaches to mainstreaming labour market activation measures for people with disabilities, is an important first step in this regard.  Funding of just over \u20ac7 million has been allocated for 14 projects in the Border, midlands and west region to run until April 2015 which are aimed at providing practical insight into how best to engage with people with disabilities and increase their employment prospects.  The four strands of the disability activation project include improving access to employment; progression for young people with disability; progression for people with an acquired disability; and innovative engagement with employers.<\/p><p> A number of programmes formerly operated by F\u00c1S are now operated by the Department of Social Protection, including the Employ Ability service, which was formerly the supported employment programme; the wage subsidy scheme; the disability support and awareness grants and schemes; and community employment.  The Department also operates a number of other income and employment support schemes, including the partial capacity benefit payment scheme mentioned by Deputy \u00d3 Cu\u00edv, the back-to-education allowance and the disability allowance income disregard.  The Department of Social Protection is committed to supporting people with disability to participate more fully in society and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers that they may face.<\/p><p> I welcome the opportunity provided by this debate to put on the record the Government's position on the numerous and wide-ranging issues raised in the motion before the House.  This is a time of change for the health sector as a whole and not just for people with disabilities.  Although the changes we have signposted in the value for money and policy review are challenging in the current economic circumstances, they contribute towards the Government's overall vision for a more integrated health service, which can only be to the benefit of each and every citizen of this country, with or without a disability.  During this time of change, the Government acknowledges that there will be significant demand for new services and a continuing requirement to make existing services more efficient.  The Government is committed to working collaboratively to realise the vision of a more inclusive society for all, where services and supports will be tailored to meet the needs of the individual citizen while at the same time being provided in an accountable and cost-effective manner.<\/p><p> The Bills that will be dealt with shortly, taking in mental capacity and assisted decision making, will have a serious and positive effect not just on all of us but on people with disability.  We will be legally obliged to listen to what such people have to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400047#UU00400","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354653600,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I understand the Minister of State is sharing time with Deputies Nolan, Connaughton and Conway.

We often speak as politicians in what can be a glib way about the most vulnerable people in society, and every group can in some way lay claim to that title.  Boiling it to the core, the people who are the most vulnerable in society are those with disabilities and particularly those with profound and severe disabilities.  In my own experience in national politics, which extends to a short two years, this is the group with which I have had the most serious engagement.  I have also experienced the steepest learning curve in this role.<\/p><p>  I can think of the members of two families I have met.  One family has a son in his mid- to late 30s who will always be in residential care.  His parents are in their mid- to late 60s and as they are getting older, interaction with their son is becoming more difficult, as they are less able to handle a grown man because they are becoming more frail.  Another family has a son who just turned 18 and is in a wheelchair and severely disabled.  He will never live a life that we as able-bodied people will but the love and devotion of the family to the son is just as strong as it would be for any other child in a family.<\/p><p>  I will speak about the service provider in my constituency, the Brothers of Charity Services and Ability West, which provide great and immense care to some of the most vulnerable citizens of Galway city and county.<\/p><p>The Brothers of Charity has a staff of 1,000 who do their utmost to serve the highly vulnerable people who avail of the organisation's services.  They have dramatically changed their service model in recent years and I commend them on reducing back office staff and restructuring to deliver a more efficient and dedicated service.  No one can deny the need to dispense with the institutional model for providing services to people with disabilities.  However, making the transition to a new model will require additional resources if it is to be completed properly.<\/p><p> I thank the Minister of State for coming to Galway to meet those involved in the Brothers of Charity services.  She was generous with her time, going through the organisation's budget, strategy and management systems and discussing individual cases.  We must always remember that disability services are provided to individuals.  I observed the immense joy felt by the parents of eight children in Galway who were informed that places would be available for them.  The Minister of State was in weekly contact with the relevant officials to ensure these places became available.<\/p><p> Delivering the national disability strategy will be the next significant plank for transforming the system.  The Minister of State's decision to chair the implementation group on the national disability strategy demonstrates the political commitment and importance she attaches to the issue.  I have heard her speak about the necessity for a strategy to drive disability services.  Other services and areas of Government have strategies, whereas the area of disability has lacked a strategy and suffered as a result.<\/p><p> Service providers are engaged in change but it must be radical and profound and everyone in the system will have to buy into it.  We cannot continue to fund the system in its current form, where one has several service providers, all with head office functions, competing with one another in one city.  Integration is needed, as is a shift towards a new funding model under which the service user is given the freedom to choose what he or she wants.<\/p><p> In all of the contributions I have heard the Minister of State make on the two areas of her portfolio in which I have an interest, namely, older people and disability, I have not heard her use the term &quot;people with disabilities&quot; or &quot;older people&quot;.  Instead, she refers to individuals and what they want or need to lead their lives.  She recognises that service users are part of family structures in which their relatives provide care and support.  It is vital that when discussing vulnerable persons we do not forget that they are individuals with their own concerns, wants and desires.  I am always delighted to hear the Minister of State speak in this manner and commend her on doing so.  I am pleased she is in her current portfolio because she is a woman of determination and tenacity with an intolerance of inflexibility.  These qualities will be needed if, rather than tweak services, we fundamentally change the way in which they are delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400048#VV00300","speaker":"1045","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354654200,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the motion.  It is important, even on the eve of what will be one of the most difficult budgets in the nation's history, to reiterate our commitment to protecting the most vulnerable in society, namely, those with intellectual and physical disabilities.<\/p><p>  The debate over who made the mistakes that led to the financial crash of recent years will continue for years or decades.  However, one group that will not figure when blame is being apportioned is people with disabilities.  They did not over-indulge, borrow excessively or engage in reckless lending and for this reason they should not bear the brunt of cuts.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has conceded that the next two years will be particularly difficult in terms of the health budget and that expenditure on services for people with a disability, which cost in the region of \u20ac1.4 billion this year, will face difficulties.  Notwithstanding this, expenditure on areas such as residential care, respite care and placements for school leavers must remain a top priority in 2013.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State is committed to the implementation of the national disability strategy and chairs the new implementation group for the strategy.  She has included in this group a number of individuals who will be able to bring to the table their experience of living with a disability.  The implementation group will also take on board the views of the disability forum, which met for the first time in June.<\/p><p>  I note that 15% of the budget of the Department of Education and Skills is spent in support of children with special educational needs, including on the employment of 10,575 whole-time equivalent special needs assistants in primary, post-primary and special schools.  We must not overlook the invaluable role special needs assistants play in our education system in ensuring children with special needs are educated among their peers in a local setting.<\/p><p>  Understanding of the need for early intervention in respect of autism is growing internationally.  It is heartening that there are now 76 early intervention classes for children with autism attached to mainstream schools.  Under the home tuition programme, funding is also provided for children with autism who are unable to access placement in such classes.  Such early intervention is crucial as it often addresses behavioural difficulties and allows children to attend their local national school.  Without such early intervention, more supports would be needed for such children in school and valuable learning time, which cannot be replaced, would be lost.<\/p><p>  The need for proper services for adults with disabilities is another crucial issue.  In recent months, members of Ballinasloe Advocates group have been to the fore in highlighting the need to retain and strengthen adult services for people with disabilities.  Deputy Nolan and I have observed at first hand the tremendous work being done across the west by organisations such as Ability West and the Brothers of Charity.  In recent years, these organisations, through the help and goodwill of members of the local community, have steadily built up the services on offer and their hard work must not be negated by a shortfall in funding in the coming years.<\/p><p>  Family members of persons with a disability will stress the need for respite hours to be retained at all costs.  These hours are often the difference between a person with a disability being able to live at home or moving to a community setting.  In many cases, parents who are becoming increasingly frail are able to cope with living with the extra demands of an adult child with a disability because of the support provided through respite care.  Reducing respite care hours would result in a major increase in the number of applications for housing in a community setting.<\/p><p>  I note the Minister plans to move into the community next year 150 of the 3,600 persons with disabilities who are living in an institution.  While progress is slow, it must be acknowledged that the provision of housing is difficult in the current climate.  The element of the national housing strategy aimed at people with a disability will come under much more pressure if the current level of respite care is not retained.<\/p><p>  Organisations and staff working with people with disabilities have done a tremendous job.  Alongside people with disabilities and their families, they have provided a strong voice in advocating for those with disabilities.  It is imperative that we continue to hear these voices and direct the money available towards ensuring vital services are retained throughout the country.  We must ensure that people with disabilities are not punished for the sins of others.  The only real way of measuring justice in any society is to examine how society treats its most vulnerable citizens.  While we all acknowledge that further cuts must be faced in the years ahead, we must shield disabled people from such measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400049#WW00200","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1354654200,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.

Service users, their families and the providers of services welcome this approach as it has been absent from the formulation and implementation of social policy through the decades.  Pleas by advocates to adopt anti-discriminatory practice have fallen on deaf ears over the years.  For this reason, we should not underestimate the commitment the Minister of State has shown in this area.  While we all know that stark and difficult budgetary decisions lie ahead, we must commend the inclusive and anti-discriminatory practice at the forefront of the Minister of State's approach to disability.  It is not lost on those who work in disability services or the families and individuals who avail of them.<\/p><p> As the Minister of State mentioned, we need a realistic implementation plan for the national disability strategy.  Strategy and policy documents have laid on shelves gathering dust for years.  This is to no one's benefit.  Other Deputies will agree that the Minister of State's approach - she is chairing the group - is to be broadly welcomed.<\/p><p> The HSE's core underlying deficits are disturbing.  I sit on the health committee and have seen the black hole in terms of health.  It is a difficult situation.  I have often spoken at that committee and with parliamentary colleagues about the need for an accounting process that would allow the disability budget to be disaggregated from the quagmire of other health spending.  The Minister of State made reference to this.  This type of reform is boring and technical and has to do with accounting, software, computers and all of the kind of material about which no newspaper likes to write.  However, this is the type of reform of our health services that we need if we are to ensure that money is spent where it is required.<\/p><p> This issue is not aligned with disability services alone.  It is equally aligned with mental health, primary care and acute hospital services.  We cannot continue to throw good money after bad.  Until we see this approach to managing money within the HSE, change will be difficult.<\/p><p> I will reference my experience in my constituency.  The Brothers of Charity are active in Waterford city and county.  Other Deputies have mentioned them.  The Brothers of Charity realise that they cannot continue to practice as they have been doing.  Carriglea Cairde Services in Dungarvan has been to the fore in removing people with learning and physical disabilities from institutions and into their communities.  This is the type of approach to which the Minister of State and the Government are committed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400049#WW00500","speaker":"1093","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354654800,"counter":587,"content":"<p>One must hand it to Fianna F\u00e1il.

All of this meant that Fianna F\u00e1il cut the income of disabled people and their carers by 10% over two budgets.  A brass neck indeed.  It is no wonder that Fianna F\u00e1il's spokesperson on social protection and Minister in that Government, Deputy O'Dea, was heckled and booed by disability rights campaigners who were protesting outside the D\u00e1il a few weeks ago.<\/p><p>  That Fianna F\u00e1il Government also cruelly slashed funding to voluntary organisations working with the disabled as well as front-line services to the disabled across the State.  We witnessed savage cuts to the number of special needs assistants, SNAs, resulting in children with disabilities staying outside of mainstream schools.  Was it not the Fianna F\u00e1il Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who told primary school teachers that resource teachers for children with learning disabilities would be withdrawn if they had less than nine children in each of their schools?  That was in 2009, when the then Fine Gael education spokesperson, Deputy Brian Hayes, issued a statement calling it an &quot;attack&quot; on children with learning disabilities.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was the then Labour spokesperson on disability and called for services for children with intellectual disabilities to be protected.  It is remarkable how Fine Gael and Labour have changed their views on all of these matters in their alliance for austerity.<\/p><p>  The motion &quot;recognises&quot; that there are more than 600,000 people with disabilities in the State and &quot;recognises&quot; their concern regarding cuts to services.  It merely &quot;notes&quot; the pledges in the programme for Government and calls on the Government to provide the appropriate funding and services to honour &quot;all&quot; commitments to people with disabilities.  It is not unreasonable to ask what Fianna F\u00e1il mean by &quot;all&quot; in this motion.  Does it include that party's own commitments to people with disabilities that it failed to uphold in spectacular fashion?<\/p><p>  As Members of this House, we must ensure that a threshold of decency on disability supports is developed.  There must be a political consensus that people with disabilities will have their dignity and rights maintained and their families will not be abandoned as a result of ongoing cutbacks.<\/p><p>  Recently, we have seen images of citizens with profound disabilities who protested outside Leinster House at the cuts introduced by the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  They struck a powerful chord with the Irish people.  The courage and dignity of those who braved the elements to make their stand shone a light on the reality that, despite the promises of the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste in the final pre\u00adelection leaders' debate last year, their Government has proceeded to enforce cut after cut on those with disabilities, their families and their carers.<\/p><p>  Their broken promises on disabilities are the cruellest of all.  If this Government took a Kango hammer and tore up our roads, there would be uproar, but that is exactly what it has been doing to support services for people with disabilities.  Nine leading disability organisations spoke out on this scandal, yet the Government has still done nothing.  We should make no mistake about this.  Given Fianna F\u00e1il's record in this area, it would not be acting any differently were it still in government.<\/p><p>  The disability organisations have outlined a vision for people with disabilities and called on the Government to take urgent action on three key areas.  First, halt reductions in the basic standard of living of people with disabilities requiring welfare supports.  People with disabilities are most likely to experience real poverty because, on top of the recent cuts in benefit levels and new charges, they must also continue to pay for extras required due to their disabilities.  They are among some of the most vulnerable groups that will lay awake tonight in fear at what fresh hell tomorrow's budget will bring.<\/p><p>  Second, funding must be guaranteed to the services needed by people with disabilities.  Cutting the services required by people with disabilities not only undermines their lives, but also leads to a growing public expenditure in terms of hospital stays and expensive care costs.  It does not make economic, let alone ethical, sense to cut their services.<\/p><p>  Third, it is a matter of urgency that the Government publish an ambitious implementation plan for the national disability strategy in keeping with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities so that people can have dignity, individual autonomy and full and effective participation in Irish society.<\/p><p>  People's faith in Ireland's eventual recovery depends not just on economic measures.  Social protection for all people through this long, stressful period needs to be central to the Government's recovery plans.  Government actions must address social inclusion and cohesion.  Recent Government cuts have heightened these concerns in the run up to the budget.  Sinn F\u00e9in fully endorses the people's call and we call on the Government to take up this challenge and honour its promises to our most vulnerable citizens.<\/p><p>  Last year, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, announced proposals to stop disability payments to new claimants between aged 16 and 18 years.  That measure was halted after people took to the streets.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, let the Minister for Social Protection take the fall, famously describing how they would &quot;revisit&quot; the matter.  We must wait and see what will be &quot;revisited&quot; in the coming months.<\/p><p>  As far as this motion is concerned, I welcome Fianna F\u00e1il's Pauline conversion to the fight for disability rights.  We can legitimately question the motivations behind it, but we support the right to full equality for people with disabilities.<\/p><p>  The previous Government cut the income of people with disabilities and their carers by 10% across two budgets.  The impact is still being felt.  The people in question are some of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in the State.  Community employment schemes, social welfare and so on impact on them.  We need to put action behind the rhetoric.  It is time for a threshold of decency on this issue.<\/p><p>I repeat my call to all parties, despite their previous and ongoing record, to examine the issue.  What citizen, on being informed by elected Members that we would make an all-party, all-grouping consensus that no matter what happens we would not make further cuts to disabled people, their carers and families but we would maintain a threshold of decency, would disagree with the proposal?  The issue is how we get to that stage.  There has been a shameful history of failure to meet our obligations to citizens with disabilities in recent years.  Perhaps we could start to reverse that, treat them as equal partners and give them their rights once and for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400050#XX01300","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354655400,"counter":600,"content":"<p>As Deputy McLellan was not present, I did not include her previously.

That amounts to 18.5% of the population.  In numerical terms that constitutes a significant section of Irish society.  However, in spite of that, successive Governments have paid only scant attention to the needs and rights of disabled adults and children.  The end result is that people with a disability are more likely to be living in poverty, to be unemployed and to be dependent on State benefits.  They are also more likely to be highly reliant on public services especially for health, housing and public transport.  All in all, people with a disability are more likely to be excluded from Irish society, or at risk of such exclusion.<\/p><p>  However, to suggest that such a situation came about through mere indifference is to ignore the impact of policies enacted by successive Governments on the lives of disabled people.  Therefore, with this important caveat to the forefront of the current discussion, Sinn F\u00e9in supports this Private Members' business, but it does so reluctantly.  I say that because Sinn F\u00e9in is of the view that people with a disability should be automatically entitled to participate fully in all areas of Irish life.  More important, we believe that the State has a duty and a responsibility to ensure that all necessary resources are put in place to ensure that is the case.<\/p><p>  Successive Fianna F\u00e1il-led Governments have repeatedly and cold-heartedly implemented policies that make a nonsense of tonight's Private Members' business.  While in power, Fianna F\u00e1il presided over the slow but deliberate dismantling of the welfare state.  As we know only too well, that had a disproportionate impact on people and children with disabilities who are almost totally dependent on the State for the provision of key services.  There is a huge degree of hypocrisy and opportunism in the fact that the very same party, namely Fianna F\u00e1il, that is responsible for pushing people with a disability to the margins of society, is proposing tonight's Private Members' business as if its hands were clean and its conscience were clear.<\/p><p>  The current Fine Gael and Labour Government has not only failed to implement a national housing strategy and a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities, it has also failed to ensure that all public policy measures are disability-proofed.  Lest we forget, when Fianna F\u00e1il was in government it too failed miserably in all of those key areas.  On all of the key indicators - access to decent health care, decent education at primary, secondary and third level, meaningful employment, and suitable and adequate housing, differently-abled people are discriminated against by policies enacted by the Government, but also by successive Fianna F\u00e1il-led Governments.  People with disabilities deserve to be, and should be, treated as equal citizens when it comes to accessing life chances.  They should not, as has been the case with the current Fine Gael and Labour Government and successive Fianna F\u00e1il-led Governments be seen as a soft option when it comes to slashing vital services in order to save money to pay off private bondholders and support zombie banks.  Unfortunately, the political landscape is littered with countless examples of where people with disabilities have had their real and pressing needs ignored in the interest of rescuing foreign speculators and dead financial institutions.  In a mature and politically sophisticated state all those with a disability, be they adults or children, would be guaranteed the necessary services and resources required to live a life with dignity and purpose.  That would mean ensuring people received as a right adequate benefits and that the public services on which they depended were adequately resourced and of a high standard.  Such supports are imperative if people with disabilities are to be enabled to live full and autonomous lives.  In other words, we must support self-determination of people with disabilities by building their capacity and that of their families.<\/p><p>  Sinn F\u00e9in supports this Private Members' business, but it does so reluctantly.  Disabled people are not pawns in a game of political cat and mouse.  They are human beings who deserve to have their rights as citizens fully vindicated.  Sinn F\u00e9in will continue to speak out in favour of that and to oppose all cuts to services and benefits which impact negatively on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400051#YY00300","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1354655400,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400051#YY00400","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1354655400,"counter":603,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It annoys me and many families that we have to fight each time for services.  People in power or in authority do not seem to get it when we talk about the rights of our children with a disability.  They do not seem to get it when we demand equality and justice for all people with a disability.  Cutting or removing services to people who did not cause the crash is an absolute disgrace.  It is wrong and does not protect the vulnerable.<\/p><p>  It maddens me when I hear some politicians or Ministers saying it is only a 3% or 6% cut - that it could have been worse.  What planet are they on, and do they realise that, for example, in the St. Michael\u2019s House services a 1% cut means taking \u20ac700,000 out of the system?  A 3% cut is \u20ac2.1 million.  That is the reality.  Recently, St. Michael\u2019s House suffered cuts of \u20ac11.2 million.  Less money means fewer staff and that existing staff have to provide more services.  That is the case with a disability organisation that has reduced absenteeism from 6.5% down to 3.5% and reduced administration costs by 34%.  There is an example of productivity.  We cannot take any more cuts.  Any further cuts to the budget will have a devastating effect on the service.  In real terms, a total of 317 people are on the priority list for residential places and 45 of those are in serious difficulty.  There is also the added problem of 283 adults with an intellectual disability who are living with one or more parents who is more than 70 years of age.  A 1% cut would be a nightmare for many of the families concerned.<\/p><p>  Many other groups such as Prosper Fingal are also facing huge problems if the cuts are implemented.  At Prosper Fingal in Swords there is considerable uncertainty at present about funding.  In the current climate the only way to access HSE funding for residential places is if someone is in a dire crisis.  Staffing and running costs are the major issues and worries.  Those are the realities on the ground for people with disability.  Their voices must be heard.  The Taoiseach, T\u00e1naiste and the Minister for Health should not cut the services.  There are other options and choices because we must build a republic based on equality and supporting all people with a disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400051#YY00600","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1354655400,"counter":605,"content":"<p>As the Independent speaker at the Constitutional Convention last Saturday one of the points I made was that when the eight topics have been dealt with that there is a need to examine human rights.  I specifically mentioned people with disabilities, both mental and physical.  I also made a point about the rights of prisoners because their mental health has been very much neglected.<\/p><p>  This has not been a good year for people with disabilities, both mental and physical, because added to the obvious difficulties of living with a disability and the stress and strain of coping with that both for the person affected and their loved ones, there are also the additional stresses and strains caused by insensitive and unethical measures for personal assistant hours and home help hours.  Those measures are also uneconomic because various organisations have made calculations on the cost of keeping someone in hospital or a nursing home.  The cost of providing supports for people with disabilities in order that they can be cared for at home, in so far as that is practicable, is minimal in comparison.<\/p><p>  There are varying degrees of disability, both physical and mental, and some require 24-hour care, but the general agreement is for community care in so far as that is possible.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, agrees with that.  Allied to that is the absolute necessity of respite for the family members doing the caring.  People with significant disabilities need more services in order to live independently.  The philosophy of independent living is that every person is important and has the right to live a fulfilling life.

That is the reason I put down this amendment.  It is because of the necessity to ensure, in the interests of societal and intergenerational solidarity, that the more healthy, including the young, access health insurance cover and that the health insurance market is made up of a sufficient mix of the more healthy, including the young, and the less healthy, including the old.<\/p><p>  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure we have a sustainable health insurance market in the next number of years.  The Minister has committed himself to bringing about universal health insurance.  We can have a debate about that another day but in the meantime, even if we move towards universal health insurance, it is critically important that we have vibrancy and sustainability in the health insurance market.  That means we must have an approach whereby young people see it as beneficial and there is merit in taking out private health insurance with a health insurer.  Otherwise, we will have a situation, as is currently the case, in which people are reducing their cover and even reducing the number of people insured in their families.  We now have cases in which the father in a family has given up health insurance because he cannot afford it.<\/p><p>  I do not expect the Minister to resolve the difficulties families are under in terms of funding private health insurance but, at the same time, it is within his remit at least to try to curtail rising health inflation and to ensure also that we have an attractive health insurance market that gives people some reward for taking out private health insurance.  If we do not do that we will not have a sustainable intergenerational support base for young people to assist in community rating and cross-subsidisation in terms of those who are older and drawing on health insurance.  That is the reason behind this amendment.  I tabled it knowing the Minister would reject it, but I wanted to stimulate some debate between now and the time when universal health insurance is established, so that in the meantime we can have a sustainable, vibrant insurance market in which there is cross-subsidisation, risk equalisation, community rating and intergenerational solidarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400052#ZZ00500","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1354656000,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Kelleher's amendment.  He has made a valid argument, which we raised with the Minister on Committee Stage, regarding the challenges we face.  The reality is that unless we can encourage young people to go into the health insurance market we will continue to see the haemorrhaging of individuals and families out of the system.  It is estimated that by the end of this year approximately 200,000 people will have left the health insurance system since 2008.  Something must be done to incentivise people to take up health insurance and encourage others to join up for the first time.<\/p><p>  The difficulty is that the Health Insurance Authority has said that is a pointless exercise at this stage in that universal health insurance will be introduced in four years' time and therefore it will not make a huge difference.  The reality is that it will take a period of time to implement universal health insurance in its totality.  It will not happen in four years' time.  Hopefully, it will commence at that stage, but it will take a period of time to roll out.  There was a contribution by the health insurers at the Oireachtas committee recently and, according to their evidence, it will take ten years to implement universal health insurance.  If we are talking about up to 14 years for the full implementation of universal health insurance, many people will have leaked out of the system in the intervening period.  Some type of incentive must be built in.<\/p><p>  The argument is being made by the Health Insurance Authority that once universal health insurance comes in everyone will be legally obliged to sign up to health insurance and therefore we will not have to try to incentivise it.  The difficulty is that we must try to get new people into the system now if we are to make the health insurance system sustainable in the short term.  The argument I made to the Minister on Committee Stage was that some sort of incentive must be put in place, and not just for young people coming into the health insurance market.  Why should someone who has continuously paid his or her VHI subscription year in, year out for the past 40 or 50 years have to pay the same amount for the same benefits as someone of the same age who is signing up for the first time?<\/p><p>  In the past, when the Minister articulated the view on universal health insurance, he said there would be an incentive for insurers to improve the quality of health of the cohort of people they have insured.  They would encourage people to give up smoking, lose weight and so forth, but how do we encourage that?  Some incentive must be given to the individual for them to lose weight or give up the cigarettes and if that is not built into the price of the policy some other added bonus must be offered.  I have suggested to the Minister that whatever carrot, so to speak, is looked at under universal health insurance, it should also be offered to people currently in the health insurance system in advance of the introduction of universal health insurance here.  It is a fair proposal that is being put forward because incentives will be built into the universal health insurance system.  Regardless of what they are, they will be decided by the insurers in many cases.  Surely we can make some provision, as part of the roll-out of universal health insurance, that people already in the system get some additional benefit on foot of others coming into the new system in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400052#ZZ00600","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1354656000,"counter":611,"content":"<p>I support my colleague's amendment to this legislation.  It is difficult not to be repetitive considering that the two previous speakers valiantly pleaded for this amendment to be accepted.  It is clear that health insurers are having difficulties not just in trying to get the intergenerational mix about which my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, has spoken but also to retain the existing participants in the scheme.  I see that as a major challenge, knowing many people who have had no choice, because of the decisions taken by this Government, but to cease payment in the private health insurance market.  Some of those are more likely to be young, healthy individuals who by their nature are taking a gamble now in the hope that they will not need insurance in the future.<\/p><p>This creates a serious strain on the health insurance sector.  I appeal to the Minister to examine the sector, not in the context of moving towards the schemes he has in mind to force people to take out health insurance but to try to assist them in the current climate.  I do not have the answers for him, but he is in contact with the sector.  Whatever incentive is needed to encourage people in order that they see the immediate benefits needs to be provided.  The insurance sector will be put under phenomenal pressure at a time when it can least take it.<\/p><p> Deputy Billy Kelleher who has tabled amendment does not expect the Minister to accept it, but perhaps it might act as a catalyst within the mind of the Minister and his departmental policymakers to see the potential to address what is a phenomenal crisis.  We hear statistics trotted out by the health insurance industry for the numbers of lost participants.  I see this in my extended family and the constituency I represent.  People are feeling the bite and cannot continue to make such a commitment.  They are feeding their children, rather than covering the potential risk of illness.  It is hard to blame them and unless we do something about it, we are pushing the bubble along a tube and, ultimately, it will burst.  I appeal to the Minister to come forward with a methodology to find a way to solve the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400052#ZZ00700","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354656600,"counter":613,"content":"<p>The Health Insurance Act regulates how private health insurance is provided for those who choose to purchase it.

Over a period covering several Governments people lost faith in the ability of the public service to deliver.  Deputy Timmy Dooley is correct in that we must maintain the health insurance market while we move to a universal health insurance system.  He was reasonable in his comments, but, needless to say, he slipped in a comment about the decisions of the Government.

Young people are not being discouraged from entering the market.  I hope the Deputy joins me in calling on insurers to provide student cover until the age of 23 years, as provided for in legislation.  The insurers can do so if they want, but they have chosen not to do so.  They are free to offer products and set prices at whatever level they like, subject only to compliance with certain minimum benefits outlined in regulations made under the Health Insurance Acts.  My role is to ensure individuals who choose to purchase such products are protected from discrimination.<\/p><p>  Deputy Denis Naughten made an interesting point about smoking.  We want to see the Bill passed as quickly as possible because it will have an impact on the market early in the new year.  However, we will refine and re-examine it as we go along and I can see a way by which we can take on board the concerns of the Deputy such that a smoker can be loaded as long as he or she is not penalised because of his or her age.  The loading should be the same for smokers of all ages because we believe in community rating and do not want a difference to emerge, as that would make obesity, for example, more difficult to deal with.  The issue of cigarette smoking could be examined and I will be happy to do so.  There will be ample opportunity to revisit the matter because the matter will come before the D\u00e1il on an annual basis.<\/p><p>  The best way to ensure health insurance will be affordable for everyone is to reduce costs.  This must be done.  I have issued clear riding instructions to the new CEO and chairman of VHI that I expect to see the costs issue tackled.  I expect to see a more robust audit and, for the first time, there will be a clinical audit in order that clinicians will be challenged on whether the carrying out of tests was necessary.  Fines will ensue.<\/p><p>  We can also cease paying by the day and pay by procedure.  Private and public hospitals that are efficient in getting in patients on the day of a procedure and home quickly, with low readmission rates, will thrive.  I also want to have a full examination of what we are paying for all procedures.  Certain procedures used to take two hours but now take 20 minutes.  However, we still pay the same remuneration rates.  This issue must be addressed.<\/p><p>  One of the main purposes of the Bill is to enhance intergenerational solidarity and solidarity between the healthy and the less healthy.  This is reflected in my amendment to the Bill which broadens the scope of the cost subsidy to include more of the healthy, generally the young, and the less healthy who are generally older.  Another issue we are discussing is that of lifetime community rating which could be introduced to allow insurers to charge people over the age of 30 years taking out health insurance for the first time a loading based on the age at which they take out private health insurance.  These are issues I am happy to examine and take suggestions on, but, in the interests of getting the Bill through as expeditiously as possible, I will not accept the amendment.  As Deputy Billy Kelleher pointed out, he expected this to be the case.  I thank him for raising the issue because it is an important one.  We are examining different ways to make health insurance more attractive and affordable for younger people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400053#AAA00400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1354656600,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I have been around the House long enough to know that, even if I had impressed on the Minister the need to accept the amendment through the force of argument, it would not have happened.  The Minister has said insurance companies can offer packages to young people and the question is why are they not doing so.  If they are to sustain a business model, there must be a number of young, healthy people to cross-subsidise.  That is a basic principle.  VHI meets more than 80% of the cost and covers only 54% of people.  This is another indication that if other insurers do not encourage young people to take out private health insurance, they will be in the same difficulty as the age profile of their clients moves upwards.  Other companies will come in and cherry-pick younger people such that there will not be a continual creeping upwards of the age profile of clients.  New clients are needed to cross-subsidise others and support intergenerational solidarity.  We understand families are under pressure and that there is a need to drive down the cost of medical insurance and the fees charged by health care providers.  We also appreciate that the Minister is carrying out an in-depth analysis of the health insurance sector, encouraging clinical audits and encouraging companies to tighten up on costs.  However, the principle we are trying to invoke is that there should be positive engagement on policy between the Government, the Department and health insurers to encourage uptake of health insurance.<\/p><p>The other reason for the decline in the number of young people taking private health cover is that they are unsure of what universal health insurance means.  The Minister says he has a target of providing universal health insurance by 2016.  In the meantime, people will ask why they should take out private health cover other than to ensure it will be there for them if they get sick.  What other benefit does it give?  Does having cover allow a person to build up loyalty with an insurance company?  People take out private health insurance for a number of reasons, but they do so primarily because they expect a loyalty bonus if they remain with a particular insurance provider.    <\/p><p> I ask the Minister to look on this amendment favourably, even at this late hour.  I accept that he cannot accept the amendment but can he give a commitment, at policy level, to ensure that young people see health insurance as beneficial until we move to mandatory health insurance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400053#AAA00500","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354657200,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I take on board what the Deputy is saying.

We want to encourage them to reduce their costs so that they are in a position to cut their prices.<\/p><p>  We have already undertaken to discuss lifetime community rating with insurers.  People take out insurance for the  cover.  In my experience, they also take it out because they want to have a one-to-one relationship with the treating consultant, which they sometimes feel they do not get in the public health service.  That is something we are in the process of changing by having more consultants in hospitals.  The new Labour Relations Commission agreement is about ensuring there are more consultants and senior decision makers around at all times.<\/p><p>  I hope that clarifies matters for the Deputy.

The Minister's strategy has no basis in rights as it contains no commitment that patients will be guaranteed in law that they will receive basic essential health care.  That is a core principle of mine.  One of the core positions of Sinn F\u00e9in is a commitment to universal entitlement to health services on the basis of need, and need alone.  Instead, the Government's strategy relies totally on regulation of the insurance industry, mainly through the legislation before us.<\/p><p>  The purpose of my amendment is to set down a marker for citizens and to enshrine a commitment in law.  Insurance companies must be made aware that there is an imperative for the State to ensure that all persons receive health services in due time, to the highest standard possible and on the basis of need alone and not on the basis of their ability to pay or the size of their bank balance.<\/p><p>  Sinn F\u00e9in sees the amendment as a first step and would build on it, introducing separate rights based legislation and a rights basis for health care.  That is necessary and, arguably, needed now more than ever, given the Government's approach to an insurance based model.  <\/p><p>  In the absence of the principle recognised in our amendment and its reinforcement in rights based legislation, which Sinn F\u00e9in is committed to, private insurance companies would be given too great a role in determining the level of basic health care services available to citizens.  That is where we are going.  Private insurance providers would have a critical role in determining the level of basic health care for each citizen.  <\/p><p>  The Fianna F\u00e1il regime of 14 years duration promised to introduce an eligibility for health and personal social services Bill.  The Minister and I, as Opposition spokespeople on health, repeatedly requested advice on the progress of the Bill.  Of course, it never saw the light of day.  The Bill would have been hugely important.  It would have placed the citizen's right to access health and personal social services in law.  The Bill did not see the light of day under the former regime and there is no indication that it will re-present under the Minister's stewardship.<\/p><p>  I refer again to a report recently published by the IMPACT trade union.  The report had not been prior-studied when we debated the Bill in the select committee.  I made reference to the report on that occasion but I do not think the Minister had access to the detail of it.  The report was an analysis of the Government's proposed reforms and concluded that the Government has based its approach to universal health insurance on policy in the Netherlands, which the Minister repeated in his reply to me on Committee Stage.  In that country, a system of competing private insurers has created an inequitable and inefficient system of funding with different tiers of entitlement.  That is hugely worrying because this is the system the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues have lauded repeatedly.  The idea of different tiers of entitlement is what we are, supposedly, trying to avoid and get away from when we commit to universal access to health care on the basis of need, and need alone.  Why and how can there be different tiers of entitlement?<\/p><p>  I appeal to the Minister, as I did previously, to consider the amendment. <\/p><p>It does not change the broad thrust of the legislation or the intent behind it, as the Minister has explained.  I believe it is worthwhile and that it serves a particular purpose.  It would have to be followed by rights-based legislation and that should follow at the earliest possible opportunity.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment and appeal to him to so do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400054#BBB00500","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354657800,"counter":623,"content":"<p>Sadly, Deputy \u00d3 Caol\u00e1in has misconstrued the situation, which is a recurring problem.  This universal health insurance, as outlined and committed to in the programme for Government, is not based on private insurance.  The programme for Government is very clear the VHI will be retained.  It is a State-owned insurer and it is to be retained as a public option.  Furthermore, the assertion that these competing insurers would dictate the basic health care standard is again wrong.  The Health Insurance Authority will determine the level of basic health care.  It will determine the standard policy that must be available to all citizens.<\/p><p>  The Deputy alluded to the IMPACT study.  Our system will be based on a multi-payer model and will be underpinned by the principle of social solidarity, as I have said.  Indeed, the Deputy quoted me as saying treatment would be based on medical need and not the ability to pay.  Under UHI everyone will be insured for a standard package of curative services.  A new insurance fund will subsidise or pay insurance premia for those who qualify for a full payment or a subsidy.<\/p><p>  The IMPACT report appears to assume the Government plans to implement the Dutch model in full.  This is not the case.  I have made it clear on numerous occasions that what we liked about the Dutch model was the multi-payer system, but we are not importing the Dutch model into Ireland.  I doubt it would work in its fullness.  We looked to Britain for hospital trusts, which we find to be a suitable model from the point of view of new hospital groups, and which we will bring in next year.  A report on that is to hand and is being analysed by my Department as we speak.  We looked to the North of Ireland, where the special delivery unit had such success before there was a change of Minister and a change of focus.  We have brought that to bear here with considerable success, if I can remind the Chamber of the 25% reduction in the number of people who must endure long trolley waits, the number of people who await inpatient treatment for a year, nine months or, indeed, three months, and that the number of children awaiting inpatient treatment has fallen by 800.  The 91% reduction in those waiting nine months or longer is, to my mind, considerable progress against a backdrop of reduced budgets and staff numbers.  We are also looking to Denmark and Canada for patient safety.<\/p><p>  We are not looking at any one model.  We are looking at all models and we taking from each one of them what we feel is the best solution for our country in the 21st century.  We are completely reforming the health service and that cannot be done overnight.  It is akin to turning a huge tanker at sea.  We must maintain it while we are reforming it and we have had many people bemoaning the fact that is dangerous because it involves so much change.  There is no other way to do this, however, because piecemeal change in the past has not delivered and we intend to deliver.  As I have said before, quoting John Donne, no man is an island, entire of itself, and no part of the health service is an island unto itself either.  The emergency department problems cannot be fixed without fixing the hospital's problems, without fixing long-term care problems in the community, and without addressing primary care issues in the community.  All these things are being tackled, along with the insurance industry, which has been reformed.  I do not believe at any time in the history of this State there has been so much reform undertaken in the health service.<\/p><p>  The IMPACT report argues for more analysis of a single payer model and cites Germany and France as examples of single payer models.  These models both involve multiple insurance funds.  The report fails to consider what would happen to the existing health insurers in Ireland, Aviva, Laya, Glo Health and the VHI, and the jobs they provide, if we introduce a single payer model.  To be frank, having watched over recent years what the HSE, with a monolithic monopoly, has done to our health service, how it has robbed the front line of its ability to decide for itself what is best for the patient, I do not want to see a single payer model in this State.  Competition is good.  It is better for the end user, in this case the patient.  If others wish to call him a client, so be it.<\/p><p>  In essence, from a technical point of view, the principle objective of this Bill relates only to those who have chosen to avail of private health insurance cover.  The issue of the basis on which access to services is available, that is, ability to pay or health needs, does not arise as that is covered by the State's current arrangements on accessibility to secondary care being free to all who reside within the State.  Therefore, I do not accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400055#CCC00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1354657800,"counter":624,"content":"<p>The Minister set out to attempt to rubbish the point that the so-called reform strategy and what the Minister envisages in terms of universal health insurance as the basis of the delivery of same into the future is based on competing private health insurance companies, yet he concludes by lauding and applauding that very approach.  His conclusion is so contradictory from what he said at the outset that it does not stand up.

I put forward an amendment as an alternative option.  It comes back to the argument we had on amendment No. 1.  Health insurers no longer announce premium increases on an annual basis, but perhaps three or four times a year.  The concern is that premium inflation will continue.  At the moment an adult will pay a health insurance levy of approximately \u20ac285 and a child pays approximately \u20ac95.  That will increase significantly on foot of the legislation before us.  At the same time nearly 200,000 people have left the health insurance market.  The reality is that the best way to protect the community-rated system is to ensure that more young people come into the system.<\/p><p> However, the opposite is happening because with the increase in the cost of private health insurance, young people and young families are leaving the system.  We have a bizarre situation where the numbers of older people within the system are increasing.  If we look at a comparison between 2009 and 2010, the number of people over the age of 65 has increased from 40.9% to 43.4%.  In real terms, between 2009 and 2011, an extra 5,500 people over the age of 80 joined the health insurance system.  The number of people aged between 70 and 79 in the system has increased up by 9,500, while the number of people aged between 60 and 69 in the system has increased by 5,000.  Older people are joining health insurance later in life, while younger people are leaving the system.  If this trend continues, the only people who will be able to afford health insurance in this country will be the wealthy or people who have no other choice but to remain in the system in order to access vital health care.  I have huge concerns that the trend will undermine the principle of universal health insurance, in which most of us in this House believe.  <\/p><p> I tabled an amendment to get around the logjam of lifetime community rating on Committee Stage.  I have tabled a different amendment here on Report Stage but it is based on the same principle and would encourage the Minister to sign the 2001 regulation, implement lifetime community rating and introduce some type of incentive or give an indication that there will be an incentive built into the new universal health insurance system for people within the health system whenever that happens.  The Minister sees where I am coming from in respect of this and acknowledged that in his original contribution this evening.  What is crucially important is that we have a timeline in respect of that.  I hope that when he responds to me he can give a timeline for the implementation of lifetime community rating.  Based on the evidence we have received from the health insurers and the HIA, the only mechanism that is not being used to reduce the cost of health insurance is lifetime community rating.  This  could have an impact on the rate of increase of health insurance costs and hopefully see a curtailment of them.  This could then be followed by a reduction in the rate of health insurance costs and could encourage even more people into the system.  This would then take pressure off the community rated system and allow for the implementation of universal health insurance, a principle with which we all agree in this House.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400056#DDD01300","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354659000,"counter":639,"content":"<p>Deputy Naughten's amendment aims to encourage people to stay or become involved in health insurance and make sure they will go into universal health insurance.  The key point there is that universal health insurance will be mandatory so there is no need for incentives to get people into universal health insurance.  It will be the law and we have a mandate from the people to do that.  It is in our programme for Government and our electoral programme.<\/p><p>  The White Paper on universal health insurance, which will be published next year as opposed to the paper which is coming out in a couple of weeks, will outline the details of the universal health insurance model in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance.  There are many key decisions that require careful planning and sequencing over the coming years and primary legislation, which will be required to underpin universal health insurance, will be developed in the future as part of that process.  <\/p><p>  The health insurance (risk equalisation) Bill provides for the introduction of a permanent scheme of risk equalisation.  Therefore, I do not consider it appropriate to insert an amendment in the current Bill which would have the effect of compelling me to introduce lifetime community rating.  However, as I have said, I am disposed to consider any measures that may assist with ensuring the maintenance of a healthy and functioning private health insurance market and will request my officials to further consider the implications of introducing lifetime community rating at this time under the existing health insurance legislation as part of the measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a universal health insurance system.  <\/p><p>  I am aware of the concerns of the Deputies and consumers alike about the cost of health insurance and I have outlined some of the areas which I want to tackle next.  In fairness to the VHI, I must advise the House that last week, the VHI reported that its cost containment programme has delivered savings of \u20ac200 million since 2009 by applying various cost containment measures including reducing consultants' fees by 15% and reducing the prices paid for various procedures by between 13% and 53%.  For example, the professional fee for the insertion of an ordinary stent has gone down from \u20ac1,100 to \u20ac200 and the cost of an MRI scan has been reduced from \u20ac650 to \u20ac160.  However, I have informed the committee that I came across a patient for whom an MRI scan cost \u20ac8,000 because he was kept in hospital awaiting it.  That is the difficulty of the current situation where we pay by the day instead of per procedure.  Paying per procedure would definitely clear out that element.<\/p><p>  The VHI has also introduced a payment system for radiologists and pathologists based on the national quality benchmarks which will lead to reduced length of stay and has the potential to save another \u20ac42 million for the VHI.  It has also focused on claims recovery through the work of its special investigation unit.  This is the audit I spoke about - a much more robust audit will be required.  The VHI continues to focus on the issues and the findings of an external review of its claims entitled the Millman review.  <\/p><p>  The challenge for all of us must be to ensure that the health market remains viable and relevant, in particular given its role in supporting the provision of services in the public sector but also as we prepare for the transition to universal health insurance.  Our public health sector has led the way in some aspects of this through the activities of the clinical care programmes, which have been far more efficient in recent times.  Indeed, the VHI and some of the private hospitals are engaging with the clinical care programmes to make sure that sort of work ethic and protocols are put in place in their own hospitals.  <\/p><p>  I hope to have the interim paper from the implementation group on universal health insurance by 18 or 19 December 2012.  I will not be accepting Deputy Naughten's amendment and I hope he will understand the reason why but I am committed to further examining with my officials the issue of lifetime community rating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400057#EEE00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1354659000,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  I accept that there is no need for an incentive to get people into universal health insurance.  Under the Dutch system, 90% of people were already in a voluntary health insurance system before they introduced universal health insurance in that jurisdiction.  If trends continue we could be down to less than 40% of the population with private health insurance in advance of universal health insurance coming in.  It makes it far more difficult when one must fund that big a differential compared to what was the situation in the Netherlands.  That is why I am saying it is important that we try to keep people within the present voluntary health insurance system and encourage new people to come in.  I and everyone involved in the industry believe that lifetime community rating is a mechanism to do that.  The difficulty is that it has taken 11 years for the Department to look at this situation, yet no decision has been made.  That is why I am asking for a timeline in respect of it.<\/p><p>  We all agree with the point the Minister made about moving from a situation where one pays by the day to paying by procedure.  The difficulty, as the Minister knows, is that this legislation provides for the opposite.  One pays by the length of time one is in the hospital bed.  It is a weakness within the legislation that there is no sunset clause built into that provision so that it can be removed from the legislation within the next 12 months.<\/p><p>The lack of such a clause will undermine the principle of where we all want to go.
