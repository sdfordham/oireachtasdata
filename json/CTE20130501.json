As it is currently delivered, further education covers a very broad spectrum, ranging from basic adult literacy and numeracy courses all the way up to courses certified at level 6 and even above, in certain examples, in the national framework of qualifications.  It also spans the generations of learners from adult learners to early school leavers.  It is delivered in a number of formats in formal classroom settings, in less formal settings in the community and also online in a blended learning method.  Essentially, it is a very flexible form of education and needs to be able to meet the diverse needs of learners in the most appropriate setting.  That flexibility and innovation in our delivery mechanisms needs to be encouraged and facilitated in the future.<\/p><p>  From this very brief description of further education, one can see how difficult it is to define exactly what it is in strict legal terms.  There will always be a danger that some element of this increasingly diverse form of education will be excluded from that very narrow and overly prescriptive definition.  On the basis of feedback from various groups and on the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, it was decided that the best approach would be not to include that legal definition of further education in the Bill.  It is considered that the further education and training strategy, as proposed in section 9, would be a far more appropriate mechanism and the place in which to describe further education in all its iterations and would be less legalistic and more meaningful for those whom we wish to serve through further education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013050100003#B00400","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"speech","time":1367409600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The definition of \"further education\" in the Bill is too narrow.

In regard to adult learners, if the legislation just mentions the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and employers it would appear that further education is about jobs, but it is much more than that.

That could encompass community education providers.  What might put that in question is the use of the word &quot;bodies&quot;, which appears very official.  People may think it is a State agency, whereas community education providers could be a community group.

This is a unique opportunity within the current reform of the further education and training to legislate for raising adult literacy and numeracy levels and to reduce or eliminate the huge social, economic and personal costs associated with low literacy levels.  Adult literacy was first enshrined in Government policy with the publication of a White Paper on adult education in 2000.  The participation in and targets of the new approach to adult literacy outlined in that paper were largely successful.  We want to see the creation of an adult literacy and numeracy strategy which would link with the national literacy and numeracy strategy for children and young people to create for the first time a comprehensive and joined-up national approach to literacy and numeracy development for all ages.  Based on the submissions we all received, literacy and numeracy development is a key component of the education structure.  It is an appropriate time, as part of the reform of further education and training, to legislate for it and set ourselves a strategy and clear targets we have to achieve.  Any strategy is only measurable if one has targets which one can measure against.

As a Government and as a society we have to realise that fact in everything we do and every strategy we come up with, and knit into every piece of legislation that goes thorough our hands a strategy to tackle that.  We cannot address this problem until we admit there is a problem.<\/p><p>  I vividly remember that when I was in opposition and there was controversy over F&Aacute;S, the current Minister - then the Labour spokesperson on education - proposed this very thing and it was not accepted by the Government.  Now is the time for us to be generous again with our legislation and accept the fact that we do not have an adult literacy strategy in this country.  We have an adult literacy crisis.  It is not refuted by anybody that 23% of our adult population are functionally illiterate and cannot read this legislation, site notices or instructions on medicine bottles.  These are very basic functions that they cannot engage with in their lives.  We have consistently, over decades, failed them.  Previously F&Aacute;S had no adult literacy policy, which was absolutely flabbergasting.  We now have the potential to knit into this legislation the construction and submission of an adult literacy policy and this is the time for us to take up that challenge and run with it.  I feel very strongly about this and I hope the Minister takes the spirit of the amendment on board and that together, across parties, we can come to terms with the challenges ahead of us and put into this legislation, finally, a strategy to combat this crisis in Irish society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013050100007#F01700","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1367412000,"counter":123,"content":"<p>There is no question that there is a challenge with regard to adult literacy.

That is not too much to ask.  This should be a box-ticking exercise in any sort of legislation of this nature.  I understand the argument that such an inclusion may be over-prescriptive, and one wants legislation to be as fluid as possible.  However, this is a wonderful opportunity for us to acknowledge and tackle the crisis in adult literacy, a crisis about which no one really wants to talk.

I would appreciate if members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery would ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference.  We had some incidents last week.  Mobile phones interfere with the sound recording so I would appreciate co-operation from all concerned.<\/p><p>  The next item on the agenda is trade promotion and the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in economic recovery, which is an ongoing issue in respect of the preparation of our report relating to our economic recovery.  We have a very important presentation today from the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, which is represented by two individuals, Brian Cotter, who is public affairs director, and Jonathan Small.  The US is a very important trading partner.  Mr. Cotter and Mr. Small are very welcome to the meeting.  They are here today to offer the views of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland on trade promotion in the context of a series of meetings and other activities which the committee has been undertaking in respect of trade promotion and the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in economic recovery.<\/p><p>  The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland represents US companies based in Ireland at both Government and industry level and within the Irish and international media.  With a corporate membership of more than 700 companies, the chamber is well placed to reflect on how official Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in particular can help maximise the potential for developing our relationship with one of our most important trading and investment partners.  There is always the risk that our long-standing links in business, political and cultural arenas may lead to us becoming somewhat complacent about the strength of our relationship with the US.  We must continually seek to understand the changing dynamics of the relationship and develop our approach in order that it continues to be a key contributor to Ireland's economic recovery.  American foreign direct investment is extremely important to us.  We saw it at first hand when we travelled to Atlanta, Houston and Silicon Valley in the US last year and had 32 meetings in six days.  Business interests out there wanted to meet politicians and learn about the recession and how Ireland was faring in its economic recovery.  The meetings were very successful.<\/p><p>  The aim of the committee's examination is to prepare and publish a report on the strategy and the response of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the economic crisis as it is extremely important that we tell the good news about foreign direct investment in Ireland, the Department's newly recognised responsibilities in respect of trade promotion, which relate to the Department's new trade remit, the programme for Government in terms of trade promotion and economic recovery, and how well the Department is performing in these respects.  As part of the examination, a delegation of the committee held 30 trade related meetings in three US cities last year as part of a very successful visit.  This reflected the importance we attach to the US as a trading and investment partner and the potential to look beyond the traditional horizons to places such as Houston in Texas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050100002#A02300","speaker":"974","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367415300,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for the invitation to address them on trade promotion and the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in economic recovery.  I will begin by talking about the bilateral investment environment between Ireland and the United States, the role of that investment and, more specifically, foreign direct investment, FDI, in driving trade and conclude with some perspectives on the role of the Department.<\/p><p>  As the Chairman said, the American chamber represents the community of 700 US firms in Ireland that directly employ 115,000 people.  That accounts for over 70% of all IDA-supported employment.  Employment in US businesses in Ireland has increased by an estimated 15% since 2007.  Today the total US FDI in Ireland is at an historic high of $188 billion.  Putting that into perspective, US investment in Ireland is well in excess of US investment in, for example, Germany and France, and is even ahead of the combined investment in the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China.  It tops the total investment that US companies have in all of Latin America of $148 billion.<\/p><p>  The chamber's role is to encourage a policy environment that retains and attracts investment and jobs into the country and that fosters the development of bilateral trade and investment flows between the US and Ireland.  Over the first two years of this decade, the combined inflows of investment from the US to Ireland reached almost $59 billion, and it is hugely encouraging to note that this is the highest 24 month period on record.  It represents a surge in both US investment and business confidence in Ireland.  It is also heartening for Ireland that there has been no shift in the geographic preference of US FDI, which remains directed towards Europe in general and Ireland in particular.<\/p><p>  This has brought significant benefits to Ireland both economically and socially.  The strongest statistic for illustrating the importance of this relationship to Ireland is that with a total output of $58 billion, this business in Ireland now accounts for over a quarter of Ireland's total GDP and contributes approximately &euro;3 billion to the Irish Exchequer in total taxes, with an additional &euro;14 billion in expenditure to the Irish economy in terms of payroll and goods and services employed in their operations.  In the global table of export platforms for US companies, Ireland now ranks as second, with only Switzerland ahead of us.<\/p><p>  It is a two-way relationship and that is vital to the sustainability of the strong economic relationship between the US and Ireland.  The investment levels of Irish firms in the US has dropped recently, however this has been driven in no small part by the sale of US assets previously held by Irish owned banks.  In spite of these shifts, Irish companies in the US still have a total investment of $25 billion.  Employment levels remain strong, and Irish companies in the US are estimated to employ 120,000 people in sectors such as services, software, food, nutritionals, construction and engineering.  Just as US companies here use Ireland to access the major market opportunities of the EU, so too does this investment abroad find opportunities in the US market.  These Irish companies generated no less than $42 billion in sales in the US in 2011, twice the level of goods exports from Ireland to the US in the same year.<\/p><p>  Despite the disappointing performance of the global economy over the past year, subdued growth has not altered how US firms prefer to compete overseas via FDI rather than traditional trade.  I would like to highlight to the committee a recently published joint publication from the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland and the American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union.  We have provided copies to the committee members.  The publication is entitled The Transatlantic Opportunity: Why we need a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.  As many members will be aware, that partnership, TTIP, was initiated earlier this year by the European Commission and US Administration.  The Irish Government is leading discussions on the negotiating mandate for the European Commission on this transatlantic partnership, and we hope that mandate for trade and investment will prove to be an ambitious and comprehensive one.  There are several areas in which trade in goods and services as well as investment can be boosted on both sides of the Atlantic.<\/p><p>  In the context of the potential further freeing up of trade between the EU and US, I want to highlight a lesser covered aspect of trade.  A crucial aspect of global commerce is what is known as intra-firm trade, which relates to the flow of goods and services between a parent company and its affiliates abroad.  The overall scale of intra-firm trade is, unfortunately, poorly documented outside of the US and a few other countries.  Statistics from the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs in the US indicate that in 2009, such trade accounted for around 40% of all US goods imports and exports.  It is a very large amount of the trading activity into and out of the US.  The importance of such trade underlines the centrality of FDI to the global economy.  Companies regularly locate various functions around the world performing different roles in the firm's value chain and requiring the flow of goods and services across that chain of functions.  This flow largely relates to intermediate or unfinished goods within the global value chain.  There is also, however, a significant amount of trade in finished goods.<\/p><p>  Ireland serves as a strategic beachhead to the rest of the world for US multinationals, with most of these exports destined for the UK and the rest of the EU.  US foreign affiliate sales of goods and services from Irish-based operations totalled $247 billion in 2009, the last full year of figures for this metric.  Putting that number into perspective, US foreign affiliate sales in a nation with a population of 4.5 million people and an economy the size of West Virginia were greater than affiliates sales in China and Japan, which rank, respectively, as the second and third largest economies in the world.  Ireland's place in the global value chains of US companies is the result of several decades of excellent performance and is proving to be an enormous boon to the country as it continues its economic recovery.  This has not happened overnight but through a focused industrial policy to create specialised industrial clusters and developing high-value activities within industries like electronics, computer software, medical instruments, pharma-chem and international finance.<\/p><p>  The global economy remains fragile.  This has created a difficult environment for all international businesses.  The impact of the eurozone crisis has affected global demand and growth prospects.  What has helped, and will continue to help, Ireland and our relationship with the US is the fact that in spite of these global challenges, protectionism has not increased significantly.  More generally, US firms are in a solid financial position.  Ireland's position in Europe is central to our ability to attract FDI.  Europe continues to account for 30% of global consumption, and it is for access to these wealthy markets that US companies are in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Into the future, there are potential benefits accruing from the fact that Europe lies in close proximity to what some analysts call the best business opportunities on the planet.  These are the growing markets of eastern Europe, including Russia, the Middle East and north Africa, a geographical area whose combined output is greater than that of China.<\/p><p>  The work of attracting further investment to Ireland will be enhanced by building on our reputation, delivering greater numbers of well-qualified graduates, maintaining our business-friendly regulatory environment, maintaining certainty regarding our corporate tax rate, and through a consistent focus on improving our overall competitiveness.  Previous witnesses to the committee have provided their thoughts on how the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade can be positioned to aid the process of recovery and how it has performed under its new mandate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050100003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Cotter","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367415900,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cotter for his valuable presentation.

The feeling is there might be an opportunity for Ireland, as global trade continues to expand and air freight becomes more important and given the constraints on many international airports and hubs.  Shannon Airport has a particular interest in seeing if there is a business case to be made for it.  It would be a considerable boon.  As there are not many locations in the world that have pre-clearance facilities, it would be an attractive hub, for example, in setting up significant store rooms and stock to supply businesses and being able to move it easily back and forth across the Atlantic.  Ireland is in a good position in the context of this trade partnership between Europe and the United States.  It has potential capacity from an airport perspective.  We have a reputation for having successfully implemented pre-clearance arrangements for individuals; therefore, there is a keen interest in some parts of the US Administration and certainly on the Irish side to explore this to see whether we can carve out a new business opportunity for the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050100004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Cotter"},{"type":"speech","time":1367415900,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Cotter and his colleagues.  The statistics he has quoted indicate the strong business relationship between the United States and this country, the very significant number of employees in US firms in this country and the large number of individual companies also.  A number of years ago it was always thought that the number of people employed in the United States by Irish companies was somewhat lower than the number employed by US firms in this country.  When did that change to Irish firms employing more people in the United States than the number US firms employ here?  We welcome this because it often provides an opportunity for the sale of products from the parent company in this country to the company established in the United States.<\/p><p>  Will Mr. Cotter elaborate on and give some detail in regard to his statement that the overall scale of inter-firm trade is poorly documented?  <\/p><p>  With regard to the Chairman's question about pre-clearance facilities and Mr. Cotter's reference to better links with the west coast of the United States, what locations does Mr. Cotter have in mind?  He also mentioned corporation tax.  In my limited experience of trade missions one of the first questions which is always raised in the boardroom is whether Ireland is committed to retaining its current level of corporation tax.  Sometimes there can be a misapprehension in regard to the European Union and the level of corporation tax.  It is a matter within the competence of the national government and it cannot be changed except with unanimity at European Union level.  The message must continue to be conveyed that there will be no change to the corporation tax rate, as has been stated by successive Governments.  It is a clear message that must be reiterated at every opportunity.<\/p><p>  With regard to the eurozone and the difficulties in recent years, has that been a source of concern on a constant basis since 2008 for the members of the chamber and client companies?  It factors in to the issue of competitiveness, as well in the context of fluctuations in the value of currencies.<\/p><p>  I welcome Mr. Cotter's strong statement about what has been achieved during the years and the potential for further development and trade through the US-EU trade agreement.

We are comparing like with like.  The bureau has figures for investment, trade and employment and we look at the same set of data it provides for companies in Ireland.  The Government has a slightly different set of figures because it counts them differently.

We use this figure because it is very important in communicating in Washington.

Many US technology companies look to Ireland when they are locating the headquarters of their European operations.  They have a demand for skills.  Over the last five or six years, between 60% and 70% of US investment in Ireland has come from companies that are already here.  That is an incredible vote of confidence.  The companies in question are looking to expand.<\/p><p>  When we express our concerns, we have to be conscious of the context in which we make our remarks.  There is a global shortage of skills.  We are not unique.  We are in a high GDP developed market.  Historically, there has not been a tendency for such markets to produce the same level of technology skills.  People sometimes get diverted into other skills and trades.  The other context is that we had a boom in construction and domestic demand that lasted between ten and 15 years.  This encouraged and made it attractive for people to join State services or get involved in retail and construction.  To a large extent, there have been two generations that did not look kindly on the opportunities that presented themselves in the technology sector.  I mention those two factors to give some background information.<\/p><p>  We are now in the fortunate position of having companies that wish to expand.  They are finding excellent graduates coming from Irish institutions, but not enough of them.  The best graduates are still very highly regarded.  As the Deputy will know, Ireland has expanded its third level output.  Over half of the population under the age of 35 has a third level degree.  It is interesting to note the increase in graduate outputs that has taken place since the end of the construction boom.  According to figures from the HEA, over the last five years engineering outputs have increased by 21%, computing outputs have increased by 50% and science outputs have increased by almost 20%.  These things are to be welcomed.<\/p><p>  The combined efforts of the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills and the HEA have allowed people who have one set of skills to convert them into something more relevant.  The people in question did not wake up stupid one morning.  They might have been in the wrong sector.  We need to see how we can get those people to transfer to another sector.  At least 2,000 new third level graduates with ICT skills are coming through next year.  A further 1,500 people are being converted and will have those skills at the end of that process.  The companies that have used and invested in the JobBridge programme have found it very useful as a means of converting skills.  We are meeting some of the demand that exists, even though there is still a shortage in some sectors.  As long as those sectors are demanding people, it is a signal that they are expanding.<\/p><p>  If large international companies that are based in Ireland or the United States are to service a European marketplace, their workers will need to have a diverse set of skills.  Therefore, it will not be unusual for them to have a European profile.  We want to make sure that as many people as possible who come through the Irish system can take those jobs.  The companies in question would not be as successful without their European profiles.  We are enjoying some success because we can pull in and assemble fantastic teams of people.  The teams in question will continue to be dominated by people of varying nationality and ethnicity who have come through Irish institutions.  That is where we want to be.  I think the real success of the Irish system is that it is able to function in this way.<\/p><p>  It needs to be borne in mind that for every job that comes in, there are other indirect jobs in support or in the indirect economy.  All of that is important.  We must let the opportunity grow.  We must encourage a continued increase in the uptake of science and engineering courses and continued improvements in maths.  I welcome the improved maths scores through the secondary system.  The issue of languages is in the long grass.  We are not quite sure how we are going to tackle that.  A large percentage of our educational time is given to Irish and English.  That is the way the priorities have been.  It does not leave much space for other languages.  If we decide to address that, there will have to be a focus on long-term change because it will take a long time to build those skills and put them into the marketplace.<\/p><p>  The Chairman spoke about his trips to the United States.  I often say to people that I was impressed when I visited Salt Lake City recently.  Its economy is basically driven by agriculture and mining, but it is trying to reinvent itself.  When the authorities there examined what they could use to that end, they discovered that the Mormon church is one of their greatest assets, albeit not in the context that one might think.  As part of its mission, the Mormon church sends young men around the world to target countries.  They are given years of language training before they go to these marketplaces - if I may call them that - for two years to talk to people on the ground.  When they come back, they rejoin the local society, community and economy.<\/p><p>  Salt Lake City is trying to reorient itself to avail of a huge resource.  It is particularly targeting Asia because a large number of Americans speak Chinese, Mandarin, Cantonese and south-east Asian languages.  When we look to languages, that is the kind of investment we need to be able to make.  We want to encourage students to take up languages and support them to go into the marketplace for an extended period in order to become fluent.  We understand that educational resources are narrow at the moment.  We need a strategy for the medium and longer terms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050100007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Cotter","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367418300,"counter":304,"content":"<p>What is Mr. Cotter's view on the link up between the universities here and the US?

Will he elaborate on that?  What would he like to see happening in that regard and what deficiencies does he see in that area?  He said the Department should have the correct skill-sets to understand and empathise with the business world.  Is he talking about the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, a Department in which significant questions have been raised about the calibre and quality of personnel in it?  Would Mr. Cotter like to see a policy where there would be greater mobility between the private sector and the public sector?  This would bring a greater level of ethical governance to the private sector and would bring more dynamic commercial expertise to the public sector.  Mr. Cotter mentioned this, but I would like him to elaborate a little on what he said. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050100008#G00400","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1367418300,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I wanted to raise the issue of skills shortages, but I think Mr. Cotter has responded on that.

Manufacturing output from US companies has been quite strong over the past couple of years but I do not have information on their contribution to last year's figures.<\/p><p>  In general, if we look at the manufacturing base here and stand back and look at it over the decades, we see a shift.  Often, unless manufacturing is very advanced or involved with high technology, such as the type of work being done by INTEL or EMC, it comes under significant cost pressures.  As we have developed a higher standard of living, our cost base has become more expensive, which has tended to put these operations under a degree of pressure.  In my remarks I mentioned inter-company trade and value chains.  These things become part of the mix.  We have seen a shift with regard to manufacturing.  There were more options in the last decade within Europe and places like Poland have done very well in the area of manufacturing.  There has been a shift in the past 20 years to centres of excellence in Asia.  We have also seen the United States become more competitive, particularly in regard to energy, where the cost of gas is one third of what it was in 2008 there because it is exploring policy and new gas reserves have come on stream.  All of this weighs on the minds of companies here.<\/p><p>  What companies here are doing, whatever their nationality, both successful indigenous companies and multinational companies, is focusing on widening the amount of activities they do.  They control the development cycle, do research and development, bring in new products and bring them to commercialisation.  They start the manufacturing process here, they engineer in all the quality and remove the cost in the process.  Then, at that point, they possibly move that range of products to a different and cheaper location.  Therefore, they are becoming centres of excellence and maintaining their pivotal role.<\/p><p>  There is a whole cadre of management here which did not exist 20 years ago, or even 15 years ago.  These people have global responsibilities.  They are responsible for plants not only in Cork, but also in Singapore and parts of China.  They are sitting in Galway, but have responsibility for plants in Boston, New Mexico, Costa Rica and Bulgaria.  I mention those two in particular because two people came to mind, but they are not alone.  There is now a whole cadre of management here with a track record that offers great potential for more, particularly when it comes to our ambitions in research and development.  This has been the general trend in terms of manufacturing, apart from industry such as car manufacturing.<\/p><p>  Recently, Forf&aacute;s issued a report which suggested that with the best possible outcome in terms of competitiveness inputs - we control costs and address skills shortages - there is a potential of 22,000 new jobs by 2016 in manufacturing alone.  We would subscribe to that because the manufacturing base here is quite strong.  It is under pressure because of cost changes and lack of demand in Europe, but the experience and the skills to make it happen exist here.  We should be conscious of this and ensure we do not lose this manufacturing base because so much hangs off it.  We are optimistic in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050100008#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Cotter"},{"type":"speech","time":1367418300,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I wish to make an observation.

Before the last American presidential election, there was much talk about Irish corporation tax.  The US President referred to bringing jobs back to America because it was losing revenue and jobs as a result of several countries - Ireland was named as one of the countries - through which American multinationals were channelling profits generated elsewhere.  I gather the practice is legal and therefore it is probably tax avoidance.  One way or another, it was a big issue at the time of the election, but we have heard nothing since.  Where is that now?  Was it a pre-election thing?  Are the members of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland concerned about it?  I realise the difference between our headline rate and the effective rate is minimal compared with other countries, including France, which was keen under Sarkozy to get us to change it.

We have heated discussions from time to time in this House about the 12.5% tax rate and the effective rate.  I do not exactly share the view but many people believe it would be appropriate to consider putting it to 15%.  Would it impact negatively on American investment in Ireland if consideration was given to making some adjustments?  I imagine the delegation appreciates the difficult budgetary situation in which we find ourselves.  The ordinary taxpayer is being squeezed and is probably unable to carry much more of the taxation burden.  We need to consider other ways of raising tax.

I am pleased in one way that he has raised this issue.  He will be aware of the importance of separating the issue of marginal tax rate from the special assignee relief programme.  The special assignee relief programme is designed to ensure our members in particular do not pay additional costs when they transfer a member of staff for a short period, in other words, an assignment, to Ireland.  The costs at present can be in the region of 15% to 20% extra because of what is termed the tax equalisation policies of US companies.  This means if a US company moves staff, there is no difference to the tax in the wage packet of the staff member and the worker will not suffer whether the tax rate of the country he is going to is lower or higher, because the company equalises the costs.  Sometimes this takes place by way of the company giving extra incentives like housing support or support for the family in moving to a different jurisdiction.  There are different packages.  That is the reason for it and we want to be competitive in that sense.  In particular, we want the people who are in charge of finance in the United States to be aware of it.  When a company decides to move people to Dublin for a period of 18 months, we do not want the finance person to say it will cost extra money and they do not have it in the budget.  That is where we are going with that and we want that to be competitive.  It is not competitive at the moment mainly from an administrative perspective.  Some tweaks on how it is being implemented would be welcome.  We are satisfied there is a good regime and that the mechanisms are in place, but we believe it can be improved.<\/p><p>  There has been some discussion on marginal income tax rates.  We compete with countries such as Singapore, Switzerland and the United States.  The marginal tax rate in Singapore is 20%, in Switzerland it is 11.5% and in the United States it is 35%.  We do not have to look too far afield to see lower and falling marginal tax rates.  It is happening to our neighbours next door.  Marginal tax rates are a tax on talent.  Talented people, whether technical or managerial, tend to get paid more.  They are highly mobile.  We need to be sensitive to that.  As the committee members are well aware, workers in Ireland fall into the marginal tax rate at a much lower level of income than in other countries.  All this plays a part.  We are keen to ensure we retain and attract new investment, but part of that involves attracting skills and retaining skills.  We do not want the global leaders who are here, many of whom are Irish, to leave because suddenly it is more attractive for them to be in another operation in their company, and that might be the case.  We have to be conscious of that when we are looking at our tax policy.  That is where we start from.<\/p><p>  A question was asked about tweaking it one way or the other.  One would have to carry out an econometric study to get the right result.  At the moment we reckon the feeling is that we are on the cusp.  There is an understanding that we can support that cusp at the moment because of where the country is, but we need a plan to get our marginal tax rates more in line and more attractive in order that we can retain the talent.

I thank the Chairman and committee for nominating me and Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan to try to come up with wording that was fair to the proposer of the original motion and the amendment.  I took it terribly seriously.  I have had sleepless nights while working out how best to present to the committee a motion that would interpret fairly accurately the desire of the presenter, Bill Browder, on behalf of his employee, who died in very strange circumstances in a Russian jail.  If one calls a spade a spade, very few other governments, notwithstanding the position of the OSCE and the European Parliament, will repeat the exact formula used by the Americans in the change of legislation.  A lot of politicians are supportive of saying something, but very few governments are prepared to sit down and talk.  A number of us threw in our lot in support of the motion suggested.  I was so concerned I tabled an amendment calling for an Irish Magnitsky law to be imposed against all other gross human rights violators.  I was not just thinking of one man in the international arena in Russia but of tyrants all over the world.  It would be lovely to impose sanctions if one could do so.  One also has to think about who the tyrants are and where they are based.<\/p><p>  I applaud Bill Browder and his company, Hermitage Capital Management, for being so loyal to his employee who died.  I ask the committee to tease out how we can apply sanctions and best represent the interests of human rights activists throughout the world.  For example, on Friday we will unveil a list of human rights front-line defenders.  The President will speak in support of their rights.  If the committee used Senator Walsh's motion and started to list the names and addresses of people and the roles they played in incidents, and one wanted to be fair to all victims of human rights, one would be in a crazy world trying to document those who abused people.  <\/p><p>  If one thinks about it a little more deeply one must wonder: if this is done for Sergei Magnitsky, what about other Russians, such as the oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky who is, allegedly, suffering in a Siberian prison?  Does one create a wealth of support for one man, who is a legitimate case, in isolation from every other victim of human rights abuses?  How, as a committee comprised of politicians concerned about human rights, do we give other victims their rights?  <\/p><p>  Men from all over the world were plucked up by rendition and were sent to tyrants in Egypt or Jordan to be tortured and have confessions extracted from them.  Some of them ended up in Guantanamo Bay.  How does one apply the concerns of the committee for the rights of all individual victims of human rights abuses, such as those to be unveiled by Mary Lawlor on Friday when she lists front-line defenders highlighted as being in need of support?  The formula proposed by Senator Walsh is unworkable and, in any case, does not have political support in any country outside America.  We should use traditional and workable political lobbying, as our motion states, by using the Presidency of the Council of the European Union - the T&aacute;naiste is the man in charge - to engage with the Russians, as the motion states, to highlight issues concerning the death of Sergei Magnitsky and try to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice under basic international human rights laws.  <\/p><p>  Unfortunately, Deputy O'Sullivan has been delayed and cannot be here.  We tortured ourselves in trying to be as fair as we possibly could in moving in what we feel is the right, serious and honest way forward.  If Parliament was to change laws it would take years.  I would like to think that if people such as the human rights defenders who will be honoured on Friday were exposed to danger we would have on the Statute Book a formula that could make people accountable for the abuse of their citizens.  That is another day's work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050100011#K00300","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367420700,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I listened with interest to Deputy Byrne.

I was contacted by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan during the week.  The motion was read to me over the telephone and I took a note of it.  It seems to me to be pretty reasonable.  I think we are moving towards something that will accommodate everyone.  I have also spoken to Senator Jim Walsh and I believe that with the addition of a couple of words the motion could be agreed unanimously.  It is important for the committee to do this.  This was a man who apparently was tortured and killed.  He was murdered, in other words.  The <i>prima facie<\/i> evidence is very clear about that.  I agree this happens all over the world.  We know that sometimes even our allies are guilty of human rights abuses.  However, I think that, like myself, Deputy Byrne believes, after some agonising, that we should take a stand to the degree that is practical in this instance.  I think it is necessary that we do and that we have some degree of courage.  However, we have to be realistic.  There is no point in our saying we are going to exile Mr. Putin to Siberia, for example, because it is <i>ultra vires<\/i>, beyond our powers.  Blocking people's assets might be appropriate in America but I do not think it would work in this case because I do not think they have any here, for a start.  If they do then they are pretty small assets.<\/p><p>  It is important that the committee take a stand against this.  I know the Chairman did not agree with me when I said that Russia was blackmailing us.  However, I draw his attention to the fact that among the material distributed to the committee members by the Chairman's office was a report from <i>The New<\/i><i>York Times <\/i>which said that in Moscow the Russian Government had warned in a letter to Ireland's Parliament that it may halt negotiations on an agreement for cross-border adoptions if an Irish parliamentary committee approves a regulation critical of rights abuses in Russia.

I also know that if this report was inaccurate, our very efficient Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would have countermanded it.  We also know from various sources that it is true.<\/p><p>  This use of children is tragic and revolting.  The Russian Government should be thoroughly ashamed of itself.  It has led to quite a large number of rather sad letters from Irish people, including one in particular that caught my attention, from a couple who had already adopted a Russian child.  They were very anxious that a second adoption from Russia, which would have provided a sibling with the same cultural, religious and linguistic background, should not be interrupted.  These people are being used as weapons against this committee.  Irish citizens are having their maternal and paternal feelings wrung by a cynical Russian Government.  I think we have to take a stand on that issue.  The human rights of the children involved in adoptions should be treated independently of the nasty political motives of various governments, whether in the West or in the East.<\/p><p>  I had no great difficulty with the emendations proposed by Deputies O'Sullivan and Deputy Byrne but I strongly support Senator Walsh - a very unusual position for me.

I thank Deputy Eric Byrne and Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for their conscientious work in trying to draft something which would be achievable and practical, as Deputy Byrne said.  I acknowledge they have done a reasonably good job.  I was not wedded to my original motion, even though I would have liked to see it being passed.  I will concentrate on the new motion that has been tabled.  I note the change to the motion which will ensure consensus and to which Senator Norris referred.  I have two suggestions in advance of that change.  I like the way the preamble is drafted.  In particular, I acknowledge that the T&aacute;naiste's comments at last week's meeting were very good.  Deputy Byrne has drawn on those comments.  He has also kindly shown us the documents from which he has drawn some of that preamble.  I refer to the comments by the T&aacute;naiste, who said that the decision last month by the investigative committee of the Russian Federation to close the criminal investigation into Mr. Magnitsky's death was highly regrettable.  He said that he shares the strongly-worded concerns which were expressed by Catherine Ashton on the issue.  He calls on the Russian authorities to reopen the investigation.  I ask if we could include this comment as being noted.  I refer to the last paragraph of the motion.  We ask the Presidency to reiterate its resolve to ensure a full and final report into the circumstances of the case.  The case was closed on 29 March 2013.  We might need to add some nuances to that, because it is not completely accurate.  We propose to ensure that those found responsible be held to account in accordance with international law.  I ask for clarification on this point.  We know that those responsible have been exonerated in the Russian courts.  I do not know if they can be retried.  I suggest this as part of a tidying-up process.  The change I seek is the one to which Senator Norris referred - that we use the Presidency of the Council of the European Union to support the European Parliament recommendations.  We are calling upon the T&aacute;naiste to do that.  I have talked to Deputy Byrne about an alternative.  He thinks that may not happen anyway.  The minimum we should do - if we are not calling on the Government to do it - would be to include the words \"that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade notes ... and supports the European Parliament.\"  Either we support the European Parliament or we call on the Presidency of the Council to do so, which would be preferable, in my view.<\/p><p>  I do not wish to force a division on this motion.  I am also conscious of the communications we have received from concerned individuals who are adopting children from Russia.  They are to be commended.  None of us wishes to put those adoptions in jeopardy.  I have explained that the committee can only make recommendations which do not carry any legal clout unless the Government adopts the motion.  In that case, the Government would examine all the implications.  In general, the efforts of Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Byrne have been very honest and genuine.

I want to make two or three points of clarification about the situation as it has developed.  When this motion first came before the committee in March, I expressed reservations about the wording of it on the basis of its impact in terms of a situation which needed to be addressed.  As I mentioned on numerous occasions, there are two ways one can go about these things, and Deputy Byrne, in his introduction, acknowledged that.  I congratulate the Deputy and Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on the work they have put into it.  We greatly appreciate that.<\/p><p>  As we all know, the degree of emphasis on human rights and its application in various democracies throughout the world varies greatly.  What constitutes a huge departure from human rights and rules in one country may be seen in another country, if not as normal practice, then certainly as something that has gone on.  Any study of history, even a peripheral one, would let us know that.  Notwithstanding all that, and while we are all grateful for the mention we received in the <i>International Herald Tribune <\/i>and in the Russian newspapers, although we did not set out to achieve such international popularity when we dealt with this, it is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with in the best possible way in the best diplomatic tradition.  A code of language applies in diplomacy and among the diplomatic corps worldwide.  That is normal practice and I would like to see that observed.  That said, I am quite happy to accept what is being proposed in so far as I understand it, with perhaps one or two minor adjustments, to ensure the committee registers its protest, that it directs its protest in the proper fashion towards the relevant authorities, and that the authorities at home towards whom any such motion is directed recognise that it is done for the right reasons and with a view to calling on somebody to address a particular issue that was not in accordance with our perception of what is required in such situations.<\/p><p>  I have received a number of telephone calls from various people.  I do not accept that the issue of adoption should arise and it was not the intention that it would be part of this argument.  If the original motion had not arisen, we would not be in this situation, and that is no disrespect to our colleague who proposed the motion.  As I said in the first instance, I had serious reservations about the wording of the motion from the beginning, the issue took off from there and we are in the situation in which we now find ourselves.

I do not want to see a situation develop whereby we exacerbate it.  That is something we need to be careful about at all times, particularly in a foreign affairs context.

The proposed Directive is a criminal law measure under Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  The objective of this new measure is to strengthen and harmonise European law on counterfeiting of the euro and other currencies and it is intended that the Directive will replace the existing Council Framework Decision 2000\/383\/JHA on this subject, which came into effect around the time of the introduction of the euro, and has been in force for nearly 12 years, at this stage.<\/p><p>  The proposal, as currently drafted, will require EU member states to provide that counterfeiting of the euro and other currencies will be a criminal offence.  The proposal envisages minimum penalties in respect of certain offences, addresses territorial jurisdiction and requires the availability of special investigative tools.<\/p><p>  The legal basis for the proposal is in Title V of Part 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Therefore, Protocol 21 applies.  The protocol provides Ireland and the UK with the option of participating in such measures.  I am here today as part of the process of seeking the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas to exercise, on behalf of Ireland, the option to take part in the adoption and application of the proposed Counterfeiting Directive.  Such approval is a requirement of Article 29.4.7o (iii) of the Constitution.<\/p><p>  We have three months from the date the proposal was presented to notify the Council of our wish to take part in its adoption and application.  The three month period in respect of this proposal expires on 12 May 2013.  Ireland could apply to adopt and participate in the Directive after the three month opt in period, however, such an application would be subject to conditions which the EU Commission may set.  In any case, the joint committee will be aware that Ireland declared its intention to opt in to measures in the area of freedom, security and justice to the maximum extent possible.  I am of the view that, in general, it is best to opt in to proposals at the earliest opportunity, so that we can be in a position to influence the development of the proposal through actively participating during the negotiation process.  If we do not participate, we cannot contribute to the final architecture of what is proposed.<\/p><p>  As regards the origins of the current proposal, this measure was first presented by the Commission on 7 February 2013.  In their proposal, they refer to the euro continuing to be a target of organised crime groups active in the forgery of money, which has caused financial loss of upwards of &euro;500 million since the introduction of the euro in 2002.  European Central Bank data also point to a rise in the number of counterfeit notes circulating recently, and an increase of more than 10% in the quantity of such notes recovered.  The Commission has expressed concerns regarding the distribution within the EU of counterfeits produced elsewhere.  In light of its detailed analysis of the issues, the Commission concluded that it would be of value to propose a new Directive to strengthen and harmonise the law on counterfeiting in order to protect the euro and other currencies.<\/p><p>  I chaired a meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council which discussed this measure on the 8 March 2013.  The Vice-President of the Commission, Madame Reding, made a very cogent argument for the adoption of this measure.  There was strong support from my colleagues in other member states for the objectives of this proposal.<\/p><p>  I would like, if I may, to give you a brief overview of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal.  The proposed directive looks to establish minimum rules in relation to the main counterfeiting offences, as well as aiding and abetting counterfeiting.  It provides for penalties of imprisonment including minimum penalties in certain cases.  It would also introduce requirements to ensure the availability of effective investigative tools and requirements on checking banknotes and sending suspect counterfeits for analysis.  There are also certain requirements to assert jurisdiction over offences occurring outside the EU where the offender or the counterfeit currency is discovered to be in a member state.  Many of these requirements exist already in the framework decision of 2000.<\/p><p>  Perhaps the most significant and contentious aspect of this new proposal is that relating to minimum sentencing for counterfeiting offences.  Article 5 provides for mandatory minimum sentences of at least six months for certain counterfeiting offences, as well as maximum penalties of at least eight years for key offences.  As members will know, in Ireland our approach to sentencing generally is for the Oireachtas to set a maximum sentence in statute while leaving discretion in the individual case to the judge sitting in the relevant court.  Mandatory minimum sentences and presumptive mandatory minimum sentences are exceptionally provided in respect of a small number of serious offences.  These include murder, treason, drug trafficking and certain offences involving firearms.  In such cases a high minimum of ten years or life imprisonment is set.  The approach in the Commission&rsquo;s proposal is to set a relatively low minimum sentence of six months.<\/p><p>  I have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General that while transposition of the proposed directive would provide constitutional cover for such a system of minimum sentences, it would not fit smoothly into our sentencing structure.<\/p><p>  At the March Justice and Home Affairs Council, the majority of member states who spoke on this issue, including Germany, France the Netherlands and the UK, indicated strong concerns about the inclusion of minimum sentences in the measure.  The opposition of member states is based on number of reasons; some member states are simply opposed to minimum sentences and do not provide for them in domestic law, however, even some of those member states who do provide minimum sentences domestically are opposed to their being set in European Union law.  It is a question of proportionality and subsidiarity.  Given the level of opposition to minimum penalties, it is unlikely that this element of the proposal will be retained in the final instrument, or survive the negotiation process that is undertaken to bring about the fine instrument.  Similar mandatory minimum sentence provisions contained in the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a directive on fraud against the financial interests of the Union will not form part of the general approach which I hope to see agreed at the June Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers.<\/p><p>  The proposal also provides in Article 8 for an extension of jurisdiction for those member states whose currency is the euro.  In this regard, our legislation already provides for significant extra-territorial jurisdiction in respect of counterfeiting offences.  Under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, section 38 provides that specified counterfeiting offences committed outside the State attract the same penalties as equivalent offences committed inside the State.<\/p><p>  A new provision in the proposal requires member states to ensure that investigative tools which are provided for in national law for organised crime or other serious crime cases can be also used in cases of counterfeiting of currency.  Such tools could include monitoring of bank accounts and other investigations, while having regard to the principle of proportionality and the nature and seriousness of the particular offences under investigation.  This aspect of the proposal will be the subject of very careful consideration by the Council working group debating this measure.  Member states are eager to ensure this provision would be proportionate to the aims of the directive, and that there would be sufficient discretion for member states to accommodate domestic thresholds applicable to sensitive measures such as surveillance.<\/p><p>  The measure also contains a further technical requirement making it mandatory to transmit samples of counterfeit coins to the country's own national analysis centres for analysis during judicial proceedings, to help with the identification and detection of further counterfeits, as provided in Article 10.  The Central Bank provides technical assistance with classification of suspected counterfeit seizures.  There is close co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Central Bank on the transmission of samples as matters stand already.  This includes regular contact with the National Analysis Centre located in the Central Bank, Europol, the ECB and the EU Commission.  In 2012 these endeavours resulted in 72 arrests and 91 charges specific to crimes involving money counterfeiting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013050100003#B00400","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367413800,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for going through that.

I agree with him that counterfeiting is a major issue and we would all be opposed to it.  I have three brief questions for the Minister.  He said that organised crime groups have caused a financial loss of up to &euro;500 million since 2002.  Does that figure of &euro;500 million cover all of the European Union?  Does he have figures or statistics for the loss caused by counterfeiting in Ireland?<\/p><p>  My second question relates to article 5 which provides for mandatory minimum sentences of at least six months for certain counterfeiting offences and of up to eight years for key offences.  My initial reaction to that article 5 provision was that a sentence of six months for such an offence, particularly by organised gangs, seems very low.  I would like the Minister to respond to that point.<\/p><p>  My third question relates to the more serious offences of murder, treason, drug trafficking and certain offences involving firearms, for which a minimum sentence of ten years will apply.  Many members of the public not only in Ireland but across the European Union are concerned about the position where people who commit very serious crimes are released back into society having served a sentence of eight to ten years.  Many people would have a concern about that in terms of regard for human life and would the Minister share my concern?<\/p><p>  The Minister said that the euro continues to be a target for organised crime groups.  Are there many of these groups operating within the European Union?  Could he also indicate if there are many such groups operating in Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013050100004#C00300","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1367413800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I will take those questions in a different order from that which the Deputy asked them.  He raised a question about violent crimes, particularly murder.  Murder in this country will result in an automatic life sentence.  There was a time about 30 years ago when the average life sentence in this country worked out as serving a jail sentence of about eight or nine years, except in particular circumstances.  There were exceptions to that but that is the way it averaged out.  The average life sentence now is between 16 to 17 years.  There are a number of people in our prisons who have been there for a good deal longer than that.  Whether persons get released effectively under some form of supervision substantially may depend on whether they pose a continuing threat to the public, whether they  have participated in prison in various arrangements that may be in place, whether that be psychiatric assistance or otherwise, and the nature of their behaviour during their term of imprisonment.  There is a range of issues involved.  I do not have in my mind what is the average sentence served across the European Union for the offence of murder but it is between 16 and 17 years in this jurisdiction.  I do not have that statistic and I am not going to invent one.  I know there are some similarities between other countries and this jurisdiction.  In the context of a recent case in which I was engaged where a prisoner was transferred from this State to another state, once one has served a sentence for murder and has been in prison for 20 years, one is entitled to apply for release, but the relevant Minister for justice told me that no one had yet been successful in such an application.  There are quite substantial variances across the European Union.  That might be an issue this committee might be interested in following up and getting the various statistics from the different European countries to get some insight into that.  I do not have that background information.<\/p><p>  On the Deputy's question of direct relevance to this matter.  The figure of &euro;500 million I mentioned is in the context of the moneys that have been found across the European Union.  According to recent figures from the European Central Bank, during the second half of 2012, a total of &euro;280,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation.  The average amount of genuine banknotes in circulation during that period was &euro;14.9 billion.  That provides an insight, in that while this is a problem it is small scale compared to the numbers.  <\/p><p>  On a positive note, there was an increase of more than 10% in the counterfeit currency recovered during the second half of 2012.  For those of the members interested in this, the most popular denomination of euro notes being counterfeited are apparently the &euro;20 note and &euro;50 note, which account for 80% of the total.<\/p><p>  In the context of convictions for counterfeiting in this State between 2005 and 2011, the numbers vary.  In 2005 there were 23 convictions, in 2006 there were 11, in 2007 there were 21, in 2008 there were 50, in 2009 there were 4, in 2010 there were 44, and in 2011 there were 49.  Those figures will give the Deputy some insight into the statistics on convictions.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013050100004#C00400","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367414400,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his contribution and response to Deputy Finian McGrath's questions which addressed some of the issues I had in mind.  I agree with the Minister that counterfeiting is bad and there is no disguising this fact.  I wish to ask about the technical side of the directive to be agreed and its transposition.  What is the process involved?  Obviously, the directive has emanated from the European Commission in the normal way.  What are the stages that have to be followed?  I am interested to hear about what happens when it comes to negotiating on the directive and reflecting the Minister's concerns and those of other member states on the minimum sentence issue.  For Ireland to have the discretion not to provide for a minimum sentence in its laws, is that a measure that will have to be negotiated on and agreed to or, the directive having been agreed, will we still have some wriggle room?  In the business of transposition of directives a degree of discretion is permitted within the confines of what is required to take account of local sensitivities.  Is it a question of sorting this out during the international negotiations stage or is it something we can tweak at a later point?  I assume that would apply, in particular, to issues such as surveillance which might be a sensitive matter as noted by the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013050100005#D00200","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1367414400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I will describe the way these things work in practical terms.  There are what I would describe as &quot;headline&quot; meetings at which Ministers discuss at European Council level a proposal from the Commission.  During the course of these meetings individual Ministers may raise issues about a particular article of a directive or regulation.  If there is general agreement on the principle of the initiative that is worth progressing, it goes to a working group.  The country that holds the Presidency of the European Union provides the chair of the working group.  In the context of this measure, the working group would have been chaired by a member of my Department.  At the meetings there are representatives of each of the member states and there is a first reading and engagement on each of the articles proposed to ascertain whether the substance and the content can be agreed to and whether there is consensus on them.  If there is a major issue which presents a difficulty, it may come back for discussion at the Council of Ministers.  Once the terms of the measure are agreed to on the ministerial side, there is formal engagement with the European Parliament and the relevant committee.  Normally there is informal engagement with the European Parliament at an earlier stage also.  <\/p><p>  There are two parliamentary committees - the JURI and the LIBE - one of which appoints a principal rapporteur.  If the rapporteur comes from one political grouping in the European Parliament, shadow rapporteurs are appointed by the other parliamentary groupings to engage with the main rapporteur.  A process is undertaken between the Parliament, the state that holds the Presidency and the Commission - a trialogue - to work through issues which present a difficulty.  Ultimately, the Parliament and the Council of Ministers must agree on the final content of a measure.  In simple terms, that is the way the process works.  During the course of the Presidency I would have been present at various meetings of either the LIBE or the JURI.  I have engaged personally with the rapporteurs appointed to deal with particular measures at plenary meetings before assuming the Presidency and since.  On occasion there has been the odd telephone call to try to iron out difficulties about measures in order that they can be progressed.<\/p><p>  The way the measure is going there is very little chance the six month minimum sentence provision will survive in the Commission's proposal.  Ultimately, if the directive is accepted - we have opted into it - the final arrangements will be agreed to and we will be required to reflect them in domestic law.  Certain basic matters contained in the directive will have to be accurately reflected in domestic law; one cannot adopt an<i><\/i><i><font color=\"#222222\">&agrave; la carte<\/font><\/i><font color=\"#222222\"> approach to it.  Much of what happens is achieved by consensus.  However, there may be division within the European Parliament.  Some Members of Parliament may be opposed to a particular measure and there may be a vote on it, as not every measure goes through the Parliament by consensus.  Ultimately, however, there is agreement between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission on how a measure will be structured at the end of the process.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013050100005#D00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1367414400,"counter":409,"content":"<p>What is the overall timescale for putting the directive to be in place and transposed in domestic law?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013050100005#D00400","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1367414400,"counter":410,"content":"<p>This is not a particularly complex measure.

Agreed.  The next petition for consideration is petition No. P00029\/12 from Dr. Ciar&aacute;n McMahon regarding open access to publicly-funded research.  This petition concerns research and science funding in Ireland.  The petitioner would like research which is funded by the taxpayer to be provided free of charge to the public.  The secretariat and the committee consulted the Departments of Education and Skills and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and in particular, the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock, who is responsible for innovation and research who deal with this issue.  The recommendation is to forward the Department's response to the petitioner, informing him of the national principles for open access policy statement which was launched after the petition was received.  The statement on that matter last October shows the Minister is committed to making outputs from State-funded research publicly available to potential users across Ireland's research community, be they in the education, business, charitable or public sector.<\/p><p>  The view of the committee is that the national open access policy will increase the visibility and improve access to the outputs of publicly-funded research and that the national steering committee on open access policy is working towards a sustainable national infrastructure for open access.  The committee notes that the policy document shows that 20 State-supported research funders and entities in Ireland have signed up to the open access policy already.  The committee notes that the national steering committee on open access policy will operate transparently and plans to issue regular statements on its progress in exploring and developing a sustainable national infrastructure incentives and rewards system to achieve its goals.  The committee considers that the principles contained in the national principles on open access policy statement will be effective.  However, due to the existing variations in access to open access infrastructure and the different maturity of open access policies and practices, the committee accepts that a phased approach to implementation will be necessary to broaden the coverage of the open access infrastructure beyond Irish universities to include provision for all publicly-funded research in Ireland.  In view of the fact that open access to publicly-funded research already exists in Ireland and its development is ongoing, the committee has decided to close the petition after communicating its findings to the petitioner.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  Petition No. P00049\/12 is from Mr. Frank Cullinane on the under-reporting of road traffic accidents in Ireland.

It could look attractive and glamorous in public places where people are relaxing and enjoying themselves and be a temptation to young people to start smoking.  I would encourage people to consider restraining their habits and their visibility in the best interests of not giving bad example, or in the best interests of giving good example by not smoking, to young people.

As Senator Harte mentioned, a decade or two ago it would never have been considered that smoking in a public place was not appropriate.  People smoked because of their need to fuel their addiction.  I was a smoker for 15 years and I have been off them now for over three years.  I was recently in Spain for a long weekend and while I was in an outside section of a restaurant a person lit up a cigarette.  That would not be permitted in Ireland but it is acceptable there.  I found it terrible to have somebody smoking nearby while I was eating.<\/p><p>  Society moves forward.  Sometimes it is a little slow to do so and other times it takes innovation and innovators to take a bold step, as we have done in this country on a number of issues.  The introduction of the smoking ban in pubs was one such step.  In 15 or 20 years time it may be the case that smoking in public areas would be socially unacceptable.  It is getting that way as we speak.  Senator Crown attempted to bring legislation forward on this matter previously or there was a discussion about banning smoking in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would not advocate it at this time but I might in the future.  When I walk past smokers, particularly outside Leinster House 2000, I take a deep breath and exhale when I get past them because I do not like the smell of it.  <\/p><p>  Society moves on and this petition has merit.  It would be interesting to get the Department's response to it.  My personal preference is that we would wait a few years before introducing a complete ban on smoking.  It is something society will request.  One or two people do not make a society.  However, in 15 years' time when we start to get hundreds of people calling for it, advocacy groups writing regularly to the newspapers calling for it, or people going on air to \"talk to Joe\" about it, I am sure we will then be ready to take that step together as a society.

I have studied the committee's recent report on the post office network and feel that in certain areas the committee might be more educated than I am when it comes to the subject.  I will introduce myself briefly, share some views and then we can start the question and answer session.<\/p><p>  My name is Christoph Mueller.  I am 51 years old and arrived in Ireland approximately three and a half years ago to take up the role of chief executive of Aer Lingus.  I am married to Florence, a former long-haul pilot.  We have three children and we live in Howth.  I joined Aer Lingus in September 2009 when the task at hand was obvious.  Aer Lingus had accumulated losses of almost &euro;100 million in 2009 as a consequence of the financial crisis and the collapse of the financial markets.  If I might say so, we have fixed the situation since then.  Aer Lingus has just published its annual accounts for 2012 which was our third consecutive profitable year.  We are now the fourth most profitable airline in Europe.  That was accompanied by a lot of structural and strategic changes and of course I can provide further evidence of this in a different capacity.<\/p><p>  I would like to shed some light on my education which I believe is relevant because I have engaged throughout my life in certain areas which might be of interest to the committee.  After a normal high school career I joined the German army where, instead of doing my mandatory 15 months' service, I opted to do two years and became an officer of the logistic forces.  Ever since I have been involved in questions of logistics of different types, postal, freight forwarding, tourism and, as I have mentioned, aviation.  After my military service I accomplished a three year apprenticeship programme which is very popular in Germany and is comparable to becoming a chartered accountant here in Ireland.  Parallel to that practical education, I completed my masters in business administration at the University of Cologne.  During my studies I concentrated on production planning and just-in-time concepts which surprisingly come from the postal network so at an early stage in my academic career I focused on that.<\/p><p>  After my academic career I made a couple of career moves.  After completing my masters degree I joined Lufthansa as an internal auditor.  I left Lufthansa after a couple of years to become financial controller of Airbus Industry.  I went to eastern Germany after reunification for my first big restructuring project, in a maintenance and repair company of 3,500 employees.  I rejoined Lufthansa in 1994 for five years and was first executive vice president for financial control and later became the head of corporate planning, also as an executive vice president.  I left the company  to re-structure Sabena, the Belgian State-owned airline at the time.  Due to the demise of Swissair in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, Sabena also went into bankruptcy.  Swissair was the second largest shareholder in the company, with 49%.  The Belgian Government then asked me to privatise the remaining subsidiaries of Sabena which comprised half of the group.  That took me almost a year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050100003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christoph Mueller","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367397600,"counter":446,"content":"<p>No doubt there will be many questions related to Mr. Mueller's experience in the business world.

As the Chairman said, An Post and its services are an integral part of urban and rural communities.  I appreciate the points Mr. Mueller made in regard to Europe and services.<\/p><p>  This debate on the future of the post office network and the provision of as many post offices as possible throughout the country has been going on for 20 years.  We have lost a large number of post offices and the sense of community and identity in urban and rural communities has dwindled as a result.  The retail network of An Post is very dear to our hearts in urban and rural communities.  In his new role, will Mr. Mueller ensure they are protected and enhanced?<\/p><p>  The debate has always been about what new services we can bring to post offices and whether they are State offices in communities and whether we should enhance them to reflect that.  It is vital that An Post looks at what services can be attached to the network to enhance its business and the urban and rural communities it serves.  A mainstay of the post office network over the past number of years has been the payment of social welfare benefits.  Over time, the Department of Social Protection has been gearing people towards having their payments paid directly into their bank accounts.  Some payments, however, were reserved completely for the post offices to avoid any confusion or fraud but I understand the Department has met to discuss the cost in the past two or three weeks.  It is vital An Post keeps that service.  If these social welfare payments are not paid by post offices, it will be very hard to sustain them in urban and rural communities.  That issue needs to be looked at.<\/p><p>  The report of this committee considered all the stakeholders.  We should protect the social welfare payments paid by post offices at all costs.  How does Mr. Mueller envisage enhancing An Post's retail outlets throughout the country to ensure they are viable going forward?  It is very easy to let the service die out, to pull it back or to close a post office because it is not viable.  However, the onus is on An Post to ensure it looks for new business and new ideas and that it enhances the network going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050100005#D00300","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1367398200,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Mueller and wish him well in his role.  There is no doubt from the curriculum vitae he presented that he is amply qualified for the role.  He has come in at a good time because last week when I was driving home from here, I heard on the news that An Post had an operating loss of &euro;17 million last year but when one factors in all the losses, it is upwards of &euro;40 million.  In the middle of that media report, there was a discussion on the salaries being paid to the top executives of An Post, in particular at the level of chief executive officer.  A company which reported a &euro;40 million loss has a CEO on a salary of &euro;400,000, which is twice that of the Taoiseach and twice the &euro;213,000 salary of the Governor of the Central Bank, who is charged with ensuring fiscal rectitude in Ireland.<\/p><p>  There might be a temptation now to reduce services or to cut employee numbers or retail outlets to try to balance the books but how does that sit with the incoming chairman?  A cost restructuring programme needs to take place in the company but the CEO earns twice the Taoiseach's salary and in a country of 4 million people.  I have a huge difficulty with that.  The Netherlands has taken a very clear line in terms of highly paid public and civil servants and salaries are set at a maximum percentage of the Prime Minister's salary.  What does Mr. Mueller think of that?  In his role as chairman, will he encourage people at the top to look at themselves before they look at others with a view cost saving in the company?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050100005#D00400","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367398200,"counter":454,"content":"<p>In regard to the retail network, we should not confuse last mile delivery with the physical post office.

A great deal of activity in rural Ireland happens around the post office.<\/p><p>  Ireland's retail sector is lagging behind, in online terms, because it has not caught up with the development of the Internet.  I see an opportunity for many post offices throughout Ireland to connect with the retail sector and see how they can work in partnership on some of these issues.  Many of our high street shops have been affected by technological changes.  People tend to shop from their sitting rooms rather than getting onto the bus or into the car to go to the city centre.

As there has been some duplication, I will try to answer in a logical sequence.  Deputy Harrington asked a key question about An Post's service portfolio now and into the future.  I agree with him that the subsidiaries are very successful in meeting new business opportunities in areas not traditionally served by An Post.  Their success, as measured by their the contribution to the bottom line, speaks for itself.  In the weeks to come, I will try to answer the key strategic question of whether that success can be leveraged to compensate for the decline in mail volumes.  We have a five-year plan.  We will challenge that piece by piece to see whether our assumptions are optimistic, conservative or just about right.<\/p><p>  I believe e-commerce is an important aspect of this discussion.  I have said that it might have upsides and downsides.  I have looked at the examples of countries like Canada, which also has a sparsely distributed population.  Online shopping is now the predominant thing.  The increase in the number of parcels being sent by companies like Amazon has the potential to compensate for the decline in letter volumes.  If that pattern continues, the owners of supermarkets like Tesco, Centra and Aldi will comprise the next group to come to this forum.  They will ask the members what they are doing about online shopping substituting its business.  The macroeconomic view of things is that the amount of goods purchased will always be 100%.  If online shopping increases at the expense of local retailers, they will come here and say that the local retail sector, rather than the post office, is the true centre of the little town.<\/p><p>  We will not be able to stop this development.  We will not even be able to influence it.  In the absence of widespread broadband Internet access in rural areas, all of this is speculation because people are unable to complete their shopping with sufficient speed.  I have not even mentioned the payment mechanism, which is the most crucial aspect.  Given that broadband coverage is very patchy in some areas outside the M50, I am still surprised that the two largest airlines in the country are selling 100% of their tickets online.  It is an exercise in itself for a person in the midlands to print out a boarding pass.  I believe that needs the enabler to really leverage that fully.  It is a good example of how new business can be generated for the post office delivery system, which is separate from the retail system.<\/p><p>  When I was asked about Sabena yesterday evening as part of my fitness test for the Central Bank, I responded by saying that as far as I know, six books have been written about the company and I have participated in five of them.  A great deal of evidence is available.  I will give the short version of the long story.  Sabena went bankrupt because its second largest shareholder was unable to live up to its funding obligations, which had been issued years before.  The shareholder in question owed us approximately &euro;450 million.  The Belgian state was not in  a position to bridge this gap because of state aid rules.  The airline received special permission from the European Commission but it came too late.  It ran out of fuel very rapidly even though a couple of days previously, its employees agreed to severe restructuring measures which would have kept Sabena alive if it had been able to receive the promised funding.  That is the short version of the story.  I am happy to go into more detail.<\/p><p>  Technology has been mentioned a couple of times.  Of course technology is an enabler.  We always think about the contributions made by barcodes, sorting centres and more fuel-efficient vehicles.  I believe the introduction of postal codes should gain more prominence in this discussion.  That would be an enabler which would make the sorting process more efficient.  It would allow us to save more money in the big sorting centres and thereby increase our potential for subsidising the post office and delivery networks.  That is very important.  I compare the current system to the one-year knowledge test that has to be passed by London taxi drivers.  They used to have to cycles all the streets on their bicycles so they would know them.<\/p><p>  If a letter was posted in Boise, Idaho with the address \"3 The Needles, Howth, Ireland\" written on it, one can imagine the problems we would have bringing it the last mile, not to mention the problems with pre-sorting in the United States.  The use of postcodes is an international norm.  I believe we can squeeze out more efficiencies by introducing a really good system here.  The knowledge that used to be required of London taxi drivers has become redundant with the introduction of GPS.  We continue to have a high justification for our delivery network because the local postman is the only person who knows where \"3 The Needles\" is.  That is an important aspect we must factor in at an early stage.  It has upsides and downsides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050100009#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christoph Mueller","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367401200,"counter":476,"content":"<p>Are members happy with that?
