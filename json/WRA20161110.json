The legal grounds under which the Governor made this decision are set out in the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the\u00a0Central Bank\u00a0that it made an application on 2 November 2016 to the High Court to have joint provisional liquidators appointed to Rush Credit Union Limited.  Jim Luby and Tom Rogers of McStay Luby were appointed as joint provisional liquidators on that date\u00a0by the President of the High Court, Mr Justice Peter Kelly.  The full application will be heard on 21 November, when the Central Bank will seek the winding up of Rush Credit Union Ltd.  The Central Bank took this action in order to ensure the protection of members' savings.  The credit union will not re-open and all issues relating to the wind down of services will be managed by the Joint Provisional Liquidators. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Central Bank\u00a0has further informed me that its\u00a0objective is to be as transparent as possible by providing information to reassure credit union members regarding the actions taken.  For legal reasons, the Central Bank is constrained in terms of the specific details it can provide, pending the decision of the High Court on 21 November 2016.\u00a0 The Central Bank will publish the Resolution Report and Affidavit (on a redacted basis) on its website following the full hearing for the winding up of Rush Credit Union Ltd in the High Court on 21 November 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Following the appointment of the Joint Provisional Liquidators the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) has been invoked.\u00a0 Members of Rush Credit Union Ltd will receive compensation in respect of their eligible deposits up to &euro;100,000 per member.  The DGS will make compensation payments as early as possible within the statutory deadline of 20 working days to duly verified depositors. <\/p>  <p>  Rush Credit Union Ltd has been monitored by the Central Bank over a number of years and during that\u00a0time the Central Bank investigated aspects of its business.  The Central Bank is of the view that there are a number of reasons for the failure of Rush Credit Union Ltd which have manifested over an extended period of time.  These include\u00a0issues relating to governance, internal controls, lending practices and valuation of its premises.  Despite assurances given by Rush Credit Union Ltd to the Central Bank, and the credit union having been provided with an opportunity to address the issues concerned, in the opinion of the Central Bank, they have not been adequately addressed.  In applying for winding up, the Central Bank has also considered Rush Credit Union Ltd's recent financial performance and its constrained capacity to ameliorate its distressed financial position.\u00a0 In the absence of taking the proposed action, the nature of the financial, governance and internal controls issues, could lead to a disorderly collapse of Rush Credit Union Ltd.<\/p>  <p>  The registration and regulation of credit unions is the responsibility of the Registrar of Credit Unions within the Central Bank, who is the independent regulator for credit unions.  The Central Bank is keen that credit union services are available to the people of Rush and Lusk.  I share this view.\u00a0 The Central Bank informs me that it\u00a0is conscious that there is a demand for the services of a credit union in the local area and will examine what arrangements can be put in place to provide specific credit union services in the community in the future.\u00a0 In some cases, members may currently be able to avail of services in another credit union in the area as the common bond may extend into their locality or through their place of work.  <\/p>  <p>  While the Central Bank is willing and prepared to take the necessary action to protect the savings of credit union members,\u00a0it remains fully supportive of the credit union sector in Ireland and is committed to the continued development of a strong and sustainable sector that meets members' changing needs and protects their savings.<\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country.  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000064#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Book Sales","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000064#WRA01675"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[34030\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000064#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the plans of State backed banks to sell mortgage loan books to third parties; and if he will instruct these banks to only sell to regulated and reputable parties.

This has been primarily achieved by customers engaging directly with their banks and agreeing a sustainable payment plan which allows the customer an achievable path out of arrears, as well as protecting the value of the loan for the bank.  In many cases these agreements have included elements of debt restructuring and writedowns. This is the most equitable means of dealing with problem loans for both borrowers and lenders, and I would urge all those in arrears to engage constructively with their bank in order to reach an appropriate\u00a0repayment arrangement.  In the vast majority of cases this achieves the best outcome for all involved. <\/p>  <p>  Despite the significant progress made, the levels of NPLs in the Irish banking sector remain elevated by European standards.  Banks are under pressure to reduce these exposures, both from their regulator and the market.\u00a0 Notwithstanding whether or not the State is a shareholder, it is the management and board of each institution that\u00a0are tasked with developing and implementing a strategy to address this challenge. <\/p>  <p>  In recent years banks have introduced multiple engagement channels to facilitate those customers who are reluctant to engage directly with them.  Having exhausted these initiatives, if meaningful engagement is not forthcoming from particular customers\u00a0the bank may be left with no option but to look at alternative solutions which could, as a last resort, include the sale of the loan.<\/p>  <p>  As the deputy will know, I as Minister for Finance have no role in the day-to-day management of the Irish banks.  Notwithstanding that the state is a significant shareholder in a AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB, these banks are run on an independent and commercial basis.

The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 was enacted in July 2015 and is designed to protect relevant borrowers whose loans are sold on to unregulated entities.  The Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  These are firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities.  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else\u00a0the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.<\/p>  <p>  Under the \u00a0Consumer Protection Act 2015 relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes, such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, issued by the Central Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000064#WRA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000064#WRA01850"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[33986\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000064#WRA01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures he will introduce to address the spiralling cost of insurance; the timeframe for implementing same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":28,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[34037\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000064#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the work of the Working Group on the Cost of Insurance; and the timeframe for action to be taken on the spiralling cost of insurance.","asker":"1259","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":29,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 22 together.<\/p><p>The Cost of Insurance Working Group, which I am chairing, is examining the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance.

These improved fundamentals mean that Ireland has now regained its A-rating with all the major credit rating agencies, following Moody's upgrade earlier this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Exchequer's funding position is strong due to the activities of the NTMA in 2016 and the fact that it has limited financing needs in the months ahead.

It is hoped that turning notional demand into real demand will generate the supply response by the market.  With the assistance of the scheme, many first-time buyers who want to buy new starter homes would be in a better position to secure deposits and obtain approval for mortgages.  In turn, this would mean that developers who may have\u00a0been struggling to raise funding to build properties will be in a position to point to this increased real demand in their\u00a0own negotiations with lenders, and therefore be in a position to build more new homes.<\/p>  <p>  Extending the scheme to apply to second hand properties would\u00a0have no impact on\u00a0increasing the supply of new homes being built and thus could not contribute to increased supply.  As a result, I\u00a0will not reconsider allowing second hand\u00a0properties to fall within the scope of\u00a0the rebate.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, when devising the scheme I was conscious that if a cap on the maximum house price was set at too low a level, then the scheme would be limited in terms of the cohort that it may be able to assist.\u00a0 Setting this cap\u00a0at too low a level could also\u00a0lead to\u00a0individuals falsifying their property prices in order to qualify.  Thus, I decided that I would set a higher cap so that first time buyers struggling with high property prices, especially those in Dublin where prices are highest, would not be excluded entirely from the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I brought forward an amendment to the proposed cap at\u00a0Committee Stage\u00a0yesterday.

Many sectors in Ireland that are exposed to the UK have a high percentage of small and Irish owned enterprises.  The increase to the Earned Income Tax Credit for self-employed tax payers will aid these enterprises and encourage entrepreneurship.  The Agri-food sector was identified in the Departments analyses as being particularly exposed to Brexit.  The introduction of an income averaging \"step-out\" in the agriculture sector will help with the volatility Brexit may bring.

He also pointed out\u00a0that these breaches\u00a0are not large enough to bring fines.<\/p>  <p>  Taking each of these in turn, I and my Department have frequently highlighed\u00a0that the harmonised methodolgy used to calculate the structural balance is not suitable for a small open economy. \u00a0In Budget 2016, the forecast nominal general government deficit was about &euro;2.8 billion.  The forecast for 2016 in Budget 2017 is for a deficit of &euro;2.4 billion.\u00a0 Although\u00a0the forecast structural deficit\u00a0also\u00a0changed down from 2.5%\u00a0of GDP to 1.9%, the improvement was reduced to 0.3 per cent from 0.8 per cent because the forecast outturn for 2015 of\u00a0minus 3.2% turned into an outturn of 2.2% of GDP. \u00a0This is one reason why our\u00a0fiscal planning looks to\u00a0the expenditure benchmark in the first instance.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;200 million excess over permitted expenditure under the benchmark in 2017 is due to\u00a0the projected increase in our EU Budget contribution arising from the large revision in our GDP. \u00a0As this is a factor beyond our control, the Government has decided not to alter its\u00a0fiscal plans to cope with a one-off level shift in our EU\u00a0contribution. \u00a0It should be noted that the European Commission applies an overall assessment\u00a0encompassing performance against\u00a0both rules when assessing compliance.\u00a0 Accordingly, we expect that the European Commission will find that Ireland is broadly compliant with its obligation - indeed, I would point out that Ireland is one of\u00a0the countries that the\u00a0European Commission has not written to seeking clarification or changes.<\/p>  <p>  I do not agree that the fiscal rules are overly restrictive. \u00a0They are\u00a0designed to promote budgetary discipline and underpin sustainable economic growth.

The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) was established to increase and facilitate the availability of low cost, flexible credit to SMEs.  In this regard, it is encouraging to note that to the end of June 2016, the SBCI has lent &euro;347 million to 8,619 SMEs.

However, they have made enquiries and the centre appears to have opened in May 2016 and it accommodates some migrants as well as serving as a \"drop-in\" centre offering a range of general activities and supports.  There are a large number of migrant facilities in Athens.  Irish officials do not visit shelters as this is not the process for relocation agreed with the Greek Asylum Service or the mechanism set out in the relevant legal instruments.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the mechanism for relocating asylum seekers from Greece to Ireland is set out in Council Decisions 2015\/1523 and 2015\/1604 which establish provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Italy and of Greece.  According to Article 3(2) of the Council Decisions on relocation, relocation shall be applied only in respect of an applicant belonging to a nationality for which the proportion of decisions granting international protection among decisions taken at first instance on application for international protection as referred to in the Asylum Procedures Directive (Directive 2013\/32\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on common procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection) is, according to the latest available updated quarterly EU-wide average Eurostat data, 75% or higher.<\/p>  <p>  At the moment, under the established mechanisms, the main beneficiaries in Greece of the relocation programme are Syrians and Iraqis.  Iraqis are no longer on the list of eligible nationalities for relocation since the beginning of July having fallen below the 75% threshold.  However, those who registered before that deadline and applied to be relocated remain eligible for relocation.  These nationalities are a sub-set of the overall pool of migrants and asylum seekers in Greece.<\/p>  <p>  The process for relocation is that following receipt by Greece of a pledge from Ireland to consider accepting a given number of asylum seekers under relocation, the Greek Asylum Service forwards the files of asylum seekers from nationalities eligible for relocation who have registered with the Greek Asylum Service and indicated a willingness to participate in the relocation programme.  In order to become eligible for the relocation programme, an applicant would first have to apply for international protection and they must go through the identification, registration and fingerprinting procedure carried out by the Greek authorities.  Applicants must opt into the relocation programme; they must be from nationalities eligible for relocation and while they do not have a choice as to specific country they are sent to under relocation, efforts are made by the Greek Asylum Service to \"match\" them with a suitable country, including one for which they may have indicated a preference during their interview.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has submitted a schedule of pledges to Greece which covers all asylum seekers due to be relocated to Ireland under the Council Decisions.  The purpose in doing this is to allow the Greek Asylum Service to project manage the pledges made by Ireland and fit them into their schedule of pledges from numerous Member States.  This process is working well and Ireland has programmed pledges to September 2017 in respect of our full allocation under the relevant Council Decisions.<\/p>  <p>  Irish IRPP officials working on the ground in Athens, both from my Department and from other agencies, undertake vulnerability assessment interviews with approved applicants, conduct security screening (in the case of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) with those applicants, liaise with unaccompanied minors (in the case of Tusla officials), and undertake other activities relevant to the management of the pledges and the needs of asylum seekers eligible for relocation.  There is a clear process in place for the relocation of asylum seekers and that process is made known to all those eligible for relocation.  The Greek Asylum Service and related agencies such as the International Organisation for Migration and UNHCR are responsible for managing this process and Ireland devotes its resources on the grounds in Athens to working with bodies like these in order to ensure that we meet the needs of the asylum seekers that are due to be relocated to Ireland.

I have been informed that as of the 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 604 Garda&iacute; assigned to the (DMR) North Central.  For operational reasons it is not appropriate for me to comment on the strength of the detective units operating in the Division. <\/p>  <p>  At the request of the Commissioner earlier this year, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang-related crime in the Dublin area.  The Government approved some &euro;55 million to maintain the necessary policing response to tackle gangland and associated crime.  This funding provides for:<\/p>  <p>  - concentrated policing targeting gang related crime;<\/p>  <p>  - the continued intensive and strategic targeting of burglaries and related crime through ongoing support for Operation Thor; and<\/p>  <p>  - continued support for measures against terrorism.<\/p>  <p>  Funding was also approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit for the Dublin Metropolitan Region given the identified need to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the Emergency Response Unit.  The Dublin Armed Support Unit is, as a matter of priority, in the process of being set up, following a selection process training has commenced and it expected that the unit will be operational next month.  Steps are also being taken to ensure that the Unit is fully equipped and to upgrade the equipment available to the Emergency Response Unit and the Special Detective Unit.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that Operation Hybrid has been established to coordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and address public safety concerns about community safety.  As of 4 September 2016, there have been 38 arrests and 5 charges brought in connection with the recent shootings.  In addition, 23 firearms have been seized and over 9,000 lines of enquiry conducted.  In excess of 11,520 high visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units and a significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence is also being examined.  Operation Hybrid is reviewed on a weekly basis to maintain optimal impact.<\/p>  <p>  For 2017, I have secured a further &euro;71.5 million for Garda overtime which will facilitate the continuation of large scale policing operations including those targeting gangland crime and burglary.<\/p>  <p>  Underpinning the measures outlined above is the Government&rsquo;s intention to increase Garda numbers to 15,000.  While in the short term substantial funds are being made available for overtime, measures are in train to accelerate the planned Garda recruitment programme, along with the recruitment of further civilian and specialist staff.  In 2017 an extra 800 Gardai will be recruited as well as 500 civilian staff to ensure that the service is renewed and has the capacity to provide visible, responsive and effective policing to every community throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000067#WRD04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000068#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[34252\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000068#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to set out the current or anticipated residency status and eligibility for naturalisation in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned currently has permission to reside in the State until 7 August 2019.

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'. Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. <\/p>  <p>  Under the \u00a0Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation on 1 July 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else\u00a0the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.  In addition to compliance with Central Bank codes of conduct, credit servicing firms will have to demonstrate to the Central Bank that they have robust governance and adequate resources to ensure compliance with its obligations under Irish financial services legislation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, my Department will continue to keep all relevant legislation under review in order to ensure that borrowers whose loans have been sold are properly protected and do not lose any protections which they previously enjoyed.  In addition, the Department of Finance expect that the Central Bank, as regulator of credit servicing firms, will be vigilant in this area and raise any specific instances where they have found consumers have not had their protections upheld or that their positions have been disadvantaged.  No such instances have as yet been brought to the attention of the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Finally I would highlight that landlord-tenant relations are governed by multiple pieces of legislation mainly under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister\u00a0for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000069#WRF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ireland Strategic Investment Fund Investments","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000069#WRF00600"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[34094\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000069#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of funding which has been made available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund for social and affordable housing provision; if he has satisfied himself with the current rates of interest being charged to borrowers through the fund; if he is reviewing the operation of the mechanisms through which credit is accessed from the fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":220,"content":"<p>Policy initiatives in the area of housing must seek to address the challenges faced by the various sectors of the market, including the private owner occupier market, the rental market, and the social and affordable housing sector.

In this statement, I also highlighted the lack of transparency and predictability that currently characterise the rules.  Fiscal rules have become extremely complex and difficult to communicate publicly. Moreover, predictability as to how compliance assessment will be performed is lacking. <\/p>  <p>  I emphasised that although both democratic and political ownership of the fiscal rules in Ireland is strong, a robust defence of the benefit of such rules is becoming progressively more difficult, in particular where the perception arises that rules are being applied differently for small and large Member States.  It is essential that these rules are applied fairly and in a sensible and predictable manner. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my fellow\u00a0Finance Ministers and I are of a shared view that a certain\u00a0degree of flexibility within the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact is both necessary and\u00a0should be permitted in certain limited circumstances to better align with country-specific economic circumstances and investment needs.

Work was carried out in the Department to assess the potential economic and financial sector implications arising, including the commissioning of an ESRI study published in November 2015, and ongoing liaison with the Central Bank.  This work was undertaken within the whole-of-Government framework established by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  Following the results of the UK referendum, this preparatory work has been intensified across the Department.  A new Brexit Unit within the EU and International Division was established in July 2016 to oversee and coordinate this work and to act as a key liaison point with the Department of the Taoiseach, in particular.  In addition, the Department\u00a0of Finance staff complement in the Irish Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels has been strengthened.  Resourcing for Brexit is being kept under review.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2017, the Department of Finance published the Economic and Fiscal outlook which presented a full macroeconomic projection including updated estimates of economic growth, the public finances and the fiscal space, taking account inter alia of the impact of Brexit.  The Department also published 'Getting Ireland Brexit ready' which set out a number of measures to mitigate the initial impacts of Brexit. In addition, the Department published detailed analysis of sectoral exposure to Brexit across the economy.  More recently, the Department has worked with the ESRI to deepen the macroeconomic analysis and a report titled 'Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland' was published on 7 November 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The work being done by the Department will be an important input to ensuring that Ireland's interests are protected in the upcoming negotiations at EU level.  More generally, the Department will continue to monitor the economic impacts and to frame budgetary policy advice in this new\u00a0context.  The best and most immediate policy under the Government's\u00a0control is to prudently manage the\u00a0public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  In this context, Budget 2017 signalled a lower debt target of 45 per cent of GDP for the mid-to-late 2020s.  This will help to provide additional fiscal 'shock absorber' capacity to the public finances to help withstand any shock including the impact of Brexit.  This will complement the contingency or 'rainy day' fund to be established following the achievement of a balanced budget in 2018 which will help provide a further counter-cyclical buffer.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Financial Services, Minister of State Murphy T.D. has responsibility, and will continue to drive forward the IFS 2020 strategy in order to build on and compete for mobile international investment in the IFS sector.

This is available to self-employed individuals who have an active trade or profession, and who do not have access to the PAYE credit.  This will be a significant benefit to small business-owners right across the country including small retailers, publicans, farmers and tradesmen.  The Programme for Government also committed to introduce a PRSI scheme for the self-employed, and the Deputy will be aware that my colleague Minister Varadkar has announced a number of enhancements to the social protection benefits available to self-employed individuals.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that differences remain between the taxation of employees and the self-employed.

For instance, there are significant timing benefits, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer, which are available to the self-assessed but which are not available to PAYE workers.  The self-employed also continue to benefit from a broader expense deduction regime than that available to employees.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the taxation of the self-employed is considered in some detail in the Income Tax Reform Plan, and the issues outlined therein will be borne in mind when deciding future reform of the income tax system as it relates to the self-employed.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to other income tax commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government, these included a commitment to support parents who choose to stay at home and care for their children, through an increase in the Home Carer Credit.  In Budget 2017, I have provided for a &euro;100 increase in the Home Carer Credit, bringing it to a value of &euro;1,100.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Programme also committed to explore mechanisms through which SMEs can reward key employees with share options in a tax-efficient manner.  My Department held a public consultation on his subject earlier this year to which over 30 submissions were received and considered by my officials.  In Budget 2017 I announced my intention to introduce a new, SME-focussed, share-based incentive scheme, to be introduced in Budget 2018.  Such an incentive will require the approval of the European Commission and my officials will commence engagement with the Commission to ensure that the incentive will comply with State Aid rules in advance of the next Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000069#WRF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Institutions Levy","counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000069#WRF01900"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[34098\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000069#WRF02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a full report on the way the annual &euro;150 million banking levy will be calculated as it extends to 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":233,"content":"<p>In accordance with Section 126AA of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, an annual levy was imposed on\u00a0certain financial institutions\u00a0for each of the years 2014, 2015 and 2016.  The levy is charged at 35% of the Deposit Interest Retention Tax\u00a0(DIRT) paid by a financial institution in 2011 and raises approximately &euro;150 million annually for the Exchequer.  In the case of a financial institution where the amount of DIRT in the base year does not exceed &euro;100,000,\u00a0the levy is not payable.<\/p>  <p>  In last year's budget statement I announced that I intended to extend the levy for a further five years to 2021.  I indicated that the overall yield from the levy would be maintained at &euro;150 million annually but that I would undertake a review of the DIRT based methodology for calculating the\u00a0levy.<\/p>  <p>  That review, which included a public consultation on the issue, was undertaken by my Department earlier this year.  Following that review, I have decided that the DIRT based formula should be retained but that the base year for calculating the levy in 2017 and 2018 would be changed from 2011 to 2015.\u00a0 I have also decided to introduce a rolling two-year series of base years which will introduce a new base year of 2017 for calculating the levy in 2019 and 2020 and a new base year of 2019 for calculating the levy in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the rolling two-year series of base years has a twofold effect.  Firstly, it ensures that financial institutions entering the market over the five further years for which the levy will apply will be subject to the levy and\u00a0financial institutions exiting the market will cease to be subject to the levy. Secondly, it will help to correct, on an ongoing basis, any anomalies for individual institutions thrown up by prevailing market conditions, such as the interest rate offering, in any one year.<\/p>  <p>  In order to maintain the annual yield from the levy at &euro;150 million, I have to increase the rate at which the levy is\u00a0charged from 35% to 59% for 2017.  This is because the assessable amount, DIRT payments in 2015, have reduced significantly since 2011.  This new rate, combined with the new 2015 base year, will preserve the existing contribution of &euro;150 million paid by the affected financial institutions.  That rate will be subject to an annual review to ensure that the yield\u00a0from the levy is not impacted from changes in interest rates and\/or DIRT rates.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000069#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Programme for Government Implementation","counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000069#WRF02200"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[34099\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000069#WRF02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when he envisages the help to buy scheme as proposed under the programme for Government will be launched; the amount the scheme will cost; the level of assistance that will be offered under the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":236,"content":"<p>Subject to the approval of the Oireachtas of the Finance Bill 2016, potential applicants for\u00a0the Help to Buy scheme\u00a0will be able to register online with Revenue from 1 January 2017.

Nevertheless, the serious threat that criminal activity of this kind poses to legitimate and compliant businesses, consumers and the Exchequer is recognised, and action against it has accordingly been a priority for Revenue over recent years.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has implemented a comprehensive strategy to tackle the illegal fuel trade, including the introduction of stringent new supply chain controls underpinning a rigorous programme of enforcement action and supported by a range of new legislative measures that I brought forward in Finance Bills.  In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from the beginning of April 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity.  I believe that this work is being supported and facilitated by the setting up earlier this year, in the framework of \"A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan\", of the Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue.  I understand that strategic and tactical plans have been agreed by all stakeholders to ensure that the activities of the agencies concerned are targeted as effectively as possible against those responsible for this form of criminality.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue works in close cooperation also with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat the illicit fuel trade.<\/p>  <p>  An analysis of the oil market undertaken by Revenue in 2015 indicates that the wide-ranging programmes of action taken against fuel fraud have had a significant impact on illegal activity.  This is borne out by feedback from fuel traders and their representative bodies, who report a significant reduction in the incidence of laundered fuel.  In addition, Revenue carried out an extensive random sampling programme early in 2016 which tested for the presence of the new fuel marker in the storage tanks of forecourt fuel retailers.  No samples tested positive for the new fuel marker.<\/p>  <p>  The penalties for offences relating to fuel smuggling and laundering are laid down in section 119 of the Finance Act 2001 and section 102 of the Finance Act 1999.  On conviction following summary prosecution under these provisions, a court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both.  Where a person is convicted for an indictable offence, the court may impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970, or both.  In addition, for an indictable offence under section 119 of the Finance Act 2001, if the value of the smuggled fuel concerned exceeds &euro;250,000, including duty and taxes, the court may impose a penalty of three times the value of the fuel, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or both.  The penalties were increased in the Finance Act 2010 to an amount significantly higher than that which had applied previously.  For example, the fine on conviction for an indictable offence was increased from &euro;12,695 to an amount not exceeding &euro;126,970.<\/p>  <p>  The courts decide on the level of fine to be applied in any particular case and, in practice, they do not apply fines up to the existing limits.

I recently published an Update on Ireland's International Tax Strategy which sets out what we have done and what we plan to do regarding the\u00a0implementation of the OECD BEPS recommendations.  In respect of the 15 BEPS reports:<\/p>  <p>  - BEPS Actions 2, 3 and 4 put forward recommendations that have been legislated for\u00a0in the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive.  The Directive will therefore see three of the\u00a0key OECD BEPS recommendations implemented consistently\u00a0across Europe.  These are rules targeting hybrid mismatches, interest deductibility rules and Controlled Foreign Company rules. Ireland will implement these changes in line with agreed deadlines set out in the Directive.<\/p>  <p>  - Action 5 developed the modified nexus approach for IP regimes.  Ireland's Knowledge Development Box was introduced in line with this approach.  The Knowledge Development Box\u00a0was reviewed by the OECD's Forum on Harmful Tax Practice and was declared to be\u00a0the\u00a0first such incentive to be fully compliant with the\u00a0modified nexus rules agreed in BEPS Action 5.<\/p>  <p>  - Action 5 also makes recommendations on exchange of information.  Ireland is\u00a0implementing the\u00a0exchange of information requirements fully\u00a0 in respect of tax rulings set out in this report.<\/p>  <p>  - Actions 6,\u00a07 and 14\u00a0make a series\u00a0recommendations for updating\u00a0tax treaties to prevent tax treaty shopping and improve dispute resolution.  The BEPS multilateral instrument (MLI) will ensure that tax treaties are updated to reflect these BEPS recommendations.  The MLI\u00a0is close to being agreed at the OECD.\u00a0Ireland has played an active part in this work.<\/p>  <p>  - Actions 8 to 10 provide recommendations on transfer pricing.  In May this year, new transfer pricing rules were agreed at the OECD.  As set out in the recent update on Irreland's international tax strategy we are now considering what changes are required to ensure that Ireland's transfer pricing rules meet the standards set in the OECD transfer pricing guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  - Action 12 recommends the introduction of\u00a0mandatory disclosure rules for promoters of tax schemes.  Ireland is one of the few countries to already have mandatory disclosure rules in our domestic legislation.<\/p>  <p>  - Action 13 recommends countries  introduce\u00a0country-by-country reporting.  Ireland legislated for country-by-country reporting in Finance Act 2015 and signed a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement in January 2016 to share these reports with other tax authorities<\/p>  <p>  - The remaining BEPS reports,\u00a0Actions 1, 11 and 15, do not make any specific recommendations.  Further work continues on the areas examined by these reports in various OECD working parties and Ireland is actively engaging in this work. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to take actions needed to implement the BEPS reports.  The review of Ireland s corporation tax code, which has been launched with Budget 2017, will include consideration of what further actions Ireland may need to take to ensure we are fully compliant with the OECD BEPS recommendations.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000070#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":283,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000070#WRG02250"},{"type":"question","counter":284,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[34127\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000070#WRG02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the State's implementation of the anti-tax avoidance directive; the legislative or regulatory steps he plans to take to complete its implementation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":285,"content":"<p>The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive was agreed by Member States following ECOFIN on 17 June 2016.  The Directive includes five significant corporate tax anti-avoidance measures.  Three of the measures derive from the non-binding elements of the OECD BEPS process, with the remaining two measures coming from the European Commission's previous Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) Directive.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the measures that are derived from the non-binding elements of the BEPS\u00a0process, namely the controlled foreign company rules, the hybrid mismatch rules and the interest limitation rules, these measures must be implemented by Member States by 1 January\u00a02019.  However,\u00a0the provisions on interest deductions (the interest limitation rule)\u00a0may be deferred until 2024 for countries that already have strong targeted interest rules.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Directive also proposes that an exit tax must be applied when a company moves its residence, its assets or a branch out of a Member State. Ireland currently has an exit tax which will be reviewed to determine what changes may be needed to ensure it is in line with the Directive.  The exit tax will need to be implemeneted by 1 January\u00a02020.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Directive also proposes that Member States introduce a general anti-avoidance rule which disregards any non-genuine arrangements which are carried out by a company for the purpose of gaining a tax advantage.\u00a0 Ireland in fact\u00a0already has\u00a0a similar General Anti-Avoidance Rule in our domestic tax law since the 1980s.

The Deputy will also know that the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out statutory requirements for mortgage lenders and credit servicing firms dealing with borrowers in or facing arrears on the mortgage loan secured by their primary residence.<\/p>  <p>  The CCMA\u00a0includes guidelines on how co-operating borrowers are to be treated before legal action can commence.  It is important to also note that the commencement of the court process is not a signal that a repossession will occur it may often be the case that the process then prompts borrowers to re-engage with their bank and to find a solution.  Often these cases are adjourned to allow both parties time to find a sustainable solution.  Borrowers should also consider other options such as a Personal Insolvency Arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the question of loans that have been sold to third parties,\u00a0the Deputy will be aware that the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated entity.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes, such as the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.  The Act means that any purchasers of loans books are required either to become regulated themselves by the Central Bank or use a regulated credit servicing firm to service their loans.<\/p>  <p>  The numbers in mortgage arrears have been steadily declining.  Data released by the Central Bank on 13 September shows that to end-Q2 2016, the number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses (PDH) has declined for the last\u00a0twelve quarters.  Some 120,614 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured.  It is clear that where a borrower actively engages with their lender under the CCMA\u00a0with a view to agreeing a sustainable arrangement to address their mortgage arrears, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that the borrower will be able to remain in their family home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000071#WRH02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Competitiveness","counter":320,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000071#WRH02600"},{"type":"question","counter":321,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[34275\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000071#WRH02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the economy continues to remain competitive when compared to other competing jurisdictions within the European Union and without; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":322,"content":"<p>Significant progress has been made in recent years in improving Ireland's competitiveness.

The pick-up in residential property price growth over the last two months follows several months of moderation, most likely reflecting the impact of Central Bank's macro-prudential measures.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market including property prices.  The recently announced Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing affirms the Government's commitment to restore the housing market to a sustainable equilibrium with 84 actionable measures across five key pillars namely Address Homelessness, Accelerate Social Housing, Build More Homes, Improve the Rental Sector and Utilise Existing Housing.  Progress in delivering on these actions is being monitored on an ongoing basis and the first quarterly progress report has recently been published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000071#WRH03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Policy","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000071#WRH03400"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[34279\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000071#WRH03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which corrective fiscal or budgetary measures are required over the next six years to ensure sustainable economic growth without over reliance on any particular sector; the extent to which he expects the economy to perform throughout this period and to remain amenable to job creation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>Budget 2017, which I presented last month, sets a general government deficit target of 0.4 per cent of GDP for 2017, following the projected deficit of 0.9 per cent of GDP this year.  This will keep us on course to achieve our medium term target of a balanced budget in structural terms, defined as a structural deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP, in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted these calculations are highly sensitive and are a function of a number of factors including our deficit performance which is contingent upon the continuation of prudent fiscal policies, consistent with the EU fiscal rules.  Any deviation from this budgetary path could jeopardise achievement of this central assumption of our fiscal policy, particularly in relation to the post 2018 years when fiscal space opens up significantly on foot of achievement of a balanced budget in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's macroeconomic forecasts, which underpin the Budget, show growth of 4.2 per cent this year and 3.5 per cent next year.  The growth outlook for next year has been revised downwards by approximately &frac12; percentage point reflecting the uncertainty arising from the UK decision to leave the European Union.  Over the medium-term (2018-2021) the economy is projected to grow in line with potential at around 3 per cent per annum on average.  This growth is projected to be more balanced with strong positive contributions expected from both domestic demand and net exports.<\/p>  <p>  The short-term outlook for the labour market also remains positive. For this year, employment growth of 2.6 per cent (52,000 jobs) is projected, with the unemployment rate set to average 8.3 per cent.  For next year, employment gains of 2.1 per cent (43,000 jobs) are anticipated, with unemployment set to average 7.7 per cent. Employment growth averaging 1&frac34; per cent per annum is envisaged over the 2018-2021 period.  Aggregate labour supply is projected to continue to expand over the medium-term supported by a resumption in positive net migration and a pick-up in participation rates.  As a result, the unemployment rate is expected to fall towards 6 per cent by 2021.<\/p>  <p>  My Department closely monitors developments at macro- fiscal level and economic performance at a sectoral level. Government policy will continue to guard against the build-up of sectoral imbalances and to avoid over-dependence on a single sector, as was previously the case with Ireland's construction sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Fiscal and Economic Outlook published with the Budget notes that the economic landscape is characterised by considerable uncertainty at present, with risks firmly tilted to the downside.  A number of specific risks are identified, including those arising from further sterling depreciation and a \"hard\" Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  In view of such risks, it is appropriate that we should enhance our fiscal shock absorption capacity.  The Government has therefore decided to establish a rainy day fund, starting in 2019, once we have achieved a balanced budget in 2018 as envisaged.  This will be both a counter cyclical measure to avoid overheating, and will also enable us to deal with the initial effects of any shock that may occur.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is also appropriate to take additional measures.  While our debt ratio has fallen from a high of 120 per cent in 2013 to an expected 76 per cent this year it remains high in value and by comparison with others.  The Government has therefore decided to set a new domestic target of a debt to GDP ratio of 45 per cent\u00a0to be reached by the mid-2020s or thereafter depending on economic growth well inside the 60 per cent required by the Stability and Growth Pact to take account of the particular risks that Ireland, as a small and very open economy, faces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000071#WRH03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Availability","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000071#WRH03700"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[34280\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000071#WRH03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he expects credit availability to small and medium-sized enterprises to improve in line with requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.

However the impact of the UK's exit from the EU on the Irish economy in the medium and long-term will become clearer as the trade arrangements between the UK and EU are settled. In order to take account of the issues emerging, in Budget 2017 my Department took Brexit into consideration in both its framing and its detail. In terms of framing, my Department incorporated the potential impact of Brexit into the macroeconomic forecasts for next year that underpinned Budget 2017. My Department also published an in-depth analysis of the sectors of the Irish economy and highlighted those with the greatest trade exposure to the UK. In light of the findings of the Department of Finance's in-depth sector analysis a number of taxation measures were announced in the Budget, with a view to getting Ireland \"Brexit ready\".<\/p>  <p>  At a\u00a0macroeconomic level Budget 2017 sought to build up Ireland's buffers to any fallout from Brexit. Accordingly the Government has decided to set a new domestic target of a debt to GDP ratio of 45 percent to be reached by the mid-2020s, or thereafter, depending on economic growth. This will improve Ireland ability to absorb a shock in addition to the rainy day fund announced in the Summer Economic Statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000072#WRJ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Loan Books Purchasers","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000072#WRJ01750"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[34360\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000072#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he will take to modify the impact on business here with particular reference to small and medium sized enterprises that have been affected by the off loading of loan books to third parties by various lending institutions, some of whom have ceased to trade in this jurisdiction but whose banking activities had a major negative impact which results in the collapse of the banking system here whether with or without the approval of the Central Bank and ECB; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":361,"content":"<p>The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 was enacted in July 2015 in order to\u00a0ensure that borrowers, including SMEs, maintained regulatory protections when their loans were\u00a0sold on to third parties.<\/p>  <p>  It was introduced to fill a consumer protection gap that existed where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm. The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.\u00a0 Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. <\/p>  <p>  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, following a review in 2015, the Central Bank Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Sized Enterprises has been strengthened resulting in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation on 1 July 2016.

The report noted, however, that this is an indicative estimate, which is subject to certain growth conditions to be met, and\u00a0that it is unrealistic to assume that the report can predict exactly the quantum of future student demand of Ss. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The extent of funding required to provide for S support in future years will, therefore, take into account the actual demand which transpires annually, while also taking into account the significant increases in S numbers recently provided in 2016.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Data underpinning the S Scheme,\u00a0as set out in the FPA, shows that overall the student to S ratio has increased from 2.2 in 2011\/2012 to 2.5 in 2015\/2016 due to changes in student numbers, the profile of disability of students and the S allocation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the S to Pupil ratio varies across the school sector from mainstream class to special class to special school. In 2015 there was 1 S for 2.2 eligible children in Mainstream classes, 3.2 children in special classes and 3.31 children in special schools. As more Ss are introduced to schools it would be expected that the ratio of Ss to eligible pupils would move closer to that in special classes and schools. <\/p>  <p>  I recently requested the NCSE to lead a comprehensive review of the S scheme, in consultation with other relevant Departments and State Agencies, including the National Disability Authority (NDA) and in that context to:<\/p>  <p>  - Identify and recommend how, in the future, the additional care needs of students, over and above those needs that could be reasonably\u00a0expected to be managed by teaching staff, should be met and<\/p>  <p>  - recommend the most appropriate form of support options to provide\u00a0better outcomes for students with Special Educational Needs who\u00a0have additional care needs, having regard to the significant amount of State investment in this area.<\/p>  <p>  This comprehensive review will include a literature review of international and country studies to compare international norms.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE\u00a0will report to me on\u00a0the progress of this review in May 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000073#WRK03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Admissions","counter":413,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000073#WRK03300"},{"type":"question","counter":414,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[34236\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000073#WRK03400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the admissions legislation proposed by the Government will allow the NCSE to require a school to establish a special class where there is sufficient local demand for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":415,"content":"<p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill was published on 6 July 2016.

Where the school is the sole primary school on an island the school will be able to appoint a second teacher.\u00a0 In relation to single teacher schools generally with an enrolment of 15 or more pupils the school can apply to the staffing appeal board for a second post where the single teacher\u00a0has children across 6 or more class groups.\u00a0 The detailed arrangements will be set out in the staffing schedule circular for the 2017\/18 school year. <\/p>  <p>  The cost of restoring the 2011\/12 staffing schedule for small schools would be approximately &euro;7.5m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000074#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Educational Disadvantage","counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000074#WRL01450"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[34248\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000074#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the costs associated with the educational disadvantage committee for each year of its duration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>The role of the Education Disadvantage Committee was to advise the Minister for Education and Science on policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage. <\/p><p>Expenditure by\u00a0the Department in respect of the EDC during its term of office was as follows:<\/p><p>2003 -\u00a0 &euro;38,000<\/p><p>2004 -\u00a0 &euro;62,000<\/p><p>2005 -\u00a0 &euro;75,000<\/p><p>2006 -\u00a0 &euro;700<\/p><p>The Committee's term of office expired in 2005.<\/p><p>The relevant legislative provision for\u00a0the establishment of the Educational Disadvantage Committee was repealed by\u00a0Section 7 of the Education (Amendment Act) 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000074#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Funding","counter":448,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000074#WRL01650"},{"type":"question","counter":449,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[34289\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000074#WRL01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his Department's costings and timeframes of delivery for his recently announced action plan for education; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":450,"content":"<p>In September, I launched the first ever Action Plan for Education aimed at making the Irish education and training service the best in Europe by 2026.

","asker":"1252","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":456,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 to 167, inclusive, together.  <\/p><p>The objective of the Seniors Alert Scheme is to encourage support for vulnerable older people in our communities through the provision of personal monitored alarms to enable them to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind.  Funding is available under the Scheme towards the purchase by a registered community-based organisation of equipment, i.e. a personal alarm and\/or pendant, while the associated monitoring and service charges are the responsibility of the individual participant. <\/p><p>As part of a review of the Scheme in 2010, one of the recommendations was that a centralised procurement process would simplify the Scheme.  By decreasing the level of administration for the community-based organisations, this would allow them to spend more time on the key aim of the Scheme, which is enhanced engagement with older members of the community.  It would also achieve value for money through economies of scale.<\/p><p>My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and, arising from this, it was decided that the Scheme should be managed by Pobal, given its significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government.  The management and administration of the Scheme transferred from the Department to Pobal on 7 September 2015. <\/p><p>The community based organisations that wish to support older people with the supply of personal monitored alarms are required to register with Pobal before operating the scheme.  It is important to stress that a paper-based registration process is available to facilitate those community-based organisations unable to register online.\u00a0 Pobal also operates a telephone helpline facility to assist with any queries (tel. no. 01 5117222). <\/p><p>Once registered, the community-based organisations can then submit participant applications on behalf of elderly people living in their defined area of operation.  There is no closing date for receipt of registrations. <\/p><p>This new approach was designed to reduce the administrative burden for the many hundreds of community and voluntary organisations registered under the Scheme, who provide an excellent service for the elderly.  It also enables the organisations to concentrate on the main purpose of the Scheme, namely to support and interact with the elderly in their local communities.  This will enhance the outcome for both beneficiaries and community groups alike.<\/p><p>Pobal are currently undertaking a general review of the Scheme.  This review will identify potential improvements, including technological advances.  On completion of the review, a new Scheme will be put in place.  Consultation with relevant stakeholders, including local communities, service users and civic organisations, is a key component of the review, the results of which will inform my Department&rsquo;s policy on the future direction of the Senior Alerts Scheme. <\/p><p>The data relating to the number of persons benefitting from alarms and the number of groups which administer the scheme is set out in the following tables.  As a result of the transfer of administration of this scheme from my Department to Pobal in September 2015, the information contained in Table 1 relates to the period from 1 January 2014 to 6 September 2015, while the information contained in Tables 2 and 3 relates to the period from 7 September 2015 to date.  It should be noted that, following the transfer of the scheme to Pobal, all community-based organisations that wished to support older people with the supply of monitored alarms were required to register with Pobal. <\/p><p><b>Table 1<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th colspan=\"2\">Number of Organisations Submitting Claims<\/th><th colspan=\"2\">Number of

Eligible organisations do not have to be specifically listed on the Register of Charities.<\/p>  <p>  Organisations wishing to offer work placements, or requiring certain work to be undertaken, can contact their local IB.  Each IB provides an easy to navigate application process.

Additionally, the IB will meet representatives of the applicant organisation and organise an inspection of the works to be undertaken.<\/p>  <p>  While the type of work undertaken is determined locally, it must be consistent with the terms and conditions of the T&uacute;s scheme.

These are attended by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the First and deputy First Ministers and, where relevant to her portfolio, the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice.  I represent the Government at these meetings.  The last review was held on 29 June 2016, and the next meeting has been scheduled for 14 December.<\/p><p>There has been sustained progress with the implementation of the Fresh Start Agreement over the last year, with each administration actively pursuing the necessary work to fulfil the respective commitments. <\/p><p>Together with the Minister for Justice and Equality, I hosted a trilateral ministerial meeting on enhancing law enforcement co-operation on the island, as envisaged by the Fresh Start Agreement, in Farmleigh on 21 December 2015.  This meeting, which included the two Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive, also launched the Joint Agency Task Force on cross-border crime.<\/p><p>The Joint Agency Task Force quickly became fully operational and is progressing its work to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime and bring to justice those involved in it.  The Task Force builds on existing operational arrangements to tackle organised crime, including that linked to paramilitarism, on a cross-border basis.  The Task Force reports on its work to the two Justice Ministers within the framework of their regular meetings under the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Criminal Justice Co-operation, as provided for in the Fresh Start Agreement.<\/p><p>The Government is meeting<s>s<\/s>its commitments as regards infrastructure projects<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>under the Fresh Start Agreement.  This includes a contribution of &euro;25 million from the Irish Government in 2019 for the upgrading of the A5 Western Transport Corridor road project, which is in addition to the &euro;50 million previously committed.  The Government&rsquo;s committed funding of &euro;2.5 million to the North West Development Fund has been provided and is to be matched by the NI Executive.  Discussions are continuing at senior official level with the Northern Ireland Executive regarding co-operation on other infrastructure projects, including the Narrow Water Bridge project and the Ulster Canal and exploring financing options for future border infrastructure projects.<\/p><p>As provided for in Fresh Start, a three-person Panel was appointed in December to recommend the elements of a strategy for the disbandment of paramilitary groups.  This panel, comprising Lord John Alderdice, Monica McWilliams, and John McBurney, made over forty recommendations.  The Northern Ireland Executive updated the June review meeting on its then draft Action Plan to take these recommendations forward.  In July, the Northern Ireland Executive published its Action Plan on Tackling Paramilitary Activity, Criminality and Organised Crime. <\/p><p>The Northern Ireland Executive is committed to carrying out research into the social costs and implications of paramilitarism; to undertake a public awareness campaign on the harms done by paramilitarism and organised crime; and to report on efforts to tackle paramilitarism which will be linked to wider cross-Departmental and statutory agency work programmes aimed at reducing community divisions and the causes of sectarianism. <\/p><p>On 13 September, I signed an international agreement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to establish the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC).  The Fresh Start Agreement provides that the IRC will report annually on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland.  These reports will inform future Northern Ireland Executive Programme for Government commitments through to 2021. The Government will shortly bring forward legislative proposals before the Oireachtas to establish the IRC in law.  The aim is to get the IRC established and up and running as soon as possible. <\/p><p>The NI Executive and the British Government are also proceeding with implementation of their respective commitments under the Fresh Start Agreement.  The Executive signed off on the 2016-17 Budget last December and the Welfare Bill implementing the relevant provisions in the Agreement passed into UK law on 25 November 2015.  The UK Treasury has also approved the release of monies from the Stormont House Agreement funding to support integrated education. <\/p><p>The institutional reforms provided for under the Fresh Start Agreement have also been implemented, including the reduction in the number of Executive Ministries from 12 to 9 and the option for parties entitled to a place in the Executive to instead designate as part of the formal opposition in the Assembly.  This option was taken up by both the UUP and SDLP following the Assembly election last May. <\/p><p>In June, the Co-Chairs and members of the Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition Commission were appointed by the Northern Ireland Executive and the Commission is now progressing its work, as foreseen in the Stormont House Agreement and reiterated in Fresh Start. <\/p><p>With regard to the establishment of a framework for dealing with the legacy of the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement but on which final agreement could not be reached during the Fresh Start Agreement talks, the Government remains committed to the full implementation of these commitments. <\/p><p>I am continuing to engage with the Secretary of State and with the Northern Ireland Executive and other parties in Northern Ireland, to see how we can to find a route to a final agreement on legacy issues.  While there remain a number of outstanding issues, there is an urgent need to achieve progress - so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  I am therefore working to secure the necessary political agreement to get the legacy bodies established and up and running as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000077#WRO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":554,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000077#WRO01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Supervisors","counter":553,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000077#WRO01700"},{"type":"question","counter":554,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[34135\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000077#WRO01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to honour the Labour Court recommendation, LCR 19293, to community employment supervisors and move immediately to implement its findings and put in place a pension ex gratia scheme for same or in view of statements (details supplied) from the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":555,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to\u00a0my answer to\u00a0Parliamentary Question No. 272 of 8 November 2016 which sets out the position on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000077#WRO01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":556,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000077#WRO02000"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[34143\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000077#WRO02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the cost of implementing the pre-January 2011 pay scales for all post-December 2010 entrants to all\u00a0public service recruitment grades; if he will provide a comparison of the salaries and allowances of each post-December 2010 public service recruitment grade with their pre-January 2011 equivalents, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":558,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 388 of 5 July 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000077#WRO02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000077#WRO02300"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[34148\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000077#WRO02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding flooding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) has maintenance responsibility only for those Catchment Drainage Schemes and Flood Relief Schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995.<\/p><p>The watercourses in the location referred to by the Deputy do not form part of any OPW maintained arterial drainage scheme and, as such, this Office has no responsibility for their maintenance.

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and debilitating. Many infected people have no symptoms at all.  The commonest noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called erythema migrans that is seen in about 80 to 90% of patients.  This red, raised skin rash (often called a bulls-eye rash) develops between 3 days and a month after a tick bite and spreads outwards from the initial bite site. People can also complain of 'flu-like symptoms such as headache, sore throat, neck stiffness, fever, muscle aches and general fatigue.  Occasionally, there may be more serious symptoms involving the nervous system, joints, the heart or other tissues.  Lyme Disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe. <\/p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis is a notifiable infectious disease, the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form, Lyme neuroborreliosis. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects and collates surveillance data on the condition. The Weekly Infectious Disease Report, published by the HPSC on 26 October 2016, indicated that for week 42-2016 (16\/10\/16-22\/10\/16) there have been 16 cases notified so far in 2016 &ndash; an increase of 5 on the same period last year. However, the diverse and unspecific nature of the symptoms means that a number of the less serious cases may not be diagnosed, leading to an underreporting of cases.  Recent estimates suggest that there may be up to 50-100 cases in Ireland per year.<\/p>  <p>  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered. In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2006.  This pharmacological regime can be summarised thus:<\/p>  <p>  -  Doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime for the treatment of adults with early localized or early disseminated Lyme disease associated with erythema migrans, in the absence of specific neurologic manifestations (ceftriaxone in early Lyme disease for adults with acute neurologic disease manifested by meningitis or radiculopathy);<\/p>  <p>  -  Doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime for adults with Lyme arthritis but without clinical evidence of neurologic disease;<\/p>  <p>  -  For late neurological disease in adults - intravenous ceftriaxone, cefotaxime or Penicillin G.<\/p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency and an Environmental Health Officer. representation has also been sought from a Lyme Disease advocacy group.<\/p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference of the Sub-Committee are:<\/p>  <p>  -  To raise awareness in Ireland of Lyme Borreliosis amongst clinicians and the general public;<\/p>  <p>  -  To identify and highlight best international practice in raising awareness about Lyme Borreliosis for the general public;<\/p>  <p>  -  To develop policies of primary prevention of Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland based on best international practice;<\/p>  <p>  -  To explore ways in which to improve surveillance of neuroborreliosis in Ireland;<\/p>  <p>  -  To develop strategies to raise awareness among the general public particularly in areas of higher tick populations;<\/p>  <p>  -  To produce a Final Report covering all the above areas.<\/p>  <p>  The initial work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involves a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland for general practitioners, and ongoing work in drawing together the Final Report of the Sub-committee.The Sub-Committee  is expected to report in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000079#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":626,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000079#WRQ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":627,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[34193\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000079#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an early date for a hip operation will be arranged at Waterford Regional Hospital in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":628,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis. The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State. In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:<\/p><p>- Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;<\/p><p>- Price(s) previously charged;<\/p><p>- Local market price; and<\/p><p>- Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.<\/p><p>The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, which was published in July 2015, committed to a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:<\/p><p>- Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;<\/p><p>- Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and<\/p><p>- Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.<\/p><p>Work has been under way on this Review for a number of months now and it is expected to be completed in the coming months.<\/p><p>The HSE has recently published the cost of care for all public nursing homes.

It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The implementation process for any strategy is vital for its success.  I chair the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), with high level representatives from all the relevant Departments and State agencies.  The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis, in order to identify and solve problems quickly.  Stakeholders regularly present to the committee meetings on their priorities for particular sectors or themes and by the end of this year, the HLIC will have reviewed in detail progress on the five cross-cutting themes and the twelve individual sectors outlined in Food Wise 2025. <\/p>  <p>  In July this year, I launched the first annual progress report of Food Wise 2025: Steps to Success 2016.  Food Wise Steps to Success showed that, of the 330 detailed actions which were due to commence in 2015 or 2016, 28% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken; and a further 67% have commenced and are progressing well.  I believe that this is a good start and I will press on to get as many actions as possible completed within the next year. <\/p>  <p>  In the light of the UK vote to leave the EU I convened a\u00a0special meeting of the High Level Implementation Committee to\u00a0consider the immediate impact of the UK decision.  I intend to include this issue as a standard item on the agenda of each future meeting of the HLIC.  It is clear that ensuring action is taken on the Food Wise recommendations, particularly those related to market development, competitiveness and innovation, assumes even greater importance in the light of the UK decision.  However, I see no compelling reason at this point to review the strategy. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000082#WRT03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Aid","counter":776,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000082#WRT03100"},{"type":"question","counter":777,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[34137\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000082#WRT03200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding the low cost loan scheme for farmers as outlined in budget 2017; the opening date for applications; the type of loans provided; and the purpose these loans will serve.

The aim of the RHI is to build on the progress already made in the renewable heating sector and to help reach Ireland&rsquo;s 12% target by 2020. In 2015, it is estimated that 6.5% of heat was derived from renewable sources. The proposed RHI scheme is <\/font>aimed at supporting larger industrial and commercial installations outside of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. From a national policy perspective, the focus on the non-ETS sector is likely to accrue a double benefit for the Irish taxpayer, helping to meet our renewable energy target and reduce emissions in the non-ETS sector, simultaneously.<\/p><p>Analysis to date suggests that it would not be cost effective, at this stage, to include the domestic heating sector in the RHI.

In addition, where legislative proposals are to be considered by Cabinet Committees, RIAs should be prepared by Departments, for consideration by relevant Senior Officials' Groups, prior to their discussion by such Committees.<\/p>  <p>  According to the 2009 Revised RIA Guidelines, it is not compulsory to apply RIA to the Finance Bill, and emergency, security and some criminal legislation. Other circumstances in which the RIA need not be used include the case of a regulatory proposal consolidating existing legislation and where no regulatory changes are being introduced; if legislation is drafted as a result of a court decision which leaves no discretion to consider alternative options or allow for meaningful consultation; where primary legislation is required to ratify international treaties which the Government has already signed up to and the proposed legislation does not go beyond the Treaty provisions and is only ratifying the Treaty &ndash; though if there are additional regulatory requirements then an RIA should be produced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000085#WRW02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Competitiveness","counter":907,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000085#WRW02150"},{"type":"question","counter":908,"qnumday":331,"qnumall":"[34325\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000085#WRW02200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on Ireland's fall to 18th on the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business 2017 report, representing decline in consecutive years in this ranking; the steps being taken to improve competitiveness in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":909,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs, which is co-ordinated and developed by my Department since 2012, has set out a comprehensive set of measures to improve our competitiveness performance. Substantial progress has been made in terms of improving Ireland's competitiveness in recent years and we have climbed from 15<sup>th<\/sup>to 7<sup>th<\/sup>in the 2016 IMD competitiveness rankings. We have moved from 24<sup>th<\/sup>to 23<sup>rd<\/sup>in the WEF Competitiveness Report and we are now ranked 18ths out of 190 countries in the World Bank Doing Business report.<\/p><p>The World Bank's Doing Business report looks at domestic, primarily small and medium size companies and measures the regulations applying to them through their life cycle. Based on standardised case studies, it presents quantitative indicators on business regulation that can be compared across 190 economies and over time. Doing Business goes beyond identifying that a problem exists and points to specific regulations or regulatory procedures that may lend them to reform.<\/p><p>In the 2017 report, Ireland&rsquo;s was ranked 18<sup>th<\/sup>&ndash; down 3 places, compared with our revised 2016 ranking. While this is disappointing, Ireland is ranked 8<sup>th <\/sup>amongst EU member states. Doing Business also highlights many strengths &ndash; for example, we are ranked 5<sup>th<\/sup>for &ldquo;paying taxes&rdquo; and 10<sup>th<\/sup>for &ldquo;starting a business&rdquo;. <\/p><p>Furthermore, in terms of the Distance to Frontier benchmark - which measures Ireland&rsquo;s score against the benchmark set by the best performing economy across ten different category headings &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s performance has actually improved slightly since 2016. Of course, other countries are also striving to improve their business environments, hence the improvement in our score but drop in our ranking.<\/p><p>This serves to remind us that competitiveness is a relative measure. The process of reform and improvement must be continuous. <\/p><p>I would also note that Ireland is a strong performer in other international competitiveness rankings &ndash; this year, for instance, we are ranked 7<sup>th<\/sup>out of 61 countries in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook - an improvement of 9 places from last year. <\/p><p>In July of this year, the National Competitiveness Council published its annual <i>Competitiveness Scorecard<\/i>benchmarking report which provides an in-depth assessment of all aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness performance. The Council found that while Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved in recent years &ndash;and has been central to recent strong economic growth, a number of threats persist, not least of which is Brexit. <\/p><p>The analysis contained in the Scorecard report is informing the development of the Council&rsquo;s annual policy report <i>Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge 2016<\/i>which I will shortly be brining to Government for consideration and which will contain a range of actions to enhance competitiveness. <\/p><p>My officials will continue to monitor publications such as the World Bank Doing Business report. Further actions and reforms - driven by the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs which is currently being prepared - will enable us to further narrow the gap with the world&rsquo;s most competitive countries and improve the ease of doing business, ultimately helping us to achieve our objective of sustainable full employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000085#WRW02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth","counter":910,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000085#WRW02350"},{"type":"question","counter":911,"qnumday":332,"qnumall":"[34326\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111000085#WRW02400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her plans to immediately review Enterprise 2025 with respect to forecasts outlined on, for example, employment, unemployment and exports, considering the document was published in November 2015 in advance of the June Brexit referendum; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":912,"content":"<p>Enterprise 2025 set out the Government's ambitions for sustainable enterprise, employment and export growth.
