Our witnesses today are An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny TD, and Mr. Richard Bruton TD.  Gentlemen, you're both welcome before the inquiry this morning.<\/p> <p>  Today, the inquiry will focus upon the roles of the Oireachtas and the effectiveness of the Oireachtas oversight of the Government in the build-up to the crisis and in responding to the crisis.  In particular, our focus will be on three lines of inquiry.  The effectiveness of the Oireachtas in scrutinising public policy on the banking sector and the economy, the analysis of the key drivers for budget policy and the appropriateness of the relationships between the Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector.  <\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach and Minister Bruton are, therefore, appearing before the inquiry today in the context of their respective roles as leader of Fine Gael, while in opposition, and as the Fine Gael spokesperson on finance, while in opposition.<\/p> <p>  In normal proceedings when a witness comes before the inquiry, I read out privilege to the witness but as both our  witnesses today are actually Members of the House, they effectively are and categorically are already covered by witness, so I don't have to extend that right as I usually would.  But I would say that you are directed by the  chairperson this morning and you are directed to only give evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings, and as to be given.<\/p> <p>  I would remind members and those present that are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right and members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and should not publish any of the documents so displayed.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.

T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och d&iacute;ot as ucht an cuireadh teacht anseo agus t&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta a bheith ag freastal ar an ... ag an chomhcoiste.  I am pleased to appear before the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis following the direction, which was given pursuant to section 67 of the House of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013, by you as Chairman.  We would hope that the inquiry can generate new insights into the cause of the banking crash and related collapse, that help policy-makers ensure that a mistake and mistakes made at that time are never again repeated.  <\/p> <p>  I've been asked to appear here in my capacity as leader of Fine Gael, between 2002 and 2007, specifically in relation to the areas that you've mentioned, the effectiveness of the Oireachtas in scrutinising public policy on the banking sector and on the economy.  Secondly, analysis of the main drivers for budgetary policy and thirdly, the appropriateness of the relationships between Government, the Oireachtas, the banking and the property sector, as you've outlined, Chairman.<\/p> <p>  Prior to my election as leader of Fine Gael in 2002, Fine Gael had been in government previous to that, between 1994 and 1997, during which time I served as Minister for Tourism and Trade.<\/p><p>As a Government ... that Government, comprised of three parties, secured modest public expenditure growth, budgeted for the first Government surplus in a generation and delivered a rapid reduction in Government debt, from 84% of GNP in 1994 down 20% to 64% of GNP in 1997.  Obviously, at that time the Government secured Ireland's entry into economic and monetary union and the adoption of the euro as our currency.  Economic growth averaged over 7% per year, driven primarily by a very strong performance in exports, which rose to 73% of our GDP - which was an exceptionally high proportion by any international standards.  That Government maintained a focus on manufacturing, on exports and on cost control in all areas and between '93 and '97, inflation averaged approximately 2%, which was consistent with the maintenance of international competitiveness - which is so important.  In the 1990s, this country doubled its share of the world export market and foreign direct investment flows into Ireland increased significantly.<\/p><p> When the Government changed in 1997, we passed on an economy in which rapid growth had been underpinned by sound public finances, strong productivity, employment growth and a vibrant export-orientated industrial base and unemployment had dropped to below 9%.  We met all those necessary economic conditions to adopt the euro, which was a new, strong currency ... a stable currency, with low interest rates to be used by ... eventually by over 500 million people.  Ireland looked forward to building a more competitive, inclusive, innovative economy as a platform for long-term prosperity, stability and, as a consequence, social cohesion.<\/p><p> So following the completion of the EMU and the formal circulation of the euro in 2001, the underlying dynamics of the Irish economy shifted dramatically ... dramatically in the following decade.  Particularly in the period 2002 to 2007 and particularly with regard to the changed contribution to Irish economic growth from exports and domestic spending.  Very important in that was the significant tax incentives that were introduced and subsequently extended beyond the lifespan originally agreed for property investment, things like multi-story car parks, student accommodation, buildings used for third level education, hotels, holiday camps, holiday cottages, rural-urban renewal park-and-ride facilities, living over the shop, nursing homes, private hospitals, convalescent facilities, sports injuries clinics and child care facilities and so on.  All of these diluted the previous policy bias in favour of manufacturing and exporting activities.  Public spending became a major driver of economic growth, increasing by an astonishing &euro;23 billion between 2002 and 2007.  The rate of growth that averaged 10% per year and credit conditions, particularly for mortgages ... they also eased as banks began to borrow more cheaply from abroad under EMU rules.  And there were no measures taken either by the national European authorities to impose appropriate lending rules to protect economic stability generally and young families buying their first homes in particular.  Household borrowing, as the inquiry will be aware, more than doubled between 2003 and 2007, with this country, Ireland, becoming the second most indebted country in the eurozone by 2007.<\/p><p> Ireland's current account balance - the difference between foreign earnings and foreign expenditure - went from a surplus of &euro;1.9 billion to a deficit of &euro;10.1 billion by 2007 as Irish households began to spend far more than they were earning.  Our share of world trade began to decline significantly from 2002 as domestic cost inflation accelerated, with the loss of market share most acute in the manufacturing sector.  And from 2000 onwards, most new Irish jobs came from domestic as opposed to exporting sectors, particularly the public sector and construction.  Manufacturing and agriculture lost almost 50,000 jobs between 2000 and 2006.<\/p><p>And by 2004 the numbers of people working in the construction sector overtook for the first time the numbers of people working in the manufacturing sector, and by 2006 the percentage of the workforce working in the construction sector was actually higher than any other industrialised country.  So by 2007 you had an uncompetitive, bloated, over-borrowed and distorted Irish economy had been left at the mercy of subsequent international events, without the safeguards, institutions and mindset that were needed to survive and to prosper as a small, open economy within a changed euro area.  By this point, the economic costs of the banking and wider collapse had already been incurred, even if the true scale of that economic disaster would take several more years to fully reveal itself. <\/p><p> So as is evident from the key speeches and policy documents dating from this period, under my own Ieadership, our party, the Fine Gael party, which was the main opposition party June 2002 to 2007, opposed the main strands of Government economic policy mentioned already, and our D&aacute;il members voted against the passage of every budget as a consequence.  Notable components of our economic policy evidenced from this period were: our opposition as a party to the Government's changes to the structures for financial regulation introduced in 2002; our warnings to the then Government regarding the deterioration in the country's international competitiveness, and, in particular, the rapid price and rapid cost escalation taking place in the closed sectors of our economy; our campaign which we called, \"Rip Off Ireland\", at the time highlighted the growing divergence in price and cost levels for consumers and businesses between Ireland and our trading partners; we had regular demands for proper cost-benefit analysis to be applied to the proliferation of tax shelters and incentives, particularly for the property sector; and our campaigns to highlight the scale of Government waste of taxpayers' money as public expenditure escalated very rapidly, most notably in our opposition to the Government's decentralisation plan.  The \"Buck Stops Here\" campaign set out by Fine Gael's proposals for securing better value for the taxpayer in the delivery of public services and infrastructure spoke for itself; our critique of the entire budgetary process, and the lack of opportunity for the Oireachtas to properly scrutinise and assess the tax and spending options available to the Government were a very sore point with us; our opposition to the Government's public sector benchmarking pay deals, reflecting the lack of transparency and the failure to link the deals to genuine changes in work practices and improvements in productivity.  <\/p><p> So a generalised critique of economic policy by our party during this period was that the then Government was abandoning the competitive, export-oriented, flexible economic model needed to prosper inside the Economic and Monetary Union, and that had been bequeathed to it by the previous Fine Gael-led Government.  And that was an economic model built on sound public finances, high productivity, strong policy support for foreign direct investment and the traded sectors of the economy.  <\/p><p> The ability of the Oireachtas to scrutinise all of these things was hampered by the bypassing of public representatives as a result of the dominance of social partnership, where all these decisions were made away from the Oireachtas.  Government choices in all key policy areas were removed from any kind of scrutiny.  The absence at that time of a clear, national, statutory fiscal framework and expenditure rule to ensure sustainable management of the public finances, and the absence of an independent watchdog to police management of the public finances and to highlight any risks that were there.  The absence of any requirement at that time to conduct and publish cost benefit analysis of tax shelters and major infrastructure projects, and to subject all major expenditure programmes to regular review; we had overruns on a regular basis.  <\/p><p> Restrictions that were introduced in the Freedom of Information Act.  So total public spending during the 2002-2007 period increased by &euro;23 billion.  The average annual growth rat, at just under 10% per year, was roughly twice the underlying potential growth rate of the economy.  And, therefore, the disastrous impact on the underlying health of the public finances was camouflaged by the temporary and unsustainable surge in transaction tax receipts from the credit fuelled construction and property bubbles.  For the main, social, political and economic drivers of the growth in Government expenditure were the genuine need to increase investment level in physical infrastructure to address capacity constraints in the Irish economy - we've mentioned some of these - and to support regional development to keep the economy moving throughout the entire country, though it was even clear then that much of the investment was being wasted because of the absence of public sector procurement and project management expertise.<\/p><p>Secondly, the need for public sector salaries to chase the rising cost of living, which in turn reflected the uncompetitive and the closed nature of many sectors of the Irish economy, as well as the rising cost of public services.  And those rising costs of the public service should of course have been mitigated by a much stronger drive to secure public sector efficiencies, particularly in the health service and the amalgamation of the health boards into the HSE.  That opportunity was lost as a result of the Government's public sector pay benchmarking deals.  The doubling of the social welfare budget during 2001 and 2007, at a time of rapidly rising employment, and while there was a genuine need to reduce poverty among vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, the disabled and so on, the rapid rise in payments to working age adults reflected the complete absence of activation reforms that were needed to lower the exceptional rate of jobless households in Ireland, even at a time when the country was allegedly enjoying full employment.  The absence at that time of a clear national strategy fiscal framework and expenditure rules to ensure sustainable management of the public finances and the absence of an independent watchdog to police management of the public finances and highlight risks.  If the expenditure rule enacted by the current Government, which caps expenditure growth of the underlying potential growth rate of the economy had been adhered to in that period, then spending growth would have been less than half of the 130% increase actually incurred.<\/p><p> Then there was the political cycle unconstrained by any independently-policed set of credible fiscal rules.  Budgetary policy during that period was as a result driven by the needs of the electoral rather than the economic cycle.  Public spending without any reform increased rapidly up to the 2002 election.  Voted spending was up by 21% in 2001, 14% in 2002 and the lead into the 2007 election, up by 13% in 2007.  So not only would tighter management of public spending during this period have helped moderate economic overheating at a time of growing risk, it would also have helped to leave the public finances in a much stronger position to protect living standards and the economy from the effects of the property bust and collapse in the construction sector.  It has of course been documented that the Fine Gael Party in the 2007 election adopted broadly similar assumptions as the then Government about economic growth, about tax receipts, about public spending over the subsequent five-year D&aacute;il term.  These assumptions were drawn from the contemporaneous projections by the Department of Finance and by the Economic and Social Research Institute and our assessment at the time was that these projections were credible on the basis of a steady managed transition back to the competitive export-orientated economic model that drove Ireland's strong and sustainable recovery during the 1990s.<\/p><p> It has been alleged, Chairman, that a relatively small clique of bankers and property owners were able to bring influence on policy-making at that time to secure taxpayer support to favoured sectors and to favoured institutions.  This is a matter of public interest for the inquiry to pursue and obviously you will make your own findings.  Whatever the truth of the allegations, it is clear that there were features of Irish politics and Irish policy-making system at that time that left it vulnerable to such perceptions.  Things like the ability of the Ministers for Finance to introduce or extend tax breaks for favourite sectors of the economy, particularly the property and construction sectors, without published detailed assessments by the Department of Finance or scrutiny indeed by the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> The excessively close relationship between the Central Bank and the Department of Finance at that time and between the Financial Regulator and the institutions that it was charged with regulating.  The ambiguity between the relative roles of the Central Bank and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, when it came to policing the stability of the banking system and protecting consumers and depositors, the corporate funding of political parties to varying degrees during this period, the dilution by the then-Government of the Freedom of Information Act, the absence of clear and forcible rules regarding the jobs that could be taken up in the private sector by former Ministers, advisers and civil servants and the absence of any institution to police the resulting conflicts of interest that arose.  The lack of transparency and rules regarding the lobbying of public officials by special interest groups, the absence of effective planning regulation at that time and the absence of structured institutionalised national risk assessment processes.  So in conclusion, by meeting all of the economic conditions needed in 1997 to adopt a new strong and stable currency with the low interest rates used by the people of the European Union, the Irish people dreamed of building a more competitive, globalised and innovative economy as a platform for long-term prosperity, for stability and for social cohesion.<\/p><p>For hundreds of thousands of families in this country, their dreams turned into a complete nightmare as boom and bust and a stability was replaced by a policy of recklessness and regulatory failures.  <\/p><p> To be sure, design flaws that existed in the euro architecture as a whole contributed to this crisis, both here and in the eurozone, and these flaws are gradually being repaired, but there are still serious challenges up ahead.  But the lion's share of the damage, Chairman, was done to the Irish economy was the fault of domestic economic and financial mismanagement.  <\/p><p> We have learned the hard way that being part of the euro presents, not just opportunities but huge domestic challenges.  The need for more effective regulation of the financial system, for greater budgetary discipline, for more responsible and transparent politics, and for relentless pursuit of cost reductions, innovation and product and labour market flexibility so as to maintain our competitiveness in the absence of any control over our exchange rate.  So having failed these challenges in the first 15 years of our euro membership, our economic and political institutions are now being renewed and being reformed so that the euro can once become a source of stability, of prosperity, and, indeed, of hope, for the Irish people.  Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#F00300","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

And, first of all, can I just thank you for the invitation, and thank your members for, I mean, what is a truly enormous amount of work, which your members on the committee and you and their Chair are putting into this.  I suppose just a few high level things.  I think it's always been Fine Gael's view that to deliver enduring growth and living standards in a small, open economy like ours, it has to be built on two basic foundations.  One is the foundation of enterprise, innovation and exports; that's the essence of a small trading economy, and the second is a smart state, that is alert, efficient, that's strategic in the way it delivers.  And that became even more important when we joined the single currency because we were committing to a hard currency regime.  We were going shoulder to shoulder with, you know, really strong economies like Germany.<\/p> <p>  It's my belief, very strongly, that, you know ... and, indeed, Fine Gael's belief, that the Irish economic crash, it wasn't a result of a tsunami way out in the ocean that swept away a whole bunch of very sustainable and clever economic policies, that the fault lines that made Ireland so vulnerable in those years had developed from bad policy over an extended period of time, and that far from building on enterprise, innovation and exports, economic success had come from speculation, property and debt.  That was the contrast.  That was the flaw, in the ... if you like, in the underlying, real economy.  It was also was undermined, in my belief, by, you know, a State that had become sluggish, wasteful, self-indulgent, in the way it approached its spending and its delivery, and the challenge of public service reform.  <\/p> <p>  I think if you look at the history of this period.  I mean, Fine Gael's approach when we were in government with Labour in '94 to 97 was very clear.  We had that strong export-driven growth.  It was very solid management of the public finances, and that was continued, in my belief, between 1997 and 2000.  But as the general election of ... approached, 2001 and 2002 saw the abandonment of a lot of that prudence.  And the ... we, in Fine Gael, you know, consistently opposed the bad policy decisions that was building up those fault lines in the economy.  And they were ... I'll just isolate four areas where I think it's, you know ... the biggest mistakes were made.  One was around sound budgets.  You know, as I say, it was abandoned in 2001 and 2002.  Spending growth in those two years was something like 35% - extraordinary - way out of line with the growth and the underlying growth in the economy.  And we warned Government of that consistently.  We warned of the growing and precarious reliance on the construction sector.  Towards the latter part of that period, 2006-2007, 25% of Government revenue was coming from construction, so 25% of the cost of running our hospitals, our schools, our garda&iacute;, and so on was coming from the construction sector.  That just wasn't a sustainable approach.  And we demanded consistently reform in the way budgets were put together, the, sort of, way  in which budgets were put together, where there was no proper scrutiny.<\/p><p>The best example, in my view, is to be seen in the lack of scrutiny of tax breaks .. that were ... billions of euros of tax breaks were given out without any scrutiny.  A big, massive decision like decentralisation was introduced without the proposal even circulating among Government Departments where it could have been scrutinised.  You know, the approach to budgeting was wholly wrong and it produced some very bad, imbalanced outputs.<\/p><p> The strong export performance is the second thing I would single out.  That was consistently undermined and we warned consistently of the inflation, the erosion of the competitiveness of our economy by inflation in what economists would call the sheltered sector of the economy, areas regulated by Government or that weren't open to competition, at a time when exporters were facing really tough conditions in the eurozone markets.  You know, export prices were generally falling, while this huge growth in domestic prices was undermining our competitiveness.  And I think most ... it was most vividly illustrated, and I repeatedly drew that illustration, the growth in agency-supported employment, which is the ... you know, supported by IDA and Enterprise Ireland, they're the heart of our exporting strategy.  In those early years, '94 to 2000, they grew by over 17,000 per year, extra people working in the export-oriented sector.  That collapsed by 90% in the second period, between 2001 and 2007, so you ... it dropped back to just ... under 2,000.  That was the imbalance that was growing.  Those are the core of a small, open, trading economy, these companies that are out there winning you new markets and, you know, that was a really damaging element.<\/p><p> The other element was smart spending and, you know, we, in Fine Gael, published numerous reports, like Who Cares?, The Buck Stops Here, focusing in on the massive growth, which I think it had been 133% growth in spending in those short five or six years, just wasn't delivering value for money and you saw poor delivery on fancy plans, you know, plans, like decentralisation ... announced.  At the end of its period, it delivered 10% of what it was supposed to.  You know, fancy plans on health not delivering.  You know, big spending increases but no one held accountable for the delivery and we very strongly, you know, drove for the need for public service reform and that was ... there's no doubt that the drive for public service reform was held back by the then social partnership arrangements, which prevented, you know, delivery of reform.<\/p><p> The fourth area I'd point out is robust regulation and we, back in 2002, when the regulatory structure was being put in place, we opposed that, and it's worth checking the record and going back, we opposed that at second stage for the very ... and we set out the reasons: because there had not been an examination of whether our regulatory system was fit for purpose.  We had come through a period when you'd seen the Enrons and various breakdowns in financial oversight and we were putting in place a structure that was just simply putting a big bulldog clip around everything that was being done, no scrutiny of the underlying systems, and that was being rammed through and that was a wholly wrong approach.  And, I think, right through that period I think we continued to pursue this inadequate oversight of banking.  We also pursued this ... the failure to implement the recommendations of the Competition Authority, which was another area of smart regulation that was not being delivered.  <\/p><p> I think the sad part of this was that the property boom papered over the vulnerabilities that were building up in our economy.  You know, they provided employment that masked the loss of jobs in the export centres ... sectors.  They provided tax revenue that masked the fact that they were unsustainable.  Those tax revenues were built by young people taking out large mortgages, paying high elements of tax on housing and that's where the funding for a lot of the growth in spending was occurring.  It was never a sustainable basis and I think, you know, Fine Gael had always a different approach to the then Government and, you know, the challenge for us then was how to manage those vulnerabilities and the core of our approach, as we approached the 2007 election, was to deliver on that ... this strategy of reverting to one built on enterprise, on innovation, on exports, on sound spending, and that has been a consistent hallmark of the approach we've taken.  You can see it in '94 to '97, the critique of policy that we outlined all through those years and again in Government in 2011 to 2015.  Those, you know, sound bases of growing the basis of a sustainable, small economy that can grow living standards for everyone has been at the heart of our approach.<\/p><p>And, you know, I think we have to get back and that's what we have done in the last number of years, to build enduring growth in living standards by continually reinventing our competitive edge, by disciplining public policy, by evaluation and accountability in what we do.  And that, I think, has been characterised, the approach we took throughout this period. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#K00300","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Bruton.

The Fine Gael manifesto in 2007 also commits to, \"Cutting income taxes for all taxpayers and keep the low rates of corporation tax and capital gains tax\".

Obviously, I've read it.  Well, your question is about the stability of the public finances and I think it's a very relevant question.  I make the point that we've always believed in sound public finances together with an unrelenting focus on national competitiveness, that these are the conditions that would apply for, you know, lower interest rates, high level of investment and, as a consequence, strong economic and employment growth.  So, back in the period when my party was in government in '94-'97, I recall that was my first senior Ministry in trade and tourism.

In the 2007 election, Fine Gael actually adopted a joint economic and fiscal programme with the Labour Party, and that meant that we'd keep our 12.5% corporation tax rate, that we'd reduce the standard rate of income tax from 20% to 18%, as well as other tax reforms to support one income families and to improve the design of the stamp duty regime with particular reference for first-time buyers.  That was because we believe that keeping taxes low on work and investment, combined with proper regulation and a competition reforms to improve the country's cost competitiveness, was a core plank of our plan to transition the economy back towards the export-led model that we passed on in 1997.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, we also committed in 2007 to keeping the public finances in surplus in general government terms and, specifically, we made it clear that all our commitments on both the spending and on the tax side were subject to the overall riding commitment to adhere to the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.  So those commitments, Deputy, on tax and spending were consistent on the basis of the growth forecasts that were available at the time, both from the ESRI and from the Department of Finance, which were forecasting growth average of about 4%, between the period 2008 to 2012.  Obviously, we understood quite clearly that level of growth couldn't be achieved unless the competitiveness of the economy was restored.  So, like the huge loss of competitiveness in there during 2002 to 2007, together with Government waste on public spending, was a central theme of our critique.

That had been severely undermined, and we believed that part of that was a tax policy that would be more supportive of enterprise.  So we did, with the economy forecast as it was then, to be on a reasonable growth phase, we believed that what we needed to do was to wind back the rate of growth of public spending, and introduce taxes and other measures that would drive economic recovery and enterprise recovery and if you look at our ... I don't have the time ... but if you look at our, our manifesto, you'll see numerous areas which we've subsequently done in government, of how we would rebuild an enterprise base and look at reforms right across the whole system to deliver better access to finance, easier to start a business and so on.

You were the Minister for Tourism and Trade when a pilot programme was introduced, it became known as the seaside resort.  Can I ask, during your period in ministerial office, was there analysis done in relation to why that tax break was introduced, and if there was analysis done, was it done by your Department or was it done by the Department of Finance on the basis of introducing a pilot scheme of this nature?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#R01000","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Yes, when I was Minister for Tourism, obviously, we sort of looked at a jaded tourism sector which had so much more potential than it was actually achieving.  In the course of, you know, travelling throughout the country, you came across particular areas that were clearly in need of some sort of infrastructure investment.  And people from all over the country, from particularly the coastal areas, said \"Look, we're out here on a limb.  This place is falling asunder.  You've got to do something to stimulate investment so that we can have a product that people will want to come and enjoy and therefore, you know, be able to contribute to the economy.\"  And we discussed that at some length, as to what might happen, and the decision was that there should be a pilot scheme introduced in a small number of areas.  That was expanded to include 15.  It was done on the basis of the district electoral divisions as determined by the local authorities.  It was different now than the, you know, the urban sort of renewal scheme, which was a much smaller scale.  I have to say that the response was one that was assessed.  I think it generated about &euro;700 million or &euro;800 million worth of work in terms of infrastructure, construction and so on.  I would say that some of the towns which were designated, Senator, took this in a far broader way than others.  Some, where their hotels went after the scheme and provided facilities for, you know, a much broader range of tourist coming in, whether it be pools or whatever else, some areas did better than others.  But I think it generated about &euro;600 million to &euro;700 million and ended, I think, then in 1999.  And no more than the case that was raised earlier, there were planning problems with some of these, so where people entered into the scheme that if they had gone beyond a certain point of, you know, a contract being signed or building under way, it was allowed to finish its course.  But the reason for the case in the first instance was because many of these communities said \"Look, we are really stranded here, we have a jaded product, there's a clear need for some infrastructure investment\", and so that kind of pilot scheme was designed and put in place.  And so, you know, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Environment and Local Government, Finance, Bord F&aacute;ilte, Shannon Development, they all put the details together and obviously there were meetings held in the locations that were chosen, from financial people about how they, how the scheme would actually work.  So it was assessed and I suppose there was a qualifying relief and the tax foregone in that scheme, I think, was about &euro;250 million altogether.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#R01100","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Just very briefly-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#R01200","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Very briefly, now, because you're over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#R01300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":205,"content":"<p>In a question to Minister Brian Lenihan dated 11 November 2008, the Minister says:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>At the time of publication the estimated output of self catering resorts was between 5000 and 6000 units.

So we were right to call at that time for a detailed review and when it came back through the subsequent years, when enforcement powers came back for consideration again we raised that issue that there hadn't been a proper stress testing of the model and I think that was proven to be a serious vulnerability.  Obviously when the guarantee ... you know that bank collapse started, as we've outlined ... the Taoiseach has outlined in detail why we supported the guarantee.  You were at a point where, you know, you feared a run on the banks, you needed to protect depositors ... but we raised all of the right questions about whether, you know, was there an adequate buffer and could this impact?  I think as soon as it became clear that this wasn't just a liquidity issue, it was a solvency issue, we strongly advocated that within each bank, there should be the separation out of a bad bank, which would have left the shareholders and the bondholders holding, if you like, the, the assets that were questionable and they would have to recover from those assets as best they could ... to recover the value of their shareholding and their bond holding.  That was clearly the model we, we, advocated, the separation of good from bad.  That wasn't done, as you know, but that was the position we took and I think we were right in that.  We took the view that, you know, Anglo, there shouldn't be more recapitalisation of Anglo, that it was a, a bank that should be wound down in an orderly fashion at a time when we were being told that it should be kept open as a going concern.  So, we did take different views on those.  I think, by and large, at the time, based on the information we had available to us, those were, were sensible policy positions to, to take up.  So, you know, I think we, we have a very credible record in relation to how we handled this, this crisis, but clearly, no one has perfect foresight or perfect hindsight and, you know it ... this was an appalling disaster that no one anticipated in its scale or impact on people but I think the policy position and the scrutiny that we applied was the right ... scrutiny and, and policy positions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#BB00100","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":534,"content":"<p>And finally, Taoiseach-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#BB00200","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Quickly now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#BB00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":536,"content":"<p>In ... what assurance can you give to the public that the measures that have been brought in will ensure that a banking crisis doesn't happen again in Ireland and that we don't have a property bubble for the ordinary person-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#BB00400","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":537,"content":"<p>You are moving in now to Minister Noonan's space when he's in before us in September, okay?

In particular, our focus will be on three lines of inquiry: the effectiveness of the Oireachtas in scrutinising public policy on the banking sector and the economy, analysis of the key drivers for budget policy and the appropriateness of the relationships between Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector.<\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Deputy Rabbitte TD are, therefore, appearing before the inquiry today in the context of their respective roles as the Labour Party's spokesperson in finance while in opposition and as the leader of the Labour Party while in opposition. <\/p> <p>  In normal circumstances - excuse me - when a witness appears before here, they don't have privilege and privilege is extended to them by virtue of this committee's powers.  In this regard, as both Members are current Members of the House, there is no requirement for me to extend privilege to the witnesses in that regard.  However, I would state that the witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subjects of these matters to these proceedings is to be given.<\/p> <p>  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.

Mr. Chairman, you have directed that I attend before the inquiry to give evidence on three specified themes in the context of my role as leader of the Labour Party from 2002 to 2007.  I have made a written submission, as directed.<\/p> <p>  I'm bound to say, Chairman, at the outset that it is my view that whoever and whatever was responsible for the banking crisis, it was not the Opposition.  As regards the effectiveness of the Oireachtas in scrutinising public policy on the banking sector, it is my view that the Oireachtas has been ill-equipped to scrutinise policy on the banking sector, that it has been the view for very many decades of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that scrutiny of the banking sector was safely reposed elsewhere, and that notwithstanding recent improvements, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann remains inadequately equipped to discharge this role, and few elected Members could perform such a role and at the same time perform their role as TDs as expected by the people.  The finance committee ought to be better resourced, not to second-guess the regulator or attempt to do his job, but to satisfy themselves that the regulatory mechanism is doing its job and to competently engage with the Minister.  <\/p> <p>  As regards the relationships to the property sector, this will always be a fraught area.  It is neither possible nor desirable to close off communication with the property sector but it is necessary to regulate that relationship.  That is why the enactment recently of legislation on the conduct of lobbying is welcome.  Any modern, functioning economy must have a certain level of construction activity but not one remotely near what we experienced during the property bubble, but a construction sector that could be up to twice what it is at the moment.  Public policy should seek to avoid developers using clandestine contacts to dictate policy.  <\/p> <p>  It would appear that some powerful individuals in the financial sector had been lobbying for some time for a bank guarantee.  The challenge is to know what's going on, and that if there are vested interests at stake, that they should be declared.  Enactment of the Regulation of Lobbying Bill of 2015 will help in respect of the relationship between Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector.  The belief abroad is that developers and builders have, on occasion, exerted considerable formative influence on public policy.  In addition to the lobbying Act of 2015, I believe that the package of reforms in the area of political funding will also have a positive impact.  Political parties, and especially those generously funded by the construction sector in the past, will now be less reliant on that source of funding.  There's nothing wrong with Government learning from outside expertise.  However, it is the task of Government to distinguish the public interest from vested interest.  <\/p> <p>  If Parliament is to be indicted for not adequately supervising the supervisors, then parliamentarians would have to be adequately resourced to do the job.<\/p><p>The typical TD is not - in respect of the detail of regulation - in a position to forensically second guess the regulator, nor can the typical TD reasonably be expected to discharge his or her usual functions and, at the same time, competently probe the entrails of banking.  Most TDs have believed that regulation of the banks was in competent, well-paid, safe hands and that the job of the Minister for Finance was to keep an eye on them.  On both scores, that belief has taken something of a bashing.  However the challenge is not to abandon that model but to reinforce it.<br\/><br\/>In my written submission, I have drawn the attention of the inquiry to the ... firstly, the report of the DIRT inquiry, of which I was a member, and, secondly, to a report that I prepared in 2005 for the public accounts committee entitled &quot;Proposals for alterations in the way that Estimates for expenditure are considered by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot;.  Both reports, I think, are relevant when considering the effectiveness of Oireachtas oversight of the banking sector.  Indeed many of the changes introduced over recent years derived from the recommendations of the DIRT inquiry report, including the proposal for a stand-alone Oireachtas commission that enables parliamentarians themselves to take decisions concerning the effective conduct of parliament.  The primary concern of parliament and government should be to ensure that there is in place a banking regulatory system in line with best practice.  The tug of war between the two Government parties that gave birth to the hybrid regulatory structure in place at the time of the crisis did not help and has facilitated the buck-passing that we have seen at the inquiry.  The Minister for Finance ought to be satisfied that the Department of Finance has the skillset to professionally interrogate the regulator and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann - especially the evolving network of parliamentary committees - should be equipped to engage professionally with the Minister and, where necessary, the Central Bank.<br\/><br\/>A great deal, Chairman, on your ... on your third theme, a great deal has been said and written about the causes of the worst crash that the State has ever experienced.  At the end of the day, the cause of our downfall was mainly a property bubble fuelled by tax incentives and over-lending for land and property investment and, indeed, reckless lending in the case of commercial property.  The Labour Party sought to address this issue over the years - that we were concerned with here - in a variety of ways.  In our view, speculation in building land was the root cause of the explosion in house prices.  Consequently, the party introduced the Planning and Development (Acquisition of Development Land) Bill of 2003 to combat speculation in building land.  The Bill would cap the price of building land at existing unzoned use value plus 25%.  At the time, the cost of the site could be 40% of the price of a home.  The Bill also sought to enable local authorities to intervene to cause hoarded building land to come into use.  The Bill went, in our view, to the heart of the problem.  The Government voted down the Bill.  Expert legal advice had assured us to the effect that the Labour Bill could be enacted within the existing constitutional framework.  Our experience had been that pressuring the Government to deal with land speculation only resulted in the then Taoiseach kicking the issue into the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.  No action was taken, although the All-Party Committee on the Constitution did, in due course, report and endorsed our approach.  That committee was advised by Gerard Hogan, senior counsel, at the time, and joint editor of Kelly's <i>The Irish Constitution<\/i>.  He is now a judge of the Court of Appeal.<br\/><br\/>Labour consistently highlighted how the different property-based tax incentives and tax shelters hollowed out the tax base so that the average PAYE income taxpayer was required to pay the relevant rate but the wealthy or very high earners could mitigate their tax liability.  Meanwhile, these property-based tax incentives and shelters were driving the property bubble.  We travelled Labour policy wherever the opportunity arose, by way of parliamentary question, amendments to legislation, amendments to finance Bills, in particular, and in public discourse generally.  We challenged the pattern of Government delay in tackling these issues, which consisted of reviews of these schemes that postponed action, allowed deadlines to be extended or referred possible solutions to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, on whose recommendations no action was ever taken.  Sometimes our efforts were merely to persuade Government to stick to their own measures, such as demanding the re-introduction of 60% rate of capital gains tax on the sale of hoarded building land to encourage builders to release land.  This had been done, following the Bacon report, by the Government in 1998 but then dropped in a subsequent budget.  Like most public representatives, Labour became more alarmed at the constantly rising house prices that were putting ... making homes ... that were making homes unaffordable even for two persons on reasonable income.<br\/><br\/>I am bound to say, however, Chairman, that I did not make the connection between our alarm and what was happening in the housing market and a risk to the financial system.  I must admit that it never occurred to me that our banks might fail.  That fear did not surface in mainline debate until the autumn of 2008, despite Morgan Kelly's article.  There were no credible economic reports that I knew of suggesting that the banks might be at risk.  In fact, there were national and international reports suggesting that the Irish financial system was sound.  Even towards the end, the public commentary was mainly about a soft landing.  The conviction was that those charged with regulating and supervising the banks were doing their job.<br\/><br\/>In summary, then, and in conclusion, Chairman, it's not the job of a TD to regulate the financial system.  It is the job of Government to satisfy itself that the regulatory system is fit for purpose.  It is the job of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to hold the Government to account.  What distinguishes the Irish collapse from the experience of most other countries was the property bubble.  We live in a winner-takes-all, adversarial system of parliamentary democracy which has its defects but is probably better than the alternative.  Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#GG00400","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":545,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy Rabbitte.

In brief, I agree with the assessment in the Regling and Watson report that while the crisis clearly had an international dimension, this was very much, unfortunately, a homemade crisis in many respects.  The economic crisis, of which the banking crisis was an integral part, I think, for the Irish people it can be viewed as a tragedy in three acts.  In act 1, the key decisions which led to the crisis were made by the Government, the banks and the Financial Regulator.  In act 2 came the unravelling of the solvency of the banking system.  This was also the point at which the then Government made the fateful decision to provide the bank guarantee.  This was the most damaging and expensive decision in terms of the cost of dealing with the crisis, which unfolded in act 3.<\/p> <p>  The decision to provide a blanket guarantee was made with effect from 30 September 2008.  It's a matter of record that at the end of the subsequent D&aacute;il debate, the Labour Party was the only party to oppose the guarantee.  We did so because we believed that the extent of the potential liability posed a real risk to the solvency of the State and I believe that this decision has been fully vindicated by subsequent events.  The banking guarantee locked the country into a cycle which led to the bailout of 2010 and everything that flowed from that date.  In looking at how the crisis arose, cheap credit became available in Ireland after the adoption of the euro.  As Regling and Watson identified, much of this lending was concentrated on the property sector and comprised loans to a limited number of developers.  This pattern of lending was reckless in the extreme and it should have prompted intervention by the Financial Regulator.  However, no such intervention occurred.  The practice of light-touch regulation prevailed and, with the benefit of hindsight, it's also clear - not least from the contributions made in this forum - that a measure of regulatory capture applied.<\/p><p>Put simply, the regulator, the regulation system and structure was too close to the banks.<\/p><p> During the D&aacute;il debate in 2003 on the Bill to establish the Irish Financial Regulator, I said, and I quote, \"The Bill does not refer to the necessity for parameters and ethical criteria for responsible lending.  This is a major deficiency.\"  Tax based incentives put in place by Government spurred on the reckless lending.  I believe that tax-based incentives can play a legitimate and a very positive role in stimulating development in certain circumstances, such as to encourage necessary, social or economic development, particularly where the market has failed to do so.  Any such incentive, though, has to be proportionate, targeted and temporary.  However, by the time I became the finance spokesperson of the Labour Party, which was in late 2002, appointed by Deputy Rabbitte to the opposition and for some time before that, it was very clear many of these tax incentives had actually run their course.  It was also clear that their continued use was stroking ... stoking a construction industry which was already overheated and a bubble in land prices which itself, the bubble, was aided and abetted by grossly irresponsible rezoning decisions in some parts of the country.<\/p><p> In my Second Stage speech on the Finance Bill in February 2003, I said:  \"The Minister for Finance is obviously a disciple of the Augustinian school.  He always announces his steadfast determination to dismantle the bewildering edifices of tax shelters but [he] is never quite ready to do [so]\".   My prediction, I think, proved, you know, prescient, as year after year, the Minister constantly found reasons to delay their expiry.  I repeatedly stressed my view that the incentives were being used as a tax shelter rather than as a development tool and they were being used by wealthy individuals to shelter income from Revenue.  I pointed out in my 2006 reply to the budget, more than 1,000 of Ireland's wealthiest people paid ... these were people with incomes in excess of a million euros a year, paid an effective tax rate of between nought and 5%.<\/p><p> I believed that the Government of the day was, as I said at the time, addicted to tax shelters.  No doubt, this was, in part, a matter of political judgment and prejudice, but I believed then, and I still believe, that the reliance of the principal Government party on financial contributions from developers also played a part.  The culture of the Galway tent was unhealthy for politics and it contributed to pushing the building industry ultimately to disaster.  <\/p><p> Also during this time, I pointed to what I considered to be abuses of the stamp duty regime to reduce the liability of wealthy individuals.  Amongst those abuses was the practices of resting contracts, whereby the parties to a particular agreement delayed or avoided the execution of a stampable document so as to reduce or to avoid or to postpone almost indefinitely liability.  Another abuse was the use of contracts for difference, which I highlighted in 2006.  The committee will be aware that a proposal for a modest duty - 1% - on such contracts was withdrawn by the Minister for Finance, Brian Cowen, following extensive lobbying from finance and other industry sources.<\/p><p> Contracts for difference were subsequently used by investors in Anglo Irish Bank, with disastrous consequences.  Had the duty been in place, it might have given - the 1% ... it might have given some of those involved pause for thought.  <\/p><p> The budget was in surplus in every year from '97 to 2007, with the exception of 2002.  And, in fact, when the previous rainbow Government handled over, there was a very small surplus on the budget.<\/p><p> Contemporary estimates of the structural balance by the EU Commission, the IMF, and the OECD did not identify a problem.  The large disparity between the apparently healthy headline figures and the underlying reality was accounted for by the over-reliance on construction related taxes that the committee members are well aware of - stamps, CAT, VAT, CGT, all elements of the bubble in tax revenues.  This over-reliance on construction-related taxes was the root cause of the collapse in the national finances, which occurred in 2008, and subsequently.  The problem was compounded by the fact that the budget policy was driven by the electoral cycle rather than by the needs of the economy.  It's no coincidence that the peaks in public spending occurred immediately before the 2002 and the 2007 general elections.  <\/p><p> I've been asked to comment specifically on the oversight role of the Oireachtas in the period under review and my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, has dealt with it in detail.  The primary role of the Opposition is to hold the Government to account.  I believe that the D&aacute;il and the Seanad have generally served us well but they're far from perfect.  Our system is adversarial - Government proposes and opposition usually opposes.  One of the reasons behind the establishment of the committee system was to provide a less adversarial setting for debate.  In recent years, it has become normal practice for independent regulators to be made accountable to the Oireachtas in the first instance and while this practice is right in principle, it's important that committees are sufficiently resourced to enable members to carry out their duties effectively.  The accountability of the Financial Regulator is a case in point.<\/p><p> It seems that in the run up to the banking crisis, everyone concerned, including the Taoiseach, Government Ministers, senior civil servants and the Oireachtas, presumed that the regulator was doing its job and that the assurances of banking stability did not warrant serious investigation.  This assumption proved to be fatefully wrong and Deputy Rabbitte has traced the evolution of the committee system after the DIRT inquiry.  The system now is better equipped to do its job than it was ten years ago.  Nevertheless, it's still debatable if a better resource system of Oireachtas oversight would or could have pointed up the potential dangers facing the banking system before the crisis hit.  Equally, I doubt if our current Oireachtas oversight could prevent a similar crisis happening again if those who are primarily responsible for preventing such crisis - the Government, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance - were blind to its very existence.  You know, I'm very conscious of raising through questions, through statements, through contributions to committees and to the Dail a whole series of issues, some of which I've referenced to there, but, you know, I was doing that as an opposition Deputy on behalf of the Labour Party.  <\/p><p> So, better resourcing of the committee system is important if we're to empower the Oireachtas in its dealings with the Executive.  And I would say, if your inquiry is minded to make such a recommendation, then I, as leader of the Labour Party, will give the recommendations, in that respect, very serious consideration.

First of all, the Labour Party manifesto was very much prepared in conjunction with other Labour Party colleagues, including, obviously, the then leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte.  But in the documents that you sent me, I just want to highlight two quotes from the ESRI reports which, when I read, just brought me back to the atmosphere of that period.  In the ESRI report of December 2005, the ESRI actually spoke about the growing aura of invincibility about the Irish economy and then, in the very last paragraph, they introduced, as was common at the time, and the then Taoiseach of the time utilised it quite a lot, the notion of a \"soft landing\"; bit like a soft day in the west of Ireland; a little bit of rain, but it wouldn't do you any harm.  That's the way it was set out.

First of all, I spoke at length about the notion of a minimum effective tax rate.  In other words, no matter how many allowances are available to an individual, particularly a high-income individual, we would ensure, or the State would ensure, that that person had to pay a minimum effective rate of tax.  The second proposal was that some of the allowances I've spoken about should be capped and that in some cases they should be discontinued.  I also proposed, Deputy, that there would be a standing committee on taxation, having previously proposed a study, which ultimately Deputy Cowen did actually carry out but didn't implement the recommendations, a study of the actual cost of tax expenditures.  And I proposed that there be a standing commission committee on taxation which would continuously look at the costs of tax arrangements which had built up in the system because I believed that if there was more information available that it would have been possible to make better judgments and better decisions about how to manage the national finances responsibly.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the proposal about reducing-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#NN01800","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":795,"content":"<p>T&aacute;naiste, quickly please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#NN01900","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":796,"content":"<p>Yes.

There was also as there is now, but more so then, a great deal of inhibition in terms of Oireachtas rules of specific institutions being named.  There was one initiative which was undertaken by the finance committee partly at my suggestion.  The finance committee in those days made a visit to the United States every two years or so and it was due to be in the autumn of 2008, and I suggested to the Chair and to the members that with what was evolving, that perhaps we should try and go to the United States and see could we get some level of briefing and so on.  We did that, if I recall, in the week after Easter of 2008, and I have to say, I came back from that visit full of a certain amount of foreboding.  But, I want to reiterate again, my fears were very concentrated around the way Anglo Irish had developed, and Irish Nationwide, as a small building society.  There was an awful lot more information and commentary, and Deputy Rabbitte has referenced one significant piece of commentary, the Morgan Kelly articles in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, which were suggesting increasingly that the Irish situation was fragile and at risk.  But as against that, I mean, the Department of Finance was very remote from mere Opposition Deputies, was very, it was entirely, if you like, related to in my experience, to the Government and the Government parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#QQ00700","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":840,"content":"<p>Can I interrupt, T&aacute;naiste,  because in fact when Mr. Cowen was giving evidence here he said - this is on page 92 - when he left ... he meant when he left his job as Minister for Finance to move on to being the Taoiseach, he said: \"There wasn't a crisis at that point.\"  That would have been late April early May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#QQ00800","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":841,"content":"<p>I have to say, I was very, very concerned, there was a lot of, if you like, commentary of a brief kind in the media.

Construction prices did rise, but it was the land values that rose, so that, say someone on a modest income who might have bought a house for &euro;250,000 or &euro;300,000, that kind of house was becoming priced at &euro;450,000 to &euro;500,000, and it was going out of the reach even of people who had employment in the public service.

I mean, this information in terms of did bankers approach us, did developers approach us ...  I mean ... this information was being kept under wraps prior to 28 September and after 28 September, the bankers felt they had got an insurance policy that insulated them.  So ... and in terms of the question about making the connection between the property bubble and the risk to the financial system, I think the record of the House will show for that night that two Deputies, Deputy Michael Noonan and myself, raised the question of solvency.  And as Deputy Burton has said, there was a great deal of caution around.  Banks weren't named by name and all the rest.  But we put in separate interventions, whether we were dealing purely with a liquidity crisis.  Now, the Minister for Finance of the day, the late Brian Lenihan, did not answer.  I wouldn't have expected him to answer.  I don't think the Minister for Finance could stand up and say, \"Yes, I'm afraid, Deputy, it's wider than liquidity.

We have it from the DIRT report, it's on page 52, but I quote from it, just it says:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>There was a particularly close and inappropriate relationship between banking and the State and its Agencies. The evidence suggests that the State and its Agencies were perhaps too mindful of the concerns of the banks, and too attentive to their pleas and lobbying.<\/blockquote>Now, I put that out there ... as a former member of the DIRT inquiry, which did, to a lot of people's minds, a lot of good work ... we're sitting here in another inquiry, the findings of the inquiry that you were at seems to be some of the things that we're investigating into just a number of years later.

So I think it was in that particular context.  Did 2003 resolve that?  I mean, a lot of messing went on with that right from the publication of the DIRT report until the Bill was brought into the House.  I think maybe three, four years might have elapsed, and a lot of messing went on in a row between the two parties in government - the PDs wanted a green field regulator, Fianna F&aacute;il, generally, wanted to retain it with the Central Bank,  And the compromise was a hybrid, which, I think, you know, was unfortunate because, you know, I have watched snatches of your extraordinary work on this committee when the opportunity has presented - and I don't have much else to do nowadays so I get my kicks watching you guys and so on - and I think, you know, you bring in one person responsibility ... who's responsible, you think, for regulation and he passes the buck to the Central Bank, you bring in the Central Bank and he says, \"No, no, the legislation says that's the job of the regulator\", and they sling the ball the ball out the wing.  I think the substantial conclusion that I would like to see this inquiry draw, if I may suggest, is that we have classic case here of regulatory capture.  I think we set up a regulator and I think, before you could say \"Jack Robinson\", he was doing the biddings of the banks rather than the other way around.

I would prefer to have a situation where you have real rates of tax, you have minimum effective rates of tax, which is what I proposed, Deputy.

That obviously has certain advantages but I think it also has disadvantages in the fact that one firm may be providing a whole range of services, and while firms have Chinese walls, whether in accounting or legal, that they don't share information, I certainly think that more diversity in terms of the functions that are carried out, perhaps by a bigger number of firms, would lead to perhaps more questioning.  But standard audits, Deputy, are designed to elicit certain information, whereas our banks faced a liquidity crisis.  And of course in the long run, and often in the very short run, a liquidity crisis turns into a solvency crisis.  Now, the audits of the banks and, you know, auditors, can ... there were internal auditors, but, you know, we have heard that internal auditors in certain circumstances did raise questions but they were contrarian views, very often were treated in that way, so they weren't well regarded.  I think the critical issue is that we have a more open society in terms of information, so that legitimate questions can be put.  I often found myself in a very contrarian position because I was questioning the orthodox explanation in relation to how the bubble was building up.  What surprises me, as I look back in the context for preparing for this, that in the history of commerce and banking and so on, bubbles are a constant problem.  And I'm just surprised that none of the institutions, as I look back, ever really seem to have queried or questioned the bubble.  The explanation then was a liquidity crisis and no one, as Deputy Rabbitte said earlier, seems to have then said, \"But if a liquidity crisis is serious enough, it's actually going to bring the whole institution down.\"  And unfortunately, that's what happened.

I'm not talking about the quality or the membership of a particular committee, but if you have 650 Members in a Parliament, as does the neighbouring Parliament, it tends to develop specialisation.  It tends to bring people through as chairman of the foreign affairs committee, who is expert on foreign affairs, who has no expectation of being a Minister or who doesn't want to become a Minister, or whatever.  In our circumstances, in a very small House, if you strip out 30 Ministers and 30 Opposition Deputies to shadow them, it's a very small House.  I mean, our system is impeccably democratic.  Nobody can say that there's a point of view in the country that isn't represented here.  Some of them are strangers to legislating but they perform other very important roles.

But, a distinction was drawn between that and Anglo Irish and, I must say, I had a doubt in my mind about Anglo Irish - I think that was widely shared.  I think the Minister for Finance - I had been opposite him for a year and a month, I think it was, in justice - and I think you could see the learning curve that he was on.  And I think ... let me put it this way, he was at least, at that stage, asking himself the same question.  Now, I would not have expected him to get up in the House and make a ... a statement because that would have obvious repercussions.  But I think he had reached the stage ... not, I think, in respect of what are now called the pillar banks but in terms of Anglo Irish, I think that he had reached the stage ... and I say that from ... in addition ... I say that from some discussions that I had with him before, during and after ... I think he himself was asking himself questions about whether Anglo was in fact rotten.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#ZZ01700","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":1267,"content":"<p>And are you suggesting that he had come to a view on that question at that time?

And, T&aacute;naiste, it relates to the, the issue of stamp duty and the debate that was raging around stamp duty in 2007.  And, again, going into that election, all of the main parties competed on how they were going to help first-time buyers deal with the stamp duty issue.  And, as you know, up until then there was a threshold of &euro;317,500 and any purchase by a first-time buyer of a home up to that level was exempt and any purchase above that, stamp duty kicked in.  And the Labour Party proposed to extend that exemption up to I think it was &euro;450,000, so ... effectively exempting the vast majority of first-time buyers from stamp duty.  Like, what was the thinking at that time, given that prices had probably peaked in late 2006 and prices were beginning to fall in the early part of 2007?  Had you any concern that creating that incentive might actually push prices back up and put houses further out of reach for first-time buyers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#AAA00700","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":1273,"content":"<p>T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#AAA00800","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":1274,"content":"<p>Yes, I mean, the purpose behind the Labour Party proposal - and, in fact, it was joined to Fine Gael ... it was a discussion which was held between both of the parties - was that the first time ... it was to try and tilt the regime in relation to stamp duty in favour of first-time buyers because the cost of a house, particularly in urban areas, had actually risen, from the figures you quoted, somewhere in the three hundred thousands up to over &euro;450,000.  And in more expensive parts of cities like Galway and Cork and Dublin, even far higher than that.  So, for instance, two civil servants on something like ... a HEO's salary or a nurse or someone like that, a teacher ... two teachers married to each other, were finding themselves priced out of being able to afford a house.  So the objective was to try and ensure that people on reasonable incomes could actually take part in home ownership, which, I think, had been agreed as being a desirable social policy by practically all parties in the House.  Now, what happened then was, as well, you had, in relation to second-hand properties, which had been traditionally somewhat cheaper, you know, particularly in less expensive areas, you had competition which the Bacon reports attempted to address.  You had competition from investors who got favourable tax treatment and again there was a disadvantage to the traditional buyer who was providing a residential home for themselves as they sought to establish a family for themselves and their ... their partner.  And there was a step ... there was a step system where once the value went over a certain amount, you jumped up into a much higher rate of stamp duty.  And the proposals by the Labour Party and Fine Gael were to try and iron out the anomalies, which were arising at that point, which were putting home ownership out of the reach of people who traditionally ... I think everybody - all parties - wanted to be involved.  Now, Fianna F&aacute;il, of course, subsequently abolished stamp duty for first-time buyers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#AAA00900","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":1275,"content":"<p>Okay, thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#AAA01000","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":1276,"content":"<p>So that answered the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#AAA01100","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":1277,"content":"<p>Senator D'Arcy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#AAA01200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":1278,"content":"<p>T&aacute;naiste, you were the ...

Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for the invitation to appear here today before the committee of inquiry into the banking crisis.  I have furnished the committee with a statement, which sets out of responses to the specific areas on which the committee has asked me to focus.  I won't repeat the detail of the statement in my opening submission but will confine myself instead to some specific points.  I'll concentrate on the time period of which the committee has asked me to address - the years between 2001 and 2008.<\/p> <p>  As my statement indicates, I've been involved in property and in property investment and development for the past 30 years.  I've a professional background in construction surveying but in the later years, my studies were in the area of project management.  Having worked with some of Ireland's leading property companies, I went on to form ... I went on to found Castlethorn Construction with my partners in 1989.  Over the time, the company gained a reputation for developing quality homes in areas that were connected and serviced by quality infrastructure.  These homes were built in locations where housing development was endorsed by local and national policy.<\/p> <p>  In the period between 2001 and 2008, Castlethorn Construction built approximately 3,000 homes.  Part V  social and affordable housing was included in these schemes.<\/p> <p>  In 2005, I formally established Chartered Land, which is the retail and office property division of the group.  This organisation owns and manages some of the most valuable and prestigious retail investments in Dublin, including Dundrum Town Centre.  The company has a 50% share in both the ILAC Shopping Centre off Henry Street and the Pavilion Shopping Centre in Swords.  With more than 500 tenants under management, these three centres support in excess of 11,000 retail and related jobs in the local economy.  The commercial office portfolio of Chartered Land includes 150,000 sq. ft. of modern office space in Dundrum and 400,000 sq. ft. of offices at Grand Canal Square in the so-called silicon docks.  Grand Canal Square, which has now been sold, is home to Facebook's European headquarters with a thousand employees and a host of other fast-growing and demanding large spaces users.<\/p> <p>  In addition to these investments, Chartered Land has secured planning permission to develop three co-located sites beside each of the retail investments.  While these proposed developments didn't proceed due to the recession, we're confident that they will be delivered at a point in the future.  In time, Dublin city centre proposal will make a significant contribution to the regeneration of the north inner city area.<\/p> <p>  Some of our other developments include the Bord G&aacute;is Energy theatre and a retail-led, mixed use, commercial scheme of Grafton Street in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  It might be helpful to the committee if I outline our approach to property opportunities as a group.  Firstly, it's important to recognise that large-scale property investment and development is a complex business.  Our approach to investment was driven by a clear long-term strategy to develop, or acquire, internationally attractive premium real estate in the retail, commercial and residential sectors.  These properties have to satisfy certain criteria.  For example, they had to be close to major transport nodes and had to appeal to the target catchment population.<\/p><p>Secondly, our focus was on prime areas in dense population in the greater Dublin area.  We didn't undertake development outside the greater area or outside of ... outside the greater Dublin area or outside of Ireland.  <\/p><p> Thirdly, our approach to development was very much guided by national, regional and local policy, whether in relation to housing, commercial or retail development.  <\/p><p> Fourthly, our approach reflected detailed and sound research of possible investment and development opportunities.  This was an exhaustive process, addressing both upside and downside risk.  It involved input from planning, design, construction, development, property and finance personnel.  Following initial appraisals, the assessment of each project moved to detailed in-house financial modelling considering different funding options, profitability and exit routes.  We undertook detailed market research, modelled project demand for each investment or development.  This involved engaging experienced property agents and international third-party experts.  For development, the planning and development framework work relevant to each site was extensively reviewed with the input of our planning consultants.<\/p><p> Finally, our approach to assessing new projects was based on utilising the best advice that we could secure for each relevant discipline.  We had ,and continue to have, a strong internal team, but we have supplemented this expertise with external advisers and consultants, where necessary.  This detailed process was key to the success of both Chartered Land and Castlethorn.  Our attention to detail ensured that any decisions we made to proceed with new investments or developments were well-grounded, thoroughly researched and based on sound, objective business assessments.<\/p><p> During the period under review, we had borrowed from a number of banks, including AIB, Anglo Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, KBC and Ulster Bank.  In financing our properties, bank debt was complemented with promoter equity.  Our approach to dealing with our lenders was based on formal engagement with each bank.  At all times, we followed the normal process that applied for the assessment of any loan application.  In my statement to the inquiry, I've outlined the approach that we employed, including our detailed engagement with the lenders to secure support for each proposal.  I can say that, at all times, from a corporate perspective, our engagement with lenders was formal, professional and based on the appropriate and documented procedures.  Loans were only sanctioned after ... or loans were only sanctioned following extensive engagement with the relevant lender and formal sanction by the bank's credit committee.  The type of information typically to be provided with each application included: investment or development rationale; financial appraisals; projected cash flows; external planning reports and risk analysis; an independent asset valuation report; a legal title report; the exit strategy, supported by robust market research.  Once a funder engaged, a term sheet was negotiated and solicitors were then appointed to draft the loan and security documents, while legal, technical due diligence was also conducted during the time ... during this time.  Preconditions were agreed for loan drawdowns over the term of each facility, while loans ... while loan advances were subject to comprehensive financial and asset management reporting.  In 2010, the economic downturn, our loans were acquired by NAMA.  We began to work with the agency to maximise the value of the assets.  For the past six years, we've enjoyed a professional relationship with NAMA and we worked hard to assist the agency to meet its objectives.<\/p><p>As the committee will be aware, our loans are currently being sold by the agency in a loan sale process called Project Jewel.  It's likely that the return to NAMA, when the loans are sold, will be a multiple of the figure that NAMA paid for these loans in 2010, and that the original capital borrowed, both personally and corporately, may be fully repaid. <\/p><p> I understand that the committee will be reaching some conclusions on the cause of the banking crisis, and, in this regard, you've heard from a wide range of witnesses with different views.  What seems apparent now is that at the time of the crisis there was too much debt available for borrowers from too many banks.  It's of note, for example, that there were 59 land transactions in Ireland in 2001, but this had risen to 260 by 2006. The problem was compounded by lending in respect of poor quality assets, where insufficient equity was invested.  While both Chartered Land and Castlethorn did borrow in the period between 2001 and 2008, these loans were advanced following a thorough and full assessment of each proposal.  Our debts were secured against prime assets, I believe this will be demonstrated with the Project Jewel, when Project Jewel completes.<\/p><p> In terms of the crash itself, there was a failure to predict and anticipate the sale of the banking and property crises.  On the property side, the talk of a soft landing was misplaced, particularly given that investment property values fell by 60%, with land values falling by as much as 90% in certain parts of the country.  On the banking side, the capital structure of certain lenders was inappropriate, for the nature of their exposure.  There was an over-reliance on property based lending by some of our institutions, including some international banks, some who had been operating in Ireland for a relatively short period of time.<\/p><p> From my personal perspective and for the benefit ... and with the benefit of hindsight, I do regret that I did not foresee the extent of the banking crisis and the property crash.  The severity of the crash took most property professionals by surprise, as it did the Department of Finance, the Central Bank, and many respected international agencies.  Looking to the future, we must ensure that the appropriate system of checks and balances is introduced to prevent a repeat of the failures in the period leading up to the crisis.  Property investment and development has a significant role to play in the regeneration of our economy.  The challenge is to implement policies which recognise the positive contribution that property companies make and which encourages, in a responsible way, the delivery of real estate, which contributes to employment, housing provision and a general economic growth.  I'm sure that the report of the committee will help to shape these policies. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to address the inquiry today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072300002#HHH00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437606000,"counter":1310,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. O'Reilly, for your opening statement.

One thing that is troubling me is why Mr. Nicholas Jermyn is in the line management command and control structure dealing with this issue or correspondence relating to it.  My understanding is that he is the former chief executive officer of the organisation, which now has an acting chief executive officer and a deputy chief executive officer and a number of senior management staff who would be in line management over issues such as procurement and financial oversight.  I am a little curious as to why a person whom we were led to believe had the role of a consultant specifically on strategic matters is the person who is actually dealing with correspondence in this regard.  I might also just ask whether it is possible that our HSE colleagues may be able to cast some light on this, because they would have an interest and an historical opinion on management structures in St. Vincent's.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to personalise this at all, but I do not think it is appropriate that somebody from KPMG is conducting an independent investigation.

The question arises from our level of satisfaction with St. Vincent's effectively investigating itself.  The questions that need to be asked are not only about the person who is in line management on procurement issues but about the institutional reaction to it.  For the hospital to say it will not come to a statutory body such as our committee because there is another investigation under way, when it has commissioned the investigation and picked the people who will do it, is, I believe, entirely inappropriate, and it should not be an excuse for them not to come to the meeting today.  We should, I believe, have an opinion as to the adequacy of an investigation that is being conducted in that way.  The specific questions I would ask about the people carrying out the investigation are as follows.  How were they picked?  How much are they being paid?  What are the terms of reference and who drew them up?  I do not think it flies.<\/p><p>There is form in this regard, and it is on the public record of the Seanad that I drew attention to major concerns about an issue that was highlighted in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in December 2013, as well as a time, 11 years before, when I had grave concerns about certain issues that had arisen in St. Vincent's.  At the time it was stated that an independent investigation had been conducted.  I provided documents in the House which showed that the investigation team had again been chosen by St. Vincent's and paid for by the hospital, and the terms of reference had been drawn up by St. Vincent's.  This is not the way publicly funded bodies should be doing their business.  I do not think that we should be happy that they have deferred their attendance to answer valid questions being put to them today because of another investigation that they have undertaken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#D01000","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1437656400,"counter":1635,"content":"<p>St. Vincent's hospital is getting substantial amounts of taxpayers' money.

I am concerned that no timeframe has been set.  I certainly think the committee should write to them stating that members expect them to come before the joint committee within a certain period to answer the valid questions that members want to ask.

A separate Garda investigation is being conducted.  In respect of the internal investigation, we have no idea of the terms of reference or the timeline, as others have mentioned, and there is a possible conflict of interest in respect of the person who has been appointed.  I would have thought that if we received a letter from St. Vincent's Healthcare Group it would have come from somebody who is more relevant to the issues we are concerned about today - namely, procurement - and not from the director of strategy, who is not responsible for procurement.  Probably, it should have been the chairman of the St. Vincent's University Hospital, Mr. James Menton, or the chief executive officer who communicated with committee.  The concern is that Mr. Menton is a partner at KPMG and the person heading up the investigation is a member of staff in KPMG.  We would like to ask why that particular choice was made.  There are serious questions that are relevant to the entire procurement process and the manner in which the investigation is going to take place that we would have liked St. Vincent's to answer and that it still should answer.  The message that should go out in writing from this committee is that St. Vincent's University hospital should reconsider its decision, that there is an onus on it to do so, and that, while we may not be able to compel it, that does not exempt it from its responsibility to be here before us and to account for taxpayers' money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#D01200","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1437656400,"counter":1637,"content":"<p>I would like to express my disappointment that representatives of St. Vincent's hospital did not attend this meeting.

As this is the first time representatives of Beacon Hospital have been before the committee, I would like to outline some brief information on the hospital.  The hospital opened in October 2006 and is now established as one of Ireland&rsquo;s most advanced high-tech private hospitals.  It has 183 acute care beds and nine operating theatres.  Last year, it treated 100,000 patients.  Some 800 health care professionals are working out of the hospital.  They provide world-class acute care services in many areas, including orthopaedics, cardiology, women&rsquo;s health, urology, vascular surgery, ear, nose and throat, neurology, general surgery and comprehensive cancer care.  The hospital is known for providing an excellent standard of care to all patients and visitors while conducting its business to the highest ethical standards.<br\/><br\/>From the outset, I would like to say how shocked and disappointed the entire team and staff at Beacon Hospital were after RTE broadcast its &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; programme last week.  The hospital has strict procurement policies and procedures in place.  Any alleged breach of these policies and procedures is taken extremely seriously.Likewise, the hospital has a comprehensive staff handbook and conflict of interest policies governing relationships with suppliers and patients.  Following the allegations made in the programme, an internal investigation was launched.  As part of this investigation, we have brought in an external independent forensic auditor to review our history of dealings with the supplier in question and all suppliers.  The auditor will also audit and evaluate the hospital&rsquo;s procurement procedures and processes to ensure the controls within the procurement chain are robust.  This investigation is ongoing.  I can confirm to the committee that an employee at the centre of the allegations has since resigned his position.<br\/><br\/>I understand that a criminal investigation is under way.  I do not want to make any further comment that may prejudice the outcome of such an investigation.  I have a summary of our procurement policy, which I can read into the record if the Chairman wishes<font color=\"#FF0000\">. <\/font>It is also contained at appendix A of our submission.  While I am happy that our procurement policies and procedures are robust, I look forward to receiving the findings of our internal investigation and implementing any recommendations.

As the chief executive officer of a private hospital, he is not under a statutory obligation to come forward here today.  His presence is appreciated.  It is sickening to think that Mr. Cullen's counterpart at St. Vincent's hospital - the chief executive officer of a hospital that is publicly funded by the taxpayer - did not see fit to come to this meeting to answer questions.  The comparison between the two is unbelievable.  I thank Mr. Cullen for coming forward.  While Beacon Hospital is a private hospital, it is funded by the public through private health insurance.  We all know that the cost of private health insurance has been increasing significantly in recent years.  The alleged impropriety that seems to have been ongoing has been helping to drive up costs.  Once again, struggling families who are being put to the pin of their collars to maintain their private health insurance are being left to carry the can.<\/p> <p>  When did Mr. Cullen become aware of what was happening?  Did he make the HSE aware of it?  He said the hospital was carrying out an investigation, and I welcome that.  I note that he felt he could come forward at today's meeting even though an investigation is being carried out.  The authorities at St. Vincent's hospital do not seem to share that perspective.

We are told a dossier was presented to the Minister last September that referenced seven hospitals, which were not named, to my best knowledge.  I understand a number of those are taxpayer-funded, while some clearly were not.  Could Mr. Cullen advise us whether the Beacon Hospital was one of the hospitals referenced for that investigation, which I understand is being conducted by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation?  Were there any earlier indications, prior to the \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme last week, of wrongdoing in respect of procurement practices at the Beacon Hospital?<\/p> <p>  I understand that an investigation into these matters is ongoing within the hospital, and I hope externally also, but in terms of the recent programme, which focused on a single supplier, and what he may or may not know at this point in time, will Mr. Cullen confirm to the committee if he will be looking at all procurement and suppliers and not just the entity named in the programme?  Will he confirm that his investigation and his co-operation with any external investigation will be holistic in terms of addressing this matter in the round?  This is hugely important.  I do not believe anyone is of the view that this is isolated to a single supplier.  The practices that have been exposed very likely apply in a number of situations.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Cullen's statement aside, would he accept, given the understandable extent of public anger at what has been witnessed and what has been demonstrated to us across our television screens, that some of the reportage in the media about getting gifts is a very mild way of presenting something that is far more serious?  Quite frankly, these are pay-offs, no matter what way one looks at it.  It is very serious because, quite clearly, the matters under investigation are not just about pay-offs for favouritism but are about procurements approved for highly inflated costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#F00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1437656400,"counter":1647,"content":"<p>Does Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in understand that is an allegation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#F00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1437656400,"counter":1648,"content":"<p>Yes, and that it is, of course, under investigation.

We thought it was an unusual request and were a little mystified as to why we would be asked such a question.  It became more apparent later that day when the employee at the centre of the allegations came to see me with a letter he had received from \"Prime Time\" containing all the allegations that were the centre of his participation in the programme.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy asked when the investigation would be complete.  I am hoping it will be complete within a couple of weeks.  I cannot give an exact time because it is ongoing.  The Deputy also asked how much was involved.  All we can say at the moment is that the employee allegedly received a holiday from the supplier which was, according to the programme, to the value of &euro;8,800 or thereabouts.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy asked if we receive HSE work.  We do.  We tender for HSE waiting list initiative work, and in 2014 that was to the value of approximately &euro;250,000.  We have tendered this year for a greater level of work and I would anticipate that it could be worth more than &euro;1 million but probably less than &euro;1.5 million for the calendar year, although I do not know for sure at the moment. <\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy asked if company law is strong enough.  I believe it is strong enough.  There is a Garda investigation into this matter.

I thank Mr. Cullen for coming in.  In a previous life I worked in procurement, although it was in the office supplies business, so it is an area that I know a lot about.  Unfortunately, I am not surprised at what the investigation by \"Prime Time Investigates\" came out with, having seen the ugly aspects of procurement.  Therefore, my specific questions are based on my knowledge of that area.<\/p> <p>  I notice that within Mr. Cullen's processes, he said that the supply chain management team was prohibited from receiving gratuities and favours.  Does that apply to all staff of the Beacon Hospital?  Does the hospital have a policy of declaring gifts above a certain amount?  How does it deal with this?  Of course, there are certain exchanges, and people can have a cup of coffee, but we are not talking about that.  What is the level at which people must declare?  For example, there could be indirect things, such as days at sporting events, that do not necessarily have a set value, but they can be an implied gift.<\/p> <p>  As regards the Beacon Hospital's external forensic audit, will the auditor be examining the stock levels held by a supplier?  Very often, overstocking by a certain supplier can be one of the areas of concern.  In addition, is there a coincidence with the timing of orders concerning suppliers?  Very often, a salesperson needs to reach a target and therefore the orders are done conveniently to facilitate that, but do not necessarily benefit the company in question.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cullen spoke about going out to tender, but I would imagine that the hospital has preferred suppliers, so how does it review the supplier relationships?  Is an audit undertaken, every two years or so, to look at how key supplier relationships are maintained, who the contacts are, and the level of ordering from those suppliers?

However, as with any relationship between a member of staff and a supplying company, there is an element of trust, and that trust is open to abuse at times.  Although these are merely allegations, it suggests that this trust may have been misplaced.

In most cases, that brand would have an exclusive distributor in Ireland.  Given that we are led by clinician choice, that restricts somewhat our ability to negotiate with individual suppliers.  Having said that, we receive three quotes in all cases with regard to particular types of product.  While the clinician might have a preference for brand A, we will obtain quotes for brands B and C to ensure that brand A was appropriately priced.  If it was not, the clinician would be shown this and asked if there was a possibility of changing brand, or we would go back to the distributor of brand A to look for a more competitive price.

That answers those questions.<\/p><p> I may have answered some of Senator Burke's questions.  I am happy to tell the Senator that our cost per patient has been decreasing over the last number of years, driven by a number of elements.  One is the economic crisis, which forced a reduction in the reimbursements we receive from insurance companies.  We received decreases of significant percentages from 2009 onwards, which forced us to be more aggressive in our purchasing.  Our hospital and many others, both public and private, have driven the cost of care down through necessity.  This has been a huge part of the management's activity both in purchasing and in senior management over the last number of years.<\/p><p> Senator van Turnhout asked about gratuities.

In order to assist in providing as much information to the committee as possible, I am joined today by a number of my colleagues, namely, Mr. John Swords, HSE head of procurement; Mr. Michael Flynn, national director internal audit; Dr. Geraldine Smith, assistant national director internal audit; and Mr. Tom Lynch, who is here today in his capacity as both chairman of Ireland East Hospital Group, of which St. Vincent's University Hospital is a constituent element, and as an experienced chartered accountant and auditor.<br\/><br\/>Health business services, HBS, is a division of the HSE.  HBS procurement is responsible for sourcing, purchasing, storage and distribution of goods and services within HSE.  The value of goods and services that the HSE procures on an annual basis is approximately &euro;1.6 billion.  The total spend on non-pay goods and services in the public health environment is just under &euro;4 billion, some of which is in voluntary bodies and some in the Office of Government Procurement.  Significant procurement savings have been achieved by the health sector of &euro;230 million between 2010 and 2014 across a wide range of goods and services.  A further saving of &euro;28 million has been achieved in 2015 to date.  The HSE and all section 38 and section 39 agencies funded by the HSE are required to comply with the HSE's procurement policy, National Financial Regulations and framework for corporate and financial governance, and with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.  The HSE's National Financial Regulations, NFR 1 Purchase to Pay sets out, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the requirements for sourcing suppliers and the tendering and contracting requirements.<br\/><br\/>Procurement throughout the HSE is subject to internal audit by the HSE's internal audit division and external audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Procurement is reviewed as part of the HSE's annual internal audit plan and the findings of all audits are regularly reported to the HSE management and audit committee.  In the past two years, 42 audits dealing with procurement, or aspects of procurement, have been completed.  Recommendations to address control weaknesses identified as part of these audits are advised to management for implementation and the control weaknesses are reflected in the HSE's annual review of the statement of internal financial control.  The status of management implementation of the audit recommendations is regularly tracked and reported to the HSE's audit committee and leadership team.<br\/><br\/>Section 38 and section 39 agencies are independent entities with their own boards of directors and management teams.  As independent entities, they are responsible for establishing and overseeing their own systems of internal control and are subject to audit by their own internal and external auditors.  St. Vincent's is a section 38 agency.  As part of the &quot;one voice for health sector procurement&quot; reform plan, future contracts for St. Vincent's hospital will be included in the overall health sector requirements.  Other non-health goods and services outside of this will be channelled through the Office of Government Procurement.  We are currently working with all the newly established hospital groups to generate a three-year procurement plan.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme, which outlined a number of allegations regarding two staff members of St. Vincent's University Hospital and a medical and surgical company, these allegations referred to the provision of holidays, the receipt of a gift voucher and the provision of confidential commercial information to a particular medical and surgical company.  Should these allegations be proved, the actions are entirely unacceptable and ones that the HSE would condemn in the strongest manner.  The actions are only allegations.  St. Vincent's is investigating them and it is important to allow due process to take its course.  The actions alleged would be unfair to competitors and minimise the opportunity to obtain best value for money.  As per the Ethics in Public Procurement document, public procurement must at all times be discharged with probity, transparency and accountability in a manner that secures best value for public money.<br\/><br\/>In September 2014, the Minister for Health received correspondence from Deputy Emmet Stagg, which was copied to the Minister for Justice and Equality, enclosing specific allegations made to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in June 2014 against named staff at five private, voluntary and statutory hospitals.  The HSE's national director of internal audit met with the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, GBFI, in November 2014 and offered to provide any possible assistance it might require in respect of the two HSE hospitals referred to in the communication from the Department and agreed to carry out a review in the HSE hospitals named by the whistleblower, namely, Mullingar and St Columcille's, to ascertain any evidence to support the claims made and so assist the GBFI in its overall investigation into the allegations.<br\/><br\/>The internal audits of St Columcille's and Mullingar identified deficiencies in procurement controls but no evidence of wrongdoing.  Collusion between supplier and purchaser, as alleged in this case, is very difficult to be detected by management, internal audit and external audit.  The whistleblower contacted and met garda&iacute; with specific allegations but did not meet or provide the Department or the HSE with any direct evidence of the allegations made.  The allegations are the subject of an ongoing Garda investigation and care must be taken not to prejudice or hinder the Garda investigation in any potential prosecution.<br\/><br\/>I will outline the actions the HSE has taken regarding the allegations raised in the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme.  The HSE has suspended payments to Eurosurgical pending further clarification and investigation.  The HSE has arranged and met with the company to outline its concerns and, in particular, to seek assurances from the company regarding security of supply and patient care.  The HSE has requested full disclosure regarding allegations of Eurosurgical's involvement in arranging holidays etc. for health procurement staff or any health staff, and on receipt of this will conduct a comprehensive investigation.  The HSE has sought and received information regarding Eurosurgical's internal investigation.  The HSE has been in contact with St. Vincent's University Hospital and has been informed that it has suspended, without prejudice, the two members of staff in question, pending the completion of an internal forensic investigation by the hospital.  A communication was issued to procurement staff reaffirming their obligations under the HSE's procurement rules and regulations.<br\/><br\/>The overall HSE expenditure with Eurosurgical for 2014 is &euro;6 million of which approximately &euro;4 million relates to the HSE directly and approximately &euro;2 million to the voluntary sector funded by the HSE.  Since the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme, the HSE has reviewed &euro;1.08 million worth of contracts with the company and the HSE has no concerns arising at this time.  Regarding the balance of the expenditure, HSE procurement is in the process of reviewing it.  HSE is currently in a tender process for surgical consumables, including the type of items provided by Eurosurgical, and the outcome of the process is near completion.<br\/><br\/>The health service is currently undergoing a series of further reforms which will see the development of hospital and community groups to strengthen the delivery of front-line health and social care services.  To support these changes, the directorate of the HSE has established Health Business Services, HBS, a shared service division which includes procurement in its range of functions.  The HBS strategy was adopted in February 2014 and is currently being implemented.  A key component of this strategy is &quot;one voice for health sector procurement&quot;.  In accordance with the Government decision of 23 April 2013, all agencies funded via the HSE are required to collaborate regarding procurement, delivering &quot;one voice for health sector procurement&quot;.  The HSE Director General has requested HBS procurement to lead the development of the concept and its subsequent implementation.  Requirement for additional procurement capacity has been identified as part of the reform programme to meet the increasing complexities of the procurement process.<br\/><br\/>In implementing the strategy, the section 38 and section 39 agencies are mandated to use framework agreements and contracts awarded by HBS procurement and the Office of Government Procurement.  This is in line with a recommendation by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2013 report regarding the wider use of framework contracts.  The HSE has in place a national financial controls assurance group that is a evaluating areas of expenditure with a view to reviewing risk, and will undertake detailed further review in areas of deemed high risk.  I am happy to take questions and may ask my colleagues to answer some of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1437656400,"counter":1699,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending.<\/p><p>I am somewhat amused by the contrast between the number of officials from the HSE and the one person who was sent to represent the Beacon Hospital.<\/p><p> It is a matter of fact that, as a result of a procurement process, a publicly funded hospital paid ten times what it would previously have paid for services provided to it.

Regarding the dossier that we have already referenced and that the Minister received last year in respect of a number of hospitals, it was said at the time and since, most recently in the context of the \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme, that the allegations contained in the dossier were worse than those presented in the programme.  The Garda bureau of fraud investigation is continuing to investigate, yet we have seen a public statement of denial of any knowledge of the above by the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  While there are two hospitals identified as HSE hospitals, Mullingar and St. Columcille's among them, is it Mr. Woods's understanding that the St. Vincent's Private Hospital, part of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, was indeed another of that number of hospitals?  Will he fill in the missing pieces in respect of the other entities involved?<\/p> <p>  How would Mr. Woods view it that the St. Vincent's hospital group only recently denied any knowledge of a Garda investigation that was allegedly set in train last September, yet here we are two months off its first anniversary?  What is the extent of the Garda investigation and how could it possibly be that the management of such a facility would be absolutely unaware of it?  How focused and how active is this investigation, to the best of Mr. Woods's knowledge?<\/p> <p>  We are told that there are two staff on paid leave at St. Vincent's and one, as Mr. Cullen has indicated, has resigned from the Beacon Hospital.  Are there others at any of these other hospital sites, either before or since the programme, who are either on paid leave or have resigned consequent on questions arising in respect of procurement practices?<\/p> <p>  As I asked Mr. Cullen earlier regarding the named business entity, the supplier company, is the HSE encouraging the widest possible address of possible other cases of inappropriate relationships between suppliers and various hospital sites?  What steps is the HSE taking regarding procurement in its widest application across all HSE sites or, indeed, HSE-funded sites, either in whole or in part?  We know of internal investigations taking place at St. Vincent's and the Beacon Hospital, but what has the \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme incited the HSE to do across all of its hospital sites and all of the other health-related facilities that come under its charge either in full or in part?<\/p> <p>  In the opening remarks of Mr. Woods's statement to us this afternoon, he stated: \"The amount of goods and services that the HSE procures on an annual basis is approximately &euro;1.6 billion.\"<\/p><p>My sense is that these goods and services do not include drugs and health-related equipment, and I ask for clarification on this.  I am aware the drugs bill is significantly greater.  These procurement practices likely cannot be confined to the type of situation exposed in the \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme.  Billions more are spent by the HSE on behalf of citizens in ensuring we have a health service to meet our needs.  What has the HSE undertaken in light of the \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme to address the huge expenditure in procuring not only goods and services but also drugs and health-related equipment and whatever other expenditure?  Quite clearly, there is room for abuse right across this public spend.  As a committee member, I would like an assurance that this is being addressed as it should be.<\/p><p> I suggest to Mr. Cullen, who is still here, and to the HSE that while the focus of the \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme - and it almost directs the investigation towards them - was on those directly involved in procurement, I am mindful of what Mr. Cullen said in response to earlier questioning on the more likely recipients of a thank-you.  Most of these - all of them, one would hope - were bona fide small gestures, such as a box of chocolates or whatever the case may be, but Mr. Cullen stated that the likely recipients were practitioners and clinicians.  Is there a way of addressing this?  The likelihood is that the procurement staff might very well be at the bottom of the buy-off pyramid.  Others can influence procurement policy and practices.  Is this also being taken on board?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#L01000","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437656400,"counter":1711,"content":"<p>I thank the HSE for coming before the committee.  The allegations that have already been made are very worrying.  The real concern of the committee, and what is at the back of everybody's mind, is whether this is the tip of the iceberg.  What we hope to have from the HSE this afternoon is confirmation of the safeguards that are in place to ensure that allegations such as those we have heard do not arise.  I accept what Mr. Cullen stated earlier about the question of trust in this area.  Having said this, systems and safeguards must be in place to ensure there are no areas where allegations such as these can arise.  The safeguards must be such that everything is above board.  This is what we need from the HSE.  We need an outline of the procurement procedures in place at present.  Does it happen on an individual hospital basis, a group basis, an area basis or a national basis?  How is it done?  What safeguards are built into the system?<\/p> <p>  What is health business services?  I have not heard much about it.  Apparently, it has a key role in procurement.  What are the terms of reference of this organisation?  Is it part of the HSE?  Are there others on a board?  How does the process work?  We also need to hear from the internal audit people, and I am delighted they have come before the committee.  This is another crucial area in this matter.  How often do internal audits take place at whatever level, be it at hospital or group level?  Are they indicated in advance?  Are they done on specific locations or specific groups of hospitals?  Are they done on specific items of equipment?

Deputy Troy asked what monitoring process is in place and a number of committee members asked about the control environment for procurement in the HSE, so I will take the opportunity of answering Deputy Troy's question to answer the others also.  I will ask my colleagues, including those in internal audit, to contribute where relevant.  The accountability environment in the HSE is that we have a directorate under legislation.  We have an audit committee with an externally appointed chair.  We have a delegated management accountability structure to national director and group and community health organisation level in the system.<\/p> <p>  On the hospital side, gross expenditure of &euro;4.8 billion goes through seven hospital groups, including paediatrics.  I will start with the voluntary element, which is the entities that are not directly funded by the HSE.  As I said in my statement, these are accountable through their own boards for their own governance, but the HSE has a service level agreement in place with them which includes requirements to comply with the national procurement standards of the HSE.  It also seeks the annual signing of a compliance statement with such requirements - not only procurement but other requirements - and this process has been in place.  We will speak more about this if required.<\/p> <p>  There is an extensive set of financial and procurement regulations in the HSE, which specify how procurement is to be transacted, our requirement to comply with public sector tendering and our duties to our staff.  There are codes of behaviour in our code of governance, which are legally set out as required under the 2004 Act.  All of this information is on our website and we can make it available to the committee in succinct form if it is helpful.  The code of governance sets requirements for individuals in terms of their personal behaviour.  Staff equivalent to and above grade 8, which is middle management level, are bound by the Ethics in Public Office Act, with which committee members are familiar.  The voluntary sector is accountable for its own arrangements and gives assurance to HSE.<\/p> <p>  More lately, as I said in my statement, the Government has adopted an approach of seeking to integrate the purchase of common goods and services throughout all Departments in pursuit of public value.<\/p><p>The HSE is a major contributor to that.  Over &euro;2 billion of total contract negotiation for goods and services within the HSE is now moved to the Office of Government Procurement, which is also doing similar activity with other Government Departments and entities.  The HSE is directly contracting for direct health related product.  The tendering the HSE will do in the future is primarily for health related product or technical and supplies products that are so intimately linked into the health environment that they require a direct health sector involvement.  At the end of last year we signed a memorandum of understanding with the Office of Government Procurement regarding the way that relationship is to work and we are working co-operatively with that office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437656400,"counter":1716,"content":"<p>What does that mean?

There is actually a strong system of governance and accountability operating, and it is well documented.  However, as you rightly point out, there can be breaches or alleged breaches that are significant matters of concern.  From our point of view, as I said in the opening statement and I will ask my colleagues in internal audit to say more on it, we audit our compliance internally and we are audited externally by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That brings to light issues within procurement where we must take action to rectify them.<\/p> <p>  To make another point on the general context, we have also developed a document called \"One Voice for Health Sector Procurement\"  with some third party support.  It is an integration of the buying between voluntary and statutory entities in the HSE.  The observation in the opening statement that goods contracted in the future for St. Vincent's Hospital or any other public entity will be part of wider contracts is in support of the recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the chapter referred to in the 2013 report.<\/p> <p>  We must also consider what we must do to ensure that the rule set in complied with, how failures occur and what happens when we see those.  In terms of compliance, management review is the first point of responsibility.  Then there is internal audit and external audit.  Regarding where there is alleged collusion or collusion between parties internally and externally, and I will return to the detail of Deputy Troy's questions shortly, to refer to the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in it is correct that ordering of goods is not unique to procurement.  In the HSE there is wide scale distributed ordering of goods.  Indeed, one of the audit recommendations we would face as a challenge is that being such a distributed organisation the segregation of duties can be difficult at times, because we do not always have people in remote locations to sign off in the three way reference the Deputy mentioned with our colleague from the Beacon clinic.  To be blunt, where there is collusion or alleged collusion we require extra vigilance and we must learn from any such incidents.<\/p> <p>  The rule set is there to give a general assurance that we have good procedures in place.  The practices we must engage in after that are constant reviews.  Regarding incidents such as this, I will speak in detail later in the answers to questions on what we have done since we saw this incident. It is referred to in my statement.  Of course, we must act, and act with great vigilance and urgency to ensure this is not happening at a wider level.  We would share a concern regarding a requirement for constant vigilance in this area.  This is not solely a procurement issue, and I take that point on board.<\/p> <p>  I will ask my colleague from internal audit to say a little more about the financial governance and internal audit component of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437656400,"counter":1718,"content":"<p>I am the national director of internal audit.

We also audit some of the funded agencies on a programme of audits.  We have approximately 40 staff in internal audit within the HSE, all dedicated to the work of internal audit.

We look at the backroom operations as well.  We produce a number of reports every year.  Most of our reports would have adverse findings in respect of improvements that could be made to the controls we have, and procurement would be no different in that regard.  A number of our reports would contain recommendations for improving controls over procurement.

Regarding when the Minister was informed, the HSE was advised by the Department so the Minister was not advised by the HSE of this allegation.  He was advised separately from us.  I do not wish to give a wrong date but I believe the timing of that may have been September last year.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if the current investigation is independent.  In terms of the work taking place within the HSE at present, the HBS division, which includes procurement, is undertaking a line-by-line transaction review.  Internal audit, which has an independent role within the organisation, will then support that in terms of undertaking any further inquiries.  However, as I said in the statement, we are reviewing every transaction.  That would include both supplies and capital, and I will return to capital under Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question because he referred to it.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the other two hospitals, the two HSE hospitals referred to are St. Columcille's and Mullingar.  Beacon Hospital and St. Vincent's Private Hospital were referred to and the media reported that the Bon Secours hospital was the fifth hospital reported in the original allegation.<\/p> <p>  On contracts out for tender and the reference to &euro;38 million, the Deputy is referring to the section 40\/02 disclosure requirements for the HSE for contracts over &euro;25,000 in value that have not been subject to tender.  The Deputy asked why that figure is growing.  There are a couple of basic reasons.  Part of the reason for contracting without tender would be that we contract with sole suppliers and there is no alternative, so it may be a valid reason to contract without tender.  In other circumstances, and they would be more significant in scale than the one I just mentioned, what we are seeing is a non-compliance with the requirement to use the procurement processes.  That is something that both internal audit and procurement then seek to enforce.  Indeed, the national financial controls assurance group I mentioned seeks to enforce proper compliance in local operating units of the HSE.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if I was aware of any trips associated with HSE procurement and if I was aware of an individual company.  I am aware of the name of the company but that is all.  I would be happy to receive more detail from the Deputy.  I have seen a reference to an employee of the Mater in the media, but I do not know any more than that at this stage.  I will have to revert to the Deputy on the patient management system that was not tendered for.  One valid possibility is that it is a sole supply and a single system already in place, but we would need to check and refer back to the Deputy.  I will do that.<\/p> <p>  Did the HSE cut prices for all section 38 organisations?  During the years of austerity the HSE imposed price freezes and negotiated price reductions across the entire environment, not just the voluntary sector.<\/p><p>I am not aware of some agencies being disadvantaged because others benefited.

The last meeting took place in Cork just two weeks ago, which had 106 people in attendance.  The initiative is also supported by a training programme on the web, in which we ask people to bring the programme back to their own staff and introduce it in that way.  The initiative has had the effect of raising awareness.  The matter is relevant to Deputy Troy's comment about the 42 reports.  In some ways, that has increased, but that is due to awareness.  People are more aware of the need to declare non-compliance by way of regulation and that comes from the compliance training that we have done.  While it is not good that it exists, it is good that people are aware of it, and that allows us then to address it through procurement.

I shall ask Mr. Lynch, in view of his experience as chairperson of a hospital group, to make some comments.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what we are doing, we have a single national procurement organisation that has a duty to create and maintain a rule set and provide a service to multiple entities - hospital groups - and support them in their need.  As well as compliance, access to goods and services is a critical component of procurement.  Logistics operations are another major aspect of what it does: warehousing and delivery to wards, theatres and such.  In terms of improving the accountability environment, members will be aware that the creation of hospital groups is a step forward in providing distributed accountability and responsibility at a more local level while maintaining a national procurement approach to ensure best value.  I may ask Mr. Lynch to say a word or two about that in terms of his experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#P00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437656400,"counter":1755,"content":"<p>The hospital groups envisioned in the Higgins report, which was published in 2013, are in the process of being established.  Over the last 12 months, we have been putting in place management teams for each of the six hospital groups.  One is already in place, for the Children's Hospital Group.  The sizes of the groups range from five hospitals to, in the case of the Ireland East Hospitals Group, 11 hospitals, one of which is St. Vincent's.  They are a mix of voluntary hospitals and what we call statutory hospitals, that is, those hospitals operated and owned by the HSE.  One hospital group in Galway, the Saolta group, is made up of only HSE hospitals.  We are in the process of establishing the governance.  We are working with the Minister for Health and the HSE on establishing boards for the groups, using the Health Act 2013 or other similar structures.  The management teams that are forming will be getting to grips with providing more decentralised local management, bringing the best of what the level 4 hospitals provide to level 3 hospitals around the country.  Part of that exercise will be managing procurement in association with the HSE and centralising those functions in the groups, together with the HSE, to ensure that we get the best value for public money.  It is early days yet, but we are beginning to see effective management being provided across the hospital system to support the work of the HSE centrally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thomas Lynch"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437656400,"counter":1756,"content":"<p>There were a couple of further points.  A Deputy asked what health business services, HBS, is.  There is a plan within the HSE for health business services, which we can make available to the committee.  It is a succinct document that fully explains this.  Very briefly, given that we are creating hospital groups and community health organisations, some functions within the HSE that run centrally at the moment need not be distributed and are better and more sensibly run from a shared location.  The services within health business services that will provide a service to all of the health environment in the future will include procurement, estates management, financial processing, personnel superannuation and HR services, which includes recruitment.  Those services can be provided at one time nationally, without duplicating everywhere.  Health business services is the name of the division, which has its own director within the HSE, that has a duty to provide those services across the whole organisation.  It allows hospital groups to focus on issues related to planning their future direction, dealing with care issues, and dealing with service provision.  There is a wider document and I am happy to make copies of that available to the committee if it is helpful.  I think we have covered the query on the internal audit approach.<\/p> <p>  The last question was what it means to say that additional procurement capacity is required.  Mr. Swords may add to this, but briefly, there are a few factors involved.  There is an increasing demand for procurement services from the organisation.  As compliance has been increasingly driven within the organisation over the last few years, there is greater demand on procurement as a service because people need that service to comply with procurement regulation and to buy goods and services in a way that makes good use of public funds.  That is an incoming demand.  We have also lost staff through the moratorium and the austerity we have been through, which is a factor.  Sometimes we are relying on relatively junior staff to do very significant things, which we have to be alert to and we must ensure we support these staff appropriately.  In terms of the split that took place between the Office for Government Procurement and us, we have ceded some staff to the Office for Government Procurement to support it in doing things we previously did.  The net effect of all of that is that we need to be watchful that we have sufficient procurement resources within our organisation to support our needs.  It may be useful for Mr. Swords to make one or two more remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437656400,"counter":1757,"content":"<p>Our organisation is becoming acutely aware of the demand on procurement and that there are more requirements for the way procurement is to be done.  As a result of that, our numbers are an issue.  As Mr. Woods said, we had lost 87 people in the HSE across moratoriums, excluding the people who were lost in the voluntary sector.  From speaking with Mr. Lynch and our colleagues in Ireland East, I know that numbers are very low.  We must resource this area correctly so that we can comply with all the requirements set out for us.  The more compliance we get and the more areas we go into with frameworks and contracts, the better compliance we will have with all the regulations, codes of ethics, and so on.  The tender process is key to that.  Within that, there are safeguards that give greater assurance of compliance with the regulations.  We have segregation of duties within the tender process.  We have declarations of interest, etc., which are a requirement within the tender process.  We have separation of the evaluation of the award criteria within that tender process.  That is brought together at the end and the announcement and award of contracts are done in a very compliant way and are audited on a regular basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Swords"},{"type":"speech","time":1437656400,"counter":1758,"content":"<p>In the report it was stated that 42 audits dealing with procurement were carried out and that deficiencies were identified.  This has all been kept within the HSE.  We have not been given any information as regards the deficiencies that were identified and the cost to the taxpayer where proper procedures were not followed or where there were deficiencies.  What action was taken where deficiencies were clearly identified?  We have no clarification of whether there were any breaches on that issue and whether action was taken in respect of the people employed.  We are talking about 42 different audits and there were deficiencies but we have no information on that.  As a health committee, we are entitled to information on what the deficiencies were and what action was taken to deal with them.<\/p> <p>  The second issue I want to raise is budgets within hospitals.  We have heard the complaint over a period of time about end of year, where units are afraid that if they do not use up their budget, it will be cut for the following year.  An example of that was presented to me in the last two months in the southern region regarding the rush to get orders in before the end of the year.  Has that practice changed?  If so, what is now the procedure if a hospital or a unit does not use up its full budget and is penalised the following year?  It may not have used up its full budget because it has become more efficient.<\/p> <p>  The third issue relates to pharmaceutical items.  I have become aware of instances where, for example, a medical unit has a budget for drugs and pharmaceuticals and rather than using this up internally, it gives a prescription.  The patient goes out and gets the item in a pharmacy and comes back into the unit for the treatment with that prescription.  Therefore, there is an additional cost to the HSE in the process.

The scale of the delegation illustrates the scale of the organisation and the budget.  As has been pointed out by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, the &euro;1.6 billion figure we are discussing is only part of the equation.  I had the opportunity a few days ago to meet with the whistleblower and I was impressed by the recollection and clarity he brought to the presentation of his story.  I hope he will be assisted in co-operating fully with the urgent investigation that is now going on.<\/p><p>This discussion arises from the \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme.  The matters aired in the broadcast were brought to the attention of the Minister, subsequently passed down the line and the appropriate investigations commenced.  Where financial matters are concerned, whether through VHI payments to a private hospital or tax funding to a HSE hospital, taxpayers are left at a loss.  Clearly, the financial ramifications of these matters are very serious and we all agree they must be fully investigated. <\/p><p> A question arises regarding the medical side of the equation.  One of the serious allegations passed from the Minister to the HSE was that, in the case of medical equipment which, in the normal course, should be sterilised or autoclaved, to use the technical term, a private clinic in Dublin regularly transferred this equipment, by arrangement with a member of staff of a public hospital, to the public hospital for sterilisation or autoclaving.  To the best of my knowledge, this occurred three, four or five years ago on an ongoing basis.  I am advised that the matter was investigated when it was brought to the attention of the authorities and the trade unions and hospital management were involved.  However, using the Irish solution to many Irish problems, the member of staff retired.  Was this matter investigated in the broadest sense as it clearly gives rise to a serious medical issue?  It also forms part of a picture of an unusual relationship between a supply company and at least one person in a hospital.  While the book was closed on the matter in some senses by the decision of the member of staff in question to retire, I wonder if the witnesses are aware of the case.  Did it set off some degree of alarm or an investigation into the supply chain?  As I indicated, this case occurred some years ago.  <\/p><p> The witnesses are also aware of the allegation that medical equipment was regularly and deliberately broken, with the result that it needed to be replaced.  It may be the case that this issue came to light last September and is now being investigated.  From a hospital management perspective, if a significant amount of medical equipment is breaking regularly in a specific medical unit or hospital, would this not cause someone to ask whether there is a problem?<\/p><p> I welcome the action taken as a result of the \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme and the correspondence of last September, although I am not sure how quickly action was taken.  Were there any other indications that unusual events were occurring and investigations were required?  I refer, in particular, to medical cases.  While financial cases also require attention, in the cases of medical issues, there all sorts of other ramifications.  Did the retirement of the staff member in the case to which I referred cause the book to be closed on the matter or were further investigations carried out? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#P00600","speaker":"1205","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437656400,"counter":1761,"content":"<p>I asked Mr. Woods whether he was confident that the investigation under way in the public hospital was independent.

Nevertheless, I do not for one moment doubt the veracity of the group's statement on the back of last week's television programme in which it states that there was no investigation under way in the group's private hospital with regard to the report made by the whistleblower to the Department in September 2014.  We were informed that this report relates to seven hospitals, whereas the witnesses identified the number involved as five.  I will accept the latter figure.  It beggars belief that the Garda has had this information since June 2014, 13 months ago.  The St. Vincent's Hospital Group has now contacted the Garda and Health Service Executive seeking information regarding the allegations.  We are told that the allegations are even more serious than those aired in the \"Prime Time\" programme last week and that there has been no contact with the Garda for 13 months.  It is also ten months since the matter was brought to the attention of the Minister.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Woods confirmed that the Minister for Health received correspondence from another Deputy in September 2014, which was copied to the Minister for Justice and Equality, in which he was made aware of the detail of the matters relating to five hospitals.  Did the HSE not consider it appropriate to alert the private hospital in the St. Vincent's Hospital Group to the irregularities that were taking place?  Did the Minister not believe he, his office or the Department should have communicated this information, irrespective of whether it related to a public or private hospital?  <\/p> <p>  I am not impressed that the Garda bureau of fraud investigation is carrying out an investigation into these matters if, 13 months later, at least one of the hospitals in question knows nothing about the matter.  The reason Mr. Woods has been able to confirm the role of Mullingar and St. Colmcille's hospitals is that the HSE took a proactive approach to the issue.  As his statement makes clear, the HSE met the Garda bureau of fraud investigation only a short time after the allegations were made, namely, in November 2014.  I presume, therefore, that it played a part in the initiation of the Garda investigation.  However, the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has known nothing about it since, and I wonder whether an investigation has been taking place at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#Q00600","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437656400,"counter":1766,"content":"<p>In response to Senator Burke's question about the 42 audit reports, we publish our audit reports six-monthly in arrears.

It can be an issue but it is not a major issue.  It does not happen all the time but we do sometimes face it.  When we need to take a national approach to driving value, our observation to a tenderer is that if it has a price that is lower in one hospital and we run a tender, it should bid that price and give it to us nationally, and then we have good value nationally.  If it comes around the back of the scrum after we have done a tender saying there was low price, we will not tolerate that.  We want national value up front.  Individual hospitals may experience loss - this came up in some of our dialogue with some larger voluntary hospitals - and we did undertake that, subject to review, we would balance our cost-cutting targets to reflect that.  If one hospital was truly suffering a loss this year, we would consider rebalancing slightly, and the adjustments would be very small to ensure that, while we are getting something that is for the common good of the whole system, nobody loses as a result of an independent or single competition.  We have the other experience of tenderers seeking to come back in having lost a contract and offering a lower price, and that is not something we tolerate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#R02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1437656400,"counter":1789,"content":"<p>If larger hospitals end up paying more than they originally paid because of a national contract, if the companies concerned could afford to do it for those hospitals at a price of X euro initially, why would it be increased to match?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015072300002#R02400","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437656400,"counter":1790,"content":"<p>Without going into individual tenders, it is not necessarily the case.
