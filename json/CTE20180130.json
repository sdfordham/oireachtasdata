I am accompanied by Mr. Martin Finucane, head of strategic energy policy at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Ms Laura Behan from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr. John Muldowney, responsible for climate change and bioenergy policy at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Mr. Frank Maughan, head of climate mitigation and awareness at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p> <p>  I have prepared a presentation, copies of which have been provided to members, and I propose to make a brief opening statement on the Paris Agreement, the EU and Ireland's emissions targets, Ireland's national mitigation plan, the national dialogue on climate action and community aspects of the renewable electricity support scheme, as requested.  <\/p> <p>  The Paris Agreement aims to hold the increase in global average temperature from pre-industrial levels to well below 2&deg; Celsius and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 &deg; Celsius.  Country pledges made by the 195 parties for 2050 exceed the warming limit of the Paris Agreement, pointing to the need for enhanced global commitment.  On behalf of its member states, the EU has committed under the Paris Agreement to a reduction of at least 40% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, to be achieved by a reduction of 43% in the emission trading scheme, ETS, sector, and a reduction of 30% in the non-ETS sector.<\/p> <p>  It is in the non-ETS sector that each member state of the EU has legally binding targets.  It should be noted that Ireland's non-ETS sector is large relative to the EU as a whole, and that within Ireland's non-ETS sector, agriculture accounts for 46% of emissions, compared with 18% for the EU 28.  <\/p> <p>  The latest Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, projections indicate that Ireland's emissions are to be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020, against a 20% reduction target.  There are a number of reasons for this, including our limited post-crash public investment capacity.  For 2030, Ireland will have a 30% emissions reduction target in the non-ETS sector.  This represents a significant challenge.  To begin addressing this challenge, the Government published its first statutory national mitigation plan last July.  It represents an initial step to set us on a pathway to achieve the level of decarbonisation required.  The plan contains 61 measures that are in place and 17 that are under consideration, as well as 106 actions.  The Government recognises that this first plan does not provide a complete roadmap to decarbonising by 2050, but begins the process of development of medium to long-term mitigation choices for the next and future decades.<\/p><p>This will be an ongoing process and will include the preparation of the ten-year national development plan and successive national mitigation plans at least every five years, as provided for in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  Decarbonisation will involve fundamental societal transformation, as well as ongoing engagement with society through the national dialogue on climate action.  The central objective of the dialogue is to create awareness, engagement and the motivation to act across society.<\/p><p> The green schools national climate change action and awareness programme is already under way and an advisory group has been established by the Minister to input into the organisation of regional and local events that will be piloted in the first half of this year.  This recognition of the centrality of communities to changing our societies is fully recognised in the design of new policy measures such as the renewable electricity support scheme.  Community participation and community ownership are at its core, and the recent consultation set out a number of policy options to support community involvement.<\/p><p> I look forward to engaging with members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517331600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>We now move on to our second witness, Professor John FitzGerald, chairman of the Climate Change Advisory Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#D00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517331600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have this opportunity to talk to the committee.  I will not go through the comments in my written statement concerning the urgency of taking action, but we are heading in the wrong direction on climate change.  While taking action can be expensive, there can be co-benefits in respect of health and the environment.  The job of the council I chair is to advise on how we can decarbonise Irish society at least cost.  There have been wins in respect of renewable electricity whereby the cost of electricity for consumers until 2012 was lower because of the deployment of renewable electricity.  Win-wins are available.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the urgent need to take action, I was asked to say something about the emissions targets.  We will miss our target for 2020 by a significant amount.  We will miss the 2030 and 2050 targets because we are heading rapidly in the wrong direction.  Without major new policy initiatives, and based on business as usual and policy as usual, we are heading in the wrong direction.  The nature of the initiatives will require broad support in the Oireachtas if they are to happen.  It is not just Government that decides; it is the Oireachtas that decides.  That is why I particularly welcome this opportunity to give the committee our advice.<\/p> <p>  Looking to the future, we need to consider a range of different scenarios because we are uncertain what will happen.  The forecasts are based on work I did in 2013 and 2014 on growth over the next decade.  In the work I did in 2013 and 2014, we may have been too pessimistic about the economy, and the problems may be greater than we think they are, so we need, and the Department needs, to go back and look at the scenarios.  The cost of technologies has fallen more rapidly than expected, so that is an area in respect of which we need to map out a route to the future which will be internally consistent.  If we electrify transport but do not deal with the problem of electricity itself, we could lock matters into a bad place.<\/p> <p>  The council is strongly of the view that we need to reflect the damage emitting carbon does to climate and the world in the price of carbon.  We need first of all a carbon tax, and there are three reasons for this.  It discourages us from burning fossil fuels and encourages us to switch to alternatives such as renewable electricity.  It also results in revenue for the Government, which can be used to cut taxes elsewhere and can be used in investment in climate change.  The ESRI published between 1991 and 2014, when I retired, on average one and a half reports a year on why carbon taxes are the right solution.  There is nothing new to be said on this issue.  One of the key reasons is that Ireland could be better off with a carbon tax because it may reduce the need for taxes elsewhere, so there is a benefit.  The third, and probably most important, reason is that business in Ireland and worldwide knows it will make money out of investing in technologies that will be clean if the price of carbon is high.  This is what is driving the research in electric cars worldwide: the prospect that carbon will be expensive.  This is why we need to reflect the damage done to climate in the price of carbon.<\/p> <p>  One area we are concerned about is the EU emissions trading scheme.  In our first statement, in June 2016, we recommended the Government support the French initiative to put in a carbon price floor, which would have guaranteed a rising and substantial price of carbon and electricity.  It would have sent the right signal and obviated the need for subsidies for renewable power because the price would have made it profitable to invest in renewables.  This is a much better solution.  One thing we need to explore is whether Ireland, along with a range of other countries, should introduce a carbon price floor even if the EU does not do so.  The Dutch Government in its most recent programme for Government proposes to do so.  These are areas in respect of which we must deal not just with the non-ETS sector, but with the ETS sector as well, electricity in particular.<\/p> <p>  The council has strongly recommended we stop subsidising peat-fired power generation.  The subsidy is &euro;100 million a year to keep a few hundred jobs in place.  One could produce real, sustainable jobs which are not damaging society by spending just one year's subsidy.  It is right that people who lose out from our tackling climate change should be compensated, and we need to do so.  The money is there.  To spend &euro;100 million a year on subsidising the emission of 2.75 million tonnes of carbon dioxide does not seem wise or sensible.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  Finally, we need to define what neutrality is in agriculture.  We need to take the win-wins.  Agriculture will have to change significantly, particularly in the context of land use.  Changes to land use could make a big difference, taking carbon out of the atmosphere rather than pumping it into it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1517331600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I call the president of the IFA, Mr. Joe Healy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#D00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517331600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting the IFA to address the committee.  The agrifood sector is Ireland's largest indigenous productive sector, exporting food, drink and forest products worth over &euro;13.5 billion in 2017 and providing employment to more than 300,000 people directly and indirectly.  It has been a key driver in Ireland's economic recovery and is the backbone of economic activity across the rural economy.<\/p> <p>  Regarding climate, there are a number of facts that are often unheard in the climate and climate response debate.  Since the established base year of 1990, agriculture's greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by 3.5%, while Ireland's national emissions have increased by 10.4%, driven mainly by the transport sector, where emissions have increased by 139%.  Emissions from energy industries have increased by 10%.  European and international leaders speak with one voice about agriculture's climate response.  Agriculture's role must be considered in the context of the additional demands on food, fuel and energy production in addition to environmental enhancement.  That said, Ireland has a responsibility to act, and within this context agriculture has an important role to play, while respecting the need to safeguard food production.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is taking a leading position by targeting European funding through the Common Agricultural Policy to areas that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the sector.  Almost 90% of the measures in Ireland's rural development programme involve climate-reducing elements.  These measures include the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which promotes the retention of soil carbon stocks through the encouragement of climate-friendly agricultural practices such as minimum tillage, green-cover establishment and low-emission manure spreading techniques.  GLAS is oversubscribed, with a high level of farmer interest in participating.  I strongly encourage the Government to reopen the scheme and allow maximum participation.  Other programmes include the beef data and genomics programme and the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, better known as TAMS, which assist farmers to reduce emissions and increase productive efficiency.<\/p> <p>  Emissions intensity as a proportion of output is the most appropriate climate measure of agriculture, particularly if we accept the position of the EU heads of Government and the international Paris Agreement of December 2015.<\/p><p>Research completed by the European Commission's science and knowledge service, the Joint Research Centre, demonstrates that Ireland has an emission-efficient model of food production.  Ireland's dairy farmers have the lowest carbon footprint in the EU for milk production and our beef farmers are in the top five.  This is not surprising given our natural grass-based model of food production and our temperate climate, with 90% of our agricultural lands being carbon sequestering grasslands.  These facts around Irish farmers' emission-efficient model of food production are welcomed but they still provide no room for complacency.<\/p><p> Ireland is the only country in the world that monitors, measures and manages carbon from farm to fork.  For example, 90% of beef exports are now in an audit and carbon foot printing programme and 100% of milk production is entering into a carbon auditing cycle.  In addition, over 137,000 carbon assessments have been completed on farms to date as part of Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green sustainability programme.  In the IFA, we are leading a voluntary initiative called Smart Farming with the Environmental Protection Agency.  This aims to address the dual challenges of improving farm incomes while reducing environmental impact.  In 2017, the average cost savings identified by participating farmers was &euro;8,700, with average emissions reductions of 10%.<\/p><p> Under the renewable energy directive, Ireland has a mandatory target to produce at least 16% of all energy consumed by 2020 from renewable sources.  This is to be met by 40% from renewable electricity, 12% from renewable heat and 10% from the renewable transport sector.  Agencies such as the Institute of International and European Affairs estimate that Ireland is likely to be hit with a bill of &euro;610 million by 2020 for breaching the targets.  The IFA believes this money should instead be diverted into a climate activation programme, focused on policy measures including the re-opening of the green low carbon agri-environment scheme; the announcement of a farm-based and community electricity tariff for renewable projects; the scaling up of on-farm emission reduction programmes; and the development of a national network of producer organisations to support the mobilisation of the private forestry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517331600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to appear before it.  I recall being here or hereabouts almost 30 years ago, in 1990, for the first national climate change strategy, which is still the best.  Like all the others, it has failed miserably to deliver.<\/p> <p>  The first point to make is that Ireland is already encountering climate change.  Everywhere in the country today is 0.5&deg; Celsius warmer than it was 30 years ago.  We are on target for the kinds of changes in climate that the rest of the world is experiencing and will continue to experience.  We know from our modelling work that over the next 20 years or so we will warm by a further 0.5&deg; and perhaps even by as much as 1&deg; over the next 30 years.  That will not be crucial for Ireland.  It will extend our growing season and cause complications for our biodiversity but the real climate change impacts in Ireland will come from rainfall changes and increased winter rainfall in the west of Ireland in particular.  There will be decreased summer rainfall in the east, where our people are located and public water supply will become a growing concern.<\/p> <p>  One of the consequences of change of this nature is that the extremes will change much more quickly and radically than the mean.  It is part of the consequence when we examine the distribution of climate variables.  In many respects we have seen in Ireland over the past few years some of those extremes beginning to manifest themselves.  We cannot label individual extremes confidently yet to climate change but, increasingly, the science is enabling us to assess the contribution made by anthropogenic climate change to them.  We know from work done in Maynooth that the winter of 2013 to 2014 was the stormiest winter both in Ireland and the UK for at least the past 143 years.  That is an extreme event.  We know the winter of 2015 to 2016 was the wettest winter on record over large parts or even much of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We saw extremes more recently in Donegal in August, where it had approximately half the amount of rain that Dublin had in the entire winter of December, January and February in six hours.  More recently, we saw floods in Mountmellick and members are aware of the more recent floods in Galway.  All of those are extreme events.  The once in a century event is, to some extent, a concept that has really passed its sell-by date.<\/p> <p>  The Paris obligations have been mentioned and the key phrase as far as I am concerned is that countries must act with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, with developed countries taking the lead.  The responsibility for doing most comes to those countries that are better off than other countries and which have historically contributed most to the problem.  We know the pathway means the world will have to decarbonise by 50% within the next 20 years, which is quite a tall order.  It means there is no time and space for promises or what we might do; there must be urgency in doing what we can now.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of studies indicating where we should be going.  The Stockholm climate equity calculator demonstrates that in the middle of the 2020s we will have crossed the line of equity and be in debt to the developing world with our large amounts of carbon emissions.  We are therefore part of the problem rather than the solution.  There is a certain revisionism going on with respect to the 2020 obligations, which were accepted by all parties.  Members can see in the documentation the extent to which they were endorsed by all parties at the time they were made.  Ireland, as we now know, is a laggard, as the Taoiseach said last month.  It is the worst performing country in Europe when it comes to climate performance.  The national policy position is over and above the climate change Act.  In Ireland and without any pressure, we have already endorsed where we should be going.  There should be an aggregate reduction of at least 80% compared with 1990 levels across the three key sectors.<\/p> <p>  We must change the culture of negotiation away from the pattern of returning from Brussels and getting a pat on the back for having got every concession and flexibility possible.  We see this very clearly in some of the examples I have given.  The 2030 example is best of all, as I have listed a variety of ways in which the Commission's proposals were watered down not solely by Ireland, but by countries, in some cases with Ireland supporting them.  It is important we tackle that problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John Sweeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1517331600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>If the witness feels he cannot mention everything, I will give everybody ample opportunity to come in again.

Stop Climate Chaos has a set of policy recommendations submitted to the Department during the public consultation on the national mitigation plan and the Citizens' Assembly.  We believe, if implemented, these will go a significant way to getting Ireland on track to meeting its own climate action targets, as well as its increasing EU and global climate action mitigation.  Today, we will focus our contribution on governance and the crucial role this committee can play in the establishment of an effective policy and accountability cycle for climate action in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Weather events across the globe and at home in recent years have seen an increased awareness within Ireland of the reality of climate change and the need for action.  We are starting to witness the more visible impacts but in other parts of the world, already increasingly frequent and intense weather events are devastating lives and livelihoods in the poorest countries that have contributed least to the problem and have the fewest resources to cope.<\/p><p>In east Africa today, more than 20 million people are continuing to struggle with persistent drought, and that is with today's level of warming.<\/p><p> Ireland has a proud, long-standing track record for its overseas aid programme.  This is a critical contributor to our global reputation.  However, it is significantly undermined by our continued poor performance on climate action.<\/p><p> It is important also to recognise that climate change poses more than environmental risks but systemic risks in the context of the failure to curb it in time to deliver on the Paris Agreement.  Beyond direct impacts in Ireland, we must be cognisant of spill-over effects of impacts elsewhere in the world, and on European countries, in regard to trade and infrastructure, transport, security and finance, as highlighted by the European Environmental Agency.  The risks posed by climate change to the financial system are twofold; the economic and financial implications of the direct physical impacts of climate change, such as the clean-up costs of more frequent and intense disasters, and the risks of failing to curb emissions in a timely manner leading to the prospect of a late, abrupt transition with significant systemic, financial, economic, social and political impacts.  That is not some kind of case analysis; these are risks highlighted by an advisory committee to the European Systemic Risk Board, and it has been highlighted publically and repeatedly by the Governor of the Bank of England, Dr. Mark Carney.<\/p><p> The Paris Agreement adopted in 2015 was a major milestone.  However, we must be clear that it is not a solution but a call to action.  In Paris in 2015, all states recognised the need to increase their action prior to 2020.  Furthermore, at its centre, the Paris Agreement contains a ratchet mechanism under which states must submit and report on their ever-increasing emission reductions commitments and actions, beginning in 2020.  This is not an externally imposed agenda.  The Paris Agreement ratchet mechanism is a recognition at the highest levels of Government, based on the Government-endorsed science, of the fact that there is only one feasible direction of travel, and we must speed up significantly and consistently in our collective interests.  Ireland&rsquo;s support for the weakest or least stringent provisions in EU legislation serves not only to hinder Irish action but EU action as a whole, undermining the progress of all 28 member states to the key goals of the Paris Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Cliona Sharkey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517331600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Just to let Ms. Sharkey know, she is over two and a half minutes now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#F00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517331600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I have just one more sentence.

It will not deliver the changes we need.<\/p> <p>  One piece of analysis that has not been mentioned, as recently reported in the press, is that a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform memorandum from last September has been released under freedom of information.  It states:  \"It would appear that almost no progress has been made on an appraisal-based, prioritised and integrated view of how to meet 2020 and 2030 climate targets\".  That is a statement made after the mitigation plan was adopted by Government.  The advisory council said there is an urgent requirement for new policies, measures and action beyond what is committed to in the national mitigation plan.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, said that we need a transformation of our energy, agriculture and transport systems if we are to deliver on our targets.  The official view of our mitigation plan, therefore, is that not enough action is being taken.<\/p> <p>  We take heart from what the Taoiseach said in the European Parliament some weeks ago, that is, that he was not proud of Ireland's record and that we are a laggard.  If that admission is the first step towards action, as is so often the case in these kinds of recovery programmes, we welcome it.<\/p> <p>  We want to outline today what we believe should happen next and we have broken that down into two sections in the presentation: what needs to happen every year and what needs to happen this year in particular.  Every year, we need a policy cycle of both planning and accountability that is transparent and effective.  The Climate Change Act 2015 establishes an annual policy cycle but there are too many loopholes in the way it is rolled out.  We believe this committee has a central role in ensuring parliamentary oversight and accountability.  For example, it is good to see representatives from the Climate Change Advisory Council here today and an independent climate scientist.  We believe representatives from the EPA should be here.  Representatives from the three organisations should come before the committee every January to lay out the state of the climate, so to speak, following which the committee can invite the Ministers who deliver their transition statements to come before it to allow members cross-examine them as necessary on their performance.  Representatives from the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, are here but where are the representatives from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport?  The Minister, Deputy Ross, has said hardly anything on transport since his elevation to that Ministry.  I believe it is the committee's role, in the absence of anyone else, to be like the Committee of Public Accounts for carbon emissions and to bring before it representatives from all the Departments which have a responsibility to act.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what should happen this year in particular, I will mention two things.  This committee should immediately recommend to the Minister that he formally begins a process to revise the national mitigation plan.  He has called it a living document and it is time now to put that into practice.<\/p> <p>  The Oireachtas must treat the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on climate change as seriously as it took its recommendations on the eighth amendment.  Given the workload of the committee, we believe it is worth considering whether a new all-party committee with broader representation should be tasked, as happened previously, to come back to the Oireachtas with a consideration of those 18 recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly by the summer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1517331600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I must stop Mr. Coghlan but if he or any witness wants to come in at any time, I ask the witness to indicate and I will call him or her.

I will start with the Department.  Regarding its comprehensive presentation, the committee would be interested to hear about major initiatives the Department is considering.  For example, the retrofitting of public buildings would not only reduce our emissions but would be a major initiative to lead the way in that regard.  What are the Department's plans regarding targets, dates and actions on reducing emissions?  Also, are there are plans for increased multi-annual budgets to help households in terms of retrofitting?  Last week, the committee heard that if one wants to have a complete retrofit of one's household, it would cost up to &euro;40,000.  Is the Department considering measures that would encourage households in terms of such retrofitting?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Professor FitzGerald.  I do not disagree about having to increase our carbon tax but if we move away from dirty energy, we need to encourage people to use alternative clean energy and I am not sure we are there yet.  Professor FitzGerald might expand on that and how we need to proceed in that area.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Joe Healy of the IFA.  Can he explain why the green, low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, payments are so popular with the farming community?  He said it is over-subscribed.  He might expand on that issue.  I ask the witnesses to bank those questions.  I will call Deputy Stanley and then Deputy Dooley, who indicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#F00500","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1517331600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  It is good to have a broad range of organisations represented, many of whose members we have met in the past.  As for the Department, it is clear that not alone is there slippage but we are not even keeping apace.  If it were not for the crash of the economy between 2008 and 2013 and 2014, we would be galloping further ahead in terms of missing our targets.  Do the witnesses believe now that the issue of binding sectoral targets should be inserted in legislation?  Some of us sought that when the climate action legislation was before the D&aacute;il and in the forerunner of this committee of which I was a member.  While some areas have made a good deal of progress, others have not.  I refer to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in particular.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Professor John FitzGerald's contribution.  His comment that not alone have we missed the 2020 target but that he projects we will overshoot the 2030 and 2050 targets was interesting.  I recall discussing in this very room the fact that we will hit carbon cliffs, although I did not believe in 2013 that it would come as quickly as it has come.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the economics of converting to biomass as we hear different views to the effect that it is not possible to do it on a large scale.  Obviously, we do not want land that is being used for producing food to produce biomass crops.  A balance must be achieved in that regard.  My party, Sinn F&eacute;in, has produced a paper on biogas, a copy of which I am happy to give the representatives of the groups.  We would welcome their views on that.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Joe Healy from the IFA for his presentation, which I read with great interest.  In his statement he said farmers are reducing emissions but the Climate Change Advisory Council referred to increases in respect of agriculture.  Mr. Healy might address that and deal with the biomass question in terms of land use.<\/p> <p>  Also, regarding sugar beet, Mr. Healy will be aware that a meeting was held the other night in Bunclody on restarting the sugar beet industry.  Some experts reckon that has a role to play both in biodiversity and as a carbon sink because as Mr. Healy and I know, beet is a covering crop; in other words, it covers the ground with green leaves for about four or five months of the year.<\/p><p>What are the views of the witnesses on restarting it to address our greenhouse gas emissions and to reduce our huge dependency on beef and dairy?<\/p><p> As for the Stop Climate Chaos presentation, it was mentioned that we have the third highest level per person in the European Union.  This is alarming.<\/p><p> What is the single most important thing we can do with regard to electric vehicles?  We have fewer than 2,000 electric vehicles according to figures I was given recently.  There is uncertainty at present with regard to the charging system and its infrastructure because of the decision of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, that it should not stay with the ESB.  What should happen here?  What should we do to change this quickly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#F00600","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517331600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I will not go back over what has been said.  The witnesses have all made very important presentations.  It is clear from everybody around the table that there is a crisis in terms of our lack of ability as an Oireachtas and a Government to address this issue.  Things are getting worse and worse.  It is very clear when we look at the graph provided by the Department, which sets out how Ireland compares within the EU, just how far we are behind everybody else.  My first question to the Department is does it think this issue has reached a crisis point?  Does the Department identify and does the Minister indicate that this is a crisis that needs to be addressed?  All that flows from this can be helpful.<\/p> <p>  It is always good to get a perspective of where we are at, where we are not at, how we are doing and how we are not doing and it is very clear it is not working.  What we then need is concrete advice and things we can do.  Professor FitzGerald spoke about a carbon tax.  This is obviously an item we must look at.  The carbon price floor has been examined.  This is an action item we can look at.  We can stop the subsidy to peat fire stations.  These are three concrete things we have to take on board but there must be more.  Mention was made of transport and heat.  We need to get direction from the witnesses, as experts, as to what will have a meaningful impact on our emissions and what we can do.  There are things we cannot do.  There is an issue with agriculture, no doubt about it, but if we were to halve the national herd overnight we would have a crisis in terms of being able to feed people, so this is not an option.  There are other measures that can be supported and I thank Mr. Healy for outlining them.<\/p> <p>  With regard to electric vehicles, people in my constituency tell me they bought into the idea of climate change and got an electric vehicle but while there are three charging points in Ennis none of them are working, and this goes on for weeks.  I think I am answering my previous question for Mr. Carroll because if it was a crisis for the Department, these issues would be to the fore and action would be taken.  We showed as a country and a Legislature the capacity to deal with a financial crisis.  We took really tough decisions that impacted massively on the lifestyle and lives of people.  Some people suffered electorally for that but it really was the right thing to do regardless of the political consequences that some suffered.  We are heading in the same direction.  There is a crisis of equal proportion but nobody is addressing it because it is not real and substantial in terms of the impact on a daily basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#G00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1517331600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank our contributors for the useful and informative submissions they have made.

Will he elaborate on what suggestions he has, what changes he is speaking about and what changes he would recommend?  With regard to peat power generation and stopping the subsidy, our difficulty in Tipperary and the midlands is that communities have been built around it and there are jobs at stake.  It would be important that somebody would identify what are the alternatives for usage of our bogland.  People will accept change if there is an alternative that creates employment.  This is the difficulty.  One cannot just stop without doing some research and development work on alternatives.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Healy recommends reopening the GLAS programme.

I will begin with the issue of sectoral targets, and then call on my colleague, Mr. Finucane, to deal with energy efficiency.  I will start by addressing the 2020 targets.  When setting targets for climate mitigation, it is very important that any target signed up to is technically achievable, considerations of cost efficiency have been factored in and there is fairness in how the burden is shared among all countries.  We are one of three countries that had the highest mitigation target for 2020 in the EU set-up, which was a 20% reduction.  It is true that at best, we will have a 4% to 6% reduction against that 20% reduction target.  There are some reasons for this.  Some of it is due to our limited post-crash public investment capacity.  Emissions growth has been coupled with economic growth from 2015, so our emissions have worsened.  There are certain structural constraints in terms of a very large agricultural sector, with 46% of our non-emissions trading system, ETS, emissions coming from agriculture.  This compares with 18% in the EU 28, and there is limited mitigation potential.<\/p> <p>  In terms of transport, the bulk of our emissions come from private car journeys and freight and we have a dispersed settlement pattern.  In terms of 2030, it has been suggested that Ireland sought every concession and every flexibility.  In fact, when the Commission published its effort-sharing regulation proposal, Ireland largely supported the proposal as published.  That is factual.  In terms of how we now address the 2030 target of a 30% reduction and the best way to deal with it, we will have to consider further policies, actions and measures.  It will involve Exchequer investment, private sector investment, regulation, tax measures, information provision and changes in the behaviour of individuals.  Many of these have been mentioned already.  Deputy Dooley asked whether the Department and the Minister recognise the scale of the problem and the answer is \"yes\".  The answer to whether we recognise the urgency of action is also \"yes\".<\/p> <p>  A comment was made on a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform memorandum from September, which highlighted the inadequacy of the appraisal system.  That agreed with the diagnosis made in July in the national mitigation plan that the appraisal system was not fit for purpose.<\/p><p>There is an action in the national mitigation plan, which is to be completed in 2018, to address that and that work is under way.  The September memorandum referred to, therefore, is simply confirming something that is explicitly recognised in the national mitigation plan, with an action to address it in 2018, and that will be done.<\/p><p> The last comment was about the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, seeing the need for further actions.  Further action is absolutely needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517331600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Did Mr. Finucane want to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#H00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517331600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Yes, just to address some of the questions on the energy perspective.  The Chairman asked about energy efficiency.  The Department operates its energy efficiency schemes through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  Currently, on average, 20,000 to 25,000 houses per annum are grant aided to increase energy efficiency.  During the period 2009 to 2017, 210,000 homes received energy efficiency grants.  The challenge we have in the future is that many of those homes have been retrofitted with certain measures, but we need to retrofit at a much deeper level which will require additional funding.  The Department, and the Minister, have made significant cases to the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the upcoming capital plan, and we expect to see significant funding made available in this area in the future.<\/p> <p>  We might also point out that regarding this year's budget, the overall capital budget for the SEAI was increased by approximately 50%, from about &euro;100 million capital to &euro;150 million capital, the significant portion of that being grant aids, not just for energy efficiency on homes but also in respect of commercial activity as well.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked specifically about public buildings.  The SEAI works very closely with the public sector and with the Office of Public Works, OPW, in terms of both retrofitting the existing building stock across the public sector and also working with the OPW to ensure that the new fleet coming in, either built by the OPW or hired by the OPW for use by the public sector, meet significantly higher standards from an energy perspective than they would have previously.  There is a good deal of action going on in respect of those two areas.<\/p> <p>  Several comments were made regarding subsidies for peat.  There are three peat stations in Ireland, one of which no longer receives a subsidy from the public service obligation, PSO.  The two remaining peat stations that do receive a subsidy are due to come out of support from the public service obligation in 2019.  Therefore, they will not be receiving support for burning peat beyond that period.  The likelihood is that they will increase.  Currently, increasing amounts of biomass are being burned in one of the plants and the likelihood is that from a strategic perspective that will increase and probably extend to the other two, but that is a commercial issue for the companies themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Finucane"},{"type":"speech","time":1517331600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I might call Professor John FitzGerald at this point as a number of questions were asked.

The Chairman asked about alternative clean energy.  One option is that we electrify heating but we do not know whether that is the right answer until we know about electricity, and that is one of the areas we need to explore.  Also, we are failing in our renewable heating obligation, more in rural areas than urban areas, and biomass may be an option, but as I indicated, much depends on the relative prices.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanley asked about converting to biomass.  I agree with him.  On a large scale that does not makes sense.  However, in rural areas, a wood chip burner rather than oil may well make sense.  There are different ways of using biomass but I disagree with the Department on converting the peat stations to burning biomass.  Even if they burn 30% biomass, they will still be emitting more carbon dioxide per unit of electricity than anything else in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I did a study on large-scale biomass with ESB International, Teagasc and another company 20 years ago.  In terms of the issue of biomass, it did not look as if burning it on a large scale made sense.  It is in the smaller scale usage.  It comes back to the point raised by Deputy Lowry about land use change, and here things fit together.  Farmers were making very little out of beef, and they are still making very little out of beef.  However, the study showed that if farmers switched from beef production, particularly on drumlin soils, to growing pollarded willow or whatever as biomass, less methane would be emitted from the cattle, the farmers would potentially make more money out of the biomass if there was a market, and the timber would suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  It would be a potential win-win.  There are possibilities here in terms of changing land use where agriculture can take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.<\/p> <p>  Another policy which is very bad in a different context is draining the swamp.  Draining the swamp is also very bad in terms of peatlands because peatlands absorb carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  They suck it out and make the climate better.  In terms of providing incentives to make better use of lands, I do not have the answers.  Land use change can make a big difference.<\/p> <p>  In terms of electric vehicles and transport, investing in public transport makes huge sense, in particular combined with the national planning framework.  We need to live much more densely.  A study done by the University of Limerick showed that people living in Limerick emitted much less carbon dioxide per head than people in surrounding villages because the people from the surrounding villages were commuting into Limerick.  We need to reduce commuting, which will be a win-win for everybody.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman and another member raised the issue of heating and supporting vulnerable households in that she talked about the cost of retrofit.  The State cannot subsidise that.  It should be profitable for people to retrofit their homes.  There is the problem of the divorce index.  Myself and my wife decided that we had to make changes.  She wanted to go ahead immediately and we did.  She won.  We had to re-plumb the entire house to put in a really efficient boiler and at the same time we insulated the house.  It was chaos.  We did not divorce, but it is about the behavioural problems of households.  Our heating bills are 70% of what they were previously so it made eminent economic sense but with households, we are dealing with much more complex issues.  There are rural households where the people are elderly, poor and using solid fuels.  It would make sense for the State to go in but if someone knocks on the door of a house up a valley in Kerry and says, \"We are here to turn your house upside down and make you comfortable\", will that work?  In the area of households, we need, first, to target the very vulnerable households if we are going to spend State money and then, second, work out how to do that.  It is not just about price or subsidies.  It is how we get people to change who are scared and will be disrupted.  It is a more complex issue.  It is not just about price.  There are other issues.<\/p> <p>  Regarding peat, Deputy Lowry said that jobs are at stake but it would have been better if the &euro;100 million being spent this year had been spent on creating a lot of jobs.  We need to make a change in that regard and, as I said, I do not believe biomass is part of the solution.  I have not answered all the questions but I have tried to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1517331600,"counter":34,"content":"<p>There were questions asked of Mr. Joe Healy from the Irish Farmers Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#H00600","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517331600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>There were a few questions asked.  I will answer the one on the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and Tom Short and Thomas Ryan might take the ones on emissions and the beet aspect.<\/p> <p>  I will deal with the two questions on the GLAS payments.  A value for money review was done on the reason the scheme is so popular.  It is oversubscribed.  Many more farmers have come into the scheme.  On the previous occasion, as soon as it was opened it was again oversubscribed.  There are two issues in this regard.  It is a rural development scheme.  There is money out of it for farmers to do the right thing, and it covers their costs.<\/p> <p>  Regarding carbon sequestration, over the five years of GLAS the target will be 90,000 ha of crop cover delivering 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide savings per year.<\/p><p>Minimum tillage is being used across 30,000 ha with the potential to sequester 10,000 tonnes of carbon per year, and 1.4 million m of new hedgerows has the potential to sequester 5,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.<\/p><p> To respond to Deputy Lowry's point on value, first, it helps to maintain that money in rural areas.  It is a long way short of the rural environment protection, REP, scheme what was in place in terms of the money accruing from it, but it helps to maintain rural areas.  It is probably difficult enough to quantify the value in it but it helps to maintain schools and businesses.  Agriculture has a turnover of &euro;26 billion per year but &euro;24 billion of that is retained within the economy and three quarters of all inputs into agriculture are sourced locally.  That highlights the importance of agriculture in rural areas to keep businesses and rural areas alive.  We can talk about willow and there is a place for it but we must remember that willow will not keep schools open in rural areas.  A willow branch will not play full back on the Ballyragget hurling team.  It will not keep teams alive.  There is a follow-on.<\/p><p> With the work farmers do through GLAS there is such a huge knock-on effect that is very often missed in terms of tourism in the most vulnerable rural areas.  The committee members did not need me to come into this room this evening to tell them that either.  That is the value to it.  When we talk about production, and I mentioned it in my presentation, what frustrates farmers is the fact that we are four times more efficient from a carbon point of view at beef production than the likes of Brazil.  In Brazil 80 kg of CO2 is produced to produce a kilo of beef.  Across Europe the average is 19 kg, yet the Commissioner for Trade, Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m, as recently as today said she is very anxious to do a trade deal with Brazil that will allow Brazil access to export a lot more beef into Europe.  On the one hand we have politicians in Europe telling us to do what we should do to improve the environment, which we want to do, yet they are willing to do a trade deal with countries  that are not nearly as efficient as us.  Projections indicate that the world population will grow by 2 billion to 9 billion over the next 25 years.  All those people will have to be fed.  If the food is not produced in Ireland or Europe, it will be produced in countries that are not nearly as carbon efficient as we are.  We are the most carbon efficient producers of dairy product in Europe and we are in the top five most carbon efficient producers of beef in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517331600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Stanley, the figures quoted in the presentation were published by the EPA in December 2017 based on greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 up to 2016.  The discussion on the amount - how much - clouds the real need for action in terms of how to.  The data are the data and the figures are the figures.  The president referred in his presentation to the need for the reopening of GLAS.  Farmers are actors in the rural community.<\/p> <p>  There is a need for farm-scale, community and rooftop renewables, be they solar, micro or wind.  The energy White Paper published in 2015 by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment speaks to an energy citizen, but to be honest, as rural communities we have yet to see the policy measures put in place to empower rural communities to take on renewable energy production in a sustainable way to ensure we do not have a similar bad experience as happened in 2008 where the policy support measures were not in place.  There is a need for a tariff premium outside of the auction system proposed by the Department for farm-scale, community projects and for roof-mounted renewable projects such as solar.  In addition, there is a need to scale up programmes such as the carbon navigator and smart farming which are addressing the challenge.  They are speaking to the dual challenges of improving farm incomes while enhancing the environment.<\/p> <p>  Reference was also made to biomass.  I hope we are about to have a second start at a biomass programme.  The lack of development of a supply chain and of supply centres meant that we had a false start a number of years ago.

There is a great deal of emphasis on efficiency in agriculture, and while I welcome that and think it is a very important thing to progress, the atmosphere does not recognise efficiency in any way.  What matters is the absolute emissions.  Yes, we can tinker around with 50,000 tonnes a year here and there, but agricultural emissions are 19 million tonnes per year, so something more radical is required than some of the schemes we have been hearing about.  It is the disruption of the existing agricultural model that is required ultimately.  That is where I think we have to face facts here.  We are not going to solve this problem by tinkering with it.  We have 1 million extra cattle on the land in the past three years.  That is 1 million extra mouths to feed.  No wonder we have a fodder crisis.<\/p> <p>  To go back to Deputy Dooley's comments, no one is talking about culling the herd by half.  We are talking about a sustainable agricultural system where emissions are brought down.  At the moment, Teagasc is estimating that agricultural emissions will rise to at least 2025 and beyond.  That will put the burden on the taxpayer.  That will put the burden not just on the rural community but on the general taxpayer.  We should not mix up the agricultural community with the whole community because the Citizens' Assembly was representative of the whole community and its outcome was 89% in favour of there being a tax on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.  There is no way that we should allow a sector to have a free pass.  We should reward those farmers who take the initiative and try to prepare themselves for the future in terms of land use change.

It was fascinating to listen to the discussions over four days.  When citizens were given time, space and information and had experts only speaking to them, rather than organisations such as Friends of the Earth or the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, they produced a highly progressive and radical set of recommendations across all sectors that challenge all of us.  The first step we should take is give these recommendations due consideration.  The recommendations have been published and the report of the Citizens' Assembly will be formally presented to the Oireachtas shortly.  Members will then have to decide how to respond to the report.  There is plenty to work with in it and it will offer a good departure point for a revision of the national mitigation plan.<\/p><p> To address some of the issues raised, the IFA has stolen most of my lines on community energy and solar.  Friends of the Earth and the IFA are very much at one that while the Government's proposal on an official renewable electricity scheme is relatively good in terms of providing some supports for community ownership and community led developments and placing an obligation on developers to share equity in developer led projects, it is bad on solar power.  The reason this is important is that solar is the area in which many people could become involved.  This could become a societal project rather than one involving only highly organised commercial or community organisations.  For example, I would like every green school to become a solar school.  Currently, they cannot sell electricity back to the grid.  This is not just about the megawatts involved, which would be limited in number, but hearts and minds and a sense of ownership of this project.  Although the official renewable energy scheme, RES, did not feature solar power at micro or rooftop level, officials and the Minister have since stated they are committed to introducing a scheme for rooftop solar at the same pace as they introduced the official larger scheme for renewable electricity.  I hope this scheme will be delivered this year in order that we can all begin to take part in it.<\/p><p> On the issue of transport, electric vehicles and recharging infrastructure are important.  The market is moving at a faster pace than politicians and bureaucracy are ready for.  In other countries, take-up of electric vehicles is speeding up and people are looking for this option.  The issue must be resolved.  However, Friends of the Earth's view, which is shared by Professor Fitzgerald, is that electric vehicles are only one part of the solution.  The Citizens' Assembly, for example, recommended that we reverse the proportion of investment allocated to roads and public transport, respectively.  This would mean spending two thirds of transport investment in public transport and one third in roads.  Real gains can also be made in cycling and walking, two areas which also deliver co-benefits in terms of health and human connectivity. <\/p><p> We must clarify an issue on peat.  If I understand the views expressed by Professor Fitzgerald and the Citizens' Assembly correctly, we should not only end subsidies for peat but also stop burning peat within perhaps five years.  It is not acceptable, therefore, for the Department to state that once peat subsidies have been removed, the decision as to whether to burn peat will be a commercial one.  The ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na, two semi-State companies, are agreeing to continue to burn peat until 2030, which is just not good enough.  Moreover, it is not good enough to cross-subsidise peat burning through subsidies for the co-firing of biomass.  Until recently, the biomass used here was palm kernels from palm oils, the production of which is devastating habitats and livelihoods in the global south.<\/p><p> We must start the firing gun on withdrawing from peat burning.  In this regard, I will make a quick analogy.  When a US multinational company pulls out of Ireland, the Minister brings the relevant agencies, including IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, together overnight, appoints a task force and promises to use the factory to be vacated and seek as many supports as possible to assist the affected workers and communities to come out the other side.  It is easier, if not easy, when someone else starts the firing gun and the decision is taken by faceless people in a boardroom in Silicon Valley.  In this case, however, we must start the firing gun and eliminate peat production in five years.  This will mean establishing a transition task force and using current expenditure on peat from the public service obligation levy to help communities to determine what their community will be like in ten years, help workers retrain and so on.  We cannot allow the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na to decide they will not stop burning peat until 2030 because at that stage, we will have bust all the carbon budgets for agriculture and everything else and given them all to the peat sector.  That makes no sense for anybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018013000002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517331600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Mr. Muldowney from the Department has indicated he wishes to make a point.

I will make a number of points on agriculture and land use.  Professor Fitzgerald stated the agriculture sector needed to define carbon neutrality.  This is acknowledged in the national mitigation plan in which we set this out as a priority action.  Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency put a research call out to tender but no applications were received.  We hope the research call will be relaunched this year in order that we can try to address how we define carbon neutrality.<\/p> <p>  We pitched the discussion on the approach to carbon neutrality in the national mitigation plan on the basis of a three-legged stool.  The three areas are: abatement of non-CO2 emissions, namely, methane and nitrous oxide; trying to increase sequestration in terms of forests and soils; and trying to contribute to the energy discussion in terms of contributing to renewable energy supply and improving energy efficiency at farm level.  We fully acknowledge the role agriculture has to play in contributing to the national targets.  We acknowledge it is a significant component of the national emissions profile and we have put significant funding around abatement options in the rural development programme, which the IFA mentioned.  We are doing considerable work on this issue. <\/p> <p>  We also have a significant research programme examining the research needs of agriculture and what are the options around methane and nitrous oxide.  The most recent projects, AGRI-I and SUDEN, which were completed last year, contributed to an updating of the national inventory of nitrous oxide emission factors from the soil.  AGRI-I also identified a very successful new fertiliser formulation with stabilised urea that reduces ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions.  We will see how well the new fertiliser is adopted by farmers.  We also have significant animal breeding programmes which seek to ensure the emissions intensity of livestock is reduced.<\/p> <p>  On livestock numbers, I do not know from where Professor Sweeney obtained the growth figure of 1 million head.

I can see how many hedgerows have gone from the fields around my home.  It is the same in every part of the country.  I asked one person why they were taking it out and they told me they were cleaning it up.  I said it did not look dirty.  A hedgerow is not dirty.  I never figured out what the person was talking about.  The concern is that while that scheme exists, hedgerows are being bulldozed at the moment.  I am not sure why because it is not good from a farmer's point of view because not alone are they removing the sequestering value, as a carbon sink, but also a barrier for shelter and drainage because a good strong ditch soaks up the water.

Carbon taxes did make a difference and the research shows that.  They would have made even more difference if they had been higher.  That is our recommendation.<\/p> <p>  In respect of who is affected, the divide is not rural-urban.  Research done as long ago as 1992 by Sue Scott in the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and more recent research by the ESRI shows that people on low incomes are most affected.  The Government needs the revenue to compensate.  It needs approximately 30% of the revenue from the carbon tax to compensate those on low incomes who would be worse off because they spend a higher share of their incomes on electricity.  Commuters would also be affected. <\/p> <p>  The point of electric vehicles is that the owners will not pay carbon tax.  The Government gets &euro;5 billion in revenue from motor vehicles.  The Department of Finance is considering this and may have to move to charging for road use in which case people in rural areas driving electric cars could end up spending much less than they do at present whereas people in congested urban areas could end up paying much more because they are causing congestion.  This is not a rural-urban issue.  It is people on a low income and the rest of the population.  <\/p> <p>  On electric cars and infrastructure, the point to consider is not just whether there are two charging points in Glenties village, rather it is that people will charge their cars at home.

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. John O&rsquo;Beirne, head of products and Mr. Stephen Mason, head of customer operations.  I took up the role of chief executive of the Bank of Ireland Group on 2 October 2017.  Before this, I spent over 20 years in a variety of senior banking roles in the UK and internationally. <br\/><br\/>Bank of Ireland is the largest lender to the Irish economy and has the largest community footprint of any bank in Ireland.  I believe the bank does many things well, however, the issue we are here to discuss today does not fall into that category.  I believe Bank of Ireland took too long to get to the right position on the tracker mortgage issue and did not go far enough in putting our customers first.  This has undoubtedly caused many of our customers financial pain and personal distress.  Therefore, before continuing with my comments this evening, I restate my unreserved apology to all customers affected by this issue for the financial loss and anxiety this has caused them and their families.  Since joining Bank of Ireland, I have reviewed the bank&rsquo;s approach to the tracker issue.  I have concluded that the bank placed a clear emphasis on the legal interpretation of our mortgage agreements but did not go far enough to fully ensure we were delivering the right outcomes for our customers.  I will return to this later, but at this point wish to restate my personal commitment to dealing with this issue as quickly and comprehensively as possible. <br\/><br\/>When I took up the position of CEO at Bank of Ireland just under four months ago I set about immersing myself in all aspects of the business.  Very quickly, the tracker mortgage issue became my key focus.  From my first week as CEO, the issue featured prominently in my interactions with the board and with our regulators.  This included communication between Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank regarding the potential inclusion of additional customers into our redress and compensation scheme.  It became abundantly clear that understanding and resolving the tracker issue was a matter I needed to put at the top of my priority list.  In agreement with the board, which wished to comprehensively resolve the issue, I made this matter my top priority so that I could understand it as best I could.  Armed with this understanding, when the Bank of Ireland chairman and I met the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, in late October, we agreed to fix this issue as quickly as possible, and I gave the Minister a strong personal commitment that we would do the right thing for our customers. <br\/><br\/>I will focus on four key points in my presentation this evening.  First, our progress in addressing this issue since last November; second, our understanding that we cannot ever fully reverse the negative impact the tracker issue has had on our customers; third, the announcement we made in November to include additional customers and why; and, finally, our determination to rebuild trust in Bank of Ireland. <br\/><br\/>On the first point, we have made significant progress in addressing this issue as a top priority.  In total, as a result of this examination Bank of Ireland has identified approximately 9,400 customers affected by this issue.  These customers fall into two groups, namely those who were denied a tracker rate, and those who were on a tracker but on an incorrect rate.  Of the total 9,400, approximately 6,000 customers were denied a tracker rate and approximately 3,400 customers were on a tracker but on an incorrect rate.  All of these customers with open, live mortgage accounts have now been returned to their correct tracker rate.  All of these customers are also entitled to redress and compensation.  As of today, we have contacted almost nine out of ten of them with an offer.  Up to the end of December 2017, more than one third of these customers, almost 3,300, had received redress and compensation with more than &euro;38 million having been paid to these customers by the end of last year.  Since then we have continued to make strong progress.  As of 24 January, the number of customers receiving redress and compensation has increased to more than 5,000, and more than &euro;68 million has been paid.  The total amount of redress and compensation offered to affected customers is &euro;108 million to date. <br\/><br\/>I trust these points underscore how seriously the bank views this issue, and the steps we are taking to make things right for our customers.  However, behind these numbers are people whose lives have been affected by the way the tracker issue was handled.  This leads me to my second point.  While we are now resolving the financial aspects of the tracker issue with compensation and redress, we know we can never fully reverse the negative effect the tracker issue has had on our customers.  A mortgage is more than a financial transaction or product.  It represents a home, the place where we build our lives, the place where we raise our families and where we sleep at night. <br\/><br\/>In my efforts to ensure we comprehensively addressed this issue, I went through a number of individual, difficult, cases in some detail.  I wanted to do this to fully understand the effect of the tracker issue on our customers.  One case involved a customer who had been in extreme financial distress, another was a customer who was at risk of losing their home and I also looked at the detail of a customer who was dealing with a life-threatening illness.  Whilst dealing with these challenging personal issues, each of these customers was also affected by the tracker issue.  I am very sorry the bank has added to their difficulties at what was already a very challenging time for them personally. <br\/><br\/>We are working hard to manage a small number of complex cases where the impact on customers has been extreme.  This includes cases where customers have lost their home as a direct result of the tracker issue.  Extended and appropriate support, tailored to their circumstances, is available to each of these customers.  Since starting our redress and compensation process, we are also keeping in close contact with our customers, listening to their feedback and the feedback of other stakeholders, and improving our approach where appropriate.  For example, in December we reviewed, and increased, the amount we are offering to all customers for independent legal or financial advice.  This is in recognition of the fact that some customers will have more complex legal and financial requirements at this time.  Our appeals panel is also now fully in place.  This independent panel will hear the concerns of any customers who do not feel they have been treated fairly in our offer of redress or compensation. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I now turn to my third point, our decision last November to increase the number of customers who should receive compensation and redress, and to outline the context for that decision.  From my first week as CEO, the tracker issue featured prominently in my interactions with the board and with our regulators.  At that time, the Central Bank challenged Bank of Ireland on whether all customers negatively affected by the tracker issue had been identified correctly, in particular a group of approximately 6,000 customers.  With the aim of achieving a comprehensive resolution, Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s board gave me a strong mandate to take a fresh look at the tracker issue. <br\/><br\/>The terms of the tracker examination, as set out by the Central Bank, required banks to conduct a complete review of their mortgage loan books.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s framework required banks to determine whether contractual rights and consumer protection obligations were complied with.  The examination also required banks to show that in assessing regulatory requirements, they had protected customers&rsquo; interests, treated them fairly, and had considered customers&rsquo; reasonable expectations regarding their tracker mortgage in the context of the information provided by the bank.  I undertook a thorough review of the tracker issue on my arrival.  Work was already in progress but I wanted to ensure we were getting to the right outcome.  This included listening to and reviewing the experience of affected customers to understand, at first-hand, the impact the tracker issue had on individuals and their homes.  I concluded that a clear emphasis had been placed on the legal interpretation of our mortgage agreements.  However, while the bank had considered the voice of the customer when reviewing cases, my view was that we had not always gone far enough to fully ensure we were delivering the right outcomes for our customers.  Therefore, in November 2017, I recommended to the board that we go further and include the additional 6,000 customers in our compensation and redress scheme<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The board strongly supported my recommendation.  There has been a concerted effort at all levels of Bank of Ireland to address this for the benefit of our customers and in a decisive, efficient and effective way for all of our stakeholders.  My primary focus right now is on resolving this issue.  However, in addition to putting things right when things go wrong, we must also learn from this experience.  Banking, at its very core, is based on trust.  Trust has been damaged, both in Bank of Ireland and in the industry as a whole.  Right now, we will be judged on our actions and not on what we say, but on what we do.  We have taken immediate steps to prioritise the return of tracker rates and the payment of compensation and redress for all customers affected by this issue.  This will remain a top priority until it is fixed for every customer.<\/p><p> Looking ahead, Ireland needs a stable and trusted banking sector, one which demonstrably acts responsibly and fairly towards customers.  I have been reflecting on what we must do to restore that trust.  My view is that the way in which we address the tracker issue will define the customer-focused culture we aspire to at Bank of Ireland.  At the end of 2017, we defined Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s purpose as one of enabling customers, colleagues and communities to thrive.  To help the bank achieve this purpose, we have defined key values that will act as a behavioural guide for all of our people.  These values aim to embed behaviour that is customer-focused, accountable, agile and which fosters teamwork.  Changing our culture in these ways will lead to the right outcomes for our customers and will enhance our reputation as a fair and customer-focused bank.  It will also, as a direct result, support sustainable growth for our shareholders.  As well as defining our own culture, Bank of Ireland is fully committed to the establishment of an Irish banking standards board to drive positive change and rebuild trust across the wider banking industry in Ireland.  <\/p><p> In conclusion, I will restate the importance that the Bank of Ireland board, my senior management team and I have placed on addressing the tracker issue and resolving it fully for every affected customer.  As CEO, my role is to lead Bank of Ireland during the next stage of its development.  I recognise we can grow our business only if we have the trust of our customers, the respect of our stakeholders, and the pride of our colleagues in their organisation.  Making things right when things go wrong is very important and learning from this issue is absolutely critical.  It is my firm commitment that lessons will be learned by Bank of Ireland, ensuring we become a more customer-focused bank, rebuilding trust with our customers and the wider society we serve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018013000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517339400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I am conscious there is a vote in the House but I will continue the meeting if members are agreeable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018013000002#D00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1517339400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McDonagh for coming in.

That is from my interaction with the board, the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank and from reading the newspapers and hearing the feedback as to the impact it was having on people.  It was very apparent that I needed to understand the detail of this within the first fortnight of arriving.  I looked at the requirements of the Central Bank's examination which required banks to look at the legal obligations and regulations around customer protection as well as at what reasonable outcome a typical customer could expect.  I looked at the legal aspect and the detail of the numbers, but I also looked at the reasonable expectations of customers.  I put myself in their shoes with my team and we looked at specific cases.  While I cannot, obviously, disclose names in a public forum, we looked at names, the circumstances and what was going on in people's lives where we had the available information and we looked at the offers we were making and the correspondence they had received.  We went through that customer journey.<\/p> <p>  I have spoken to customers and I have listened to their descriptions of the impact it has had on them.  There has been a concerted effort since we included the additional 6,000 to give the benefit of the doubt to customers to do our best to get this to a resolution to their satisfaction.  The redress and compensation framework is for clarity and for many customers it will be in line with their expectations.  For those who feel it is not fair, we have an appeals panel in place.

When we looked at the correspondence with customers, there was insufficient clarity in our communication and terms and conditions that would have given them the absolute clarity they needed to understand if they were going to get a tracker or not.

Legally, those customers had not been given the access to a tracker to which they were entitled.  There were other cases where there was a more of a discussion.

How did this happen?  Who is responsible?  Was anyone targeted to do anything that was not in the best interests of customers?  To answer the first question, it is important to look at the context in 2008.  It was October 2008 when the tracker mortgage product was discontinued for new customers.  There is a deep root-cause review ongoing which will look objectively at the root causes and learnings from this.<\/p><p>It is important that we learn from it.  However, when I look at 2008, and I was not working in Ireland at that stage, I am cognisant that the product at the time was not profitable.  It was lossmaking and not a sustainable product in 2008.  The stability of the whole banking sector in Ireland was at risk.  There was a prudential survival requirement to discontinue products that were unsustainable and losing money every day.  <\/p><p> The bank took a decision in October 2008 to discontinue tracker mortgages for new customers.  Looking at it from my perspective, coming in, it was the right decision to stop a product that was not profitable.  Consideration was given at the time to customers who were on a fixed rate mortgage but had the legal right to a tracker.  From 2008 onwards, there were 20,000 customers who had previously been on a fixed rate and had a contractual right to a tracker.  We discontinued trackers, but appropriately, seamlessly and correctly they still rolled over into a tracker mortgage.<\/p><p> We discontinued the product for new customers.  However, 20,000 customers appropriately exercised their contractual right to roll into a tracker in the future.  That is an indication those customers had been considered.  When I looked at documentation I see that was understood.  However, that application was not consistent.  There are 3,400 in respect of which at some stage, when they were on tracker, the rate was slightly off by 0.15%.  We have put 100% of those customers, of those who are alive today, back on the correct rate and compensated and redressed them for those differentials.  We can talk about the average, but the differential is not very large relative to some of the other numbers in the industry.  <\/p><p> However, 6,000 customers did not get their contractual entitlement to a tracker.  I see no indication of intent or desire to do that.  Whether it was lack of clarity in some of our terminology or not taking a sufficiently customer-focused approach, those 6,000 customers did not get the tracker they were entitled to.  That has been identified and accepted.  Our focus and energy is on giving them their money back via compensation and redress by 31 March or as soon as they respond to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018013000002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517339400,"counter":84,"content":"<p>We will come back to the responsibility issue.  We have heard similar stuff from AIB.  It is beyond belief.  The issue here relates to Bank of Ireland's staff.  The witness gave us the number of impacted persons who have been restored in tracker mortgages.  There are currently large numbers of Bank of Ireland staff still being denied the tracker mortgage and the bank is still in breach of the law in relation to them.  I will give one example of many concerning individuals on a two-year fixed rate of 3.59%.  This was around 2009.<\/p><p>The bank promised them they would roll over onto a staff tracker mortgage of ECB plus 0.75%.  I will read out some internal documentation that may be of interest to Ms McDonagh.  It was circulated to all the members of staff.

Staff who are currently on staff two-year fixed rates, currently 3.59%, will roll to ECB plus 0.75% with no benefit in kind, BIK, implications, as per their original signed mortgage agreement, at the end of the two-year fixed period.

Given this internal document and given individuals who were on the two-year fixed rate are not deemed impacted after being looked at by the witness's bank, does Ms McDonagh believe she is in breach of that comment?

However, this communication said very clearly, in respect of existing staff mortgage accounts, staff who are currently on the two-year fixed will roll automatically onto the tracker.  Bank of Ireland has made a decision at a corporate level that they are excluded.  There is a reasonable expectation, if not a legal expectation, that they should be deemed appropriate.  I know what is going on here.  I know that Bank of Ireland did put some people on, but it was those who were on tracker first and then fixed.

One is the offer letter, which is typically the original and primary document for a mortgage and it has information on pricing and relevant terms and conditions.  For a customer who changes, switches or takes on a new feature in their mortgage, they would then get a second document called a mortgage form of authorisation, MFA.  That MFA will refer to pricing but states that save the details set out in this form, all terms and conditions applicable to the loan remain unchanged.  If one is the customer who switched 17 times, one would have 17 MFAs and one offer document.  That reference over a period of time, involving multiple MFA documents to the offer and even though it may be contractually accurate, from a customer-centric perspective and how a reasonable customer would understand that, we believe there was scope for confusion.

On top of the compensation structure we set out in the questionnaire returned to the committee, it is important to highlight that where it has been deemed there is direct causation for the loss of any customer's home, and while we know that money alone will not be an answer for the suffering of those families, what we have also done within that compensation structure is to ensure that any residual debt that would have been left from the sale of the home is written off in full.  Any payments towards that residual debt made by the customer after the sale of the property will be returned.  There will be a minimum of &euro;50,000 in compensation.  If there has been any gain in value of the property since the date it was sold, given the rising property market at the moment, the differential will also be given back to the customer.  Similarly, we will also look to calculate a future value they would have had from the tracker mortgage that was removed from them versus the value of the standard variable rate.  That is an additional payment to the customer.  If possible, and if that the customer wishes to, we will return him or her to a tracker rate in purchasing a new home.  In the case of the mortgage-to-rent scheme, if they wish, we will see if we can re-purchase it from the housing body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018013000002#K01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Beirne"},{"type":"speech","time":1517339400,"counter":186,"content":"<p>How many of those were voluntary surrenders?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018013000002#K01500","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517339400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>In respect of the loss of ownership of the eight owner-occupied cases, none was reprocessed, six were via consensual sale, one resulted in a trade down to a more affordable property, and one was the case of mortgage-to-rent, referred to by Mr. O'Beirne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018013000002#K01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1517339400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>There were not any court cases through the process.

This is the problem.  The Irish public put billions into Bank of Ireland.  If an individual owed money to Bank of Ireland for a mortgage, and I was in practice for years, the bank took on those customers.  It was there to collect the money.  I find it incredible with regard to these 6,000 customers.  The bank was clearly fighting with the Central Bank before Ms McDonagh's arrival with regard to a technicality.<\/p> <p>  We are on a committee discussing this, but the devil is always in the detail.  That is the bank's business but we have to probe the question.  How can Ms McDonagh stand over a situation based on a technicality?  Someone could have taken out a mortgage on 31 December 2006 and another customer could have taken out a mortgage on 1 January 2007.  Both are identical, but one person is covered and the other is not.  This is totally against the spirit of why the Irish public put money into the banks.  The money held for people who took out mortgages before 2006 was their money, it was not the bank's money.  If the roles were reversed and a customer owed money to the bank, whether the mortgage was taken out pre-2006 or post-2006, the bank would have gone after that customer in the same fashion.  There has to be fairness.<\/p> <p>  Can Ms McDonagh stand over this?  I hope Ms McDonagh was horrified when she went in and that she just turned around to the board and stated the bank had to stand over these tracker mortgages.  Can Ms McDonagh see the exasperation?  I find it incredible.  I am actually shocked.  The bank has 3,400 affected customers and another 6,000 on top, which is not quite double, but who make up at this stage two thirds of the affected trackers.  The bank was basically trying to keep them out on a technicality and continue - for want of a term where I want to be direct because I very rarely am - to rob their money.

I want to get an understanding.  She spoke about compensation in her opening remarks.  We get letters and emails all the time.  Why does Ms McDonagh believe her staff - the employees of her bank - are writing to us on an ongoing basis to highlight the fact that they feel they are not being treated properly?  Given what she has said about how the bank treats its staff the same as its customers, is it not odd that they are writing to us to say they are not getting fair play?<\/p> <p>  The second point I want to make relates to compensation.  Ms McDonagh has said she deals with particular cases.  A lady wrote to us in December to say she had been overcharged by &euro;1,355 a month.  She said that if Bank of Ireland had come clean at any point over the years between 2008 and 2012, she and her family would have kept their home, their tracker and their lives.  She said she would have had enough money to pay for a consultant in the course of the birth of her child, who was born with a disability.  She mentioned that a second child is receiving the services of a psychologist.  She says her life has been destroyed and broken and her relationship and family are destroyed.  It was in December of last year that this lady wrote to us to that effect.  What method is available within the bank to reach out to that family?  How does it construct a compensation package around an extreme case like that?  What flexibility is there?

Staff have the right to write directly to the committee.  Obviously, I would always want our staff to feel they can escalate their concerns to their line managers or to me as part of an open and engaging culture in our organisation.  We are encouraging a speak-up culture in which the more traditional hierarchical layers are broken down and people feel they can speak up and have their concerns addressed.  Such a culture is engaging and successful.  Staff members may have escalated the cases that have been mentioned to their line managers or to me.  I do not know.  If there are cases involving employees of Bank of Ireland, I would be very keen to look at them, as I would with any customers.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned a specific case in which someone wrote to him in December 2017 to set out the impact the tracker issue has caused in her life.  I would be very keen to look at this individual case.  I hope it is one we are dealing with as what we consider to be a \"complex\" case.  It is clear that in this case, there are extenuating circumstances, there is vulnerability and distress has been caused.  No financial framework can compensate for the human impact of what has happened to that individual's family.  I recognised that in my opening statement and I have apologised for it.  The only thing we can do right now is look at complex individual cases on a case-by-case basis.  The people who are managing this are not contractors or new staff members.  They have a great deal of experience of managing and resolving complex cases.

I have concluded that the bank placed a clear emphasis on the legal interpretation of our mortgage agreements but did not go far enough to fully ensure we were delivering the right outcomes for our customers.<\/blockquote> <p>On page 4, almost identical wording is used, namely:<\/p><blockquote>I concluded that a clear emphasis had been placed on the legal interpretation of our mortgage agreements.

Is it fair to say that the bank looked at the agreements, said that within the law it could continue doing what it was doing and it would do so, then Ms McDonagh came along and made recommendations to the board, for which Ms McDonagh received the board's support?  Can she discuss with us the extent to which the Central Bank's involvement was relevant and how much arm-twisting, if any, was involved?  If it was not relevant, then so be it.  For the figure to go from 3,400 to 9,400 - nearly 10,000 - in a very short time - effectively in one go on 9 November - is notable.

Work was ongoing before I arrived.  There was an ongoing discussion and challenge between the Central Bank and the Bank of Ireland regarding which customers should be included.  There was a lot of work and discussion between senior management and the board.  Nobody was trying to take an exclusively legalistic approach.  There was a clear intent and endeavour to include customers' perspective.  I will give two examples.  The benefit of the doubt was given to customers where we had undercharged.  I spoke of the 3,400 marginal errors where we had slightly overcharged customers and which we have corrected and redressed.  There were 2,000 cases where we undercharged.  That was an operational error - our error - and we did not return to the customers and tell them they owed us money as a consequence of our operational error.  That is a simple example of where the bank did the right thing.  During much of the discussion around contractual or consumer protection, the voice of the customer was in the room.  The bank had a senior, very accomplished executive to be the voice of the customer and to give the customer perspective, which I think is good.<\/p> <p>  On reflection, and coming in with a fresh perspective and in agreement with the board, with a very clear mandate, I think that it could have gone further.  My view is that in order to be more customer-centric, the voice of the customer could have been an external voice rather than an internal employee.  It could have been more of a consumer advocate, to be a critical friend and constructive voice to challenge some of the thinking.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to pre-empt the review and have already mentioned this, but the opportunity to improve the clarity and consistency of wording is something that we should do and to go further on it.  That is something I would like to do.<\/p> <p>  When I arrived, working with a team, we looked at the journey purely from a customer perspective.  We did not have technical or legal counsel in the room for this exercise.  We imagined a customer, it could be a member of staff or someone who is in the pre-2006 group or a regular switcher, and what they would have experienced at every step of the life of their mortgage?  That provided a different prism through which to view the issue and it allowed us to see matters from their perspective.

I asked the question of AIB last week and will probably ask it of other banks.  What is the highest amount of redress and compensation identified so far?  I do not know if any of the team looked at the AIB interaction last week.  During the meeting we saw that, by and large, its compensation was approximately 15% but there were higher figures of 22% and 24% as well as lower figures.  It depended on the impact.  I tried to understand some of the information in Appendix 2 although it is perhaps not the easiest thing in the world to understand because it refers to upfront payments and 5% of refund value etc.  We might come back to that.  However, in terms of those who lost and those who did not lose their homes, what were the highest amounts of redress?<\/p> <p>  Although they are not necessarily with Bank of Ireland, people have contacted me to say they will receive approximately &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000.

It has a huge job in terms of restoring trust.  This is not just in Bank of Ireland and Bank of Ireland cannot do it for the whole banking sector but it can do its best within its bank.  I know we are dealing with tracker mortgages but this is central to everything that happens in a bank.  In terms of behaviour that is agile, accountable, fosters teamwork and is customer-focused, what is the bank doing to get that over the line?  We have previously spoken about branches that are moving towards automated transactions.  They are not cashless and I accept that they are not cashless but there is less customer interaction with staff for ordinary transactions.  I accept that many customers are happy with it and they carry out their banking on their mobiles and so on.  It is very difficult, however, to be customer focused when a person wants to talk to someone but is faced with lots of machines in the branch.  How does the bank respond to that kind of thing?  People are now opening post office accounts to deal with coin because they cannot go to the bank and deal with it except on Friday mornings for two hours etc.  Many people are unhappy with parts of the change of culture, which is happening in all of the banks, including Bank of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018013000002#Q01600","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517339400,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I will respond more broadly on culture and what we are doing and I will ask Mr. Mason to respond on the trends we are seeing and changes made in the branch network.<\/p><p>Obviously how we address this particular issue will be defining in terms of the culture both for our stakeholders and customers, as well as on how our own staff feel we are addressing this - not just because they have had a tracker - but how they feel the bank represents itself in its resolution.  It is an incredibly important moment for us, as to how we redress this in the coming weeks until we come to conclusion.  <\/p><p> Many things had happened to start to improve the culture before my arrival.  For example, complaints management has been consolidated.  As opposed to having complaints on different products or different channels in different parts of the banks, for accountability, agility and being customer-focused, it involved having a consolidated and centralised understanding of where complaints are happening.  It means that even if one sees a relatively small number of increase, one can investigate or there would be an escalation. <\/p><p> We have also changed how we launch, alter or discontinue a product in order that there is a better consideration of all aspects of the customer impact.

It is one that seeks to improve both the efficiency and the speed, simplicity and digital propositions that we offer our customers over time.  These are some of the examples.

I did so because I recognise that both formats are equally applicable to different types of customers and some customers will use both for different things.  The role of the branch is incredibly important.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Mason has said, the behaviour and needs of our customers are evolving and we need to evolve and match them.  Last week, I spoke to customers in Galway and learned of their frustrations.  They want to have more personal time and do not want to queue to use a machine.  Customer feedback is very important to us and we incorporate it into our schemes.  We will always have people in every single branch in our network.  We have the largest footprint of any bank in Ireland.  Every single branch has cash but some are more focused towards a self-service model because that is where we have seen the footprint.  We do not underestimate the importance of a relationship and personal service, whether it is in our branches or contact centres.  Increasingly, whether it is the SME or agricultural sector, some customers want to have an out-of-hours conversation with a specialist adviser.  We have found that model to be highly relevant for the modern age.<\/p> <p>  We are opening new branches.  I joined the team at a new work space located on Camden Street.

First, how long does it take to be approved for a mortgage.  Second, how is the changing nature of work, in terms of contracts etc., taken into account.<\/p> <p>  As for the speed in getting a mortgage, typically, the time it takes from applying to drawing down a mortgage depends on how quickly the property sells.  Applying for a mortgage and getting approval tends to be a relatively quick process once the bank has sight of all of the documentation that is required to make a decision.  Typically, if there is an urgency on the part of the customer or if there is a specific reason that he or she has a time constraint, we will seek to turn the decision around within 24 hours.  If approval is not time-sensitive, then normally it takes three to five days.  In some cases, it can take a little bit longer but that depends on the circumstances such as a requirement to provide follow-up information. <\/p> <p>  On the Senator's second question on the changing nature of work and contracts, the bank is mindful of the situation.  We try to look past whether somebody is in traditional long-term employment or whether they are on a 12-month or 24-month work contract.  Typically, we look through the individual or person's sphere of expertise - let us say he or she is an engineer or teacher - and we think this person is very likely to be able to continue to find employment in that space and the salary looks like it is within the normal parameters that we would expect.  That will not count against the individual in terms of the bank arriving at an approval for the mortgage application.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018013000002#R01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Beirne"},{"type":"speech","time":1517339400,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Mr. Boucher advocated that most banks should go down the route of fixed rate mortgages over a period or to at least fix part of the mortgage.

On existing staff mortgage accounts - the staff two-year fixed rate - it states that they would revert to tracker mortgages.  The bank's staff are watching these hearings.  I received an email from one staff of member who is in this cohort that the bank has deemed non-impacted, which means that it will not give them back the money that they are entitled to plus compensation.  This is an internal email from the following day.  I refer to the original communication which indicates that the bank's staff member is entitled to roll on to an ECB tracker plus 0.75%, which, by the way, the staff member always believed because, when the staff member took out the fixed rate, that was the understanding.  The following day, the staff member emailed the bank to query the position regarding the tracker rate mortgage.  The reply states that it is in reply to an email the staff member sent to a more senior person in the bank, that the staff member is on a fixed rate mortgage until a certain date in 2009, that the staff member's mortgage will then automatically revert to the staff tracker currently at 4.5%, and that they can let the staff member know at that time what the staff member's repayments will be at that time.  That issued from personal lending.<\/p> <p>  These are the guys in respect of whom the bank is still closing down the hatches and stating that they are not entitled to it.  The bank can provide us all this stuff about how it told them it was but it was a wee bit vague and then the bank clarified it a couple of weeks later, but there are internal documents here.  This individual reached out to the bank just to be sure.  The individual did so because there were options at that time for that individual to break the fixed rate and go on to a tracker, which was still available in the market but which would quickly be shut down.  The bank denied that individual and the other hundreds of bank staff members those opportunities.<\/p> <p>  I say this to Ms McDonagh.

This email is clear.  This email from the bank tells that individual the day after it sent out the original communication, when he clarified this, that his mortgage was moving to a tracker.

I am sure that this individual is not the only one and I am sure they have gone through all the processes within the bank.<\/p> <p>  Let me tell Ms McDonagh how I am 100% convinced.  Before Ms McDonagh's time, but only four months ago, bankers from her bank sat there when the chairperson questioned them.  At that stage, they were telling us that none of the 1,850 customers would be deemed impacted.  The chairperson went through line by line, with Mr. McLoughlin, how the bank could verify that, how the committee that was set up scrutinised all the work, and how that committee was independent, etc.  The reality is we just must keep on pushing and the bank will finally accept what should have been accepted a long time ago.<\/p> <p>  We are coming to the end of this process but there is much still to be done until we get there.  The bank has a responsibility.  If Ms McDonagh wants to talk about the culture of the bank, she should not be tarred with the culture of the bank that she joined.  This one, whatever about the rest of it, hangs on Ms McDonagh.  I plead with Ms McDonagh to do right by her staff, current and past, to deal with this issue compassionately, as she talked about in her opening statement.  This is where the proof of the pudding lies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018013000002#U01300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517339400,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I would need to have a look at those cases.

I refer to the transcripts of that meeting in September 2017.  Mr. Liam McLoughlin was explicit, stating that the examination at that time was \"It is not complete.  It is an ongoing review.  There are some [matters] still be addressed.\"  Those matters were the cohorts that were in debate.  That was an absolutely correct statement.  He also stated that the number of accounts affected may change, which, indeed, they have.  According to the transcript, what he stated accurately represented the position of the bank at the time.  That position, following more work, review and a mandate from the board to take a more customer-centric position, has changed, which, I think, is good and right.<\/p><p>We are working hard to close out all remaining issues.

For those who had an entitlement to a tracker mortgage and who would have fixed for a period, by the time the fixed period had expired, the tracker mortgage was no longer available on the market so they would have been offered a variable rate or to fix again.  If they chose to fix again, would they be deemed as impacted?  AIB told us they would be deemed as impacted because it had failed to offer them the tracker mortgage, even though it was not in the market, because it had a contractual arrangement.  Again, we have plenty of communication on this but a sample case is a customer of Bank of Ireland who took out a tracker mortgage with the bank in 2007.  It was clearly stated on the contract that it was the ECB rate plus 1.1%.  He fixed for three years and, when the three years was up, he was offered other options and he fixed again.  Others in the exact same scenario have spoken about this on <i>www.askaboutmoney.com<\/i>and all of this is publicly available.  When they got the letter of offer, they actually approached Bank of Ireland and said they were entitled to a tracker and then got a letter back from the bank saying it was sorry for the error and it put them back on the tracker.  These are probably some of the 20,000 Ms McDonagh talks about.  The bank was aware there was an error there but this individual, and many others like him who fixed for a second period, are now not being deemed to be impacted by the bank.  How could that be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018013000002#V00500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517339400,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. O'Beirne to respond to that detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018013000002#V00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517339400,"counter":397,"content":"<p>If I understand it, these are customers who drew down on a tracker, then they fixed and then they fixed again.
