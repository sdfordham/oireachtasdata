How is it fair that child benefit has been cut across the board, and not just by the announced \u20ac10 which was hidden in the small print?

How should people accept those cuts?  I do not specifically blame the Labour Party.  It has a greater responsibility in this regard but both Government parties have agreed this cut.  On the basis of the pre-election commitments given by the Labour Party specifically in the area of child benefit, a vote for the Labour Party was supposed to protect child benefit.  Will someone explain to me whether it is like what the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, said at the weekend that they were only election promises and they do not really matter?  It appears to be same with the increase in third level fees, which seems to have been forgotten, and the property tax.  The Government is not seeking to exempt those with pyrite affected houses but will ram through an anti-urban property tax.<\/p><p>Following the weekend, I understand many Senators and Deputies took the time to lobby the Ministers.  Perhaps Senator Bacik can tell the House the progress of that lobbying and if the Labour Party will back a cut in child benefit, the respite care grant and the back to school allowance.  Next week, Members will have a better opportunity to vote against those cuts in the House because of the numbers issue.  The Government does not have the majority it enjoys in the other House to be able to ram through these disgusting cuts.

We could ask the T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, to come to the House to explain what the Department is doing.  I say this not as a criticism of the Minister as I believe he is doing what he can and the Irish ambassadors there over the years have been doing their best, but because here is an Irish citizen, whose wife lives here in Ireland with their three daughters and who has been detained without trial or any explanation of why he was arrested and who has been left in solitary confinement to a large extent.

The reason they are doing this is because they recognise that there has been no disadvantage in America over the years.  There has been a huge impact on fuel costs in America because, for a number of years, they had been using this technology successfully and Britain does not want to be left behind.  We should not be left behind.  We should at least be debating this and we have been remiss in not allowing the debate to take place.  There are a number of Senators, particularly Senator Mooney, who expressed deep concern.  I am pleased to hear such concern because we should bring this out into the open.  In Britain, they have brought it out into the open and they have made a decision to go ahead with shale-gas fracking but under tight controls.

From a hitherto unseen chapter of the Stevens report, it now is known that one of the guns involved was stolen from the British Army and subsequently was returned to it, courtesy of the RUC.  This points very clearly to the collusion that unfortunately was involved.  While another report is forthcoming, I salute the Taoiseach as he has been completely consistent on this matter.

This was evident from the atmosphere in the audience and the decorum that existed.  I also compliment Pat Kenny on the manner in which he handled it, because there were lessons to be learned from last night's programme.  Members also have lessons to learn, which are that it does not matter what diverse views one may have in a debate or whether it takes place in a television studio, this Chamber or anywhere else but it should be possible to conduct any dialogue and debate without heckling and shouting.  If one's opinion is genuinely held and strong enough, it should be sufficient simply to be part of whatever discussion is going on.<\/p><p>On another point, I believe the current loyalist violence in the North serves as a reminder to us all of how fragile the peace process can be in certain circumstances.  I acknowledge it is not representative of the views which are held throughout Northern Ireland but we have become a little complacent ourselves.  A lot of time, goodwill and compromise was invested in the Good Friday Agreement and everyone has seen the fruits that have come therefrom.  They have been historic and edifying in so many ways.  However, I have formed the impression that, at present, there is a gap in the ongoing dialogue between our own part and that part of the country.  The same applies when one turns a blind eye to glaring issues, such as the murder of solicitor Pat Finucane, because it always was understood that in time of conflict, anyone involved in the legal profession or anyone involved in the media generally were not regarded as targets in any sense of the word.  Members have listened to the pleas of the family of Pat Finucane but have not responded sufficiently.<\/p> <p>The day Britain did not agree to have a proper public investigation sent the wrong signal.  We all believe there was collusion between the security forces and those who murdered Pat Finucane.  The murder was condemned throughout the world.  There is no doubt whatsoever now about murderous collusion between the security forces and the people who carried out the murder.  If we do not strongly and formally, at the highest level, require what the Finucane family now request and deserve, namely, ensure there is a proper public inquiry, we will always have the type of thing that erupts right in the middle of the peace process.

Such was its effect that it not only left an indelible mark on the Irish psyche; it also led to 1 million people dying prematurely from starvation and disease and 1 million more emigrating.

It is something we should debate as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p>I also agree with the sentiments of a number of Senators on the Pat Finucane case.  I concur that the Taoiseach must use every opportunity to raise the issue and ensure a full, public inquiry is set up.<\/p><p>On a number of occasions I have asked that the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in the North would be invited to speak in this Chamber.  It would be timely for them to come to the Chamber to talk about what has been achieved through the peace process and the ongoing situation in the North.  It would also be pertinent given the number of issues that have been raised concerning the North, ranging from Queen\u2019s University, Belfast, the Pat Finucane inquiry, and the ongoing violence there on the raising of the flag over Belfast City Hall.  We would all have a chance to ask them various questions on those issues.<\/p><p>I also note that at a meeting of the joint policing committee in County Galway yesterday, the chief superintendent told us that there has been a 44% increase in burglaries in rural County Galway.  That is an alarming figure, but it is even more alarming coming after a budgetary announcement that 100 Garda stations will be closed in rural areas - ten of them in County Galway, which is the largest number in any county.  I do not see how it all adds up that one would close Garda stations at a time when there is an increasing number of burglaries or that the Minister would contend that is a better way of policing.  He was backed up by the local representative, Deputy Se\u00e1n Kyne, who said he believed it would be a better model and would work better for rural areas.  We should have a full, frank and open debate on the issue.  I do not consider it a positive step.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors has said it is a retrograde step.  Ordinary garda\u00ed have said they do not feel we should close Garda stations in rural areas.

I call on the Minister to come before the House for a full debate.  He should set out the reasons he believes this is a better model of policing and his proposals to technically upgrade rural Garda stations to enable garda\u00ed to do their job in the best way possible and reduce the alarming number of burglaries. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100011#K00300","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355231100,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I join colleagues in condemning the violence in Belfast over the weekend, in particular, the attempted murder of a police officer and appalling attacks on offices belonging to the Alliance Party, which has made a major contribution to the peace process in Northern Ireland.

There are complicated matters in the alcohol strategy that are difficult for us to deal with, for example, sponsorship of certain festivals and sporting events.

First, it was appalling to read reports over the weekend that the Revenue Commissioners are yet again using a big stick against people who find themselves in financial difficulty, this time threatening to remove mortgage interest relief for people who unfortunately find themselves in arrears with their mortgage payments.  That is unacceptable, unnecessary and retrograde.  It gives people who are down on their knees a further kick.  The Minister for Finance should immediately instruct the Revenue Commissioners to issue a clarification statement on their exact approach and to adopt a fair and reasonable approach to people who are trying their best but who are at the end of their tether.<\/p><p>Overall, many elements of the budget, although they are painful, had to be included.  Personally, however, I would have favoured an extra 3% in the universal social charge for people earning not only more than \u20ac100,000 but on earnings over \u20ac80,000.  When the Minister for Finance is drafting the Finance Bill perhaps he would consider introducing a 3% increase in the universal social charge for earnings between \u20ac80,000 and \u20ac120,000 and a 5% increase for earnings over \u20ac120,000.  It is appropriate that taxes such as the capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax are being increased from 30% to 33%.  I believe they should have been increased to 35%.  If people are earning such wealth in this country, they should pay their fair share of taxes.  What is the difference between 33% and 35% to somebody who is selling a house at a reasonable profit or somebody who is making a great deal of money from dividends?  It is an extra 2% but it would help people at the lower end as it means it would be possible to reduce the effects on them.  Although it might not be agreeable to all members of my party, I believe in taxing wealth.  During a recession, in particular, when people are struggling, the wealthy should pay over and above their fair share.  They should suffer the same pain.  I have no hesitation or qualms about saying that here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100014#N00200","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1355231700,"counter":110,"content":"<\/a> <p>Senator Darragh O'Brien called for a debate on perinatal care.

The appointments system was designed to provide representation for minorities or interests not adequately represented by the D\u00e1il, in effect giving a voice to Unionist representatives and people of specialist knowledge and experience or with a record of public service.  Among those who sat in this Chamber were William Butler Yeats, Oliver St. John Gogarty, Sir Horace Plunkett, Jenny Wyse Power, Douglas Hyde and Alice Stopford Green. <\/p><p>Since its inception, the Seanad recorded a remarkable record of initiating and amending legislation, with notable and inspiring contributions and an impressive level of debate.  <\/p><p>The modern Seanad \u00c9ireann was established by the Constitution of Ireland in 1937.  The new Seanad \u00c9ireann is comprised of 60 Members, 43 elected by five panels representing vocational interests, namely: culture and education; agriculture; labour; industry and commerce; and public administration.  Six Senators are elected by the graduates of two universities, three each from the National University of Ireland and the University of Dublin, Trinity College.  Eleven Senators are nominated by the Taoiseach.    <\/p><p>The spirit and intent of the Seanad to represent minorities and provide a platform to those with specialist experience and to contribute to a healthy and robust democracy carried through to the new Seanad.  In the past, Taoisigh have used their nominations to appoint respected people from Northern Ireland, such as the late peace campaigner, Gordon Wilson, and Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party.  Benjamin Guinness, Lord Iveagh, sat as a Taoiseach's nominated Senator from 1973 to 1977 while he was also a Member of the House of Lords.  <\/p><p>Today, Seanad \u00c9ireann is playing a greater and more effective role in our parliamentary democracy.  This newly-elected Seanad is determined to modernise its procedures and actively engage with civic society.  To begin this process, we have changed Standing Orders to allow persons and representatives of public and civil life to address Seanad \u00c9ireann.  Among those to address the Seanad under the new rules were: Drew Nelson, grand secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland; Mary Robinson, former Senator, President of Ireland and United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; and Maurice Manning, president of the Irish Human Rights Commission and chair of the European Group of National Human Rights Institutions.  <\/p><p>The Seanad Public Consultation Committee, which was established as part of the new procedures to open access to Seanad \u00c9ireann and its work, is to specify and publicise areas related to the legislative powers of the Seanad and issues of public policy and to invite submissions from public interest groups.  It provides a powerful opportunity to strengthen dialogue between the Seanad and the public.  It is also a very public forum for debate and discussion on a wide range of subjects in the area of public policy.  To date, the Seanad Public Consultation Committee has published a report calling for wide-ranging amendments to existing legislation to bolster the rights of older people and has sought submissions from interested groups or individuals on how government and society can respond to the challenge of preventing cancer through healthy diet, physical activity and weight management.<\/p><p>These new rules allow for a vibrant and effective Seanad where we can learn about and increase our understanding of the major issues facing our people.  The changes will enable us, as parliamentarians, to provide a real and valuable input into initiatives to meet the key challenges and concerns facing our society today.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100017#Q00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1355232600,"counter":121,"content":"<p>A Chathaoirligh, today we mark the 90th anniversary of the inaugural meeting of Seanad \u00c9ireann which took place on 11 December 1922.

Some 90 years later, the 24th Seanad sits at a time when our nation faces another battle, to retrieve its economic and political sovereignty.<\/p><p>I sincerely hope that as we approach the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising and the 1922 establishment of the Irish Free State we will have retrieved that sovereignty and re-identified with the values that define us as a people and can on those anniversaries celebrate a true Republic.<\/p> <p>That is what we owe the generations before us who dedicated themselves to the pursuit of Irish independence and created the architecture of our modern Irish State.  The right to control our own affairs and to decide our own destiny has been the wish for generations of our ancestors.  We owe to them and future generations a better body politic, one that places the national interest before that of any one individual or interest group.  In this context, I believe the members of Seanad \u00c9ireann can play a central role.<\/p><p>One of the most outstanding members in the early years of Seanad \u00c9ireann was Senator William Butler Yeats.  Despite an overwhelmingly Catholic membership, Yeats and his future independent colleagues achieved great things.  He chaired the coinage committee that was charged with selecting a set of designs for the first coinage for the Irish Free State.  A year after his term in the first Seanad he was to become the first Irishman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in literature.  The Nobel committee described Yeats\u2019s work as &quot;inspired poetry, which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation.&quot;  He also contributed to a number of debates, including speaking against the proposed anti-divorce legislation in 1925.  Yeats was very much a character that resembles the true value of the Seanad as a Chamber that can give the voiceless a voice, the invisible a presence and the status quo a challenger.<\/p><p>Many other great public representatives and patriots have also served in this Chamber.  I recall the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald, a man whose honesty, extraordinary commitment and love for Ireland and its people has remained a benchmark for all public representatives.  Other colleagues of ours, including former President, Mary Robinson, have championed the cause of minorities when others were not prepared to listen.  Those barriers did not stop Mary Robinson\u2019s efforts; in fact they encouraged her further to achieve true greatness in the areas of human rights and social issues.  Last week, we paid tribute to former Senator Trevor West, who played a vital, if low key, role in the early days of the peace process in Northern Ireland.  There are countless other examples of Senators who have gone on to achieve marvellous things both at home and abroad.  It is fitting that, on this day, we remember their extraordinary service to our country.<\/p><p>It remains the Government\u2019s intention to hold a referendum on the future of Seanad \u00c9ireann.  Ultimately, the people of Ireland will decide its fate.  Regardless of the outcome of this referendum, this Seanad can serve as the most productive and effective one yet but that can only be achieved if we as a group do it ourselves.  That requires Members to respect the true purpose of this Parliament, to scrutinise legislation, to represent minorities and to uphold at all times the national interest.  It also requires Members to turn up for debates with members of the Government and contribute to them.  This is a most challenging time for our country in its 90-year history and the public are looking to both Houses of the Oireachtas for solutions, however daring and bold they may be.<\/p><p>There is much good to be said of the valuable contribution made by the Seanad that is too often forgotten by the commentariat.  Initiatives such as the public consultation committee, which strives to strengthen the dialogue between the Seanad and public on a range of policy issues, have been well received.  The adoption by Government of a number of Seanad Private Members' Bills and its receptive response to many others shows we can make an effective contribution.  Time and time again Ministers and Ministers of State have expressed to me their satisfaction with the quality of debate in the House when discussing legislation and they have demonstrated a willingness take on board relevant legislative amendments where possible.<\/p><p>As part of the Seanad's programme for the Irish Presidency of the EU which takes place during the first half of next year, I have invited all Irish MEPs to address the House throughout the six-month Presidency.  I hope this new initiative will bring the work of the Seanad and that of the European Parliament much closer.<\/p> <p>We have achieved cross-party agreement on a number of motions of interest to members and I hope this is something on which we can build. <\/p><p>The 24th Seanad has led the way on many issues.  I want to improve upon that because the House has far more to offer than it is given credit for by some people.  I hope the future will bring greater peace, prosperity and success to our great country and the world.  The reformed Seanad can play a role in achieving those ideals in an ever changing Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100017#Q00400","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355233500,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Ar dt\u00fas, is m\u00f3r an on\u00f3ir dom a bheith anseo mar cheannaire Fhianna F\u00e1il sa Seanad, le labhairt ar an cheili\u00faradh speisialta seo.  As leader of the Fianna F\u00e1il group I am honoured to speak on behalf of my party on the 90th anniversary of the House to mark its contribution to the State.  I fear many of our colleagues will mention the same names of some auspicious previous Members.  It is important to note their contribution in the House.<\/p><p>Some 90 years ago when the Seanad was first established its purpose was to include Upper House representatives from minorities or interests not represented adequately in the D\u00e1il, as the distinguished historian and former Senator, John A. Murphy, put it, this meant not only Protestant or Unionist representatives but people of specialist knowledge and experience or with a record of public service.  We can thank the first Seanad on how it enabled the minority communities in what was then the Irish Free State to become part of our political and democratic process here.  The importance of what happened by way of allowing the southern Unionist representation, in particular, southern Protestant and Presbyterian and other minorities, such as the Jewish faith, proper representation in the Upper House was crucially important.  Many new European countries as they were then, failed in this respect at the first hurdle.  The first Seanad which played a crucial role that has not been properly teased out or given the credit due, was forward thinking.  I am proud to say that the first Seanad achieved the same.  Its membership was made up not only of Roman Catholics but Protestants and Jews and included many Unionists, several peers, a former British army general, artists, writers and republicans.  It was as diverse a body as might be imagined in the period after the establishment of the new State.  All its members were united by their desire and willingness to serve Ireland.  <\/p><p>The list of Members of the Seanad reflects the breadth of talent who took up the challenge.  The first Cathaoirleach of the Seanad was Lord Glenavy, former Unionist MP and Lord Chancellor of Ireland, who was overwhelmingly elected as Chair of the House by his fellow Members, an act which set a pattern of bipartisanship, co-operation and collegiality that distinguishes the House to this day, most of the time.  We will wait for the Social Welfare Bill next week.  His fellow Members included the Nobel laureate, as the Cathaoirleach and the Leader of the House have covered, William Butler Yeats, one of the greatest writers the country has ever produce, Horace Plunkett, pioneer of the co-operative movement in Ireland, Jane Wyse Power, the activist, feminist and business woman, the historian, as the Leader said, Alice Stopford Green, and the surgeon and poet, Oliver St. John Gogarty.  Another previous notable Member was Douglas Hyde, the founder of the Gaelic League and first President of Ireland.  He deserves a special mention as being a Member of the first Seanad.<\/p><p>Recently we have faced calls for the abolition of the House.  While I will not discuss the specifics of the merits of that I draw attention to the fact that these calls are not new.  Indeed, the founder of my party, \u00c9amon De Valera, in 1928, called for an end to what he called the costly Seanad for it served no useful function.  It would appear that even he recognised the need for an Upper House and proceeded to draw up plans for a new Seanad, the result of which our Members see today.  <\/p><p>Each and every Seanad since 1937 - we have another commemoration tomorrow in regard to the Constitution - has had its fair share of distinguished Members, including another President of Ireland, as mentioned, Mary Robinson, and former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald.  As with the first Seanad, it also included people with specialist knowledge.<\/p> <p>The Hon Lady Valerie Goulding, Noel Browne and Robert Malachy Burke were all Members.  Benjamin Guinness, the third Earl of Iveagh, held the distinction of being a Member of two Upper Houses at the same time - the Seanad and the House of Lords.  I single out two current Members, Senators Norris and Quinn, who would rightly form part of that role of honour of Members over the past 90 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100019#S00200","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355233800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100020#T00200","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1355233800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Another aspect of more recent Seanaid has been the appointment of people involved in the Northern Ireland peace process by successive taoisigh.  I think of Members such as Seamus Mallon, Br\u00edd Rogers and Gordon Wilson.  Perhaps this is a practice that should be re-established because I have no doubt that we will have future Seanaid and that Seanad \u00c9ireann will survive.<\/p><p>The reformed Seanad after 1937, with the same abiding principles as the First Seanad, sought to provide a place for independent voices to discuss and debate, to propose and amend, to support and criticise legislation brought to this House or, as is often the case, legislation originating in this House.  It is not reported that more than 30% of all legislation initiated in the Oireachtas has started here in successive Seanaid, mostly in the spirit of bipartisanship, collegiality and co-operation.  A former critic of this House, Michael McDowell, stated that these principles and this spirit made the Seanad an institution worth keeping.  His experience as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, informed his statement that &quot;the better legislative work by far was done in the Seanad&quot;.  He went on to state: &quot;I also found that the practice of initiating major reforming legislation in the Seanad and then bringing it to the D\u00e1il frequently had the effect of defusing the adversarial atmosphere in the D\u00e1il because many of the more contentious issues had either been explained or resolved in an amicable way in the Seanad.&quot;<\/p><p>I have served in both Houses - I served in the previous D\u00e1il and am now honoured to serve here on the Seanad's 90th anniversary.  Oireachtas reform will not be achieved through abolition.  Parliamentary reform should encompass all aspects and all pillars of the Oireachtas, including the Executive, the D\u00e1il, Seanad and the President.  Singling out the Seanad as only area in which reform should happen will not solve that problem.  That will be a debate for another day.  It is never too late for any Government to look back and see the merit of that argument.  If we had a referendum on the D\u00e1il, I have a feeling it would also be abolished.<\/p><p>I commend the Cathaoirleach and the Leader, specifically, along with the group leaders and other colleagues, on the many changes that have been initiated in this House in the past 18 or 19 months.  They were very important changes, as the Leader, Senator Maurice Hayes, mentioned.

I am honoured not only as a Labour Senator, but also as a university Senator, because the university Senators have had a very proud tradition in this House.  Many of the Senators, named by colleagues earlier, represented the universities.<\/p><p>As we look back, all of us are also conscious that we also look forward to a likely referendum on the future of the Seanad.  However, as we look back over the history of the last 90 years, it is striking that a debate on abolition or retention has been ongoing throughout the lifetime of the Seanad.<\/p> <p>I am indebted to a colleague, a senior counsel and Fianna F\u00e1il councillor, Jim O'Callaghan, who has done extensive research on the first Seanad and wrote that a form of senate was referred to in all three of the Home Rule Bills dating back to 1886.  Before the Free State Seanad was constituted, proposals were in place which varied widely.  The first Home Rule Bill provided for 103 representatives in an upper house, of whom 28 would be peers, and who would serve for ten years.  The Government of Ireland Act 1920 provided for a slimmed down version of 64 senators designed to ensure representation and protection for Southern Unionists in the new state.  The Free State Seanad, which was finally constituted in 1922, was made up of 60 Members under Article 12 of the 1922 Constitution, and 30 of those were nominated by the President of the Executive Council, Mr. W.T. Cosgrave, who appointed what was referred to as a distinguished and talented group representative of all classes, as <i>The New York Times<\/i>remarked at the time.<\/p><p> I am also indebted to Dr. Elaine Byrne who wrote a wonderful article on the 60th anniversary of the current Seanad in July 2008 in which she spoke of the first Seanad as constituting seven peers, a dowager countess, five baronets and several knights, and that the Seanad consisted of 36 Catholics, 20 Protestants, three Quakers and one Jew.  Mr. Cosgrave's nominees numbered 16 Southern Unionists.  It was a truly diverse group, and yet was youthful and important in the life of the first Government.  The 1922 Government, as Dr. Byrne has written, had no practical experience of parliamentary life.  The young Ministers relied enormously on the Seanad, along with the Civil Service and the Army, because the Seanad influenced the guiding principles and legislative foundations of the State, representing, as it did, more of an establishment culture.<\/p><p> It is also interesting to note that those first Senators were subject to serious intimidation and threats.  In the light of what is happening in Northern Ireland at this time, it is particularly poignant to read that by the end of March 1922, as a result of anti-treaty opposition to the Seanad, 37 Senators' homes had been burnt to the ground and Mr. Cosgrave's home was scorched.  There was a good deal of intimidation of the early Seanad.<\/p><p> Fianna F\u00e1il opposed the Seanad in advance proposals in 1932 before it came to power, and it was in its election manifesto for the 1932 general election.  As O'Callaghan writes, they promised to abolish the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100020#T00600","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355234400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Senator Bacik never misses an opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100021#U00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1355234400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>The Seanad abolition Bill was not put to the D\u00e1il until the day after the Seanad had voted down a Government Bill to restrict the wearing of uniforms in light of the Blueshirts threat.  There is an interesting history to the first Seanad abolition Bill.<\/p><p>The reason I mention all of this is because, in March and April 1934, there was a fascinating series of debates in both Houses on the idea of a bicameral system that also has significant resonance today.  Persons such as the late President Eamon de Valera, were critical of that Seanad or second Chamber, but once the Bill had been passed, the Bill having been supported by the Labour Party, with the late Deputy William Norton referring to that first Seanad as a rubber stamp, and the Seanad abolished, popular opinion changed over the course of the following two years.  By 1938, following the enactment of the 1937 Constitution, a new Seanad was set up.  This was the current Seanad as we know it, with 60 Senators elected and nominated in the way the Leader described.<\/p><p>This new Seanad was a reformed version of a second House.  It is interesting that, during the course of the period of the debates in the D\u00e1il and Seanad in 1934, there was a growing recognition of the need for a bicameral system.  This was accepted even by those who were highly critical of the constitution of the first Seanad.  The commission that was set up following the 1936 vote agreed that there should be a second House in the new Constitution, that is, the House we have currently.<\/p><p>As other Senators have said, it is a House that we need to reform.  We have carried out some important reforms internally, but we also must acknowledge the contribution the Seanad has made over many years.  Senators have referred to the number of Bills that have been put through.  Today, more than 100 amendments are likely to be tabled for Report Stage of the Personal Insolvency Bill.  There is a good tradition of commencing Bills and of tabling amendments in this House.  There is also a good tradition of introducing Private Members' Bills.  We saw one last week on humanist weddings that had started life in this House as a Private Members' Bill.<\/p><p>Over the 90 years of the Seanad's history there has been this ongoing debate on whether to retain the Seanad.  This debate will be emphasised further in 2013 as we face into the referendum.  It would be worth acknowledging the history and contribution of the Seanad.<\/p> <p>A practical way of doing this, which Dr. Byrne suggested four years ago, would be to put the Seanad casket and signatures on permanent public display.  I believe they are still in the Royal Irish Academy.  The casket was on display on the Cathaoirleach's desk in the Chamber from 1924 to 1936.  It has a vellum manuscript with fountain pen signatures of the first 60 Senators.  I believe I am correct to state it has not yet been moved from the Royal Irish Academy.  Perhaps it is something we could consider doing in recognition of the long, lively and far from smooth history of the Seanad.  As we face into debates we might do well to remember the Seanad has faced up robustly to these challenges in the past and may well do so in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100021#U00300","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355235000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I am honoured to speak on behalf of the Taoiseach's nominees.  In preparing for today I spent the past week reflecting and reading through the history of the Seanad, as it appears my colleagues also did, and in particular I looked at its earlier days.  My colleagues know I have a keen interest in family history, and through my research on my family I learned the necklace I am wearing today was given by my grandfather to his sister on her wedding day in the 1920s.  I wonder what were their thoughts about the newly founded Seanad on that day in County Clare.  My family history includes some amazing strong women, and as I wear my great-aunt's necklace, I wonder whether the first women of the Seanad gave her inspiration.<\/p><p>The women nominated to the 1922 to 1937 Free State Seanad were highly gifted and made significant contributions to the political, economic and cultural spheres of Ireland.  Notably these women were committed to gender equality during a period in which legislative changes ensured women\u2019s rights were further weakened.  Jenny Wyse Power had been active in the Ladies' Land League and local government, and also ran various businesses.  Ellen Odette Cuffe, Countess of Desart, was a London-based Jewish woman who had founded a woollen mill, a theatre and a hospital in Kilkenny.  She was also a keen supporter of the Irish language.  Alice Stopford Green was a noted historian.  Eileen Costello was a London-based teacher who moved to Galway and had a keen interest in Irish folklore.  Elected in 1928, Kathleen Clarke was a well-known nationalist who opposed the wording of Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann as she believed it placed women in a lower position than the Proclamation of 1916.  Kathleen Browne, a member of Cumann na nGaedheal, joined the Seanad through a by-election in 1929.<\/p><p>Despite their political differences, these women often worked together to promote women\u2019s issues.  The Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Bill 1925, which sought to confine State examinations for senior Civil Service posts to men, was strongly opposed by Senators Wyse Power and Costello.  Additionally, Senator Wyse Power, who had worked in the republican courts established during the War of Independence, was staunch in her opposition to the Juries Act 1927 which barred women from jury service in the new state.  Many of the women Senators supported the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Bill 1929, which was introduced to improve the status of unmarried mothers by providing the mother with the right to financial maintenance from the child\u2019s father.  Senator Clarke opposed a ban on contraceptives in 1934, arguing it would drive the issue of birth control underground.  Radically for the time, Senator Clarke also called for solidarity from the trade union movement on the issue of equal pay in 1935.<\/p><p>A number of women elected over the years to the post-1937 Seanad, such as Mary Robinson and Gemma Hussey, began their political careers campaigning actively for women\u2019s issues.  Once elected, they worked hard to ensure women\u2019s rights were placed on the agenda of the House.  The then Senator Robinson, despite being subject to personal hate mail and high levels of suspicion from a number of colleagues, introduced a Bill in 1973 to make contraceptives legal in the Republic.  Meanwhile, Senator Hussey attempted to introduce legislation on rape, sponsoring the Sexual Offences Bill 1980, which lapsed on First Stage.  A former Judge of the Supreme Court, Catherine McGuinness, who was first elected to the Seanad in 1979, argued for the rights of the individual throughout her legislative and judicial career.  These women, and others, made improving the lives of ordinary women central to their work as Senators, and are just three examples of the high level of female talent which has emerged from the Upper House.<\/p><p>I was interested to note that between 1937 and 2007, no Taoiseach nominated more than four women.  This was broken in 2011 when the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, included seven women among his 11 nominees.<\/p> <p>This ensured the new Seanad was 30% female, a record high in women's political representation in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As one examines the transcripts and history of the House, it is clear that women Senators have made contributions to the Upper House and to Houses of the Oireachtas well beyond their paltry numbers.<\/p><p>The 90th anniversary has given me an opportunity to reflect on our history and to draw inspiration.  I feel very privileged to be a member of Seanad \u00c9ireann.  As I reflect today, and especially looking at my colleagues in my Independent group and admire the work that they have done outside and inside the House, I think that each one of us has an opportunity to reflect and decide what will be the legacy of our work.  Will we be willing to use our voices, our role and our powers to make a positive difference to the lives of the people of Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100022#V00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355235600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I call the Leader to move an amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100023#W00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1355235600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I amend the Order of Business to allow this item of business to conclude at 1.55 p.m<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100023#W00300","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1355235600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

When Lord Midleton, Dr. John Henry Bernard, then provost of Trinity College, and Mr. Andrew Jameson met Arthur Griffith in London on 16 November 1921 and communicated with the then President of the D\u00e1il, Eamon de Valera, they set in train a remarkable body, and it is fitting that we celebrate its 90th birthday today.<\/p><p>  One of the first things the Seanad did was rename an institution that is known everywhere in the country.  An amendment was introduced and passed by the Seanad which changed the name of the Civic Guards to An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, which is the title it has been known by ever since.  The early relationship between the Government, the D\u00e1il and the Seanad was described by Donal O'Sullivan as imperfect sympathy.  By 9 August 1923, Mr. Cosgrave came to the House to express his deep appreciation, and that of his colleagues, for the co-operation and assistance given by the second Chamber to him and for its useful and constructive criticism given on the legislative proposals of the Ministry.  I hope that on 9 August 2013, the Taoiseach will come to the House to tell us how much he appreciates what Senators have done.  That is the spirit in which we operate and is why we are here.<\/p><p>  Mrs. Alice Stopford Green said, when presenting the casket on which Senator Bacik commented:<ul>We shall learn the ties which did in fact ever bind the dwellers in Ireland together.  Whether we are of an ancient Irish descent, or of later Irish birth, we are united in one people, and we are bound by one lofty obligation to complete the building of our common nation.<\/ul>Of course, as the Leader has said, that includes in the past two years in particular, the necessity to question and seek checks and balances to be created in institutions which have failed the country and which have caused the loss of our economic sovereignty.  Let me think of famous names.  President Michael D. Higgins was nominated to be a Member of this House by the then Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, and he has had a stellar political career ever since.<\/p><p>  With regard to the present day, we shall discuss the Personal Insolvency Bill.  It was amended 181 times on Committee Stage and the relevant Minister has taken another 155 amendments tabled in this House.  Therefore, 336 examples exist of changes made by the House to major legislation that seeks to change insolvency from bankruptcy to a conciliatory process.  That is not a unique occurrence in the past year.  As many Ministers have referred to, and as the Leader has said, there have been constructive debates in this House.  It is a pity sometimes that the advisers to the Ministers, who sit behind them, pass on notes telling them not to accept what we say.  I hope that junior people in the Civil Service will be more open to our amendments than some of their seniors.  It is a pleasure to see how willing Ministers are to listen to what we say here and that they appreciate the quality of our debates.<\/p><p>  What present should the Seanad receive for its 90th birthday?

That Chamber was established after a long period of division and conflict.  The Seanad was envisioned as a Chamber which could offset the powers of the executive by providing checks and balances.  Realistically, however, it has never been like that.  The Seanad we know today was not that first one, but the Seanad of de Valera's 1937 Constitution which was ostensibly established on a model of extracting expertise in various fields.  This was, however, a corporatist and largely undemocratic approach and the product of a time when long discredited corporatist politics were in vogue.  Somehow or other, and despite numerous reports and proposals to vary that, we are still stuck with this model.  It is because we are stuck with that model that there are calls for its abolition, not least from the Taoiseach himself.<\/p><p>There have been numerous opportunities to do something about the structure of the Seanad.  It is my view, and I believe a widely shared one, that the Seanad as currently constituted is undemocratic, unrepresentative and does not have a clear enough purpose.  This does not mean there is no function for a second Chamber.  It is not right or proper simply to remove one arm of the Houses of the Oireachtas without offering alternatives.  Sinn F\u00e9in has proposed alternatives.<\/p><p>I commend Senators who put together the &quot;Open it, Don\u2019t Close it&quot; report, which has been very valuable.  The report usefully highlights that, even without constitutional reform, we can make elections to the Seanad more democratic by expanding the franchise, which is crucial for it to have any validity.  The Seanad is clearly an appropriate place to provide representation to Irish citizens in the North and to the diaspora.  These are categories of citizen that have no say in the political life of the State, and that situation must be corrected.  We could also very much utilise the Seanad as a forum for scrutiny of European legislation.<\/p><p>On a day as auspicious as this, however, I pay tribute to all those who have passed through the Seanad, including those previously mentioned.  I will not go over the names again because they are on the record.  While taking into account all the political conflict we may have in the Chamber, it is not in question that people work very hard in here.  They are here for the right reasons, including the betterment of the State.  I congratulate all those who, in their own way, challenged the prevailing consensus of the time.<\/p><p>If the Seanad is to survive another nine years, however, not to mind 90, it needs to change and become more democratic.  I appeal to the Government, especially the Taoiseach, to give us the chance for that to happen.  The constitutional convention would probably be an appropriate forum by which to do that.<\/p><p>Mar dhuine a labhrann Gaeilge agus a bhfuil an-suim agam i gc\u00farsa\u00ed Ghaeilge, is fi\u00fa luadh go bhfuil \u00fas\u00e1id na Gaeilge sa Seand seo ach go h-\u00e1irithe ardaithe go m\u00f3r agus gur iontach an deis \u00ed an Seanad leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn sa saol poibl\u00ed.

The Bill is a relatively short technical Bill, with 20 sections in total that was passed by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann without amendment on 29 November last.  The Bill proposes to amend the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 to provide for the enhanced and effective functioning of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and the registration boards established under the Act.  It will also amend the Act to better provide for the assessment and recognition in Ireland of qualifications obtained outside the State and to ensure compliance with the relevant EU instrument.<\/p><p>The 2005 Act provides for the establishment of a system of statutory regulation for designated health and social care professions.  The regulatory system comprises a registration board for each of 12 designated professions, a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system and a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters.  These bodies are collectively known informally as CORU.  CORU is responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland.  It promotes high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants.  The Health and Social Care Professionals Council was established in 2007.  Its functions include the governance and co-ordination of registration boards and the provision of administrative support and secretarial assistance to registration boards and their committees.  Although the annual cost of running the council is being funded by the Exchequer in the main at present, the intention is that the regulatory system will, in time, be fully self-funding through the annual fees payable by registrants, as is the case with all other health professional regulators, such as the Medical Council, An Bord Altranais, etc.<\/p><p>At present, the following 12 health and social care professions are designated under the Act, namely, clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.  In addition, the decision of the previous Government to rationalise the Opticians Board into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council will see another two professions, optometrists and dispensing opticians, being regulated under the Act in 2013.  Under the Act, I, as Minister for Health, may designate other health and social care professions if I consider that it is in the public interest to do so and if the specified criteria have been met.<\/p> <p>I am aware that some professions, currently not designated, have made a case to be regulated under the Act.  While my immediate priority is to proceed with the establishment of the registration boards for the professions currently designated under the 2005 legislation, I have undertaken to commence the necessary steps to bring counsellors and psychotherapists within the ambit of the Act as a matter of urgency.  I have given this commitment following the valuable and thoughtful contributions made during the passage of the Bill through D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.<\/p><p>The lack of regulation in the area of counselling in particular is a matter of concern.  There are a number of issues still to be clarified however.  These include decisions on whether one or two professions are regulated, on the title or titles of the profession or professions, and on the minimum qualifications to be required of counsellors and psychotherapists.  A report from Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, is due next year and will establish standards of knowledge, skills and competence to be acquired by students of counselling and psychotherapy.  In addition, an examination will be undertaken on the standard of qualifications currently held by counselling and psychotherapy practitioners seeking regulation.  The culmination of this work will be a big milestone towards the regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists.<\/p><p>To date, five registration boards have been established.  These registration boards are for the professions of social worker, radiographer, dietitian, occupational therapist and speech and language therapist.  It is my intention to proceed to establish a further six registration boards in 2013.  The Social Workers Registration Board has established its register, has held elections and has made the necessary by-laws on education and training qualifications.  The board has also adopted a code of professional conduct and ethics which was subject to public consultation.  When the statutory transitional period ends two years after the establishment of the register next May, the profession of social worker will be fully regulated under the Act.  The Radiographers Registration Board will soon be in a position to open its register and commence its two-year transitional period.  That will also facilitate the commencement of the fitness to practise provisions of the Act.<\/p><p>The Act provides for grandparenting - a transitional period of two years during which existing practitioners must register on the basis of current specified qualifications.  After that, only registrants of a registration board, who will be subject to the Act's regulatory regime, will be entitled to use the relevant designated title.<\/p><p>The Bill has three main purposes.  The first is to amend the Act to allow the Minister for Health to continue to appoint professional members to the council until each of the registration boards has been established in respect of the 12 professions designated under the Act, has held elections, and is in a position to nominate one of their elected members.  The second is to incorporate the provisions of Directive 2005\/3 6\/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications into the principal Act and to provide for the assessment and recognition of other non-Irish qualifications which are outside the scope of the directive.  Third, and in order to enhance the effective operation of the council and the registration boards, other amendments are proposed which relate to items such as fees payable to members of the council, registration criteria and the updating of fines for offences under the Act.<\/p><p>I wish to briefly explain the technical difficulty that has arisen with the appointment of professional members to the council.  The Act provides that the council consists of a chairperson and 24 ordinary members, with each of the 12 registration boards nominating one of their elected members for appointment.  As is usual in such cases, for the first term, the Act also empowers the Minister for Health to directly appoint 12 professional representative members since no registration board would have been established.  The phased establishment of the 12 registration boards and the resulting lapse of time have meant however that, in the absence of registration boards which can then nominate council members, professional representative members cannot be appointed to the council to fill the vacancies arising from the completion of the terms of office of the original members.<\/p><p>Currently, 12 professional members are attending council meetings in an observer capacity, with my consent, so that the perspective of the professionals can be maintained.  This is an interim measure only and those attending do not have voting powers and cannot fulfil the requirements for a quorum.  The Bill therefore proposes an amendment to the Act to allow the Minister for Health to continue to appoint professional members to the council until such time as the registration boards have been established, have held elections and are in a position to nominate elected members for appointment to the council.<\/p> <p> The Bill also takes account of the provisions of Directive 2005\/36\/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications, which was enacted after the enactment of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  This directive is an Internal Market measure aimed at facilitating the free movement of persons within the European Economic Area, EEA.  While health professionals are the largest single professional category availing of its provisions, the directive applies to any regulated profession.  The Department of Education and Skills, in light of its role in qualifications, has overall responsibility for the directive in Ireland.<\/p><p>Senators may be aware that discussions are taking place at European Union level to modernise Directive 2005\/36\/EC.  These are expected to conclude during the Irish Presidency.  In the meantime, it is necessary to give effect to certain aspects of the current directive in this Bill.<\/p><p>The directive makes it easier for qualified professionals, including certain health and social care professionals, to practise their professions in European countries other than their own, while providing appropriate safeguards to ensure public health and safety and consumer protection.  This means that applicants' qualifications and post-qualification work experience are assessed to ensure they meet the qualification entry requirements to the profession in question in Ireland.  As qualification recognition is the first step in a statutory registration process, it was always the policy intention that the registration boards would assume responsibility for the qualification recognition function under this directive.  The Bill, therefore, provides that each registration board will be designated as competent authority under Directive 2005\/36\/EC for its designated profession.<\/p><p>The Minister for Health is the competent authority for most of the health professions designated under the Act and qualification recognition is for the purpose of eligibility for recruitment to the publicly-funded health sector.  The introduction of statutory registration will mean all persons with non-Irish professional qualifications who seek to exercise their profession in Ireland must have their non-Irish qualification recognised under the directive.<\/p><p>The amendments contained in the Bill will also provide a legal basis for the assessment and recognition of qualifications obtained outside the State which are outside the scope of the directive, namely, the non-EEA qualifications of EEA nationals and the qualifications of non-EEA nationals.  The Bill provides that the processes for the assessment of these qualifications are the same as provided for in Directive 2005\/36\/EC, including the provision of explicit appeal mechanisms.<\/p><p>The main provisions of the Bill can be summarised as follows.  Section 1 sets out that the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 is the principal Act and section 2 inserts a number of definitions into the principal Act.  Section 3 will allow the Minister for Health to continue to appoint representatives of the designated professions to the council until such time as all registration boards are established and in a position to nominate elected members.  Section 4 will provide a legal basis, when the council is self-funding, for payments to members of the council and its disciplinary - fitness to practise - committees, subject to the approval of the Minister for Health and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>Section 6 will permit each registration board to prescribe certain practice and training requirements for professionals who have not practised for a designated period.  Sections 11 and 13 will increase the maximum fines for offences committed under the principal Act.  Sections 15 and 16 will provide for some changes in relation to &quot;grandparenting&quot; and in respect of the use of professional titles during the transitional period in which practising professionals may apply for registration.  Sections 17 and 18 will allow the Minister to have the power to appoint members of the council and registration boards for a period of up to four years, rather than the current fixed term of four years.<\/p><p>Amendments are also proposed to sections 5 to 10, inclusive, and 14 and 15, of the principal Act to provide for the assessment and recognition in Ireland of qualifications obtained outside the State.  Section 5 inserts a new section 27A to provide that when their registers have been established registration boards will be designated as competent authorities under Directive 2005\/36\/EC, empowered to act as competent authorities for their designated professions under Directive 2005\/36\/EC and empowered to assess qualifications obtained outside the State which are outside the scope of the directive.  This section also provides for necessary transition arrangements for applications under the directive.<\/p><p>Section 6 amends section 31 to provide that a registration board may make by-laws relating to procedures for the assessment of professional qualifications, training, experience, aptitude tests or adaptation periods of applicants for registration whose professional qualifications have been obtained outside the State and are outside the scope of the directive.<\/p> <p>Section 7 amends section 38 to update and simplify the approved qualifications criteria in section 38(2) so that there are three categories - Irish qualifications, qualifications approved under Directive 2005\/36\/EC and other qualifications - and to insert new definitions and remove others no longer necessary.  Sections 8, 9 and 10 relate to procedures and appeals for non-Irish qualifications.  Section 12 relates to the use of title in the provision of services on a temporary and occasional basis.  Sections 14 and 15 amend the registration process for existing practitioners to comply with the processes of Directive 2005\/36\/EC which provide for the assessment of formal professional training and post-qualification professional experience.  Finally, section 19 provides a minor clarifying amendment to the list of optional qualifications required by an existing practitioner radiographer in order to register during the transitional period.<\/p><p>In conclusion, this Bill will enable the Health and Social Care Professionals Council to continue to fulfil in a more effective way its object to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of the designated professions.  I thank the House for its attention and commend the Bill to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100025#Y00400","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355237700,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing most of the Minister's speech.  I was on my way to another meeting and became delayed.  I welcome the opportunity to make a few points about this legislation.  We could have the Minister in the House all the time.  The Minister knows that every day on the Order of Business, we are always looking to have a chat with him about various things.  In contrast to the normal adversarial approach I take, we very much support this Bill.  The Minister knows that its origins go back to the current Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Martin, in 2000 in respect of the report entitled Statutory Registration for<\/p><p>Health and Social Professionals: Proposals for the Way Forward.  The 2005 Act came about as a result of that report and we then saw the commitment to introduce statutory registration for health and social care professionals.  <\/p><p>According to that report, approximately 35 grades in the health service come under the overall term of health and social care.  The rationale for the introduction of such registration is that we all require confidence in our health care professionals and to know that if we are seeking therapy or medical help and assistance, we can be confident that the prescribed treatment or therapy does what it says on the tin, for want of a better expression.  Various disciplines have voiced concerns over the years about people's qualifications.  <\/p><p>The legislation, which the Minister went through piece by piece, is technical in nature.  Its main implications are the inclusion of additional professions in the system of statutory regulation in the future and the granting of power to the Minister to do that.  For example, the Minister may look at including counselling and psychotherapy after the original 12 areas are included.  What are the Minister's intentions with regard to herbalists?  There are some very well-qualified people who are offering herbal remedies and treatments and many people have considerable confidence in them.  There are varying degrees of expertise among these people.  Some have done basic courses while I gather that others have completed degrees and doctorates in this area and so are very well qualified and competent in prescribing various remedies and treatments.  We should try to include this area as soon as possible so that we can ensure that those worthy of registration are registered and those who are not worthy of registration are not registered so that the public can have confidence in that area as well.  <\/p> <p> Will the Minister clarify why section 6 of the 2005 Act, relating to fitness to practise complaints, inquiries and the discipline that might be handed down, has not yet commenced?  Why is this issue not dealt with in the Bill?  Obviously, it is very important in the regulation of health care professionals and is meant to be a key function of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council.  Only two of the professions are registered and up and running so far.

It is important to have proper registration for people who are offering such services.  When the review was carried out in 2000 there were only five professional groups subject to statutory registration - doctors, dentists, nurses, opticians and pharmacists.  The 2005 Act expanded that to 12 other groups, including clinical biochemists, dieticians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.<\/p><p>We are dealing with a very big area.  In the health and medical care sector, there are more than 18,000 registered medical practitioners and I understand that more than 4,500 of them are people who did not graduate in Ireland.  There is a huge movement of professionals in all areas.  An advantage of the EU is that people can move freely within the 27 member states and over the years more people are moving from one state to another.  Indeed, a large number of professional practitioners have moved to Ireland so it is important that we have a proper procedure in place for registration.  I welcome this Bill for that reason.<\/p><p>It is important that the Health and Social Care Professionals Council is fully operational, with all the various sectoral boards registered as well.  The Minister said that five are already up and running and another six are due to be established during 2013.  This is technical legislation and it is important that it is passed.  The registration board is not just about registration but also about ensuring that set standards are reached in respect of education and training and that a set procedure is in place for dealing with complaints, inquiries, discipline and the protection of professional titles.<\/p> <p> The EU documentation refers to more than 800 professional qualifications.  As more and more people are moving between member states, it is important that we move towards harmonising and recognising qualifications.  We are attached to the UK health education system, in that we are more likely to recognise a qualification from a non-European country, for example, India, Pakistan or Nigeria, than we are to recognise qualifications from European countries.  Our tendency has been to look towards the UK's education and training process.  As we progress further in Europe, there will be greater sharing of information and training and expertise will become more available in Ireland as opposed to the Irish just offering that expertise to other European countries.  In this light, it is important that a set of rules apply across the 27 member states.<\/p><p>Not only does the Bill before us deal with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and the establishment of the registration boards, it also deals with the 2005 directive on same.  That directive was a consolidation of 15 other directives and is concerned with the recognition of qualifications.  Since it is currently being reviewed, we need to move with the times.  I welcome the Minister's work in introducing the Bill and in ensuring that all of the registration boards are set up in a timely manner.  Although the legislation has been in place since 2005, we have been slow in putting all of the procedures in place.  We need to move faster.  I note the Minister's confirmation to the effect that the 12 boards will be up and running within the not too distant future.<\/p><p>Given the work that must be done by the boards and the council, it is important that backup administrative services be in place.  The Bill sets out strict timelines for response times to applications and for dealing with appeals and complaints.  If the timelines are to work properly, there must be a proper administrative structure.<\/p><p>I welcome this development overall.  It is important that the public has a fair protection mechanism that ensures that the quality of service it receives is of the standard expected and required in Ireland and the other 26 member states.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to its passage through the House and its enactment at an early date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100029#CC00500","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355238300,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and add my support to the Bill.

I look forward to it.<\/p><p>In particular, I welcome the Minister's statement that he has started taking the steps necessary to include counselling and psychotherapy among the professions to be recognised.<\/p> <p>It is alarming as we have all heard of cases where people can put a plaque on the door and call themselves a counsellor or psychotherapist and provide counselling in areas like suicide or eating disorders, which are very serious complaints that require proper and effective training.

He had to gain the appropriate qualifications but was left for nine or ten months, which is a major delay in looking at his qualifications.

It has a number of key purposes, as the Minister outlined, and we hope it will add to the effective functioning of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, which represents 12 disciplines, including clinical biochemists, dieticians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists, with optometrists and dispensing opticians to be added in 2013.<\/p><p>The registration boards for each of these professions have yet to be established.  One of the purposes of the Bill, as outlined, is to allow the Minister to continue to appoint professional members to the council until each of the registration boards has been established in respect of the 12 professions designated under the Act, elections are to be held and there is the chance to nominate an elected member.  We support this process, which is a reasonable step to ensure various disciplines are represented.<\/p><p>The second key purpose is to incorporate the provisions of Directive 2005\/36\/EC into Irish law, which relates to the recognition of professional qualifications into the principal Act and provide for the assessment and recognition of other non-Irish qualifications outside the scope of the directive.  This is again perfectly sensible and there is a need to ensure skills are transferable, particularly as there is often a need to bring people with particular skills into this country's health care service.<\/p><p>Although it is vital to ensure there is co-operation, integration and transferability in a European context, we should also consider how to better bring about integration in an all-Ireland context, and it is not just Sinn F\u00e9in which sees value in this.  As my colleague, Deputy \u00d3 Caol\u00e1in, noted in the other House, the North-South feasibility study on cross-Border co-operation in health care provision, carried out by the two Departments in the North and South, made clear the benefits of cross-Border operation.  He noted there are significant difficulties, as there are two jurisdictions on this small island, for both sets of authorities in sustaining high quality and specialist services normally only provided in centres servicing large populations.<\/p><p>Steps can be taken to overcome such challenges if a cross-Border approach is taken.  The report noted that where patients must leave both jurisdictions for treatment, the impact on individuals and families is significant in terms of patient well-being and accessibility for families in what can sometimes be traumatic circumstances.<\/p> <p>Combining resources for the provision of such services on a North-South basis makes sense.  It is particularly relevant to the legislation that the report notes, \"it is recognised that both populations would benefit from flexible working arrangements which would enable staff to work in another jurisdiction.  For example, practitioners with scarce clinical skills might reasonably offer a service to both populations\".<\/p><p>The report considers that issues such as indemnity for staff working out of jurisdiction and mutual recognition of qualifications between professional bodies in both jurisdictions, as well as registration and pension issues associated with working in both jurisdictions, need to be resolved for the benefits of that to be fully recognised.  I agree with these sentiments.  I hope the Minister takes them on board and that we will see action in this regard in the coming weeks and months.<\/p><p>The third major purpose of the legislation is to enhance the effective operation of the council and registration boards, including items such as fees payable to members of the council, registration criteria and the updating of fines for offences under the Act.  This is largely technical in nature.<\/p><p>The steps taken here are positive in improving regulation and so on.  They are, however, modest steps with reference to the substantial reform we require.  The Minister commits himself to reform on a substantial scale but we need to see more evidence of this progress.<\/p><p>Given the way the HSE and our health care system are structured, too few people are employed in many of these disciplines, despite many being trained in those fields.  The most obvious example is that of speech therapists.  Many who have qualifications would love to take on that work full-time and plug a gap in service provision that is clearly there.  This was borne out in the D\u00e1il contributions by Deputy \u00d3 Caol\u00e1in and several others.  The recruitment embargo is a blunt instrument that is not working and is hampering the care of patients.  <\/p><p>I urge the Minister to bring this issue back to Cabinet.  Nonetheless, we commend the Minister for bringing the Bill forward and we will be supporting it.

It is essential that we have registration boards and regulation for professionals.  There must be certainty for professionals working in the various disciplines and members of the public who avail of those services must have certainty and trust in standards.  A certain level of educational attainment must be established prior to entering a profession and there must be continuing professional development and training throughout a professional working life.  In 2000, only five professions were registered.  There are now another 12.  Twelve years is a long time but some of these things can take a long time.  It is important to give certainty.<\/p><p>I am glad to hear the Minister's comments regarding counsellors and psychotherapists.  This area can be difficult.  A person can put a plaque on the wall and offer those services.  This can happen in other areas but it is particularly true of these areas.  Counsellors and psychotherapists deal with vulnerable people who are crying out for help and depending on these professionals to support them and provide the necessary interventions and supports.  In many cases they charge a hefty fee of \u20ac60, \u20ac70, \u20ac80 or more per hour for their services.  This area has been crying out for regulation for a long time and we have all heard stories of how the trust of the public has been violated by certain individuals.  I welcome the Minister's comments that he will work on this area as a matter of priority.  In his speech, he laid out how he intends to move forward.  That is a positive move.<\/p><p>As a member state of the EU, we want to ensure that there is a standard for all professions across the 27 member states.  Those standards should be required of any professional coming to work in this country or in any member state.  There should be a means of assessment to ensure professionals meet those standards.  <\/p><p>This is an important and positive step, from everyone's point of view.<\/p> <p>The registration boards will give certainty and confidence to users of the services of these health professionals.

We need at least two committees to be in place and these have not commenced yet because the three new registers and the social work register have only recently been added.  These committees will commence next year.<\/p><p>A number of Members asked about establishing registers for other health-related fields.  They could make submissions to the Department.  Many of them mentioned specific areas, some of which I am interested in.  For instance, acupuncture is valuable and it works, particularly for pain relief.  I would much prefer people to have acupuncture on a weekly basis than to take non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, which can destroy their kidneys and cause gastrointestinal bleeding.<\/p> <p>Acupuncture is a safe alternative, particularly in older people, but we do not have any university here that has a prescribed course, therefore, one is at the mercy of the person delivering the service.  It is an area I would like examined.  I would like to see some of the colleges provide a course on which we could rely to produce suitably qualified individuals to provide these services.  The same applies to reflexology, not to the same extent, but it certainly can have a role in respect of relaxation.  <\/p><p>Senator Marie Moloney asked about registration costs, an issue also raised by Senator John Kelly.  The reason it is more expensive for social workers to register is that they number only in the hundreds whereas there are 60,000 nurses.  If one has to support the same super structure with fewer people it will obviously cost more.  As to who set the fee, at the behest of the unions I entered a long discussion with them on the fee because I did not want people to have lots of frills in respect of the register that are unnecessary when those who have to register have to pay the bill.  <\/p><p>Senator Mary Moran raised the issue of an individual from the US.  The same processes apply.  Obviously it is in our interest and I would like to see a minimalisation of red tape in respect of professionals coming to this country as we need them.  As the traffic is often in the other direction, it is good to get some coming this way.  The time period allowed is four months.  That should be the case unless they have not provided the appropriate documentation which can hold up the process.  Clear information is provided on the Department's website but that is not to say that individuals do not run into difficulty from time to time.  It is an area that must be kept under active review because we should not do anything to obstruct suitably qualified people coming to the country to deliver care.  <\/p><p>Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh mentioned the recruitment embargo.  The reality is that the embargo has to stay in place but we said we would be much more flexible around it; we will be and have been in the past and will be more so next year.  However, we face a serious challenge - I do not want to get into that discussion - in the health budget next year.  There are 3,500 staff who must go.   Considering that there are 37,000 plus nurses in the Health Service Executive manpower, sadly nurses cannot escape, therefore, we have to go back to changing the model of care that I mentioned, that is, ensuring that the right patient is seen by the right person in the right place at the right time.  So often, that is not the case in the current system.  There are nurses looking after people that health care assistants could look after.  There are general practitioners looking after patients that nurses and physiotherapists should be looking after.  There are patients being looked after in hospitals that should be looked after in the community.  There are consultants looking after patients that others should be looking after.  A big job of work is being undertaken through the clinical programmes, the SDU.  That is ongoing and we continue to make progress.  Obviously we would like if the progress was faster but the reality is that one never gets to where one wants to as quickly as one would wish but that does not mean one should not continue to strive to do so and we certainly will.<\/p><p>The issue of herbalism and herbalists was mentioned.  Currently the product is regulated under the medicines legislation rather than the actual practitioner.  One could look at herbalism and traditional medicine.  That is a whole area that needs to be explored.  Just because I am a doctor does not mean I close my eyes to these issues.  My view is very simple, if it works, it works and as long as it can be proven to work and in repeated control trials to be seen to work, why not have it available to one's citizens.  There are other jurisdictions we can look to where they have got structured training in these areas and have degrees from universities that ensure that the individual who is practising is competent in the area.  We know this can be looked at but the most pressing issue for us, outside of those mentioned here, has to be counselling and psychotherapy.  Given the high rate of suicide in the country we have to ensure we have got the professionals suitably qualified to help us deal with the mental health requirements of our people.<\/p> <p>I thank all the Members for their contributions and support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100033#GG00400","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355240100,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355240100,"counter":169,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100035#JJ00300","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1355240100,"counter":170,"content":"<p>On Tuesday, 18 December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100035#JJ00400","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355240100,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 18 December 2012.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355240400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 2.45 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Credit Union Bill 2012 : Committee Stage","time":1355240700,"count":173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100037#NN00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355240700,"counter":174,"content":"<p>SECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355240700,"counter":175,"content":"<\/a> <p>Amendments Nos. 1, 164 to 166, inclusive, and 176 to 180, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

Specifically, these amendments must be enacted to permit the Central Bank to sign the International Organization of Securities Commissions multilateral memorandum of understanding, or MMOU.  This must be done by year end.  In light of the pressing end-of-year timeline for signing the MMOU, it has been necessary to effectively make these amendments part of this Bill.<\/p><p>The purpose of the MMOU is to allow the Central Bank to co-operate and share information with other regulators, including other securities commissions, around the world in accordance with international best practice. <\/p><p>The provisions being inserted into this Bill are currently part of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011, which is due to go to Committee Stage in the D\u00e1il in January.  The changes envisaged include: enacting section 53 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill, so that the Central Bank may use its powers on behalf of overseas regulators; enhancing and consolidating authorised officer provisions; and related provisions for guarding the Central Bank confidentiality regime.<\/p><p>Given that these amendments are not related to credit unions, it is necessary to amend the Short and Long Titles of this Bill to accommodate them.  I wish to emphasise that the expeditious passage of the Credit Union Bill through this House is to allow for \u20ac250 million to be contributed to the credit union fund by year end, as there is no scope in the 2013 figures for it to be done after that.  This money is essential for the restructuring process to get under way.  We have already discussed this matter on Second Stage.<\/p> <p>While the International Organization of Securities Commissions, IOSCO, requirements are urgent, they are not the cause of the accelerated timetable for the Bill.  I acknowledge that on Second Stage, Members asked what was the rush and the rush is to get the money in place, because the Government has made provision for it in 2012.  The end of 2012 is approaching and it is important that the money be put in place as part of the restructuring process.  In respect of this group of amendments, the Government simply is bringing them forward in order that this important aspect of the Central Bank's work also can be part and parcel of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100037#NN00500","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355241000,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355241000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 159 are related and may be discussed together, by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100038#OO00300","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355241000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 2:In page 5, subsection (2), line 30, to delete &#8220;sections 37 and 48(2)&#8221; and substitute the following:&#8220;sections 36, 37, 48(2) and 57(2), Part 5 and Schedules 2 to 5&#8221;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355241000,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I will speak on amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 159.  Given these provisions amend the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, it is also necessary to update the citation of the Central Bank Acts and these amendments provide for this update.  I might put some additional information on the record of the House in case there is any question about this.  The first of these changes, as set out in amendments Nos. 1 and 180, will amend the Short and Long Titles of this Bill to provide for the inclusion of this package of measures and hence the new Title to the Bill, namely, the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Bill.  The net impact is the name of the Bill is being changed from being the Credit Union Bill to the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Bill 2012, which I readily concede is a bit of a mouthful.<\/p><p>The Long Title is likewise amended to specify that the Central Bank will have revised powers in respect of co-operation with other regulators and will from henceforth have consolidated powers in respect of the appointment of authorised officers.  The International Organization of Securities Commissions, usually referred to as IOSCO, co-ordinates security regulators across the globe.  The great majority of IOSCO members already have acceded to the memorandum but amendments are required to enable the Central Bank of Ireland to sign it.  In these amendments, the Government is simply allowing the Central Bank to sign this international amendment in order that the powers that can be given to it are clear for all to see.<\/p><p>The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 proposes measures which meet all of these requirements and it was intended that the Central Bank of Ireland would be in a position to accede to the memorandum on the enactment of that Bill.  However, IOSCO members have agreed that it would issue a watch-list of those countries which had not yet signed the memorandum on 1 January 2013.  This change means that the enactment of the relevant legislation provisions now is a matter of some urgency.<\/p><p>As for what the amendments do, the new section 54 of the Central Bank Reform Act is a general provision enabling the Central Bank to exercise its various powers in support of third-country regulators.  It is important to note that the proposed power enables the Central Bank to share information with other regulators.  In making a decision to share information with other regulators, the Central Bank may take into account a number of factors, including whether the breach of law concerned also would be a breach of Irish law, as well as the seriousness of the issue and the public interest in general.  It also should be noted that the Central Bank can expect a financial contribution to defray the cost of the investigation by the bank, if it agrees to a request to investigate a matter on behalf of another regulator, unless European Union-related obligations are concerned.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 164 provides for changes to section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  It removes the obligation on the bank to report information pointing to the commission of an offence to other law enforcement authorities in the State where the information concerned is received from an overseas supervisor.  The reason for this is to allow the free flow of information between regulators without fear that the information shared could cause criminal prosecutions to fail as a result of the variations in the methods used to gather information in different jurisdictions.  The mandatory passing of information to those charged with prosecuting criminal offences in circumstances in which Irish rules of evidence might mean that any prosecution would be contaminated, clearly is not in the interest of justice for the individual or the integrity of the criminal justice system generally.<\/p> <p> The larger part of amendment No. 165 proposes to repeal the existing authorised officer powers under 20 different Acts and statutory instruments and replace them with a single authorised officer regime which the Central Bank may use to obtain information from all regulated financial service providers.  The current authorised officer regime varies across each sector, and important powers provided for in some circumstances are absent in others.  A key provision will allow for an authorised officer appointed by the Central Bank to require any person who might reasonably have information relevant to the investigation of a financial service issue to provide the information.  The substance of the amendments in group 2 is to provide for that and to tidy up the existing legislation by way of a number of consequential changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100038#OO00500","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355241600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355241600,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 3:\r\nIn page 5, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following subsection:\r\n&#8220;(3) The Central Bank Acts 1942 to 2011, sections 36, 37, 48(2) and 57(2), Part 5 (in so far as it amends any of those Acts), and Schedules 2 and 3 (in so far as they amend any of those Acts) may be cited together as the Central Bank Acts 1942 to 2012.&#8221;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355241600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355241600,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Section 1, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355241600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Sections 2 and 3 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355241600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>SECTION 4<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355241600,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 4 and 52 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100039#PP00700","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355241600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 4:\r\nIn page 6, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following subsections: &#8220;(2) Notwithstanding anything in the rules of a credit union, the board of directors may, by resolution passed during the transitional period, make such amendments of the rules of the credit union as may be consequential on the provisions of this Act.\r\n(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the transitional period is the period of one year from the commencement of this section.\r\n(4) Notwithstanding anything in section 14(4) of the Principal Act, after the expiry of one year from the commencement of this section, the Bank shall not be required to register any amendment of a credit union&#8217;s rules unless such consequential amendments of the registered rules as are mentioned in subsection (2) either&#8212;(a) have been made before the Bank receives the amendment; or\r\n(b) are to be effected by the amendment.&#8221;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355241600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>We are dealing with amendments Nos. 4 and 52.

Shared branching is an activity that operates primarily in the credit union system of the United States.  It was not considered by the Commission on Credit Unions and does not form part of the commission's final report.  Moreover, in the public consultation process shared branching was not a key issue in the submissions received from credit unions or other stakeholders, nor did it emerge from the survey returns from the credit unions.<\/p><p>In simple terms, shared branching would allow one credit union member to use the service of another credit union.  For this facility to work securely, it is important that certain procedures are put in place beforehand.  First, a settlement system is needed as a person could withdraw his or her savings several times from different credit unions if safeguards were not in place to prevent such a practice.  Second, an underwriting process is needed to establish proper assessment of ability to repay at the credit union issuing the loan on behalf of the member's home credit union.  It would also need to be made clear who would be held responsible should a loan go into arrears.  Would it be the member's credit union or the credit union which issued the loan?  Third, an accompanying prudential framework would be needed to ensure, for example, that proper liquidity management practices are in place to guard against large, unpredictable withdrawals at small credit unions which are connected to larger credit unions.  Furthermore, shared branching raises fundamental questions about the common bond, notwithstanding the commission's recommendations that the common bond remain unchanged. <\/p> <p>The fact that shared branching apparently operates successfully in other jurisdiction indicates that it is certainly worth considering.  I consider that it would be premature to enshrine shared branching in legislation in the absence of the supporting infrastructure and prudential framework developed in consultation with all the relevant credit union stakeholders and the Central Bank.  The Minister has written to the Credit Union Advisory Committee to ask it to examine this issue and to report back to him by the end of the second quarter of next year.  I think I also mentioned this on Second Stage.  The committee's report will involve an assessment of the current appetite for shared branching among credit unions and their members, an analysis of the framework requirements to support shared branching, an exploration of various alternatives and approaches drawing on international experience and best practice, and the recommendations of the Credit Union Advisory Committee, including any legislative changes required.  The report is to be an open process involving consultation with other credit union stakeholders, including credit union representatives and the Central Bank.  We do not propose to accept amendment No. 7, which has also been our position in the other House, but the Minister has asked for this report to be laid before him by the second quarter of next year.  If there is an appetite for a wider application of this model, which I know is used in other jurisdictions, we can consider it in due course, but it is not appropriate to do so in the context of the current legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100040#QQ01000","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355242500,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I do not think credit unions want to be a single bank or branches.

That was not a recommendation from the commission.  It recommended an aggressive form of shared services, which is already provided for in the Bill.  The Senators are confusing one with the other.<\/p><p>If there is an appetite for shared branching, which is the essence of the co-operative banking system in America and other countries, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, is open to that.

We are open to examining this, and I am not closing down debate on it.  The view of the Minister for Finance is that in asking that this matter be brought before him by the end of the first half of next year he demonstrates his intent to both Houses of the Oireachtas to look at this in a constructive way, if there is support for it.

The commission report notes that services may be shared in a number of ways, including the establishment of central credit unions, corporate credit unions, credit union service organisations - CUSOs, but we will just call them &quot;credit union service organisations&quot; - or local alliances.  Indeed, shared service arrangements are already in operation in the credit union sector, for example, the Credit Union Services Co-operative Limited or the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU's own payment services.  The commission recommends that the establishment of such shared service arrangements should be facilitated by legislation where necessary.<\/p><p>  The Government agrees that the sharing of services offers credit unions an opportunity to benefit from economies of scale and allows them to access expertise that they would not normally have the resources to engage.  The latter may become increasingly important, given the increasing complexity and running costs expected in a modernised regulatory framework and enhanced service offering.  The ILCU has accepted that there is no obstacle to establishing shared service arrangements at credit union level.<\/p><p>  Subsection (3)(<i>a<\/i>) of Senator Reilly's amendment No. 8 states:<ul>(<i>a<\/i>) clerical, professional and management services:<ul>(i) accounting services;<br>(ii) internal audits for credit unions;<\/ul><\/ul>It also refers to marketing and research services.

It is an opportunity for credit unions in their own facility to fund projects, whether it is a PPP with a local authority or somebody else, for which they may not be able to get funding.  There is another aspect that I would ask the Minister of State to consider.  While it may not be a PPP project it is important to remember that credit unions are disallowed from funding limited companies.  In regard to PPPs, it would be a good if a credit union from a county town was to fund a project within that town for which potentially the local authority or somebody else may be incapable of getting funding. There are many registered charitable organisations and community groups organised on the basis of a limited company that do superb work.  While not a PPP, they are organised in this manner as a limited company.  Credit unions are disallowed fund limited companies.  The best community organisation in the country may require funding, the merits of which may only be understood by the credit union in the local town, but because of the way the community organisation is organised, formed by guarantee and formed as a limited company, a credit union is disallowed from funding it.  I am not talking here about opening up credit unions to massive loans to limited companies.  This is an issue that needs to be considered specifically for community organisations that are organised in this manner.  It is something that would have a community gain as well as a benefit for the credit union.  It would be seen as acting not only in the greater good of the individual but in the greater good via a community organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100047#XX01100","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speech","time":1355244900,"counter":312,"content":"<p>It is a sensible Government amendment that follows on from the debate in the other House and Second Stage here and we will certainly support it.

It is often viewed exclusively as a problem for small rural credit unions but it is equally an issue in urban areas where there are many small credit unions.

Many of the people who have served in credit unions for a long number of years have brought invaluable experience and expertise to this area.

Issues arose in the D\u00e1il on the procedure for the suspension and removal of directors, in particular in terms of the director concerned being provided with written notification of the board oversight committee\u2019s reasons for taking action under the section.<\/p> <p>The Minister, on Committee and Report Stages in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, and when the issue was raised on Second Stage in the Seanad, indicated his willingness to re-examine the provisions.  This amendment reflects the changes necessary to address the concerns raised in both Houses.  It brings the procedure for removing a director at a special general meeting convened under this section into line with the procedure for the removal of a director from office by members of a credit union, as set out in section 56 of the 1997 Act, thereby ensuring greater procedural consistency.  Under this section, the board oversight committee can suspend a director where it considers that a member has taken any action or decision which is not in accordance with Part IV of the 1997 Act.  The board oversight committee is required to provide written notice to the director, setting out the reasons for its decision before either suspending the director or convening a special general meeting of the credit union to consider whether to remove the director. <\/p><p>Where a director is suspended by the board oversight committee under this section, the suspension takes effect immediately and if the director in question has not resigned within seven days of being suspended, the committee shall convene a special general meeting to review the suspension and consider whether to remove the director.  At a special general meeting convened in accordance with this section, the members may ratify or rescind the suspension or remove the director from office.  This amendment provides, in a similar manner to section 56 of the 1997 legislation, that a director is entitled to written notice of a special general meeting to be held under this section not less than 21 days in advance of the meeting.  The amendment also sets out the procedure for the director in question to make written representations in advance of a special general meeting and that the director has the right to be heard orally at such a meeting.<\/p><p>The Minister is confident that the amendment addresses the concerns raised by Members of both Houses on Second Stage.  A further amendment will be tabled on Report Stage to clarify that if the director resigns, the special general meeting must be held within seven days after the 21 day period of notice to be given to members.  Under the current wording, the special general meeting must be held within seven days of the decision, even though notification of the meeting must be given at least 21 days in advance.  <\/p><p>On the key issue of the suspension or removal of the board oversight committee, the Minister has attempted to create a degree of consistency with section 56 of the original 1997 Act to provide certainty and clarity on the rights of individuals.  Where the oversight committee takes this action, written notice will be given and the person in question will have a right to reply.  Further, within a timeframe set out in the amendment, a special general meeting will be held at which various options placed before members.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100054#EEE05100","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355247600,"counter":451,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355247600,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Section 23, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355247600,"counter":453,"content":"<p>SECTION 24<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355247600,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 78:\r\nIn page 36, line 43, after &#8220;Bank&#8221; to insert the following:&#8220;including regulations setting out the form and content of that statement&#8221;.This amendment clarifies that the requirements which the bank may prescribe under section 66C(1) relate to the form and content of the compliance statement to be provided to it by credit unions.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355247600,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355247600,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Section 24, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355247600,"counter":457,"content":"<p>SECTION 25<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355247600,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 79 to 86, inclusive, may be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100055#FFF00900","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355247600,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 79:\r\nIn page 37, between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following:&#8220;(ii) where the officer is the secretary, in writing to the board of directors and served on the chair,&#8221;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355247900,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 79 ensures the secretary acts at all times in a manner that is free from conflict.

There was much constructive debate in the D\u00e1il and on Second Stage in the Seanad about the eligibility for membership of the board oversight committee.  A number of amendments were proposed earlier relating to section 53(10) regarding changes to the exclusion from the board of directors.  These amendments are proposed to ensure consistency between the board and the board oversight committee.  The effect of these amendments reduces the exclusions that would apply to membership of the board oversight committee.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 97 allows volunteers of other credit unions to be on the board oversight committee of a credit union.  The Minister already flagged this amendment.  Amendment No. 108 removes the prohibition on family members of volunteers of the credit union becoming board oversight committee members.  Amendment No. 98 allows for a director of another credit union to become a board oversight committee member.  This is also something the Minister, Deputy Noonan, said he would concede.  An amendment to this section will be made on Report Stage to clarify that a member of the oversight committee of the credit union cannot also sit on the board of directors of the same credit unions; this is already provided for under section 15 but I will table an amendment to clarify this on Report Stage.  In error, amendment No. 98 provides that a director of the credit union be eligible also for membership of the board oversight committee of the same credit union.  I intend to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to correct this.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 106 makes a change to the exclusion of auditors from the board oversight committee.  This exclusion will now include a person employed or engaged by that auditor.  This is to guard against any conflicts of interest.  Amendment No. 111 deletes section 76N(4)(q) in line with the changes for exclusions from board membership.  Amendment No. 112 ensures that where a committee member falls under any exclusion provisions, that member should resign from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100057#HHH00600","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355248500,"counter":509,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355248500,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 98:\r\nIn page 52, to delete lines 41 and 42.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355248500,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355248500,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 99:\r\nIn page 52, line 43, to delete &#8220;(d) an employee of&#8221;

In some cases, credit unions have had restrictions and demands imposed upon them without real explanations or, more importantly, guidelines on how to remedy the situation.  Credit unions expect and require clarity concerning what they need to do to have restrictions eased or removed.  One credit union had a lending restriction communicated to it in writing.  A part of that restriction was a complete ban on commercial lending, but it was later alleviated verbally.  There is a great deal of confusion.  This is of little use to the credit union in question and is certainly no way for a professional regulator to conduct business.<\/p><p>  Simple issues such as communication, timeframes and so on could be easily addressed by way of a memorandum of understanding, which we are calling for in this amendment.

This issue was discussed in some detail on Committee Stage in the Lower House, when the Minister for Finance made it clear that he would be sticking with the Bill's current provisions.  The bank has already published a consultation protocol for credit unions, as recommended by the Commission on Credit Unions.  It is not appropriate to place the bank under a statutory obligation to enter into a memorandum of understanding.<\/p><p>The commission recommended that a consultation protocol should be in place between the Central Bank and credit unions.  This protocol has been developed following consultation between the Central Bank, the Minister, credit union representative bodies and the Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC.  The protocol was sent to all credit unions earlier last week and is being worked upon by all of the stakeholders, as requested under the commission's recommendation.<\/p> <p>The protocol sets out how the Central Bank proposes to engage with credit unions in any formal consultation process prior to the introduction of new regulations, which is important.  The protocol is in place and is fair in dealing with people.  The protocol states that the bank is committed to having clear, open and transparent engagement with stakeholders in fulfilling its financial regulation and supervisory objectives.<\/p><p>The bank commits to engage formally and informally with credit union representative bodies and relevant stakeholders, as well as ensuring it complies with any relevant legal obligations relating to consultation.  The bank will consult on new regulations that will have a significant impact on the business of credit unions.  As part of the consultation process, the bank will invite credit unions, their representative bodies and other stakeholders to make written submissions on new regulations that will be reviewed and considered before regulations are made.<\/p><p>It has been suggested that a broader memorandum of understanding be agreed between the Central Bank and credit unions.  I understand that one of the concerns driving this issue is an idea that the Central Bank should issue written directions.  The Bill provides for this, as well as for an appeals mechanism.  It is important to state that if people feel there is some unfairness in the way in which directions have been issued, there is an appeals mechanism which one could argue gives significant powers to the credit union sector if it is felt that a measure was being unfairly imposed.<\/p><p>I do not propose to follow the memorandum of understanding amendment and, as I stated earlier, it was not recommended by the commission.  If this issue was of significance to the commission in making its recommendations, it would have been flagged.  That was not the case.  We should be careful not to undermine the independence of the regulator.  We have all learned enough from the financial crisis to know that the Central Bank must be able to act within its own powers when required.

If that principle had not applied up until now, provision is being made for it now purely on the basis of ensuring that credit union members' deposits and shares are properly held.  One cannot have one without the other.  Liquidity and stress-testing are two sides of the one coin.  The Minister for Finance made it clear in his contributions in the other House that he does not want these provisions to be used as a hammer to crack over the heads of smaller credit unions which, by definition, scope and size, are in a different league to larger ones.  One cannot compare apples and oranges.  There is an argument of scale here.

Amendment No. 21 is designed to facilitate the processing of documents by the insolvency service and the Courts Service in regard to applications for the various debt resolution arrangements provided for in the Bill.  In developing the necessary systems for the insolvency service to operate the new debt relief notice, DRN, the debt settlement arrangement, DSA, and the personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, there is a significant effectiveness and efficiency requirement for the new processes to operate on a paperless basis to the maximum extent possible.  The various elements of each process should operate on an electronic completion and transmission basis.

This provision will facilitate an efficient deployment of staff and court time.  These provisions can be brought into operate by rule of court.  It is my intention to bring forward as soon as possible similar provision to facilitate electronic lodgement of documents or information in respect of a broad range of court proceedings.

Amendment No. 4 provides for definitions in regard to relevant pension arrangements for the new debt resolution processes in bankruptcy.  The definition is a prerequisite in regard to further amendments to the Bill providing that a pension pot will not be counted as an asset in the overall insolvency regime.  For example, in the debt relief notice process, a pension pot will not be counted against the asset exemption limit of &#8364;400, but payments which the debtor is entitled to receive but has not yet received will be regarded as income.  This amendment mirrors an amendment in the similar UK and Northern Ireland debt relief notice process to address a situation whereby small future pension arrangements push debtors over the asset exemption limit and prevent them from accessing this basic debt relief.<\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 25 and 28 are linked.  Amendment No. 25 provides for the exemption in regard to a pension pot.  However, this is subject to the provisions being inserted by amendment No. 28 which does not exempt income received or entitled to be received in the context of the income test in relation to a debt relief notice application.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 42 sets out how pension arrangements are to be treated in the context of debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements.  It provides that the DSA and PIA processes cannot require a debtor to hand over his or her pension pot or to draw down a pension early.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 72 inserts a new section in the Bill which will allow a creditor or a personal insolvency practitioner of a debtor in respect of whom a debt settlement arrangement is in force to make an application to the appropriate court for relief in accordance with this section where the creditor or the personal insolvency practitioner concerned considers that a debtor has made excessive contributions to a relevant pension arrangement.  The net excessive contributions to the debtor's pension must have been made within the three-year period prior to the issue of the protective certificate.  Subsection (3) provides that where the court finds that the debtor's pension contributions were excessive, it can direct such part of the contribution concerned, less any tax required to be deducted, to be paid by the person administering the relevant pension arrangement to the personal insolvency practitioner for distribution among creditors of the debtor.  It may make such other orders as the court deems appropriate, including an order as to the costs of the application.  Subsection (4) sets out matters that the court should have regard to in the consideration of this matter.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 117 is similar  to amendment No. 72.  The purpose of the amendment is to allow a creditor challenge a personal insolvency arrangement in a situation where the debtor may have made excessive pension contributions in the three years prior to the issue of the protective certificate with a view to putting funds out of reach of creditors.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 142<i>a <\/i>provides for the insertion of two new sections, new section 44A and new section 44B, into the Bankruptcy Act 1988.  The new section 44A provides that the future entitlement to payment under a relevant pension arrangement, perhaps better and more colloquially described as a pension pot, of a person adjudicated bankrupt will not vest in the official assignee in bankruptcy.  The section sets out the various conditions attached and lists the types of relevant pension arrangements accompanied by the section.  However, any income from a pension, either in payment or whether there is an entitlement to receive a payment, is not exempt and may be claimed by the official assignee or the trustee in bankruptcy.  This is a significant improvement in our bankruptcy law as it recognises the desirability of persons making contributions to provide for the future and not impose an excessive burden on the State.  This provision is similar to that in the UK to exempt pension pots from being ceased in a bankruptcy.<\/p><p>  Section 44B provides again that in a case where the bankrupt has made excessive contributions to his or her pension within the three years prior to being adjudicated bankrupt, the official assignee or the trustee in bankruptcy can apply to court for an order in relation to the pension for the purpose of ensuring the excessive contributions can be made available for distribution to creditors.  This mirrors similar provisions in regard to excessive contributions in the debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement processes.  This is an important counterbalance to the exemption allowed in the previous section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100064#RRR00850","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355252400,"counter":837,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355252400,"counter":838,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 5:\r\nIn page 12, line 17, to delete &quot;and apart&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355252400,"counter":839,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355252400,"counter":840,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 6:\r\nIn page 12, to delete lines 46 to 48.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355252400,"counter":841,"content":"<p>This amendment, in regard to section 2(2)(<i>b<\/i>) as currently drafted, refers to section 157 of the Corporation Tax Act 1976 for the interpretation of &quot;control&quot;.

Amendment No. 31 replaces the text inserted by Amendment No. 17 on Committee Stage and is to correctly refer to a &quot;permitted debt&quot; in subparagraph (iii).  It is recommended by Parliamentary Counsel. Amendment No. 38 is essentially a drafting amendment to remove the reference in section 46(l)(<i>a<\/i>)(iv) to guarantees in respect of the debtor's own debts which are not required in this context.

The essential change is in subsection (8) which makes it explicit that a permitted debt refers to an excludable debt where the creditor has consented to include it for consideration in the debt settlement arrangement.  The Parliamentary Counsel decided that the replacement of the entire section was the optimum approach.  Amendment No. 47 extends the provisions of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of section 54(2)(<i>e<\/i>) with new text which now provides that the schedule of debts and creditors should also contain any other information that may be prescribed.<\/p><p>  Amendment No.<b><\/b>73 is required for the avoidance of doubt.  I am advised by the Parliamentary Counsel that while the Bill now contains a definition in section 2 of &quot;excluded debt&quot;, clear provisions to the effect that an excluded debt cannot be included in a personal insolvency arrangement are still required.  This is similar the amendment made to the debt settlement arrangement.  Amendment No. 76 removes the requirement for the debtor to make a statutory declaration in support of his or her application for a personal insolvency arrangement and replaces it with a declaration in writing. Amendment No.<b><\/b>77 inserts a new subsection (5) and replicates in the personal insolvency arrangement the requirement in the debt relief notice and debt settlement arrangement that the proposal should also concern primarily debts which are in default for a period of more than six months prior to application.<\/p><p>  Amendment No.<b><\/b>78 is designed to further refine the new provision concerning the requirement for creditor consent for the inclusion of excludable debt in personal insolvency arrangement.

I note that CUDA has been in contact with the Department.  I would like to set out the logic for them and will then listen to the Minister's response.  It does them justice to table the amendments and to elicit the Minister's response.<\/p><p>  The repayments that debtors have entered into with their banks, which might be interest only, just serve the purpose of kicking the can down the road.  The substantial capital sum still remains to be repaid, which is a serious problem currently facing many individuals and families.  <\/p><p>  In trying to address this issue, the Credit Union Development Association has proposed an amendment to the Department that once the creditor enters this process all interest on debts, which are the subject matter of the arrangement, shall cease to accrue.  In addition, all creditors would be prevented from charging or earning interest.  <\/p><p>  Under section 98, a personal insolvency practitioner has the option to include in the arrangement, for the benefit of the secured creditor, that a debtor pays interest and only part capital under section 98a, or makes interest-only repayments under sections 98b and so on.<\/p><p>  CUDA is of the view that a mechanism is needed to address the fact that a substantial sum still remains unpaid.  While the practitioner has many options to choose from when drawing up a proposed arrangement, as a principle there should not be an option to allow the payment of interest during the arrangement, nor should interest accrue for the duration.  That is what both amendments have the effect of doing. <\/p> <p>CUDA is also concerned that credit unions, as small creditors, will not cope financially with the impact of the proposed legislation.  While they agree there is a need for legislation, they believe there is an imbalance between the rights of a large secured creditor and a small unsecured creditor, such as a credit union.  They argue that a situation should not arise whereby the capital of a credit union loan, which in effect is other people's money, that is, other members' money from that credit union, is sacrificed for the payment of interest on a secured debt to a large retail bank.  This is the logic or rationale.  I note the organisation has been in contact with the Department of Justice and Equality in this regard.

Basically, it provides a structure within which a debtor, with the assistance of a personal insolvency practitioner, can seek to enter into arrangements with creditors with regard to outstanding debts in circumstances in which a debtor clearly is unable to meet his or her liabilities.  The Senator seeks to exclude any individual from the process whose debts exceed \u20ac1 million.  I explained this is merely a mechanism to facilitate debt resolution and that there is no great advantage in this.  While the perception has been created that this provision helps people who are rich, the reality is that it is a facility whereby if one's debts run to \u20ac3 million, one is in far greater financial difficulty than if they run to \u20ac1 million.  This is a mechanism to ascertain whether arrangements can be entered into between debtors and creditors which, from the creditors' point of view, may, over a period of years, result in them recouping a greater share of the moneys due to them than they otherwise would recoup, were a debtor to go into bankruptcy.<\/p><p>Moreover, from the advantage perspective of the debtor, it creates the possibility that he or she may be allowed to continue to live in, own and occupy the family home of reasonable size, as opposed to a mansion, to use the phrase that suddenly has come into focus.  The Senator simply is seeking to exclude the possibility of this mechanism being used by a range of people with a view to pushing them into bankruptcy if they are insolvent, where such a bankruptcy would be to the detriment of both the debtor and creditor and could affect someone who, perhaps through no fault of his or her own, has incurred large business debts, perhaps because others have defaulted on paying him or her.  I do not see why such persons, if they are living in a modest home with their families, should be rendered homeless in a bankruptcy process.<\/p><p>I also have made the case previously that where someone is in serious debt and creditors are willing to enter into an arrangement with him or her, as the law presently stands, outside any structured process, that could happen regardless of the level of the debts.  There could be \u20ac15 million or \u20ac20 million worth of debts and if agreement can be reached between debtors and creditors, they can effectively resolve issues.  This provision allows the use of personal insolvency practitioners, the use of the personal insolvency arrangement structure and the possibility of orders being made by the court to copper-fasten or to approve an arrangement already approved by the insolvency service.  In the context of an item of progressive legislation designed to assist people in difficulties, I must state that I regard the Senator's amendment to be regressive and lacking in understanding of the process.  Consequently, for all those reasons, I am opposed the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100064#XXX00700","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1355252400,"counter":1083,"content":"<p>The Minister is being somewhat disingenuous with regard to the logic of this amendment.

That is the logic of this amendment and while I acknowledge the Minister has a point with regard to the \u20ac3 million ceiling, Sinn F\u00e9in's point is this should not be the norm.

provisions.  Section 99 of the Bill sets out a number of protections for secured creditors in a personal insolvency arrangement.  The claw-back mechanism provides that where secured debt has been written down under a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, and the property that is the subject of the security for that debt is subsequently disposed of by the debtor for an amount or at a value greater than the value attributed to the security for the purpose of the arrangement, the debtor may be obliged to pay an additional amount to the secured creditor.  In other words, some or all of the debt forgiveness that the debtor gained originally following a write-down of secured debt under a personal insolvency arrangement could, due to an increase in property values at the time of a future sale within a period not to exceed 20 years from the date of the PIA, be clawed back in favour of the secured creditor.<\/p><p>Subsection (9) is intended to ensure the claw-back only applies where the sale proceeds exceed the outstanding amount of the secured debt.

Bringing the Bill to a conclusion in the Seanad has been like running a marathon.  This is complex legislation and we have taken up a lot of time in the Chamber but it has been time well spent.  I must now return to the other House and explain why we did so much constructive business in the House and seek approval in the D\u00e1il for the amendments now included in the Bill.<\/p><p>This Bill is of substantial importance in the current economic climate where so many citizens find themselves in serious financial difficulty, many through no fault of their own.

I look forward to and hope the objectives of the Bill will be fulfilled and that it will facilitate individuals who genuinely cannot pay their debts and are in major financial difficulty entering into constructive and appropriate arrangements with creditors, including financial institutions.  It is vital that creditors have the fullest information available to them as to individuals' financial resources and income, assets and liabilities, and that they apply a degree of common sense and realism in any discussions that may take place with a view to addressing issues through the non-judicial debt settlement mechanism.  Reforms are also being made to bankruptcy which essentially prescribe a three-year period of bankruptcy, a substantial change in our law that creates the possibility for individuals who find themselves bankrupt to rebuild their lives within a reasonable period while extending to creditors the possibility during the period of bankruptcy of recouping what can be recouped by them to meet debts that are legally and appropriately due.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for the substantial work they undertook on this Bill and for the very interesting contributions made in this House.

The issue I raise is the proposed closure of the Reserve Defence Force facility in Clonmel.  As the Minister will be aware, Kickham Barracks closed on 29 March last, thus ending 350 years of a military presence in Clonmel.  The Third Cavalry Battalion of the Reserve Defence Force was attached to the barracks and following its closure, negotiations with the Minister resulted in a Reserve Defence Force headquarters being located in Clonmel.  As a result, 55 active members continued their weekly meetings and training at the location.<\/p><p>As a result of the Minister's recent announcement in that the Reserve Defence Force will be consolidated nationwide, the Third Cavalry Battalion will cease to function in Clonmel and move to Cork.  This decision has come as a great shock to the 55 members of the battalion who serve in the town.  This group, which include individuals from Carrick-on-Suir, where I live, Cahir, Fethard and surrounding areas, will have to travel to Cork for training every week if they wish to continue to serve their country.  Making this journey of approximately 70 miles in each direction will require the provision of at least two minibuses.  While I am aware of the cost of renting, operating and maintaining the building currently in use in Clonmel, the decision to close the facility and incur weekly transport costs to Cork does not make financial sense.  Moreover, the loss to Clonmel of this military unit, of which I was a member for many years, will also result in the loss of a military tradition as Reserve Defence Force will no longer be recruited in south County Tipperary.<\/p><p>Following his recent announcement, the Minister indicated the closed Kickham Barracks will be developed to provide a new Garda barracks and other services.  At this late stage, I appeal to him to give a commitment to serving members of the Reserve Defence Force in Clonmel that he will reserve a section of the new facility at the barracks to allow them to return to Clonmel.  Such a decision would save money in the long term and allow a 350 year old tradition in the town to continue.  It would also facilitate continued recruitment in the local area of young men and women who wish to serve in the Reserve Defence Force.  I ask the Minister to consider my proposal and look forward to his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100064#AAAA00800","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1355252400,"counter":1259,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Landy for raising this issue.  As he will be aware, a value for money review of the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, was recently completed and published.  The review was undertaken by a steering committee with an independent chair and had representatives from the Department of Defence, Defence Forces and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It found that the current effective strength of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve, at 4,500 personnel, was substantially less than half that of the 9,692 personnel for which the organisational structures were designed.  In addition, it found that the low uptake of training within the reserve raised serious questions about its current capacity.   For example, during 2011 the number of reservists who met paid and unpaid training targets required for the payment of a gratuity was 2,010 personnel.<\/p><p>The steering committee made a series of recommendations which were aimed at ensuring a viable Reserve Defence Force into the future.  In this context, a key recommendation was for a major reorganisation of the reserve, with organisational structures that were sustainable within the current resource envelope.  Arising from the reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force, within a strength level of 9,500 personnel, the number of Permanent Defence Force personnel available to support the Army Reserve in a full-time capacity is being reduced to 48.  A cadre of a further nine Permanent Defence Force personnel is assigned to support the Naval Service Reserve.<\/p><p>The steering committee recommended an Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve based on a total strength ceiling of 4,000 personnel, 3,800 of whom would be Army Reserve and 200 of whom Naval Service Reserve personnel.  It recommended the retention of a country-wide geographic spread with units in existing Permanent Defence Force installations and 16 locations outside these installations.<\/p> <p>I accepted these recommendations and directed that proposals for new organisational structures be prepared.  The chief of staff and Secretary General of my Department submitted a joint report which set out detailed re-organisation proposals, including unit structures and the location of reserve units.  Their recommendation was based on a single force concept which differs from the current model of reserve organisation.  Army units will have permanent and reserve elements rather than a parallel reserve structure as at present.<\/p><p>This approach offers significant advantages in terms of accessing equipment and training.  Under this organisational model, the only Army reserve elements outside Permanent Defence Force installations will be reserve infantry companies.  All other Army reserve combat support and combat service support elements will be co-located with their PDF counterparts in PDF installations.  This will be in Cork in the case of 1 Brigade.    Accordingly, it is no longer feasible to retain reserve cavalry or medical elements in Clonmel.  The training and support of reserve elements of defence force units located in PDF installations will be undertaken by the PDF element of those units.  The 16 reserve infantry companies outside PDF installations will have additional support from 16 teams of full time PDF personnel.  <\/p><p>The Senator will appreciate that the consolidation of existing reserve into a small number of full strength units means it is not possible to retain all existing locations.  Clonmel was not selected as a location for one of these 16 infantry companies which are distributed throughout the country.  I emphasise that this is not a negative reflection on the quality of participation of the current reservists in Clonmel but reflects the reality that all locations cannot be retained.<\/p><p>All members of the reserve will be afforded the opportunity to apply for positions within the new organisational structure, having regard to their particular needs.  The closest reserve infantry companies to Clonmel will be based in Waterford, Kilkenny and Templemore.  Personnel will be able to avail of retraining should this be required.  The overall travel costs of the new reserve units will not be known for some time but I can confirm that no increase in the overarching reserve budget is anticipated or planned.  I am satisfied that given a reduction in direct expenditure on the reserve of \u20ac11 million in 2013, the new reserve will be significantly more cost-effective than the existing organisation.  <\/p><p>Finally, I emphasise that the contribution and commitment of each member of the reserve is valued and appreciated.  I sincerely hope all members of the Reserve Defence Force will continue to serve within the new organisation.  Unfortunately, I cannot accede to the request made by the Senator that we preserve the reserve in Clonmel or that Clonmel remain a location for reserve training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100064#AAAA00900","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355252400,"counter":1261,"content":"<p>The Minister is proposing to provide finance for the development of the old Army barracks into a new Garda unit.

In respect of the issue the Senator raised relating to Cork, I emphasise that all reservists will be invited to apply for positions within the new organisational structure.  They must decide based on their particular circumstances as to which units best serve their needs.  This can and may include transferring from their current corps such as cavalry to an alternative such as infantry.  Every effort will be made to facilitate reservists with their choice, however, this may not be feasible if units are over-subscribed.  As this process unfolds, there will be a clearer picture as to the locations which reservists wish to relocate to.  It is important to state that military authorities have informed that they do not envisage transporting reservists from Clonmel to Cork or other locations.<\/p><p>I hope members of the Reserve Defence Force, particularly active members who are doing the community a service and are committed to and very much enjoy their involvement and engagement in the reserve, will show the flexibility and understanding that is necessary in the circumstances that now pertain.  In the context of the reserve, we must ensure that it has a capability, that members of the reserve participate in the minimum training and that the reserve re-adjusts itself to the very substantial and dramatic changes made in the Permanent Defence Force where we have moved from a three-brigade to a two-brigade structure.  I have an obligation in current circumstances as Minister for Justice, Defence and Equality to ensure that the re-organisation of the Permanent Defence Force is reflected in an appropriate re-organisation of the Reserve Defence Force in the context of ensuring the public gets value for money and that we do not unduly waste resources.  In addition, the advantage of the new arrangements is that there will be greater connectivity between the Permanent Defence Force and the reserve, as opposed to a reserve operating to a great extent as a separate organisation save for the PDF cadre that was available to assist it in its operations and training.<\/p><p>I hope the reforms will be welcomed by the members of the reserve insofar as they will have a changing and, I hope, more relevant role and a greater engagement with the PDF in general.  I also hope that those members of the reserve who have been engaged and active will continue to do so.  I am also anxious to ensure that, in the context of the reserve, we have a real strength as opposed to a nominal one.  I have concerns that, as I pointed out in 2011, only 2,010 of the 4,500 members of the reserve fully participated in the minimum seven days training that is prescribed to maintain some degree of capability within the reserve.  I am sure the reservists in Clonmel are disappointed that this location has not been retained.  We will over a period of months be working through the implementation of the reforms, which will not be implemented overnight.  A consultative process is taking place. I wish all the members in Clonmel well and thank them for their service so far.  I hope those members in Clonmel who are committed to and actively participating in the reserve can re-adjust to maintain their involvement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100064#BBBB00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wastewater Treatment Systems","time":1355252400,"count":1263,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100064#BBBB00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1355252400,"counter":1264,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the House and thank him for taking this matter on the Adjournment.

I made regulations in June setting out the procedures for householders to register details of their treatment systems with their water services authorities.  The Local Government Management Agency developed an online registration facility, on a shared service basis for the 34 county and city councils, and the agency has also been tasked with managing a central bureau to process written applications accompanied by registration fees.  Registration facilities have been available from 26 June 2012.  In keeping with a previous commitment, I set the registration fee at \u20ac5 for the first three months of the registration period, up to 28 September this year, and the fee payable since that date is \u20ac50.  The registration fees are intended to cover the costs to the water services authorities of administering the registers and managing the risk-based inspection system which will be implemented in 2013.<\/p><p>As of 10 December 2012, applications in respect of the on-site wastewater treatment systems of 241,000 owners, who have registered online, by post or in person at their local authority offices, have been processed.  I understand that approximately a further 50,000 owners have submitted registration applications which have yet to be processed by the bureau operated by the Local Government Management Agency.  This means that more than 290,000 owners have registered their systems.  This compares with the almost 500,000 houses that are served by septic tanks or other on-site treatment systems that were recorded in Census 2011.  Householders who have not yet registered have until 1 February 2013 to register their system.  I would encourage each of them to register on time to ensure they are in compliance with the law.  Registration can be done online, by post or at local authority offices.<\/p><p>I am very aware of the concerns that have been expressed and raised by Senator Higgins that some householders are concerned they may incur significant expense in repairing or upgrading their systems if they fail an inspection.  I have stated on a number of occasions that I am prepared to consider all possible options to provide financial support to those householders whose wastewater treatment systems are deemed, following inspection under the new legislation, to require substantial remediation or upgrading.  The provision of any financial support will have regard to the overall budgetary situation and to the financial position of the individual householders concerned.  If we are introducing any financial support at some stage in the future, this support would be targeted as a last resort to people on low incomes who have been unable, due to their means, to facilitate a major improvement of their wastewater treatment system.<\/p><p>I remind the House that this legislation was introduced to ensure compliance with a European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland.  It is important the legislation is fully implemented not just to comply with the court ruling but also to protect our very valuable water resources.  Senator Higgins is correct to point out the importance of good quality water to householders, the agriculture and food industry and businesses generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100064#CCCC00100","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1355252400,"counter":1266,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for outlining the situation.

This is the solution that was found in Cavan.  In 2004, Cavan County Council quite correctly identified that it had a very serious problem with pollution of its waterways and lakes.  Some of it was due to difficulties with groundwater arising from leaks from septic tanks.  The regulations that were enforced by Cavan County Council in 2004 showed that approximately 11% of the wastewater treatment systems failed following an inspection.  I do not anticipate that there will be as many wastewater treatment systems as in Cavan County Council, but I accept there will be exceptional cases where, through nobody's fault, a substantial sum of money will have to be spent on remediation works.  I am particularly conscious of that for low income families and people on social welfare.  The most important matter as far as we are concerned is that people will register by 1 February 2013.  If a person does not register, they will certainly not be considered for any grant assistance.

I would appreciate a comment or response from the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn, on the case of a young ten year old boy whose parents have withdrawn him from school due to their concerns about him.  I sent the details to the Minister for Education and Skills a few weeks ago and I hope he provided them to the Minister of State, Deputy Perry.  I understand they are also under investigation by the Garda.<\/p><p>The little boy has multiple and significant special needs.  He has been diagnosed with an intellectual disability, Down's syndrome, arthritis, Down's syndrome atrophy, sleep apnoea and hearing loss.  He also has a cardiac condition.  Unfortunately, this ten year old boy has been out of school since last April, due to the concerns I outlined to the Minister.  Significantly, it must be taken into consideration that the boy is non-verbal, which raises huge communication issues.  Nobody knows a child better than the child's mother, and his mother reported that the child had become very withdrawn and unhappy at the school he was attending.  Since she removed him his general health and overall mood have greatly improved.<\/p><p>His parents are extremely anxious that he return to full-time education.  I have met the little boy and his parents.  I concur with them that he needs to be in education.  However, they have genuine concerns about the school at which he is currently enrolled.  They did not make the decision to remove him lightly.  Indeed, they only did so only after a series of incidents over a two-year period.  The boy is on a waiting list for two other special schools but there is no guarantee that a place will become available for him.  In the interim, the parents applied for the home tuition grant to ensure he could continue his education.  Unfortunately, this has recently been refused and the child has not received formal education for the past eight months.  The home tuition grant for a child with special needs is granted only where a child is waiting to be placed in a suitable placement.  The reason given for the refusal was that the child still has a place available to him in the school he was attending.  The parents believe this is not in the best interests of the child and argue that a placement in a suitable school is not available at present.  They believe there should be a review of this decision.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to address the situation in order that this young boy can return to formal education as a matter of priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100064#CCCC00400","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1355252400,"counter":1270,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and for giving me the opportunity, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn, who regrets he cannot be present, to outline the current position regarding this case.<\/p><p>  The child in question is enrolled in a special school.  This school has a staffing of an administrative principal, 14 class teachers and 27 special needs assistants to cater for the 99 pupils enrolled.  This is an overall staff to pupil ratio of one staff member per 2.4 pupils in the school.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has advised the Department of Education and Skills that it considers this level of staffing sufficient to meet the special educational and care needs of all the pupils enrolled in the school, which includes the child in question.<\/p><p>  In October 2012, an application for home tuition for the child was submitted to the Department of Education and Skills under section 2(<i>b<\/i>) of the scheme, that is, children with special educational needs who are awaiting an educational placement.<\/p> <p>Eligibility for tuition in this regard is determined in consultation with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO.  The SENO in question verified that a placement remained available in the special school in which the child is currently enrolled.  Consequently, the application was refused, as funding for home provision arises only where a place is not available.<\/p><p>The Department operates another home tuition scheme where the child does not have a school place, is without the offer of a school place and on whose behalf a school place is being actively sought or a section 29 appeal is being taken.  This home tuition scheme is an interim measure pending the offer of a school placement.  I understand that an application for home tuition was again refused because a school placement was available.<\/p><p>The National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, subsequently appealed the Department's decision on home tuition on behalf of this child's parents.  The appeal was rejected on the same grounds, namely, that the child remained on the roll of the school in question and a placement was available for him there, as a consequence of which the home tuition scheme could not apply to him.<\/p><p>Regarding the role of the NCSE in these matters, the position is that there is no formal requirement for continued NCSE involvement once a placement is available for a child.  In this case, however, the SENO has been advised that the boy's parents might seek assistance regarding an alternative placing and the Department of Education and Skills is happy for the SENO to provide support in respect of any option they are considering.<\/p><p>The NEWB has a particular role in securing a return to school of a child who has been withdrawn regardless of whether a special educational need exists.  I understand that the NEWB has been assisting the parents in attempting to secure an alternative school placement for their child.<\/p><p>The Senator referred to parental concerns and I fully respect the fact that this is a sensitive case.  I should clarify that, under the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school and with employing school staff.  Accordingly, whereas the Department of Education and Skills provides funding and policy direction for schools, it does not have any power to instruct schools to follow a particular course of action regarding individual complaints.<\/p><p>If a parent or guardian is still unsatisfied after having brought a complaint to the attention of a school's board of management, he or she may write to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, which may independently investigate complaints relating to the administrative actions or inactions of a school recognised by the Department of Education and Skills, provided that the parent has fully followed the school's complaints procedures.  The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the actions of a school have or may have adversely affected the child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100064#CCCC00500","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355252400,"counter":1272,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, always seems to take those Adjournment debates where I am not happy with the response.

Amendment No. 4 provides for definitions in regard to relevant pension arrangements for the new debt resolution processes in bankruptcy.  The definition is a prerequisite in regard to further amendments to the Bill providing that a pension pot will not be counted as an asset in the overall insolvency regime.  For example, in the debt relief notice process, a pension pot will not be counted against the asset exemption limit of &#8364;400, but payments which the debtor is entitled to receive but has not yet received will be regarded as income.  This amendment mirrors an amendment in the similar UK and Northern Ireland debt relief notice process to address a situation whereby small future pension arrangements push debtors over the asset exemption limit and prevent them from accessing this basic debt relief.<\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 25 and 28 are linked.  Amendment No. 25 provides for the exemption in regard to a pension pot.  However, this is subject to the provisions being inserted by amendment No. 28 which does not exempt income received or entitled to be received in the context of the income test in relation to a debt relief notice application.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 42 sets out how pension arrangements are to be treated in the context of debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements.  It provides that the DSA and PIA processes cannot require a debtor to hand over his or her pension pot or to draw down a pension early.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 72 inserts a new section in the Bill which will allow a creditor or a personal insolvency practitioner of a debtor in respect of whom a debt settlement arrangement is in force to make an application to the appropriate court for relief in accordance with this section where the creditor or the personal insolvency practitioner concerned considers that a debtor has made excessive contributions to a relevant pension arrangement.  The net excessive contributions to the debtor's pension must have been made within the three-year period prior to the issue of the protective certificate.  Subsection (3) provides that where the court finds that the debtor's pension contributions were excessive, it can direct such part of the contribution concerned, less any tax required to be deducted, to be paid by the person administering the relevant pension arrangement to the personal insolvency practitioner for distribution among creditors of the debtor.  It may make such other orders as the court deems appropriate, including an order as to the costs of the application.  Subsection (4) sets out matters that the court should have regard to in the consideration of this matter.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 117 is similar  to amendment No. 72.  The purpose of the amendment is to allow a creditor challenge a personal insolvency arrangement in a situation where the debtor may have made excessive pension contributions in the three years prior to the issue of the protective certificate with a view to putting funds out of reach of creditors.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 142<i>a <\/i>provides for the insertion of two new sections, new section 44A and new section 44B, into the Bankruptcy Act 1988.  The new section 44A provides that the future entitlement to payment under a relevant pension arrangement, perhaps better and more colloquially described as a pension pot, of a person adjudicated bankrupt will not vest in the official assignee in bankruptcy.  The section sets out the various conditions attached and lists the types of relevant pension arrangements accompanied by the section.  However, any income from a pension, either in payment or whether there is an entitlement to receive a payment, is not exempt and may be claimed by the official assignee or the trustee in bankruptcy.  This is a significant improvement in our bankruptcy law as it recognises the desirability of persons making contributions to provide for the future and not impose an excessive burden on the State.  This provision is similar to that in the UK to exempt pension pots from being ceased in a bankruptcy.<\/p><p>  Section 44B provides again that in a case where the bankrupt has made excessive contributions to his or her pension within the three years prior to being adjudicated bankrupt, the official assignee or the trustee in bankruptcy can apply to court for an order in relation to the pension for the purpose of ensuring the excessive contributions can be made available for distribution to creditors.  This mirrors similar provisions in regard to excessive contributions in the debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement processes.  This is an important counterbalance to the exemption allowed in the previous section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100066#RRR00850","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355253600,"counter":1301,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355253600,"counter":1302,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 5:\r\nIn page 12, line 17, to delete &quot;and apart&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355253600,"counter":1303,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355253600,"counter":1304,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 6:\r\nIn page 12, to delete lines 46 to 48.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355253600,"counter":1305,"content":"<p>This amendment, in regard to section 2(2)(<i>b<\/i>) as currently drafted, refers to section 157 of the Corporation Tax Act 1976 for the interpretation of &quot;control&quot;.

The proposed new text retains the requirement for the insolvency service to submit its business plans to the Minister for approval every year.  However, it removes the current requirement in the Bill for the business plans to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Having reviewed the matter, I believe this onerous requirement is not necessary.  The proposed amendment brings the insolvency service more in line with the governance provisions of other similar entities.  It does not, however, diminish the accountability provisions of the service to the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 17 is a technical drafting amendment.

Amendment No. 18 proposes the insertion of a new subsection (8) and is linked to the previous amendment to subsection (6).  The purpose of section 16 is to make provision for the preparation of reports by the insolvency service to the Minister.  The provision, as currently drafted, permits the preparation of reports on a number of matters and is not limited to the preparation of annual reports.  The current construction would have the effect that every single report prepared by the insolvency service, even on very minor matters, would be required to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  New subsection (8) seeks to improve on the current text by giving the Minister the discretion to decide whether reports prepared by the insolvency service under the provisions of subsection (3) are to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 19 is a technical drafting amendment required to improve the presentation of the text.

Clearly if there is a business plan is presented, the funding for the insolvency service would be contained in the Estimates of expenditure.  For example there is provision in the 2013 Estimates for the insolvency service.  There is a general provision in the legislation whereby the insolvency service makes an annual report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality may invite the director of the service to appear before it, if it wishes.  Obviously members of the committee would be able to raise questions about the business plan with the director of the service.<\/p><p>As originally drafted the director would have been peppering the Houses of the Oireachtas with a range of things to no particular benefit or advantage.  We have aligned the position of the insolvency service to that of other similar agencies.  It does not diminish accountability of the director to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, nor does it diminish the obligation to present the annual report.  There is little purpose that minor issues that are reported to the Minister must also be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.

Amendment No. 31 replaces the text inserted by Amendment No. 17 on Committee Stage and is to correctly refer to a &quot;permitted debt&quot; in subparagraph (iii).  It is recommended by Parliamentary Counsel. Amendment No. 38 is essentially a drafting amendment to remove the reference in section 46(l)(<i>a<\/i>)(iv) to guarantees in respect of the debtor's own debts which are not required in this context.

The essential change is in subsection (8) which makes it explicit that a permitted debt refers to an excludable debt where the creditor has consented to include it for consideration in the debt settlement arrangement.  The Parliamentary Counsel decided that the replacement of the entire section was the optimum approach.  Amendment No. 47 extends the provisions of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of section 54(2)(<i>e<\/i>) with new text which now provides that the schedule of debts and creditors should also contain any other information that may be prescribed.<\/p><p>  Amendment No.<b><\/b>73 is required for the avoidance of doubt.  I am advised by the Parliamentary Counsel that while the Bill now contains a definition in section 2 of &quot;excluded debt&quot;, clear provisions to the effect that an excluded debt cannot be included in a personal insolvency arrangement are still required.  This is similar the amendment made to the debt settlement arrangement.  Amendment No. 76 removes the requirement for the debtor to make a statutory declaration in support of his or her application for a personal insolvency arrangement and replaces it with a declaration in writing.

I note that CUDA has been in contact with the Department.  I would like to set out the logic for them and will then listen to the Minister's response.  It does them justice to table the amendments and to elicit the Minister's response.<\/p><p>  The repayments that debtors have entered into with their banks, which might be interest only, just serve the purpose of kicking the can down the road.  The substantial capital sum still remains to be repaid, which is a serious problem currently facing many individuals and families.  <\/p><p>  In trying to address this issue, the Credit Union Development Association has proposed an amendment to the Department that once the creditor enters this process all interest on debts, which are the subject matter of the arrangement, shall cease to accrue.  In addition, all creditors would be prevented from charging or earning interest.  <\/p><p>  Under section 98, a personal insolvency practitioner has the option to include in the arrangement, for the benefit of the secured creditor, that a debtor pays interest and only part capital under section 98a, or makes interest-only repayments under sections 98b and so on.<\/p><p>  CUDA is of the view that a mechanism is needed to address the fact that a substantial sum still remains unpaid.  While the practitioner has many options to choose from when drawing up a proposed arrangement, as a principle there should not be an option to allow the payment of interest during the arrangement, nor should interest accrue for the duration.  That is what both amendments have the effect of doing. <\/p> <p>CUDA is also concerned that credit unions, as small creditors, will not cope financially with the impact of the proposed legislation.  While they agree there is a need for legislation, they believe there is an imbalance between the rights of a large secured creditor and a small unsecured creditor, such as a credit union.  They argue that a situation should not arise whereby the capital of a credit union loan, which in effect is other people's money, that is, other members' money from that credit union, is sacrificed for the payment of interest on a secured debt to a large retail bank.  This is the logic or rationale.  I note the organisation has been in contact with the Department of Justice and Equality in this regard.  While I am not privy to the response it received, I thought I should do it justice by tabling the amendments, listening to the Minister's response and deciding how to deal with the amendments thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100071#WWW05100","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355257200,"counter":1541,"content":"<p>Is there a seconder for the amendment?

Basically, it provides a structure within which a debtor, with the assistance of a personal insolvency practitioner, can seek to enter into arrangements with creditors with regard to outstanding debts in circumstances in which a debtor clearly is unable to meet his or her liabilities.  The Senator seeks to exclude any individual from the process whose debts exceed \u20ac1 million.  I explained this is merely a mechanism to facilitate debt resolution and that there is no great advantage in this.  While the perception has been created that this provision helps people who are rich, the reality is that it is a facility whereby if one's debts run to \u20ac3 million, one is in far greater financial difficulty than if they run to \u20ac1 million.  This is a mechanism to ascertain whether arrangements can be entered into between debtors and creditors which, from the creditors' point of view, may, over a period of years, result in them recouping a greater share of the moneys due to them than they otherwise would recoup, were a debtor to go into bankruptcy.<\/p><p>Moreover, from the advantage perspective of the debtor, it creates the possibility that he or she may be allowed to continue to live in, own and occupy the family home of reasonable size, as opposed to a mansion, to use the phrase that suddenly has come into focus.  The Senator simply is seeking to exclude the possibility of this mechanism being used by a range of people with a view to pushing them into bankruptcy if they are insolvent, where such a bankruptcy would be to the detriment of both the debtor and creditor and could affect someone who, perhaps through no fault of his or her own, has incurred large business debts, perhaps because others have defaulted on paying him or her.  I do not see why such persons, if they are living in a modest home with their families, should be rendered homeless in a bankruptcy process.<\/p><p>I also have made the case previously that where someone is in serious debt and creditors are willing to enter into an arrangement with him or her, as the law presently stands, outside any structured process, that could happen regardless of the level of the debts.  There could be \u20ac15 million or \u20ac20 million worth of debts and if agreement can be reached between debtors and creditors, they can effectively resolve issues.  This provision allows the use of personal insolvency practitioners, the use of the personal insolvency arrangement structure and the possibility of orders being made by the court to copper-fasten or to approve an arrangement already approved by the insolvency service.  In the context of an item of progressive legislation designed to assist people in difficulties, I must state that I regard the Senator's amendment to be regressive and lacking in understanding of the process.  Consequently, for all those reasons, I am opposed the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100072#XXX00700","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1355257200,"counter":1547,"content":"<p>The Minister is being somewhat disingenuous with regard to the logic of this amendment.

That is the logic of this amendment and while I acknowledge the Minister has a point with regard to the \u20ac3 million ceiling, Sinn F\u00e9in's point is this should not be the norm.

fully discharge the amount secured by the security (or such later date as may be specified for so doing in the Personal Insolvency Arrangement) and does so discharge his or her indebtedness, whichever first occurs.(12) Unless otherwise provided for under the terms of the Personal Insolvency Arrangement, where a property in respect of which subsection (3) applies is the subject of security held by more than one secured creditor&#8212;(a) any additional amounts payable by virtue of this section to the secured creditors shall be paid in order of the priority of the security held by each secured creditor, and\r\n(b) if the security held by a secured creditor is not ranked first in priority, the obligation to pay an additional amount to that creditor arising by virtue of this section shall

additional amount calculated in accordance with subsection (4).(13) For the purposes of subsection (3)&#8212;(a) without prejudice to the generality of that subsection, a disposal by a debtor of property the subject of security held by a secured creditor shall include the voluntary grant by the debtor of security over that property to any person other than that secured creditor, including any such grant of security in connection with what is commonly known as a refinancing of the existing secured debt, and\r\n(b) a debtor shall not be considered to dispose of property the subject of security held by a secured creditor where the debtor leases or licenses the property to any person for a term of less than 20 years.&#8221;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355257200,"counter":1567,"content":"<p>This amendment provides for the replacement of the current section 99 with revised text that seeks to simplify the provisions.  Section 99 of the Bill sets out a number of protections for secured creditors in a personal insolvency arrangement.  The claw-back mechanism provides that where secured debt has been written down under a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, and the property that is the subject of the security for that debt is subsequently disposed of by the debtor for an amount or at a value greater than the value attributed to the security for the purpose of the arrangement, the debtor may be obliged to pay an additional amount to the secured creditor.  In other words, some or all of the debt forgiveness that the debtor gained originally following a write-down of secured debt under a personal insolvency arrangement could, due to an increase in property values at the time of a future sale within a period not to exceed 20 years from the date of the PIA, be clawed back in favour of the secured creditor.<\/p><p>Subsection (9) is intended to ensure the claw-back only applies where the sale proceeds exceed the outstanding amount of the secured debt.  As mentioned earlier, the claw-back is intended to prevent a debtor gaining a windfall at the expense of a secured creditor.  However, no such windfall arises for the debtor in the case of what is known as a short sale, that is, where the sale proceeds of the property subject to the security are not sufficient to discharge the outstanding secured debt.  The main purpose of the proposed replacement of section 99 with a new text is to improve the clarity of the provisions regarding the claw-back mechanism and to provide for situations where there is more than one secured creditor in respect of the same property.<\/p> <p>I propose to withdraw amendments Nos. 85 to 97 which have been incorporated into the replacement section 99 that is proposed to be inserted by amendment No. 84<i>b<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100072#XXX02800","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355257800,"counter":1569,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355257800,"counter":1570,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 85 to 97, inclusive, not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355257800,"counter":1571,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 97a: \r\nIn page 93, to delete lines 45 to 49, to delete page 94 and in page 95, to delete lines 1 to 11 and substitute the following: \r\n101.&#8212;(1) Subject to the provisions of this section the value of security in respect of secured debt for the purposes of this Chapter shall be the market value of the security determined by agreement between the personal insolvency practitioner, the debtor and the relevant secured creditor.\r\n(2) Where the personal insolvency practitioner does not accept a secured creditor&#8217;s estimate of the value, if any, of the security furnished by the secured creditor under section 98, the debtor, the personal insolvency practitioner and the secured creditor shall in good faith endeavour to agree the market value for the security having regard to any matter relevant to the valuation of security, including the matters specified in subsection (5).\r\n(3) In the absence of agreement as to the value of the security, the personal insolvency practitioner, the debtor and the relevant secured creditor shall appoint an appropriate independent expert to determine the market value for the security having regard to any matter relevant to the valuation of security, including the matters specified in subsection (5).\r\n(4) Where the personal insolvency practitioner, the debtor and the secured creditor are unable to agree as to the independent expert to be appointed under subsection (3) the issue may be referred by any of them to the Insolvency Service which shall appoint such independent expert as it considers appropriate to determine the market value of the security concerned having regard to any matter relevant to the valuation of security, including the matters specified in subsection (5), and the valuation carried out by such expert shall be binding on the personal insolvency practitioner, the debtor and the secured creditor concerned.\r\n(5) The matters referred to in subsections (2) to (4) as the matters specified in subsection (5) are:(a) the type of property the subject of the security;\r\n(b) the priority of the security;\r\n(c) the costs of disposing of the property the subject of the security;\r\n(d) the price at which similar property to that which is the subject of the security has been sold within the 12 months prior to the issue of the protective certificate;\r\n(e) the date of the most recent valuation or transaction with respect to the property the subject of the security and the value attributed to the property in respect of that valuation or transaction;\r\n(f) the value attributed to the property the subject of the security in the debtor&#8217;s accounting records (if any);

Reforms are also being made to bankruptcy which essentially prescribe a three-year period of bankruptcy, a substantial change in our law that creates the possibility for individuals who find themselves bankrupt to rebuild their lives within a reasonable period while extending to creditors the possibility during the period of bankruptcy of recouping what can be recouped by them to meet debts that are legally and appropriately due.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for the substantial work they undertook on this Bill and for the very interesting contributions made in this House.

The issue I raise is the proposed closure of the Reserve Defence Force facility in Clonmel.  As the Minister will be aware, Kickham Barracks closed on 29 March last, thus ending 350 years of a military presence in Clonmel.  The Third Cavalry Battalion of the Reserve Defence Force was attached to the barracks and following its closure, negotiations with the Minister resulted in a Reserve Defence Force headquarters being located in Clonmel.  As a result, 55 active members continued their weekly meetings and training at the location.<\/p><p>As a result of the Minister's recent announcement in that the Reserve Defence Force will be consolidated nationwide, the Third Cavalry Battalion will cease to function in Clonmel and move to Cork.  This decision has come as a great shock to the 55 members of the battalion who serve in the town.  This group, which include individuals from Carrick-on-Suir, where I live, Cahir, Fethard and surrounding areas, will have to travel to Cork for training every week if they wish to continue to serve their country.  Making this journey of approximately 70 miles in each direction will require the provision of at least two minibuses.  While I am aware of the cost of renting, operating and maintaining the building currently in use in Clonmel, the decision to close the facility and incur weekly transport costs to Cork does not make financial sense.  Moreover, the loss to Clonmel of this military unit, of which I was a member for many years, will also result in the loss of a military tradition as Reserve Defence Force will no longer be recruited in south County Tipperary.<\/p><p>Following his recent announcement, the Minister indicated the closed Kickham Barracks will be developed to provide a new Garda barracks and other services.  At this late stage, I appeal to him to give a commitment to serving members of the Reserve Defence Force in Clonmel that he will reserve a section of the new facility at the barracks to allow them to return to Clonmel.  Such a decision would save money in the long term and allow a 350 year old tradition in the town to continue.  It would also facilitate continued recruitment in the local area of young men and women who wish to serve in the Reserve Defence Force.  I ask the Minister to consider my proposal and look forward to his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100075#AAAA00800","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1355259000,"counter":1723,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Landy for raising this issue.  As he will be aware, a value for money review of the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, was recently completed and published.  The review was undertaken by a steering committee with an independent chair and had representatives from the Department of Defence, Defence Forces and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It found that the current effective strength of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve, at 4,500 personnel, was substantially less than half that of the 9,692 personnel for which the organisational structures were designed.  In addition, it found that the low uptake of training within the reserve raised serious questions about its current capacity.   For example, during 2011 the number of reservists who met paid and unpaid training targets required for the payment of a gratuity was 2,010 personnel.<\/p><p>The steering committee made a series of recommendations which were aimed at ensuring a viable Reserve Defence Force into the future.  In this context, a key recommendation was for a major reorganisation of the reserve, with organisational structures that were sustainable within the current resource envelope.  Arising from the reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force, within a strength level of 9,500 personnel, the number of Permanent Defence Force personnel available to support the Army Reserve in a full-time capacity is being reduced to 48.  A cadre of a further nine Permanent Defence Force personnel is assigned to support the Naval Service Reserve.<\/p><p>The steering committee recommended an Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve based on a total strength ceiling of 4,000 personnel, 3,800 of whom would be Army Reserve and 200 of whom Naval Service Reserve personnel.  It recommended the retention of a country-wide geographic spread with units in existing Permanent Defence Force installations and 16 locations outside these installations.<\/p> <p>I accepted these recommendations and directed that proposals for new organisational structures be prepared.  The chief of staff and Secretary General of my Department submitted a joint report which set out detailed re-organisation proposals, including unit structures and the location of reserve units.  Their recommendation was based on a single force concept which differs from the current model of reserve organisation.  Army units will have permanent and reserve elements rather than a parallel reserve structure as at present.<\/p><p>This approach offers significant advantages in terms of accessing equipment and training.  Under this organisational model, the only Army reserve elements outside Permanent Defence Force installations will be reserve infantry companies.  All other Army reserve combat support and combat service support elements will be co-located with their PDF counterparts in PDF installations.  This will be in Cork in the case of 1 Brigade.    Accordingly, it is no longer feasible to retain reserve cavalry or medical elements in Clonmel.  The training and support of reserve elements of defence force units located in PDF installations will be undertaken by the PDF element of those units.  The 16 reserve infantry companies outside PDF installations will have additional support from 16 teams of full time PDF personnel.  <\/p><p>The Senator will appreciate that the consolidation of existing reserve into a small number of full strength units means it is not possible to retain all existing locations.  Clonmel was not selected as a location for one of these 16 infantry companies which are distributed throughout the country.  I emphasise that this is not a negative reflection on the quality of participation of the current reservists in Clonmel but reflects the reality that all locations cannot be retained.<\/p><p>All members of the reserve will be afforded the opportunity to apply for positions within the new organisational structure, having regard to their particular needs.  The closest reserve infantry companies to Clonmel will be based in Waterford, Kilkenny and Templemore.  Personnel will be able to avail of retraining should this be required.  The overall travel costs of the new reserve units will not be known for some time but I can confirm that no increase in the overarching reserve budget is anticipated or planned.  I am satisfied that given a reduction in direct expenditure on the reserve of \u20ac11 million in 2013, the new reserve will be significantly more cost-effective than the existing organisation.  <\/p><p>Finally, I emphasise that the contribution and commitment of each member of the reserve is valued and appreciated.  I sincerely hope all members of the Reserve Defence Force will continue to serve within the new organisation.  Unfortunately, I cannot accede to the request made by the Senator that we preserve the reserve in Clonmel or that Clonmel remain a location for reserve training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100075#AAAA00900","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355259600,"counter":1725,"content":"<p>The Minister is proposing to provide finance for the development of the old Army barracks into a new Garda unit.

In respect of the issue the Senator raised relating to Cork, I emphasise that all reservists will be invited to apply for positions within the new organisational structure.  They must decide based on their particular circumstances as to which units best serve their needs.  This can and may include transferring from their current corps such as cavalry to an alternative such as infantry.  Every effort will be made to facilitate reservists with their choice, however, this may not be feasible if units are over-subscribed.  As this process unfolds, there will be a clearer picture as to the locations which reservists wish to relocate to.  It is important to state that military authorities have informed that they do not envisage transporting reservists from Clonmel to Cork or other locations.<\/p><p>I hope members of the Reserve Defence Force, particularly active members who are doing the community a service and are committed to and very much enjoy their involvement and engagement in the reserve, will show the flexibility and understanding that is necessary in the circumstances that now pertain.  In the context of the reserve, we must ensure that it has a capability, that members of the reserve participate in the minimum training and that the reserve re-adjusts itself to the very substantial and dramatic changes made in the Permanent Defence Force where we have moved from a three-brigade to a two-brigade structure.  I have an obligation in current circumstances as Minister for Justice, Defence and Equality to ensure that the re-organisation of the Permanent Defence Force is reflected in an appropriate re-organisation of the Reserve Defence Force in the context of ensuring the public gets value for money and that we do not unduly waste resources.  In addition, the advantage of the new arrangements is that there will be greater connectivity between the Permanent Defence Force and the reserve, as opposed to a reserve operating to a great extent as a separate organisation save for the PDF cadre that was available to assist it in its operations and training.<\/p><p>I hope the reforms will be welcomed by the members of the reserve insofar as they will have a changing and, I hope, more relevant role and a greater engagement with the PDF in general.  I also hope that those members of the reserve who have been engaged and active will continue to do so.  I am also anxious to ensure that, in the context of the reserve, we have a real strength as opposed to a nominal one.  I have concerns that, as I pointed out in 2011, only 2,010 of the 4,500 members of the reserve fully participated in the minimum seven days training that is prescribed to maintain some degree of capability within the reserve.  I am sure the reservists in Clonmel are disappointed that this location has not been retained.  We will over a period of months be working through the implementation of the reforms, which will not be implemented overnight.  A consultative process is taking place. I wish all the members in Clonmel well and thank them for their service so far.  I hope those members in Clonmel who are committed to and actively participating in the reserve can re-adjust to maintain their involvement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100076#BBBB00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wastewater Treatment Systems","time":1355259600,"count":1727,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100076#BBBB00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1355259600,"counter":1728,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the House and thank him for taking this matter on the Adjournment.

I made regulations in June setting out the procedures for householders to register details of their treatment systems with their water services authorities.  The Local Government Management Agency developed an online registration facility, on a shared service basis for the 34 county and city councils, and the agency has also been tasked with managing a central bureau to process written applications accompanied by registration fees.  Registration facilities have been available from 26 June 2012.  In keeping with a previous commitment, I set the registration fee at \u20ac5 for the first three months of the registration period, up to 28 September this year, and the fee payable since that date is \u20ac50.  The registration fees are intended to cover the costs to the water services authorities of administering the registers and managing the risk-based inspection system which will be implemented in 2013.<\/p><p>As of 10 December 2012, applications in respect of the on-site wastewater treatment systems of 241,000 owners, who have registered online, by post or in person at their local authority offices, have been processed.  I understand that approximately a further 50,000 owners have submitted registration applications which have yet to be processed by the bureau operated by the Local Government Management Agency.  This means that more than 290,000 owners have registered their systems.  This compares with the almost 500,000 houses that are served by septic tanks or other on-site treatment systems that were recorded in Census 2011.  Householders who have not yet registered have until 1 February 2013 to register their system.  I would encourage each of them to register on time to ensure they are in compliance with the law.  Registration can be done online, by post or at local authority offices.<\/p><p>I am very aware of the concerns that have been expressed and raised by Senator Higgins that some householders are concerned they may incur significant expense in repairing or upgrading their systems if they fail an inspection.  I have stated on a number of occasions that I am prepared to consider all possible options to provide financial support to those householders whose wastewater treatment systems are deemed, following inspection under the new legislation, to require substantial remediation or upgrading.  The provision of any financial support will have regard to the overall budgetary situation and to the financial position of the individual householders concerned.  If we are introducing any financial support at some stage in the future, this support would be targeted as a last resort to people on low incomes who have been unable, due to their means, to facilitate a major improvement of their wastewater treatment system.<\/p><p>I remind the House that this legislation was introduced to ensure compliance with a European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland.  It is important the legislation is fully implemented not just to comply with the court ruling but also to protect our very valuable water resources.  Senator Higgins is correct to point out the importance of good quality water to householders, the agriculture and food industry and businesses generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100077#CCCC00100","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1355260200,"counter":1730,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for outlining the situation.

This is the solution that was found in Cavan.  In 2004, Cavan County Council quite correctly identified that it had a very serious problem with pollution of its waterways and lakes.  Some of it was due to difficulties with groundwater arising from leaks from septic tanks.  The regulations that were enforced by Cavan County Council in 2004 showed that approximately 11% of the wastewater treatment systems failed following an inspection.  I do not anticipate that there will be as many wastewater treatment systems as in Cavan County Council, but I accept there will be exceptional cases where, through nobody's fault, a substantial sum of money will have to be spent on remediation works.  I am particularly conscious of that for low income families and people on social welfare.  The most important matter as far as we are concerned is that people will register by 1 February 2013.  If a person does not register, they will certainly not be considered for any grant assistance.

The boy is on a waiting list for two other special schools but there is no guarantee that a place will become available for him.  In the interim, the parents applied for the home tuition grant to ensure he could continue his education.  Unfortunately, this has recently been refused and the child has not received formal education for the past eight months.  The home tuition grant for a child with special needs is granted only where a child is waiting to be placed in a suitable placement.  The reason given for the refusal was that the child still has a place available to him in the school he was attending.

Consequently, the application was refused, as funding for home provision arises only where a place is not available.<\/p><p>The Department operates another home tuition scheme where the child does not have a school place, is without the offer of a school place and on whose behalf a school place is being actively sought or a section 29 appeal is being taken.  This home tuition scheme is an interim measure pending the offer of a school placement.  I understand that an application for home tuition was again refused because a school placement was available.<\/p><p>The National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, subsequently appealed the Department's decision on home tuition on behalf of this child's parents.  The appeal was rejected on the same grounds, namely, that the child remained on the roll of the school in question and a placement was available for him there, as a consequence of which the home tuition scheme could not apply to him.<\/p><p>Regarding the role of the NCSE in these matters, the position is that there is no formal requirement for continued NCSE involvement once a placement is available for a child.  In this case, however, the SENO has been advised that the boy's parents might seek assistance regarding an alternative placing and the Department of Education and Skills is happy for the SENO to provide support in respect of any option they are considering.<\/p><p>The NEWB has a particular role in securing a return to school of a child who has been withdrawn regardless of whether a special educational need exists.  I understand that the NEWB has been assisting the parents in attempting to secure an alternative school placement for their child.<\/p><p>The Senator referred to parental concerns and I fully respect the fact that this is a sensitive case.  I should clarify that, under the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school and with employing school staff.  Accordingly, whereas the Department of Education and Skills provides funding and policy direction for schools, it does not have any power to instruct schools to follow a particular course of action regarding individual complaints.<\/p><p>If a parent or guardian is still unsatisfied after having brought a complaint to the attention of a school's board of management, he or she may write to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, which may independently investigate complaints relating to the administrative actions or inactions of a school recognised by the Department of Education and Skills, provided that the parent has fully followed the school's complaints procedures.  The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the actions of a school have or may have adversely affected the child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100077#CCCC00500","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355260800,"counter":1736,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, always seems to take those Adjournment debates where I am not happy with the response.  I am very disappointed in this instance.  Where a child has an intellectual disability or, as in this case, special needs, we must consider each case individually.<\/p><p>If the child was attending a normal school, that is, one that was not a special school, his parents could just send him to a different school in the area if that was their preference.  Unfortunately, as the child is attending a special school and no other special school is available, he is caught in a terrible loop.  His parents are clearly unhappy with his current placement.  They have noticed a significant improvement since removing him.  Surely, where they send their child to school is a matter of parental choice.  He has been out of school since last April, some eight months ago, and priority needs to be given to his case.  We owe him the right to an education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121100078#DDDD00200","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1355260800,"counter":1737,"content":"<p>I do not want to repeat anything that has been stated but, in fairness to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, the reply was comprehensive.
