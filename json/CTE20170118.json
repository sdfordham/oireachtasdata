He was appointed head of representation last year.<\/p><p>For the information of members, two European Commissioners will visit Leinster House this month.  Commissioner Moscovici who is responsible for economic and financial affairs, taxation and customs matters will be here on 24 January, while Commissioner Vestager who is responsible for competition matters will visit on 31 January.  Both will appear before the Joint Committee on Finance to discuss matters within their remit.  The Houses are involved in the work of the European Commission.  Today the committee will consider the European Commission's annual work programme which sets out the Commmission's legislative and policy agenda for the year ahead.  It is entitled, Delivering a Europe that Protects, Empowers and Defends.  It sets out several new initiatives, as well as continuing the process of the Juncker Commission's Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme REFIT initiative.  <\/p><p>I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I am very happy to be here, given the nature of the activities of the committee, as well as ours.  I hope we will have a lot in common and that there will be a lot of co-operation in the future.  I have only been in the position since last October, having spent almost 30 years working in the European Commission, mainly in the area of agriculture.  I have also worked in Washington DC.  This is a new scene for me.<\/p> <p>  I have been asked to talk about the Commission's work programme for 2017 and the role and activities of the European Commission Representation in Ireland.  For the first two years of this Commission the European Union has been in a challenging situation, facing terrorism, migration, continuing economic instability and the Brexit question.  There have been many issues outside EU policy which have influenced the work of the Commission and the European Union.  Throughout, however, the Commission has remained a source of resilience, stability and forward momentum.  It is adamant that it is only by moving forward and being decisive that the European Union can meet the concerns of the citizen.  That is exactly what the Commission is doing and will continue to do.  <\/p> <p>  As committee members know, every year the Commission adopts a work programme setting out the list of actions it will take in the following 12 months.  The work programme informs the public and the co-legislators of our political commitment to present new initiatives, withdraw pending proposals and review existing EU legislation.  It does not cover the ongoing work of the Commission in its role as guardian of the treaties or in enforcing existing legislation, or the regular initiatives it adopts every year.  In practice that is what most Commission officials work at day to day.  <\/p> <p>  The Commission's work programme for 2017 is entitled, Delivering a Europe that Protects, Empowers and Defends.  At the start of the new year it confirmed that it would devote all its efforts to implementing the work programme which was focused squarely on delivery of the ten priorities outlined in the Juncker Commission's political guidelines of July 2014 in order to address the biggest challenges facing Europeans.  In spite of these new issues and challenges, President Juncker and the Commission are adamant that the ten priorities stand unchanged and will be delivered on, but that does not mean that many other issues will not be addressed, as they were last year and the year before.  <\/p> <p>  The work programme for this year proposes 21 key initiatives, as well as a further 18 REFIT proposals to improve the quality of existing EU legislation and ensure our rules are fit for purpose.<\/p><p>To ensure a focus on delivery, the Commission work programme also identifies 34 priority pending proposals we have made in the past two years where swift adoption by the Parliament and Council can make a tangible impact on the ground.  Both the European Parliament and European Council have further agreed to accelerate work on a number of issues in the joint declaration of the EU&rsquo;s legislative priorities in 2017 signed by all three EU institutions on 13 December 2016.  The pace at which decisions are made has been a cause for criticism of the EU in the past.  While there are many urgent issues, it takes a long time for decisions to be made.  However, there are good reasons for decisions taking a long time to be made, including the fact that different EU institutions have a role to play, the complexity of the issues and the magnitude of getting it wrong in terms of the potential impact on EU citizens.  Decision making takes a long time but there is a commitment on the part of the institutions that we will move faster in the future and reach decisions on a more expeditious basis.  With the priorities now set, we will be focusing on delivery and ensuring that all member states make good on their commitments.  As President Juncker said in his September 2016 state of the Union address, &ldquo;Europeans want common decisions followed by swift and efficient implementation&rdquo;.  As the EU heads from Bratislava to Rome, this is what it needs to deliver collectively.<\/p><p> The first, which is the primary priority of President Juncker and this Commission, is to boost jobs, growth and investment.  We are proposing a youth initiative, an action plan on the implementation of the circular economy and a new multi-annual financial framework.  This also includes a proposal for the European Solidarity Corps.  Youth unemployment and employment has been a big issue for this Commission.  While all countries in the EU are making headway and the EU as a whole is making substantial headway on the level of employment and youth unemployment is declining, nevertheless it remains a problem.  The European Commission has been addressing it with the member states through the youth initiative, which has involved about 9 million young people who were unemployed.  Those young people have gone into education, taken up apprenticeship training and so forth.  We have about &euro;6.4 billion in the EU budget for 2017 aimed specifically at youth employment.  Committee members may be aware that we recently launched what is called the European Solidarity Corps, which is a European framework for young people to volunteer.  It can also be a form of employment for young people in charitable organisations.  Youth unemployment is a big issue and it is considered a priority by the Commission, Council and Parliament.  <\/p><p> We will present ideas for the reform of the EU 27 and the strengthening of the Economic and Monetary Union.  We will also propose a European pillar of social rights.  One hears many criticisms of the EU today to the effect that it is only benefitting big business and that there is very little consideration given to social issues.  In fact, if people analysed the situation, they would see that most of the social protection that exists today in member states has emanated from the EU over many years.  That does not mean that we will stop but most of the work on social protection has been done already by the EU.  Nevertheless, the Commission is looking at addressing social questions further during the year ahead.<\/p><p> We will continue to pursue a security union to fight terrorism and will align the rules on the protection of personal data and privacy.  We will deliver on the European agenda on migration.  There has been much criticism of the EU's position on migration over the last few years.  People saw the catastrophe as it was but failed to appreciate the challenges posed.  We have seen the greatest movement of people since the Second World War.  It is important, in this context, to separate the Commission from the EU as a whole.  The Commission has been well ahead of the curve in terms of what it believes should be done but it was not always possible to deliver.  Equally, it was not always possible for national governments to deliver in their own countries for domestic political reasons.  That said, an awful lot has been done, considering the magnitude of the problem.  There are some indications that things are beginning to settle down and get under control.  The European Union spent something like &euro;15 billion in the last 12 to 15 months on migration and something in the order of &euro;7 billion has been allocated in the 2017 budget for migration.  I am not saying that money can solve the problem but it does help and is a good starting point.<\/p><p> We also want to strengthen Europe&rsquo;s role as a global actor.  In that context, we will present a European defence action plan, including a European defence fund, and the Commission and the High Representative will adopt an EU strategy for Syria and implement the EU global strategy and the Africa-EU partnership.  On the defence action plan, much has been written to the effect that this represents a proposal for a European army but nobody has mentioned the question of a European army.  The defence action plan is about getting co-operation between the defence forces of the 27 member states.  To give an example, the combined expenditure by the 27 member states on defence is &euro;200 billion per year while the expenditure by the US on defence is &euro;500 billion per year.  However, the EU member states combined only have something of the order of 15% of the US output.  It is inefficient, basically.  What we are proposing is more co-operation, more common procurement and more interoperability so that armies can co-operate and operate better together when the need arises.  The need does arise because many member states are involved in peacekeeping missions in different countries and it is important that they are able to co-operate better in every sense, in terms of the weapons used and so forth.  <\/p><p> We will also adapt existing laws to the Treaty provisions on delegated and implementing Acts and will assess the democratic legitimacy of existing procedures for adopting certain secondary EU Acts.  In addition to this, the regulatory fitness and performance programme, REFIT, reviews will update and improve existing legislation so it continues to achieve its objectives effectively and without undue burdens.  In setting our priorities, we have taken particular account of the 22 opinions delivered by the REFIT platform, the newly-created independent panel of experts which reviews existing legislation and draws on citizens&rsquo; and stakeholders&rsquo; suggestions for reducing the administrative and financial burden of EU law.  In parallel to this work programme, we are publishing a scoreboard which sets out in detail the follow-up to the REFIT platform opinions and the state of play on 231 initiatives for simplifying and reducing administrative burdens in existing legislation.  This year we are proposing 19 withdrawals of pending legislative proposals which have become outdated and we will repeal 16 pieces of existing legislation which have become obsolete.<\/p><p>We will also step up our efforts on the enforcement agenda across a range of policy areas, including the Single Market and the environment, because even the best law is useless unless it delivers real results on the ground.  <\/p><p> This year&rsquo;s programme is fully aligned with the priorities identified by the 27 EU Heads of State and Government in Bratislava, and includes proposals which will contribute to the long-term vision of the European Union ahead of the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome in March 2017.  The Commission will set out its vision for the long term in a White Paper to be published in March 2017.  However, just as important as the new initiatives set out this year is our continued work with the European Parliament and Council to reach agreement on the ambitious proposals which have already been made in the Commission&rsquo;s first two years in office.  Delivering agreement on these proposals will be a priority in the next year.<\/p><p> In all this, I would like to emphasise the role of national parliaments in the process.  The Juncker Commission has been clear from the very beginning on the need to deepen the existing political dialogue with national parliaments.  Personally, I look forward to continuing to work with this committee.  It has undertaken very valuable work across a range of European issues, and I look forward to building on the close co-operation it had with my predecessor.<\/p><p> Let me say a few words about the role of the representation.  The European Commission, as the executive body of the EU, represents the common interests of all Europeans.  Apart from its main presence in Brussels and Luxembourg, the Commission also has representations in all 28 member state capitals, as well as regional offices in the larger member states.  This network of 37 national and regional representations has the same role and engages in the same activities in every member state.  The representations are the Commission&rsquo;s eyes, ears and voice on the ground in all member states.  They interact with national authorities and stakeholders and inform the media and the public about EU policies.  The representations report to the Commission&rsquo;s headquarters on significant developments in the member states.  <\/p><p> Our activities fall under a certain number of different headings.  On the political side, we represent the Commission's interests in the member states, but also follow discussions on Europe in a member state and provide political intelligence about this to headquarters, in order to keep the Commission well informed about latest developments.  On press, we engage with the national and regional press and media to inform them about the initiatives and views of the Commission.  This also involves social media activities.  On public communication, we inform and engage with civil society organisations, and also directly with citizens, on all things related to the EU.  Not just informing them, but also entering into dialogue and debate with a view to clarifying the facts and figures related to the EU.  On economic governance, we engage and interact with member states and stakeholders in member states on issues and developments related to the European semester and our current mechanism of economic and budgetary surveillance.  On protocol, we prepare and manage the visits of European Commissioners and other high-level EU officials to member states in all aspects, ranging from political contacts to citizens dialogues to press work.  As the Chairman mentioned, we will have visits from Commissioner Moscovici and Commissioner Vestager, who will be here later this month.  <\/p><p> We also engage with citizens, through our citizens dialogues.  This is not a new policy, but it is a reinforced policy where the Commission wants to have more citizen's dialogues.  We have had approximately 120 to date across the EU.  We have had some in Ireland, and we hope that we will have further dialogues with citizens in future.<\/p><p> We also have 500 EU information centres throughout the 28 member states, called Europe Direct centres.  We have ten of them in Ireland.  Through this direct and local provision of EU information we try to engage with citizens on EU affairs of concern to them.  The representation will be organising specific events, such as Europe Day in May, which this year will be focused on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome.  In March we will also have what is called a model EU Council event involving secondary schools from all around the country, re-enacting a Council meeting and discussing the merits of free trade agreements.<\/p><p> During late May we expect to be presenting our annual country specific recommendations to member states, and will organise an event around this topic with partners and stakeholders to give them a first-hand insight into the Commission&rsquo;s thinking.  These are but a few examples of the type of activity we carry out here.  We will, of course, be engaging closely with the Oireachtas and the Government during 2017 on the main issues of concern to Ireland.<\/p><p> Since the beginning of the Juncker Commission in 2014, heads of representations are appointed by the President and are his political representatives in the member state to which they are posted.  This is a big change in function and status compared to when EEC representations started off six decades ago as information centres.  This reflects the changing role of the Commission as it has evolved over the past decades, as well as the very political focus of the Juncker Commission itself.  <\/p><p> On behalf the European Commission I look forward to working closely with the Houses and members of the committee during the course of 2017 on EU affairs.  At a time of volatility in Europe and the world, it is important that we work together as closely and as clearly as possible.  Bratislava is the beginning of a process which must see concrete steps taken on the issues which unite us.  The lessons of the crises of past years are clear.  We cannot leave our major projects only half-built for decades.  A test will always come sooner or later, and a systemic problem cannot be addressed with a last-minute quick fix.<\/p><p> Looking ahead to Rome and our 60th Anniversary, we have work to achieve and we have a vision to set out.  First, we must deliver on the positive agenda set out in the 2016 state of the union address, which inspires the Commission&rsquo;s 2017 work programme.  The Commission is tabling all the promised proposals, and counts on the European Parliament and the Council to advance with the necessary legislative framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017011800002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Kiely","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kiely for his presentation.  I am not going to mention Brexit directly, because I am assuming and hoping my colleagues might, but there is something I want to look at.  Mr. Kiely mentioned something on which Brexit will undoubtedly have a massive impact, which is priority six in regard to trade.  That focuses on the EU-US trade deal.  Following President-elect Trump's inauguration, I am absolutely certain that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, will be dead in the water, and I say that very reluctantly as someone who was an outspoken supporter of TTIP.  I know that is not always the most popular thing to say.  I fear that having an EU-US trade deal as a priority with the new President is no longer a viable position.  I do not despair, however.  The EU negotiated a solid deal with Canada through the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  I think there is also massive potential for new trade deals, particularly in Asia, and I would like that to be fed back to the Commission.  I know Commissioner Hogan undertook a serious study and information tour in places like Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand.  Obviously, there is competition there, and there are concerns, but if we take the model of the EU-South Korea trade deal and apply that to other Asian markets, and improve on existing trade deals, I think there is potential in the short term to negotiate real, substantial trade deals with those countries rather than focusing on TTIP, which I think is at the 15th or 16th round of negotiation, and is the third or fourth attempt to actually get a trade deal.<\/p> <p>  In regard to Mr. Kiely's work in Ireland, it is a massive challenge.  As someone who is pro-Europe, lived in Brussels and worked in the Parliament, there is nothing I could say that could ever be construed as eurosceptic.  However, we are facing into a massive challenge of selling and sustaining the European Union.  Brexit has forced this.  The eurosceptics have actually won one for once, and we can no longer be complacent.  I fear there is a particular mindset, not necessarily within the Commission but definitely within the pro-European brigade in Ireland.  This is maybe is not necessarily from my generation, but perhaps my generation is taking for granted the very many positive things that we have experienced, such as free movement, free travel, free trade, the right to work and the right to various social services.  The Commission could play a more central role in reviving the pro-European narrative in Ireland.  Going back to the halcyon days of the 1970s and 1980s, we had great figures like Garret FitzGerald and Paddy Hillery leading the way.  We need a return to that, because it is far too easy to knock the European Union and the European process.  I would really like to see greater support and greater emphasis given to the individuals and the bodies.  I would also like to see pressure put on individuals and bodies to actually come out and bat for Europe, and bat for the idea.  Rather than having a cut against Brussels and the faceless elites, people should actually say that they got to go on holidays to Spain, spend their money there very easily, that they got sick, were able to see the doctor there for no fee and that they get that because of Europe.  Not enough people take that into account now, and I think that is the big challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017011800002#C00200","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kiely for outlining the Commission's work programme and for giving us some information as to the role of the Irish representation here.  I would like to ask a question about agriculture, given Mr. Kiely's background in that area, but unfortunately it is not of much interest to my constituents in Dublin Bay North.<\/p><p> The Brexit vote on 23 June has taken place and there is talk of increased populism in Europe, of a swing to the hard right and so on.  Has the Commission assessed the vote in the United Kingdom?  Obviously everybody now agrees that immigration played a huge role in the outcome of the vote, but I am sure there are other issues as well.  Some were just mentioned such as, for example, the delay in getting decisions and implementing decisions by the European Union.  I would also say the Commission has a communications problem.  Citizens sometimes feel they are being talked down to or talked at, rather than being communicated with.  Has the Commission analysed the vote in the UK either officially or otherwise?  Has it come to conclusions about how the EU should do things differently and so forth?  A very definite message was delivered and I think this trend can be discerned throughout the states of the European Union.<\/p><p> The stated aims and objectives are laudable.  In particular, the first one to boost jobs, growth and investment is probably the most important of all as far as the citizens are concerned.  I agree with Mr. Kiely's comments about social Europe and so on.  As an example, it was mentioned that the Commission representation here in Ireland would report on significant developments to the Commission.  In the last two days, there has been a lot of discussion and debate following the speech from the Prime Minister of the UK yesterday.  Would communicating the Irish reaction to the Prime Minister's speech, both in the D&aacute;il yesterday and today and so forth, be particularly high on the agenda?  In this committee, we have said it is very important that the special position of Ireland arising from the vote should be considered in the negotiations.  All our efforts are to try to get that message across to our European colleagues.  What role does the European Commission Representation in Ireland play in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017011800002#C00300","speaker":"1360","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Haughey and call Deputy Crowe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017011800002#D00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  I welcome Mr. Kiely.<\/p> <p>  I presume Mr. Kiely is aware that Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs and other Irish MEPs met with the European Commission's chief negotiator on Brexit, Michel Barnier, on Tuesday.  Our MEPs impressed upon Mr. Barnier the potentially grave implications that Brexit holds for Ireland and in particular, the challenges faced by the North of Ireland.  It is being dragged out of the EU against the democratically-expressed wishes of the people there.  We made the case for the North to have special designated status within the EU as a democratic imperative and the importance of a transnational EU deal for Ireland in advance of Brexit to protect the interests of Irish citizens' business, particularly in the Border regions.  Is there awareness or concern in the Commission on the implications that Brexit will have for Ireland?  I have heard Mr. Barnier talking about his own experience with the peace process, so he has some awareness.  Is there awareness across the Commission that we are the country that probably will experience the greatest impact in respect of cross-border trade and so on?<\/p> <p>  The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, and Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, were mentioned by one of my colleagues here.  I am sure Mr. Kiely is aware that Sinn F&eacute;in had a different view on the TTIP and CETA agreements.  We see them as a new generation of free trade agreements that move far beyond the lowering of tariffs or free movement of goods and which look to attack and undermine the sovereignty of national parliaments by interfering in national regulation of trade.  Shared concerns were expressed by non-government organisations and civil society consumer groups about the weak protections in CETA for the environment, workers' rights, public health, food safety and public procurement and in particular on the impact of the investment court system.  Many of us can understand why major corporations are in favour of these agreements but I argue they are not designed for economies like Ireland and would do serious damage to our agrifood industry.<\/p> <p>  I am appalled at the fact that it seemed to be rammed through.  There is considerable secrecy surrounding the two negotiations. I have been talking to MEPs and they say that if one wants to read about TTIP, one is brought into a room without being allowed to bring a mobile phone and one cannot quote directly from a document.  What is the issue with the secrecy around that?  Since Mr. Kiely is talking in terms of the national dialogue and citizens' dialogue, has the intense secrecy surrounding these deals come up as a concern?  That feeds into the concerns many citizens would have about it.  Members have never really had a discussion on CETA in this Parliament.  Committees had no intense discussion on it.  There was a view that it was trade and it had to be good.  None of the implications for farmers or citizens or anyone else were taken into account.  Why must these things be railroaded through?<\/p> <p>  As for the issue of water, Lynn Boylan, MEP who represents Dublin, repeatedly called out the European Commission for its continued mixed messages and double dealing regarding politically sensitive types of water charges.  At one stage, Commissioner Vella's water unit in the Commission confirmed in e-mails to separate queries from both Lynn Boylan, MEP and Marian Harkin, MEP that Ireland could in fact opt to not charge for water, as is permitted in the Water Framework Directive.  Yet soon after that, there were leaked documents that said the established practice was to have the polluter pay and so on.  It remains crystal clear that Ireland's established practice to recover costs was through general taxation.  Would Mr. Kiely not agree that at a time when disengagement between Irish citizens and European citizens with the Brussels elite is at its highest, it is incredibly foolish for the European Commission to stick its nose into domestic politics when it is fully aware that a review into water charges is ongoing?  We are getting mixed messages.<\/p> <p>  One priority mentioned in respect of the work programme was migration.  It has been expressed here and at the foreign affairs committee that there is huge concern about the migrations to the EU from Turkey.  How, under any criteria, can the European Commission or any European body designate Turkey as a safe country of origin?  How can a country that regularly violates civil rights and human rights of its own citizens and others - we are practically in the middle of a civil war within Turkey - be considered to be a safe country of origin?  Even more worrying are the most recently developed plans to copy this model and negotiate similar deals with countries such as Libya, a failed state, and Mali.  Some would state the latter is not a failed state but I would argue it is has.  It is inconceivable that this would be done.  We would be talking in terms of huge migration of population.  We had other people coming in from the EU and I have asked the same questions.  How can the Commission state those are places of safe origin?  <\/p> <p>  Lastly, I have a different view on the European army.  The move is towards a common defence policy and a standing EU army.  While Mr. Kiely stated that nobody is talking about that, it is the subtext and the agenda that is coming from many states within Europe.  They want to see it and want to see us moving down that road.  At a time of austerity, high unemployment, creaking public services, we are investing in more military spending.  It is incredible and reflects how out of touch are many of our European elites.<\/p><p>Mr. Kiely spoke about terrorism and that we have to defend ourselves, but many of the terrorist attacks that have happened across Europe have involved people who were born and grew up in those countries.  That is a concern and a difficulty.  There is something wrong with investing in more weaponry at a time when people are going to bed hungry, and I would question that.  There are difficulties with the direction in which Europe in going with respect to many of the key elements in the Commission's work programme.  Thankfully, people are starting to speak out about it.  If the EU elites do not begin to change, we will face a hugely difficult time when there will be even more pressure on the structures and people will rethink about our membership of the Union.  That is the big concern I have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017011800002#D00300","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Kiely to the committee and thank him for his presentation.  I hope he does not take personally what I have to say.  He is a representative here doing a job.  The opening statement on the yellow sheet carries the heading, \"A Europe that preserves our way of life and empowers our young\".  However, do we want to preserve the way of life we have slipped into as a result of mismanagement of the economy not only in Ireland but right across Europe and right across the western world?  We have thrown our young onto the scrapheap.  At least two generations will suffer as a result of what has happened.  I do not want to see the way of life we have created for them preserved.  Mr. Kiely will forgive me for saying this but these documents were prepared by somebody somewhere in the annals of the European Union and they contain all this grand flowery language, but we have failed people.<\/p> <p>  My colleague spoke about the rise of populism.  Populism arose because there was a vacuum.  We have lost the support of the people, the ordinary Joe Soap on the ground.  They have no faith in politics or in politicians.

We can understand where that criticism comes from when we see the way we have wrecked lives right across Europe, which is another issue we have to discuss.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the grand idea that we would have an integrated digital Single Market, if a person drives 80 miles north of here, the moment he or she hits the Border, he or she will find how integrated our digital markets are.  That person's phone will switch over to another network and he or she will have to pay roaming charges.  That will not get any easier as Brexit comes down the line.  There has been a singular failure there.<\/p> <p>  We talk about building a deeper and fairer Internal Market.  I will give Mr. Kiely an example of how fair the Internal Market is.  A colleague of mine who suffers from blood pressure problems buys his drugs in Lanzarote.  He told me he paid &euro;10.95 for a year's supply of drugs that would cost him &euro;1,024 in Ireland.  I cannot verify that but if we are to have a Single Market, I should be able to buy a McDonald's burger in Madrid for the same price I would buy it in Berlin, Amsterdam and Dublin.  Similarly, I should be able to buy my medical prescriptions in any country in the European Union for exactly the same cost.  Why is it that the Single Market works in some areas and does not necessarily work in other areas?  I know Mr. Kiely's background is in agriculture and he will have seen the Single Market work in agriculture to some degree.  It has not favoured all of the agricultural sector and it certainly has not favoured the fisheries sector.  On the notion that we will have a fairer market, I will know there is a fairer market when the price of a blood pressure tablet is the same in Europe no matter where I go.  That, for me, is what would signify a deeper, fairer market.<\/p> <p>  We talk about an energy strategy, but we have been mucking about for God knows how long about the North-South interconnector.  I know that does not necessarily fall into Mr. Kiely's lap, but it is a project for which funding no doubt will come from the European Union.  That will probably be lost because of the mucking about there is now with Brexit coming down the line, which is a huge problem.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kiely's statement covered strengthening our trade defence instruments.  That suggests there is a veiled threat that we will see the return of tariffs and so on as Brexit flows through.  Mr. Kiely might address that.  I am sorry for coming at him like this on these elements.<\/p> <p>  On the security issue, I can understand how we would want a single point of purchase for military equipment but I would have to agree with my colleague in questioning why there is an emphasis on purchasing military might when thousands of people across Europe are unemployed and when we cannot manage our hospitals and that is not only the case in Ireland.  I was watching proceedings in the UK yesterday.  The UK is still a member of the European Union.  I heard that maternity services there are falling to pieces because they do not have the resources to deal with them.  I am sure the position is no different across the European Union.<\/p> <p>  On the element of strengthening Europe's role as a global actor, I have serious concerns about the way we in the West, and I include Europe and the United States in this, think we know what is best for the Syria, north Africa and various other places.  If we had invested properly in north Africa, people would not want to run out of it.  There are many economic migrants from there, aside from those who are fleeing war-torn countries.  When we consider war-torn countries like Syria, we armed them, we gave them the weapons and trained them in how to use them, and then when they turned them on their own people, we armed the resistance groups.  We have a massive amount to pay.  If Europe was to take a global role, it might take a global role based on the Irish peacekeeping role and not become an aggressor.<\/p> <p>  We talk about having fairer taxation systems.  This country alone is bleeding somewhere between &euro;250 million and &euro;350 million a year through vulture funds that have been allowed in here.  They were allowed in because we had to sell off the resources of this country to save the euro.  The European system was no friend to Ireland when the crash came.  The European system hung this country out to dry and has made us pay through the nose for it.  I would love to see the solidarity mentioned in this document and shared responsibility coming into play, but I do not see that happening.<\/p> <p>  Unlike some of my colleagues, I will say something about Brexit.  We need to step up to the plate, take a leading role and tell the 26 member states what is acceptable for us.  I hate to say this as a committed European, but the 26 member states need to take account of our special position, in particular with the North of Ireland, and there can be no Border and no change to the circumstances in which we currently live.  I have to be able to sit in my car and drive to any part of Northern Ireland without encountering any delays or stops.  The time has come, and I hope Mr. Kiely will bring this point back to the Commission, where Ireland is a special case, the North of Ireland is a special case and we cannot and will not tolerate any situation which will force us back to the old days of the Border and Border controls because if we do, there is a likelihood that we will start to talk about an NIexit.  I do not want the voice of the NIexit group to grow any louder than it currently is.  Some 41% of our agricultural output and 35% of our textiles and leather output go the UK and 60,000 people have emigrated to the UK between 2011 and 2013.  I do not know how many thousands of Irish people are in the UK.<\/p><p>There are approximately 25,000 people from the United Kingdom living in this country.  Our two economies have been inextricably linked for over 800 years.  One hundred years ago, we decided we were a republic on our own.  As citizens of a republic, we cannot be in circumstances in which we are subservient to the United Kingdom or the other member states as we move into Brexit.  As a good partner and friend of Europe, Ireland must be recognised by the European Union as having a unique problem.  The EU member states should gather around behind us and help us with the Northern Border.<\/p><p> I am sorry for rattling on a bit.  I thank Mr. Kiely for his time and for attending today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017011800002#E00300","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Kiely.

I could talk to members at length about Brexit but the Commission and President have taken a position that we are not going to give a running commentary on it.  We need to have Article 50 triggered sooner rather than later.  We want to get on with it because there are things to be done.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Barnier will be the chief negotiator for the European Union.  He is the Commission's negotiator.  He has been here.  I have been at meetings with him across the board.  The Commission is well aware of the political and economic implications of Brexit for Ireland.  The Government has been doing a tour of the capitals.  I am sure many people in them are aware of the circumstances.  Members, farm organisations, NGOs and others should never stop telling everybody the story because these negotiations will be difficult.  The only people who will be involved in them who are neutral will be the officials from the Commission.  Every member state will bear in mind the European Union's interests but also its own.  The Commission must bear in mind the European Union's interests only.  It is very cognisant of the challenges that will arise for Ireland owing to Brexit.  One should never stop telling the story, however.<br\/><br\/>I have been at many conferences and I have been involved in many discussions on the implications of Brexit.  We do not know what Brexit will look like.  Admittedly, we received some more clarification yesterday on what Britain is looking for but we do not know what Brexit will look like.  We do not know what the negotiating positions of the individual member states will be when the negotiations begin.  Ireland could already be drawing up potential solutions that would benefit it.  I refer to the Government, the NGOs and others.  There are many very intelligent people in Government organisations, the Civil Service and various other organisations.  Everybody can see the implications for Ireland and the obstacles to trade and the political problems that will arise in the event of various options being chosen.  People should be considering possible solutions now and putting them on the table, be it at the Commission or in the capitals.  We should be preparing people because one cannot expect those outside Ireland to do so, with the possible exception of the Commission because it is committed to looking after Irish interests in the same way as it is committed to looking after other member states' interests.  One cannot expect people in Berlin, Paris or any other capital to spend time looking for a solution for Ireland.  The ideas for a solution should come from Ireland, which should try to persuade the others around the table on its merits and the reasons it should be acceptable.  That is all I can say on Brexit.  Within the Commission and the capitals, there is an appreciation of the fact that the implications are greater for Ireland than anywhere else.  One should never stop telling the story, however.<br\/><br\/>With regard to trade, TTIP will be frozen until we see the view of the next US Administration on trade.  Certainly, the indications do not suggest the United States has an interest in forging ahead on trade deals.  We have a lot in common with the United States.  The United States and European Union are the two biggest and lucrative economies in the world.  They have a lot in common.  A trade deal would have been worth a lot to Ireland, in spite of what people say about the negative aspect of trade.  It is very important for Ireland to have open markets as it is dependent on exports.  The EU market can absorb so much from Ireland but circumstances are different when the growth is outside the EU market.  Members mentioned Indonesia, Vietnam and other regions.  This is where the growth will arise.  Therefore, Ireland and the European Union as a whole need an increasing amount of trade.  Trade is good for citizens.  Admittedly, the traders are the primary beneficiaries but, without their benefiting within the European Union, they will not be creating employment.<br\/><br\/>I find it strange that people say globalisation is negative.  For globalisation to be negative, one must be importing something at a lower price than it can be produced in the European Union or Ireland.  The person importing the product is the consumer, however.  The person benefiting from the lower price is the consumer.  There are more consumers than producers.  Certainly, people have lost their jobs because of imports but many people have gained jobs because of imports.  Saying there should not be freer trade or globalisation means one wants to protect an inefficient operator inside the border by comparison with an external operator on the back of the Irish or European consumer.  There is an opportunity cost also because one cannot support an inefficient producer <i>ad infinitum<\/i>.  It will go to the wall eventually.  One is just postponing the pain.  The resource, be it labour, capital or otherwise, could have been put into something that would have been efficient and competitive economically.<br\/><br\/>The European Commission and European Union believe in trade.  We will continue irrespective of what others around the world might think about trade.  We do not talk about free trade but about trade liberalisation.  I cannot think of any free-trade agreement we have today &ndash; we have many &ndash; under which trade is totally liberalised.  There is always a restriction in sensitive sectors.  Mention was made of agriculture in this regard.  We virtually always have restrictions in regard to agriculture because, given our commitment to a particular agricultural model based on the multifunctional nature of European agriculture, we want to protect the model.  That type of model cannot be protected if there is total liberalisation of trade.  Usually, sensitive sectors are treated differently.<br\/><br\/>The European Union has become an easy candidate for criticism over recent years.  There are many eurosceptics, including newfound eurosceptics, and populists seeking publicity on the back of the European Union with a view to self-promotion.  Not enough effort has been made by the pro-Europeans to defend the European Union.  To return to Deputy Haughey's question on Brexit, there have been many analyses of the British referendum.<\/p><p>Personally, I am convinced that the British referendum was not lost during the campaign.  Much of it was lost before the campaign because for the last 30 years the eurosceptics have had a free open goal.  Every day of the week, the media, pundits and so forth were criticising the EU and nobody was answering back because, first, they did not wish to put their heads above the parapet and, second, they did not think it would make a difference.  They know different now.  It does make a difference.<\/p><p> One cannot leave the field open to eurosceptics or critics.  They must be answered, and we answer them.  The European Commission, European Parliament and the institutions answer them, but it cannot be done from Brussels alone.  It must be done at national level by anybody who believes that the European Union, warts and all, should continue.  We accept that there are problems with the EU and that it could be better, but the exercise on that will continue.  However, if people want the EU to continue it should be defended by the people on the ground at national level, be it politicians, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, or sectoral interests.  There are more people among the public who believe that the EU should continue than believe it should not, and they should defend it.  They should not be depending on the European Commission or others to defend it, because when we do and say people are wrong they will say, \"What else would they say?  They are paid to say that\".  It is much better if the defence comes from the local level.<\/p><p> On the special status of Ireland in the context of Brexit, that is down the road and a matter for somebody else on a higher salary than mine.  However, the first issue is that Article 50 must be triggered so the negotiations can start.<\/p><p> With regard to water, my recollection is that there was a letter to the committee about water from Commissioner Karmenu Vella.  It recognised domestic politics but also highlighted the fact that there is a law, the water directive, which deals with polluter pays, cost recovery and so forth.  There is flexibility for the country, but the directive is clear.  The directive has been in place for a long time so people should be quite familiar with it.<\/p><p> I agree on the Internal Market.  The reason we are looking at the Internal Market is that it must be deepened.  The example of pharmaceuticals might not really relate to the Internal Market.  It is probably more to do with the Spanish health service and the subsidies it might be given - I do not know.  Certainly, the Internal Market is not complete.  There are factors which will play into the cost, with different prices for the same product in different countries, that have nothing to do with the Internal Market, such as local wages, local rents and so forth.  The purpose of the exercise is that we wish to deepen the Internal Market and make it more complete.<\/p><p> On strengthening trade defence instruments, there is more globalisation and trade liberalisation.  We are looking at having a mechanism that can prevent somebody from abusing the EU market through having practices in place which give them an advantage and which are not totally in line with World Trade Organisation, WTO, rules and so forth.  However, if one wishes to take a WTO case it can take four or five years.  Meanwhile, the damage is done.  We are looking at it purely from that point of view.  Yes, it might involve tariffs or blocking a product completely, depending on how serious the distortion of trade is, but it would be for a particular reason.<\/p><p> Regarding Turkey and the immigrants, we are dealing with political reality here.  The Deputy is as aware as I am of the discussions with the member states.  The zones that have been created, which the EU is financing, are under strict NGO and EU control.  It is not a question of us saying, \"Let them go to that country\" or whatever.  They are in specific zones which are equipped to the best of people's ability and are under strict supervision.<\/p><p> The Deputy spoke about austerity and spending money on the European army.  In fact, we are saying almost the opposite.  I gave the example.  If there was a common approach with what is being spent at present we could conceivably save &euro;100 billion.  By standing still and doing nothing, one could save &euro;100 billion.  Our proposal is not necessarily that more should be spent but that there should be more co-operation.  This might happen down the road.  We have heard the discussions about the future of NATO, countries' roles in NATO, the possibility that Europe might have to spend more on defending itself and so forth, but what we are discussing today is more inter-operability between the different armies of the member states and a common approach on procurement.  It has been estimated that this alone could save &euro;100 billion, so by standing still there could be &euro;100 billion more to spend on more needy causes.<\/p><p> Chairman, I believe I have covered most of the points.

I refer to the dramatic increase in the destruction and confiscation of Palestinian dwelling and livelihood structures by the Israeli army in the West Bank and Jerusalem in 2016.  We will begin with an overview of all demolitions in Area C and East Jerusalem and will focus on the specific issue of the destruction and confiscation of EU-funded humanitarian aid by the Israeli army.  We will also outline what positive steps the committee can take to pursue a cessation of and accountability for this destruction and confiscation of EU-funded assets.<\/p> <p>  To introduce myself, I am a returned ecumenical accompanier, or human rights monitor.  I was based in the occupied West Bank as part of the EAPPI programme, which I will explain.  I was there for three months in 2012 and another three months in 2013 in Bethlehem and I was back briefly in 2015.  I am joined by a fellow ecumenical accompanier, EA, Mr. Alex Dunne, who has been based most recently in the West Bank.  He served as a human rights monitor for two periods of three months in 2015 and 2016.  Unfortunately, Patrick Costello is sick.  He sends his apologies.<\/p> <p>  Principally, we recommend that the committee call on the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to raise the issue of the dramatic increase in the destruction of EU-funded humanitarian aid at the next EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting and that the committee also request to be updated regularly on the efforts being made by Ireland to push for a cessation of such breaches of international law in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.<\/p> <p>  I will explain briefly the programme with which we have both worked and then Mr. Dunne will speak in more detail about the demolitions.  Some members of the committee might already know, but some might not, that the ecumenical accompaniment programme in Palestine and Israel, EAPPI, was founded in 2002 after a call by the heads of the Christian churches in Jerusalem for support from the international community.  In response, the World Council of Churches set up this worldwide programme which brings people of different backgrounds, professions, ages and faiths to Israel and Palestine to serve as EAs.  EAs are human rights monitors.  We form part of the United Nations protection cluster and monitor human rights violations.  These include violations regarding access to land and livelihood for Palestinian farmers, access to education for children and access to movement for Palestinians across the numerous internal military checkpoints dotted throughout the West Bank.  The vision of the programme is a future in which the occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza has ended and both Palestinians and Israelis benefit from a just peace, with freedom and security, based on international law.  Our mission is to witness life under occupation, engage with local Palestinians and Israelis pursuing a just peace and work to change the international community's involvement with the conflict, urging it to act against injustice in the region.  Our philosophy is one of non-violence.  We are not pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian; we do not take sides in the conflict.  However, we are pro-human rights and international humanitarian law.  We do not discriminate against anyone and we stand faithfully with the poor, the oppressed and the marginalised.  Since 2002, the programme has brought more than 1,500 EAs to the West Bank and East Jerusalem from all over the world.  In the UK and Ireland, EAs are volunteers, and the programme is run by the Quakers in Britain and supported by Tr&oacute;caire and Christian Aid in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Alex Dunne, will now walk the committee through the reality on the ground concerning demolitions, including of EU-funded structures, by way of the latest statistics gathered by the United Nations, the European Union and our organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017011800002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Jenny Derbyshire"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484748000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>To understand the context in which these demolitions are taking place, we need to look at the map on page 2 of the opening statement circulated to the committee.  The map is of the West Bank and it clearly marks out areas A, B and C as created under the Oslo Accords of the early 1990s.  It is worth highlighting that these were only meant to be in existence for five years, ahead of the formation of an independent Palestinian state.  However, more than 20 years later, this arrangement or agreement is still in place.  In areas A and B, the Palestinian Authority has limited authority over policing and civic services.  These are the areas in yellow and beige on the map.  The blue area of the map, constituting 60% of the West Bank, is known as Area C.  In Area C, Palestinians are subject to Israeli military law and need to apply to the Israeli military for a permit to build any structure, even on privately owned land.  Area C is also the part of the West Bank where the majority of Israeli settlements and outposts can be found.  Israeli settlers in Area C are not subject to military law but to Israeli civil law instead.  These numerous settlements, illegal under international law, can be seen in purple on the map.<\/p> <p>  According to the preliminary data collected by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UN OCHA, and the EAPPI, as of 28 December 2016, the Israeli authorities have demolished or confiscated 1,089 Palestinian-owned structures in the West Bank, which has displaced 1,593 Palestinians and affected the livelihoods of another 7,101.  I reaffirm this has happened in 2016.  These structures were demolished or confiscated because they were deemed illegal as they had been built without permits from the Israeli army or the Israeli civil administration.  It is important to note that this time last year, the former UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, remarked that Israeli zoning and planning in the West Bank is \"restrictive, discriminatory and incompatible with requirements under international law.  The planning system favours Israeli settlement interests over the needs of the protected population and makes it practically impossible for Palestinians living in Area C ... to obtain building permits.\"<\/p> <p>  Official figures from the Israeli civil administration show that between 2010 and 2014, 1.5% of permits applied for by Palestinians to build anything in all of Area C were approved.  Zero permits were approved in 2015.  As the committee can see from the chart in the opening statement circulated to the committee, during roughly the same period, more than 30,000 settlement units were advanced by the Israeli authorities in the same area.  Looking at the chart, we can see that 2016 was the year the highest number of demolitions in the occupied West Bank took place since the UN OCHA began formal records in this regard.  These new figures from the UN OCHA show there has been an approximate 96% increase in demolitions by the Israeli military of Palestinian structures in 2016 against 2015's total.  It is also important to note that the figures for the first week of 2017 show that the Israeli army has demolished more than 70 Palestinian structures in Area C since New Year's Day.  This is 6.5% of 2016's total.  If this weekly average continues throughout the year, demolitions in 2017 will be up 338% on 2016's historic total.<\/p> <p>  Under international law, Israel, as the occupying power, has the obligation to protect Palestinian civilians and administer the territory for its benefit.  I will walk the committee through two parts of the Fourth Geneva Convention.<\/p><p>Article 49 of the Geneva Convention states, &quot;Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons ... are prohibited, regardless of their motive.&quot;  Article 53 states, &quot;Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons ... is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.&quot;<br\/><br\/>This trend has been highlighted many times throughout 2016 at international fora.  United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 of 23 December 2016 illustrates that the international community has reaffirmed its condemnation of &quot;all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, including, inter alia, the construction and expansion of settlements, transfer of Israeli settlers, confiscation of land, demolition of homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians, in violation of international humanitarian law and relevant resolutions&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The figures I have outlined are not descriptive of the number and value of the EU-funded humanitarian aid structures that have been demolished in the same period.  According to the recently released report of the EU delegation in Jerusalem on demolitions and confiscations of EU-funded structures in area C, from January to 8 August 2016 the Israeli military has demolished or confiscated up to 115 EU-funded humanitarian aid structures.  The most recent figures from the European External Action Service show that as of the end of 2016, 180 EU structures were demolished or confiscated.  This represents a staggering 140% increase on the 2015 total and amounts to a material loss of &euro;600,000, as the graph on the screen demonstrates.  The summary of that report, a copy of which has been supplied to members as part of the briefing material, states:<\/p><blockquote>The upsurge in demolitions in 2016 can be attributed to an overarching Israeli policy aimed at asserting control over strategic areas together with increased pressure from various Israeli settler groups on the Israeli Civil Administration. Demolitions are predicted to continue during the next six months...Of particular concern are developments related to Israeli plans for the relocation of Bedouins and herders in Area C...and the overall coercive environment in Area C that communities are facing.<\/blockquote><p>In May 2016, the EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, told members of the European Parliament that since 2009, EU-funded structures to the value of approximately &euro;329,000 have been demolished or confiscated by the Israeli army and that approximately 600 structures, worth almost &euro;2.4 million, have been subject to orders for demolition, cessation of work or eviction by the Israeli army and are, therefore, under threat.<br\/><br\/>The next pages in the presentation include examples of photographs we have taken.  My colleagues and I have been on a programme out there.  Committee members will see a mix of EU-funded structures from different parts of the West Bank.  The first photographs are from an area called Khirbet Tana, an area in the north of the West Bank.  The building was a boys school funded with European money.  I took the photograph in February 2016.  One month later, a colleague sent me a photograph of the same school and it had been demolished.  The plaque on the top of the school is shown in detail in the photograph on the next page.  It is clear that the school building was an EU-funded project and that money that went to an Italian NGO to undertake the project.  The next photograph shows a school for a community in east Jerusalem.  Again, the destruction of EU-funded aid is clear in the following two pages.  The final photograph was taken in the Jordan Valley in the past week by a colleague.<br\/><br\/>On the basis of this data and the eyewitness testimony we have provided, I will outline a set of recommended steps that the committee could take to alleviate this destruction and, in line with international law, reaffirm Ireland's commitment to a just and lasting settlement of the conflict.  The Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel recommends that the committee should call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, to attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs ahead of the next meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  We recommend that the committee makes the recommendation that the Minister raise the need to ensure accountability for the forcible transfer of protected persons and the destruction of EU-funded humanitarian aid in the West Bank and draws attention to the creeping annexation of area C.  We recommend that the committee requests to be informed on the status of the destruction of EU humanitarian aid in the West Bank as well as the progress being made at the EU Foreign Affairs Council to counter this.  This should be done on a regular basis by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Dara Murphy.  We recommend that the joint committee request, as a matter of urgency, a debate in the D&aacute;il on this issue ahead of the next meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  We recommend that the members of the joint committee travel in an official capacity to the occupied West Bank to see the destruction and confiscation of this EU-funded humanitarian aid as it is being demolished.<br\/><br\/>I thank the members of the joint committee for their time and patience with our opening statement.

I cannot begin to imagine the feelings of those little boys in the photograph as their school is being torn down.<\/p> <p>  I admire the fact that the deputation is neither pro-Palestinian nor pro-Israeli.  The more I see of what goes on out there, the stronger my views become.  I wrote to the members of the Israeli Government at one stage.  I told them that the only thing they had learned from the treatment they received under the jackboot was that they learned how to wear a jackboot far better than those who had caused the holocaust.  Perhaps they are not sending people to gas chambers, but, by God, they are destroying lives.  I support everything the deputation has asked for, and more besides.  I will not ask the deputation to comment on anything I have to say.  I feel disgust and anger at what is the most blatant example of man's inhumanity to man.

The situation in America is going to make things even worse if we are to believe what we read in the newspapers and what we hear.  The wanton destruction of schools and property is dreadful.  In some cases, the homes, businesses and livelihoods of people are blown away overnight.  I cannot understand it.  As Senator Craughwell said, some of the greatest powers in the world have supported this for years.  I wonder how focused the UN is on this question.

That is certainly not the case here so I compliment the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  When one looks through the presentations and sees what has been outlined, one thinks of the saying that a picture paints a thousand words.  The witnesses did that very well in their presentation.  It is absolutely horrifying to see what is going on.  My colleague, Deputy Scanlon, and others will support their proposals in this and do whatever has to be done.  We need to increase focus, heighten awareness and continue to profile what is happening to bring attention to the fact that something needs to be done.  It is not acceptable.  One sees the school for example.  We have seen this far too often on different scales and spectrums in different countries where buildings and people's lives are destroyed by this type of action.  That is not acceptable or good enough any day in any country for anybody.  People are trying to build a life, progress themselves and then all of a sudden everything comes down around them.  It is absolutely shocking and horrible stuff.  If somebody gave Mr. Alex Dunne a blank sheet of paper and asked him what he feels needs to be done to assist in preventing what is happening at the moment and trying to get some level of normality back to the West Bank, what would he propose?  <\/p> <p>  I echo what Deputy Scanlon said.

I am aware of some of the work the witnesses are involved in and I am impressed by the group's pro-human rights and international law philosophy.  The group does not take sides and also has a philosophy of non-violence.  It is putting itself and its volunteers out there in the work it is doing.  I have no doubt they comes across some difficult stories and they bring those images back home.  That is part of the difficulty but there are also friendships and other things.<\/p> <p>  One of the difficulties we have as a committee is that people will want to look at the slides of Palestine and what has happened over the years.  It is unfortunate that people watching proceedings at home cannot see the slides.  At some stage we need to come up with mechanism through which viewers at home can see the presentations.  Many people follow these meetings and it is difficult to do so because if one is not looking at the slides, one does not see the information contained in them.  I do not know if that is something we can do.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses suggested a number of points for the committee to propose.  It is probably unusual that they have asked the committee to do something.  I support the group.  What do the witnesses think the EU can do?  We had the Commissioner in and one of the questions I wanted to ask was about Israel's favourable trading status with the EU.  At the same time, EU property and taxpayers' money is being destroyed by this.  One of the speakers said they do not understand how the world can agree to this.  I do not think anyone agrees to it.  I do not think people are aware of what is happening and what the Israeli army is doing on the ground.  That is part of it.  In some countries the difficulty is that as a result of war guilt, people do not want to be seen to raise this issue.  A country might be progressive on certain issues but will not raise what is happening to Palestine and will not make any criticism of what the Israelis are doing.  That is a difficulty.  That must be part of the discussion in the future.  How do we convince these people that these things are going on?  They are not going on in our name but they are going on and we are allowing these things to happen.<\/p> <p>  I am aware there is a worrying crackdown by Israeli Government on NGOs and civil society groups.  Have EAPPI and its volunteers been affected by this crackdown?  Has it become more difficult for EAPPI to operate?  Will the witnesses walk us through their own experience of demolition?  What actually happens?  What happens if there is an illegal Israeli settlement established in an area?  If it is established in a city, for example, in a block of flats or one apartment, what happens after that?   What does the Israeli army do to protect the settlers?  Does it make the area around it sterile and so on?  There are certain roads that Palestinians can travel which others cannot.  Were the witnesses allowed to travel on the international roads?  The witnesses are there to observe but they are not Palestinians and are not suffering the way Palestinians are so they probably would not go through the same difficulties such as checkpoints and so on.  That does not take away from the work they are doing.<\/p> <p>  Last year, the UN reported that many structures, funded partly or fully by international donors, were demolished in the West Bank in 2016.  The witnesses said there was a 96% increase.  Why is that?  Do the witnesses have a view on why that happened in 2016?  The witnesses must have a view on that even if it is not their group's official view.  In June 2016, the Israeli military demolished &euro;74 million-worth of EU-funded structures and projects in the West Bank.  How do we recoup those funds?  They are taxpayers' funds.  That money could do a lot of good.  People look at this and ask why we are sending more money.  How can that be recouped?  Is it a case of court cases?  How do we do it?  Will it happen through the trade sanctions that some people will suggest?  I have asked a question about what specific actions the witnesses would like to see coming from the EU. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017011800002#K00400","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Crowe.

EAPPI, as a programme, does not have a view on that and has not made a statement on whether it is for or against it.  What was remarkable about it was that it was the first time someone had been deported directly from Tel Aviv explicitly as a result of BDFs, which is a worrying trend because we do not have a stance on it.  To be deported for an ideology is worrying and challenging.<\/p><p>Some of the current legal steps that are going through the Israeli Knesset at the moment are seeking to advance Bills that could do the very same thing for Jewish people, Israelis and anyone around the world, that is, denying them entry into the country because of their report for BDS because that is essentially against Government policy.<br\/><br\/>Members raised a few other points.  How do we explain the current spike in demolitions and why now?  Since 2002 when the programme was established, what we as observers witnessed on the ground has been a successful Israeli Government policy of de facto annexation of huge parts of the West Bank and Area C, but we have not heard it as loudly and as clearly from different Israeli Governments as we hear it now.  We are now at a point where what we see on the ground is in tandem with the political discourse taking place within this coalition Government.  In practice and as outlined in the EU delegation's biannual report, of which the committee has a copy, discourse within the Israeli coalition at the moment has contributed to the creation of a coercive environment in the West Bank that aims to forcibly displace Palestinians from areas intended for settlement expansion.  Perhaps most alarming is that the rate of these demolitions and displacement practices has grown at a time when international opinion has been clearly stated in the Middle East Quartet report and the latest United Nations Security Council resolution and at the Paris peace conference that was held last Sunday and which our Minister attended.  In the background to all that, these demolitions have been increasing and that is worrying.<br\/><br\/>A structured dialogue between the European Union and Israel that was initiated in 2015 to look at this issue of demolitions is taking place.  In December 2014, the EU and its member states committed to taking certain concrete actions on the demolition of EU-funded structures if the situation on the ground continued to deteriorate.  This action included asking for compensation and calling for all demolished EU-funded structures to be listed publicly.  Further, in May 2016, the EU called on Israel for an immediate moratorium on the adverse developments in Area C.  According to press reports, the European ambassador has warned Israel that the continued demolitions were liable to harm EU-Israel relations.  So far, a group of member states are very supportive of the move forward with compensation claims but no concrete action on the issue has been made or taken by the Commission or the European External Action Service yet.<br\/><br\/>Members asked what can be done now, how the UN fits into this and how we can advance other international diplomatic efforts.First, we welcome the international efforts and the latest UN Security Council resolution of December.  We welcome the statements of Secretary of State John Kerry on Middle East peace.  We welcome the joint declaration in Paris on Sunday.  However, all of these international documents and fora are non-binding.  In reality they are recommendations.  We would like to see progress being made at European level and member state level on implementing some of these calls.  To further that aim, Ireland alone or with like-minded European states could call on the European Commission to audit the full scope of European-Israeli relations.<br\/><br\/>On the level of implementation of a differentiation of commitments and reporting back to the council, let us have a look at where the relationship between the EU and Israel stands at the moment and the agreements that are in place.  There was a freeze since 2009 on this going any further, but perhaps we can call on the Commission to examine it and see what parts need to be examined now in light of the deteriorating situation on the ground which, as we can see from the opening statement, the detail from the European Union, the United Nations and pretty much every international body in the world, is going in the wrong direction and away from a two-state solution.<br\/><br\/>Why the spike and what steps could be taken?  It is important to note that we fund these projects.  We pay for the buildings that are destroyed.  We pay for them in a centralised pot.  The EU's operational budget for last year was approximately &euro;141 billion.  We contribute approximately &euro;1.6 billion to it.  Of the total pot, approximately &euro;2 billion is used on humanitarian aid globally.  A fraction of our contribution - &euro;23 million - goes into that pot.  We can look at the demolition of these structures and ask if any Irish structure has been demolished outside the direct funding of two projects in the West Bank by Irish Aid.  Not one structure funded by Irish Aid has been demolished.  However, we can take the view that every single EU funded structure that is confiscated or demolished is ours.  Our taxpayers' money is going into it.  Ireland, with its significant historical background and experience of peace and conflict mediation, has a strong and powerful voice at a European level to push for claims for compensation for these assets and to draw a line in the sand and show that it is unacceptable for the structures to be demolished. <br\/><br\/>The reason the humanitarian assistance is in place is that Israel is not living up to its obligations under international law.  Under the fourth Geneva convention, Israel is supposed to provide for security, housing and access to education and water for the population in those areas it occupies.  When Israel in Area C does not live up to this obligation, the international community steps in.  In this situation, the European Union steps in and puts these assets on the ground.  That these assets are confiscated before they get to the ground or demolished when they get there is quite staggering.<br\/><br\/>To add one final point, I will quote from the minutes of a meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee which took place in the middle of last year.  I will send these minutes to the committee.  In speaking on the destruction of European aid and the establishment of firing zones in Area C, it should be known that Colonel Einav Shalev, who was the operations officer of the central command of the Israeli army, is on record as admitting that the establishment of firing zones in this same area in the West Bank is used to expel Palestinian communities.  In addressing a sub-committee of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that was discussing illegal Palestinian construction in Area C, he told it that military training in live fire zones in the West Bank is used as a way of reducing the number of Palestinians living nearby and was one of the main reasons the Israeli army has increased its training in the Jordan valley.  He stated that, &quot;in places where we [the Israeli army] significantly reduced the amount of training, weeds have grown&quot;.  He then spoke about the confiscation of international humanitarian aid before it reached its destination and stated that it serves as:<\/p><blockquote>a [blow] in the right places.  When you confiscate 10 large, white and expensive tents, it&rsquo;s not easy.  It&rsquo;s not simple to recover.<\/blockquote><p>I can send on those minutes to the committee.  For us, that these structures are being demolished to make way for the settlement enterprise in the West Bank, which is what we have been witnessing since 2002, shows a clear determination of policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017011800002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alex Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I am reluctant to open up the discussion again, but I will allow a brief question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017011800002#L00200","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Unfortunately I had to substitute in another committee.

I appreciate the opportunity to make a presentation from the Department's perspective on aspects of the funding of water services.  I am accompanied by Mr. Colm Lavery and Mr. Patrick O'Sullivan, principal officers in the water division of the Department.  <\/p> <p>  My understanding is that at the last meeting the committee had specific questions about the overall funding position prior to the establishment of Irish Water.  I will seek to address them, as well as providing some perspectives on the overall funding of the sector to assist the committee in its consideration of the expert commission's report.  As we have provided a detailed note with historical information on capital and operational costs, as well as forecasts to 2021, which I think all members of the committee have received, I will focus in this presentation on some of the key trends and relevant issues.<\/p> <p>  Prior to 2014, the Department managed two capital investment programmes - the multi-annual water services investment programme, WSIP, and the rural water programme, RWP.<\/p><p>Over the eight-year period 2006-13, just under &euro;3.5 billion in Exchequer resources was invested in water under these programmes.  The WSIP was focused on public water services capital projects valued over &euro;1 million, while the RWP covered investment in small public water and sewerage schemes valued at under &euro;1 million, as well as the recoupment to local authorities of grants paid to the non-public water sector, mainly the group water schemes.  The Exchequer grants for public water services projects generally covered about 75% of the overall costs.  The balance was funded by local authorities from revenue from commercial water charges, capital contributions from major users, the water component of development levies and borrowings.<\/p><p> Under these arrangements, the overall strategic direction of the WSIP and the projects outlined therein were selected by the Department following prioritisation by local authorities.  The advancement of projects through key stages required departmental approval and grant approval was provided on a project-by-project basis, with approvals setting the split between the Exchequer and local authority funding.  The capital expenditure on public water services in 2013, including the estimated local authority contribution, was approximately &euro;319 million.  At the end of 2013 local authorities had an outstanding debt in regard to borrowing for water and wastewater projects of approximately &euro;600 million.<\/p><p> Prior to 2014 local authorities were wholly responsible for operational expenditure decisions and operational costs were met from non-domestic charges and local authority own resources.  The most important of these own resources was the general purpose grant provided from the local government fund, LGF.  While the general purpose grant had reflected the commitment by the State to provide funding to local authorities in respect of domestic water services following the abolition of water charges in 1997, local authorities had discretion as to how they applied the general purpose grant across expenditure lines.  Based on local authorities' annual financial statements, and adjusting for services not transferred to Irish Water, the expenditure by local authorities on the operation of public water and wastewater services was about &euro;720 million in 2013 and would have risen to &euro;732 million in 2014, allowing for network growth and adjusting for the increases in commercial rates charges, which happened in 2014.<\/p><p> The capital funding for Irish Water in 2014, which was provided as a capital contribution from the Minister for Finance, was set at &euro;239 million, which would have been the same as under the previous Exchequer funding arrangements of the WSIP and RWP had they remained in place.  Irish Water utilised this funding and borrowings to finance a capital programme of &euro;740 million, including metering and establishment costs in 2014.  Overall, Irish Water operational costs in 2014, including financing costs, were &euro;778 million.  This covered functions transferred from local authorities, as well as new Irish Water activities.  This expenditure was financed from non-domestic revenue, borrowings and operational subvention.  The funding from the local government fund to Irish Water was based on an estimate of the net funding which would have been provided to local authorities towards water services from general purpose grants had the function remained with them, that is, operational costs less revenue from non-domestic charges with some adjustment for expected operational savings and the cost of financing the local authority outstanding debt as this did not transfer to Irish Water.  On this basis, the subvention to Irish Water in 2014 was &euro;439 million, approximately &euro;47 million was recouped to local authorities for their water financing costs and the general purpose grant to local authorities was reduced accordingly.<\/p><p> Funding arrangements from 2015 onwards have reflected the commencement of economic regulation and domestic water charges.  Capital funding is provided by a capital contribution from the Minister for Finance with the balance of capital expenditure facilitated through borrowing and customer revenue.  A total of &euro;406 million in capital funding was provided in 2015 and 2016.  An amount of &euro;270 million is scheduled for 2017 and similar amounts would be expected each year to 2020 under the Irish Water business plan.  The business plan did not envisage the requirement for a contribution in 2021 on the basis that capital expenditure in that year would be met wholly by borrowing and customer revenue.<\/p><p> Turning to the operational side, operational subvention to Irish Water is designed to cover the costs of providing the free allowance for children, capping water charges at &euro;160 or &euro;260 per annum depending on household size and capping the unit charge at &euro;3.70 for each 1,000 litres of water supplied and wastewater removed.  Funding is also provided for working capital, which reflects the time lag between charging and receipt of revenue.  On this basis, the Irish Water business plan generally reflects an average annual subvention of &euro;467 million and average working capital of &euro;32 million between 2017 and 2021.  In 2017, &euro;475 million is to be provided in line with the business plan and this is being increased by &euro;125 million to cover the suspension of water charges provided for in the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2016.  If water charging were to remain suspended in 2017 for domestic users, a further &euro;114 million would be required, bringing the total additional funding requirement in 2017 above the business plan projection to &euro;239 million.<\/p><p> I want to turn to comparisons between the operational expenditure under both models.  The Irish Water business plan forecasts efficiencies in operational expenditure of &euro;1.1 billion over the period to 2021, and these will be subject to scrutiny and challenge by the CER.  As a consequence, the operational costs, excluding financing costs, will reduce from &euro;769 million in 2014 to &euro;614 million in 2021 at 2015 prices.  By comparison, if the functions had been retained by local authorities, and allowing for the upward pressure in costs from new facilities and similarly excluding financing and commercial rates costs, it is estimated that the equivalent local authority figure in 2021 would have been of the order of &euro;695 million.<\/p><p> A couple of points need to be borne in mind when comparing operational costs under both models.  First, the PwC independent assessment in 2011, based on engagement with local authorities, recognised that operational expenditure by local authorities was artificially constrained for budgetary reasons.  This is supported by EPA analysis which indicates that while 34% of incidents associated with licensed wastewater discharges in 2012 were for capacity issues, including the need for infrastructural improvements, 38% of incidents were due to operation and maintenance issues.  PwC estimated that approximately &euro;60 million was required to address this operational expenditure, OPEX, backlog.  Second, there are costs reflected in the Irish Water model which would not have arisen for local authorities.  These include some costs related to the set-up, such as developing new systems and so on, which are treated as operational expenditure under accounting rules but are treated as capital expenditure by the CER.  It also includes a range of activities relating to new functions, for example, customer billing and running new asset management systems, as well as new programmes such as the first-fix programme.  Many of these costs would be characterised as &ldquo;spend to save&rdquo; programmes, that is, expenditure now to deliver future efficiencies.  Third, a much higher level of performance is expected from Irish Water operations across a range of metrics, including leakage, customer service, environmental compliance and reduction in boil water notices, as Irish Water avails of economies of scale and deploys new asset management systems and standard operational approaches.  A performance assessment framework is being put in place by the CER in this regard.<\/p><p> Considerable capital investment was made by local authorities over the period from 2000 to 2013, particularly to build new wastewater treatment capacity.  Exchequer capital spending on public water services peaked at &euro;432 million in 2009 but declined to &euro;319 million by 2013.  By comparison, the average core capital spending under the Irish Water business plan is &euro;590 million.<\/p><p>However, it is not only a question of the amount of funding required, it is also a matter of ensuring that the funding model supports the most efficient delivery of services, the right investment decisions and the appropriate balance between capital investment and ongoing maintenance.  Aside from the limitations on strategic planning and economies of scale presented by a dispersed model based on 34 authorities rather than a single regulated utility, the previous funding model faced particular challenges from: the absence of a national asset management system to inform prioritisation of capital maintenance and investment; funding lines which tended to incentivise capital investment over capital maintenance; a lack of certainty on overall Exchequer funding at a programme and project level over an extended period in light of the annual Exchequer budgetary process; and delays in project implementation due to misalignment in the availability of funding from the two main sources, namely, the Exchequer and local authorities.<br\/><br\/>From this experience, conclusions can be drawn on the key features of an efficient funding model for the future, particularly if such a model is to support the correct investment decisions and the most efficient operations in respect of water services.  These would include: that the model should ideally provide a level of certainty of funding over a multi-annual period to ensure appropriate strategic planning and timely delivery; decisions on operations and capital investment should be integrated and made by a single authority, and the sources of funding available should not skew this decision-making process; costs and outputs should be benchmarked against best practice internationally; and the funding model is likely to require an element of cost recovery and promotion of conservation to ensure compliance with the water framework directive.  On the latter point, the Minister has recently received further correspondence from the European Commission which, <i>inter alia<\/i>, points to the need for the recovery of costs to ensure that the serious maintenance and investment needs of the public water and wastewater system can be met.  I am aware that the question of compliance with the water framework directive will be dealt with at a future meeting of this committee, so I will focus on the other features of the funding model today.<br\/><br\/>From an organisational perspective, the single public water utility, with the new asset management approaches developed by Irish Water, can address the key issues relating to appropriate project selection, achieving economies of scale and securing greater efficiency in operations.  As described by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and Irish Water, the regulated approach ensures that the appropriate funding requirement over a reasonable time cycle is determined in an open and transparent manner, delivering efficiencies alongside service improvements.  Generally, for a regulated water utility, when the funding requirement is settled, the revenue can be raised through charges and borrowing, with some State support.  This gives the utility the greater certainty regarding its investment plans and operational decisions.  If, however, the model is reliant mainly on State support to cover this revenue requirement rather than charges, other options need to be examined to provide a level of assurance that the business plan of Irish Water can, following regulatory review, be delivered.<br\/><br\/>It has to be acknowledged that funding what the expert commission termed the &quot;regulatory settlement&quot; through general taxation inevitably introduces risks of funding shortfalls or funding uncertainty because water services funding would have to be considered as part of the normal budgetary process.  Ring-fenced funding would provide greater certainty and underpin delivery of the business plan but does present challenges for the normal management of the public finances.  There are examples, such as the local property tax or the plastic bag levy, where revenues raised are directed to particular areas.  It is fair to say that the greater the link between the revenue stream and its purpose, the more certainty can be provided on the funding environment for the utility and the greater the support for long-term planning, generation of efficiencies and service improvements.<br\/><br\/>There are also international examples of regulated utilities where the Government provides some guidance to the utility and the regulator as to the likely funding parameters over a multi-annual process.  The recent decision on the 2017-2018 revenue control period by the CER had some component of this approach.  The business plan for Irish Water to 2021, considered by Government, set out a perspective on the likely subvention and capital requirements over the period.  As such, the Department, in its engagement with Irish Water and the CER on the 2017-18 revenue control, indicated that the business plan projections represented the outer limits of State support.  In the first revenue control period, a ministerial policy direction was issued under section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 and this set some conditions for State funding.<br\/><br\/>The overall funding model also needs to support policy to address deficiencies in the non-public water sector.  In particular, significant capital funding is provided by the Department to the group water sector under the rural water multi-annual programme.  To ensure parity of treatment between the public water system and the group water sector, a system of operational subsidies was introduced for the group water sector from 1997.  These subsidies are paid to the schemes by local authorities, which are reimbursed in full for this expenditure from the local government fund.  The subsidies have been adjusted, following consultation with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, in light of the suspension of domestic water charges.  Approximately &euro;50 million is required on an annual basis to fund the non-public water services.<br\/><br\/>In summary, a stable multi-annual funding approach would underpin improvements in service and compliance by Irish Water.  In line with the Irish Water business plan, which is prepared on the basis of achieving such outcomes, an annual amount of approximately &euro;1.4 billion would be required by 2021 in order to fund the capital expenditure and operational expenditure cost of water and wastewater services not met by the non-domestic sector.  Ideally, the manner in which this is funded needs to ensure that best value for money is achieved from the existing asset base and that the correct operational and investment decisions are made to deliver the best outcomes for customers.  More detailed financial information is set out in the note we have provided for the committee and I am, of course, happy to answer any questions members may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017011800002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484746200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Graham.

I circulated a very short presentation to members.  The first slide sets out the background, outlining the rationale for trying to classify Irish Water as off-balance sheet.  As members are familiar with this, I do not need to go into it in any great detail.  The next slide shows that in July 2015 EUROSTAT took the decision that, for various reasons - the market test, the capping of fees and so forth - Irish Water should be classified within the general Government sector.<\/p> <p>  It is fair to say that it is unlikely, at least in the short term, that there would be any change to that classification.  In this sense, the role of the Department of Finance is twofold: we are responsible for fiscal planning over the short and medium terms - and, to an extent, the long term also - and for taxation policy.  From a fiscal planning perspective, the revenue and receipts from Irish Water are included in our latest medium term fiscal projections which were published alongside budget 2017.  What would be the fiscal impact should a decision be made to abolish domestic water charges?  I have set out our projections on slide 5 for the general Government balance over the period 2017-2021.  The actual general Government balance includes approximately 0.1% of gross domestic product, GDP, per annum in the form of additional revenue from domestic tariffs.  Members can see what the general Government balance would be if these domestic charges were abolished.  The deficit in 2017 and 2018 would be zero percentage points worse and the surplus from 2020 and 2021 would be approximately zero percentage points of GDP lower than we have assumed.<\/p><p>I refer to what this means in respect of the fiscal rules, which members are aware are legally binding.  We had a referendum on this in 2012 and we have our European requirements also.  We corrected the excessive deficit and it was brought below 3% of gross domestic product, GDP, in 2015.  We moved out of the so-called corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact and are now in the so-called preventive arm, which operates on the principle that prevention is better than cure.<\/p><p> The preventive arm sets targets for both the general government deficit and for general government debt.  What does this require?  It is government policy that we eliminate the structural deficit by 2018.  That is the deficit that would apply if one removed cyclical factors on both the revenue and expenditure sides.  On the basis of the projections in the budget, we will just about achieve that by 2018.  We are also required to reduce the general government debt to GDP ratio at a sufficient pace, namely to reduce the difference between the actual debt and 60% by five percentage points per annum.<\/p><p> The Irish Water business plan was agreed in October 2015 by the Government and it sets out its expenditure over the period.  It, of course, requires a revenue stream to fund this.  If water charges were to be abolished, a key question from the Department's perspective is whether taxation would be the appropriate mechanism to actually fund a public utility.  We do not fund electricity or gas through taxation, even though they are public utilities.  There is also the issue of the user pays principle.  From an economic perspective - I must stress I am not going into policy which is a matter for the Government - there would be reservations about this.<\/p><p> What does economics tell us about the taxation impact?  If water was to be funded from general taxation, we can look at Adam Smith's kinds of taxation.  There will be a pool of taxation which might have to be increased to fund this particular revenue stream.  Which particular tax head would be targeted?  We all know taxes are distortionary and have an impact on economic activity.  The insights of the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, are relevant in this perspective.  The OECD sets out various scenarios on which taxes are the most damaging to an economy in terms of labour market impact, competitiveness and so forth.  Equity would be another consideration that would need to be borne in mind.  The incidence of the tax also needs to be considered.  Who actually pays would be crucial.  The final canon is that the overall administrative cost of tax should be low relative to the yield.  It does not make sense to introduce a tax in which administrative costs are high if the yield is relatively low.<\/p><p> On the ring-fencing of tax revenue for particular expenditure, what is involved is tax revenue that amounts to 0.1% of GDP.  There are questions as to whether it would be appropriate to put in place a new and potentially expensive tax infrastructure when the yield is potentially relatively low.  I use the word \"relatively\" importantly here.  With respect to hypothecation, in the past there has been a long-standing principle that expenditure is funded from the general tax pool.  Hypothecation would essentially mean that the hands of government are tied.  In some respect, it would not be able to remove or reallocate revenue from a particular area as new priorities develop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017011800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484746200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. John McCarthy for his presentation.

As the Chairman said, it will be made available to members.  It is a short letter which follows on from the noting that the European Commission made in its submission to the expert commission.  It pointed out some issues around the directive being a flexible instrument allowing member states a margin of appreciation but it also referred to cost recovery and the polluter pays principle.  It stated that it is therefore important that the ongoing decision-making process leads to sound and lasting results which must bring Ireland back into compliance with the directive.  It gave some views from the Commission in terms of how a fair balance might be struck.  I highlighted one of them in the presentation, which was the recovery of costs and how we must ensure that Irish Water meets the infrastructure needs.  The letter also talked about how consumption of water might be set at a normal use, a reasonable level and charging for excess use.  It went into the components of the expert commission recommendation in that regard.  That is what will be addressed at the future meeting.<\/p> <p>  The issue around investment in wastewater infrastructure is relevant.  The Commission, in terms of compliance with the water framework directive and charging, has a number of open infringements with us with urban wastewater compliance.  Much of the &euro;5.5 billion in the Irish Water business plan is to address that infringement and bring us into compliance in that respect.<\/p><p>Similarly, regarding drinking water, we have a pilot infringement which requires investment in drinking water by both Irish Water and the rural water sector.

It is important for the committee to be clear that there are two separate funding issues in this discussion.  The first is water charges as a contribution to the operational costs of the utility and the impact the abolition of water charges would have on the Government's deficit and on meeting the fiscal targets.  A separate issue is water charges as part of a business model designed to take the utility off balance sheet to facilitate it to borrow in its own right and not to negatively impact the Government's debt-to-GDP ratio.  These are two separate matters that often get confused in the public debate.<\/p><p>My first questions are to the Department of housing.  Ms Graham mentioned the figure of &euro;239 million as being the overall cost of the abolition of water charges, but that is obviously the gross figure.  Could she confirm to the committee the net figure when the conservation grant, the cost of the billing regime, etc., are taken out?  That is the really important figure from the point of view of the deficit and fiscal targets.  She referred to the figure of &euro;50 million annually for non-public domestic water services.  Will she clarify whether that is the current cost to the State of its subvention?  If domestic water charges in the public system are to be abolished and there is to be equity, namely, if people not on the public domestic water system were not to pay anything, are there calculations of what the additional cost of that would be?  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, cited a figure of &euro;14 million in a <i>Sunday Times<\/i>interview at the start of the year as the estimated cost of an excess water charge, as recommended by the expert group.  Is this a calculation from Ms Graham's Department or from Irish Water, or does it come from somewhere else?<\/p><p>I know this is not the meeting to discuss fines and compliance, but just so people are clear, can Ms Graham outline a timeline in the case of, for example, the infringement proceedings in the urban wastewater directive?  This is an infringement proceeding that has been going on since 2012.  Some people think fines arrive immediately.  I ask the question so that people might have a sense of this.<\/p><p>Regarding fiscal impact, can the Department of Finance confirm the exact financial impact on the 2018 structural deficit target deadline if water charges were abolished?  Could it also confirm to the committee that this could be offset by, for example, fewer tax cuts - for example, an amendment to legislation effecting the abolition or the phasing out of the USC?  Could this cost be offset at the discretionary tax level?<\/p><p>Mr. McCarthy said it is unlikely Irish Water will be classified as off balance sheet in the medium term.  What does he mean by this?  The reason I ask is that in Irish Water's capital programme, its capital investment significantly increases from 2019 onwards from &euro;500 million currently to &euro;777 million and then up to about &euro;900 million.  Would this need to be off balance sheet to meet those borrowing targets, or would it allow the Government's debt reduction targets under the fiscal rules to be on balance sheet with that level of expenditure?<\/p><p>I have one final question about this.  Clearly, if the bulk of Irish Water's capital investment programme is borrowed - this is so under the current plan - there is an extra financing cost for that.  I have asked this a couple of times during Question Time.  I would like to know the additional cost to Irish Water or to the taxpayer from the borrowing over the eight years of the plan of the &euro;5.5 billion.  Can we have the prediction for this?<\/p><p>I appreciate the economic impact of the abolition of water charges, and I know this is sometimes difficult for economists but there is also a social impact of funding something through usage charges rather than general taxation.  Will the Department of Finance factor not just the straight economic impact but also the social impact into its assessments as to which is the best taxation model?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017011800002#J01200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484746200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first point, he is correct that regarding the water conservation grant, which is not being paid in 2017, the &euro;100 million has been netted off in the overall finances.

We try in negotiations with the federation to get a fair subsidy that essentially reflects the circumstances at the time when there were no water charges and what would cover most of the water charges.  The group water sector either gets water from the public system and then puts it through its networks or it has its own private sources.  The subsidy in each case reflects the system used.  Private users get the higher subsidies.  The subsidies are &euro;140 per household using a private system and &euro;70 for the public system.  We reduced the subsidies when domestic water charges were introduced to &euro;95 and &euro;40, respectively.  The aim of this calculation was to bring people into parity.

Some of my questions might cross over others asked already.  Ms Graham mentioned that the water debt from the local authorities did not transfer over to Irish Water.  Could she outline the amount involved, who picks up the tab for that or where is that taken care of as and from now?<\/p> <p>  I refer to the comparison in terms of the operational expenditure.  Is it fair to say that by 2021, the establishment of Irish Water will have brought about savings of approximately &euro;400 million, if we look at the figures of &euro;1.1 billion and &euro;695 million in those first few years?<\/p> <p>  The regulator was before the committee last week.  When we consider the level of pressure and scrutiny it is putting on Irish Water to bring about further savings and efficiencies in the coming years, is it fair to say that a comparable level of pressure was not put on the local authority system to be as efficient during that time or was there always pressure on the local authorities to try to do the best they could in that regard?  How do they compare?<\/p> <p>  In terms of the figures, to be clear, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is saying that if there are no water charges in 2017, &euro;114 million of Exchequer resources will be required.  Does the Department of Finance agree with that figure?  Is there clarity on that?<\/p> <p> How was Irish Water funded in 2016?  In particular, I would like to see the comparison between the first six months, when charges were in place, and the second six months.  In terms of the Exchequer, where did the money come from for that?  Ms Graham referenced &euro;50 million to fund non-public water services.  Is that &euro;50 million part of the &euro;114 million or is it in addition to it?<\/p> <p>  This question is specifically for the Department of Finance.  If we move away from a charging mechanism, ring fencing will be a key area for us as a committee.  One of the main advantages of having a charging mechanism was that we had a dedicated pot of money for investing to ensure we all had treated water to drink, that we put an end to raw sewage flowing into our rivers and that we were able to fix the many wastewater problems.  Without some type of ring fencing of a pot of money for water and wastewater services, my fear is that we will go back to the mistakes of the past where Government decided that the hospital and the school would always win over pipes in the ground that are not visible to the public.  I am concerned that we may go back to a process of not investing enough in our system.  Would Mr. McCarthy accept that the mistake made in the past was that when that pressure came on in difficult financial circumstances, decisions were made to not invest as much as should have been invested in water and wastewater services?  As a committee, that will be key to us in terms of any recommendations we make to the Oireachtas because we must ensure those mistakes are not made again.  If we move away from charges that would have brought in a pot of money that could have been used to invest directly in those services and without ring fencing of some type, we will have a difficulty in getting an assurance that the work Irish Water needs to do in the coming years from a conservation and quality water perspective can be done because the resources may not be made available by future Governments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017011800002#K00600","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484746200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>On the first question on the water debt, while the water debt of &euro;600 million that was in place in 2013 was held by local authorities, from the general finances perspective it is part of Government debt.  The decision was made that rather than transfer that to Irish Water, we would continue to finance it through the local government fund.  About &euro;450 million of that was with the Housing Finance Agency and &euro;150 million with commercial lenders.  The funding from the Housing Finance Agency was raised by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, so it was wound back into the NTMA, which is looking after that.  We are continuing to give resources on an annual basis to local authorities on the commercial debt still outstanding as that is wound down.  It comes out of the local government fund.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the operational savings, the business plan for Irish Water is &euro;1.1 billion over the period of the plan to 2021.  That is what it has said it can achieve, and it is held to account for that by the regulator, who may look for further savings beyond that.<\/p> <p>  The key feature in comparing the local authority system and the Irish Water system is that the regulator is looking over a multi-annual period whereas local authorities have operational budgets set by whatever financing they have on a year-by-year basis.  The regulator is benchmarking, by international standards, to determine where operational costs should go over a period of time.  It is a different perspective and a different way of going about it whereas a local authority, and some members of the committee may have been members of authorities, is dealing with a budget and what it has to do on a year-by-year basis.  That is one of the key features.<\/p> <p>  In the note we gave members they will see that the operational spending in the years immediately prior to moving to Irish Water remained fairly steady even though there would have been pressure from new facilities coming on-stream.  That reflects the fact that money was not going into capital maintenance.  That is what the PricewaterhouseCoopers report I mentioned was referring to.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the rural water programme, the &euro;114 million I mentioned is purely Irish Water.  It is the extra funding we would have to give in this year.  With regard to the &euro;50 million I referred to, the subsidies to the rural water sector are approximately &euro;24 million in 2017 and the rural water programme is of the order of &euro;18 million.

A lot of the presentation I have heard seems to be a justification for the existence of Irish Water, which we are not discussing at all.<\/p> <p>  The expert committee appeared to recommend that there should be absolute equity between people who are getting their water supply through group water schemes and those who get it from the public mains.  Has Mr. McCarthy calculated how much of a subsidy would be necessary for the group water supply schemes to bring that about?  <\/p> <p>  In reply to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I think Mr. McCarthy said the loss of &euro;125 million to the Exchequer from abolishing water charges included the abolition of the water conservation grant.  What rate of compliance is that based on?  Is it 90%, 95% or the 50% to 55% rate of compliance we have had?  In arriving at that figure, is Mr. McCarthy counting in the cost of repaying the borrowings that Irish Water incurs, which I understand is very high?  <\/p> <p>  On page 6 of Mr. McCarthy's presentation he seems to suggest that ring fencing would be more necessary if the model was entirely reliant on State support than if it was reliant on charges plus some State support.  What is the logic of that?  Is Mr. McCarthy suggesting that if it was not totally reliant on State support and if there were charges, then it would be more certain because the charges could be increased to meet the requirements in any particular year?  If Mr. McCarthy is talking about this in the context of capped charges, it does not make any sense to me.<\/p> <p>  What is Irish Water's capacity to borrow now?  Can it borrow and, if so, at what sort of rates?  We are told that Ervia has prepared a report on future funding models.  I am fascinated by the prospect of seeing what will be in that report.  Is it completed and available?  If so, can we have a copy of it?<\/p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy indicated that he did not agree that direct taxation was the correct way to fund a model such as Irish Water.  He cited electricity and gas companies but with all due respect, that is a matter of policy.  He said that policy was not his remit.  When governments are looking at various things they must take into account matters other than the purely economic implications.<\/p> <p>  I would like Mr. McCarthy to elaborate on one point he made.  He mentioned that one of the principles of taxation was that if it cost too much to raise, it was not a particularly efficient form of taxation.  Is what has been happening here not a textbook example of that?  There are billing systems, interest payments on borrowings and water conservation grants but they are hardly worth the candle.  We are still not absolutely clear what the net cost to the Exchequer would be if we were to abolish water charges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017011800002#L00200","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1484746200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>And the net take, not the aspirational take or the 100% compliance take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017011800002#L00300","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1484746200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>What percentage of compliance is it based on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017011800002#L00350","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484746200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I will take Deputy O'Dea's questions in order.

That relates back to our past experience when water charges were not in place.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea referred to the comments set out in page 6.  To be clear, what I intended from the comments pertained to the delivery of the Irish Water business plan.  If the objective is to deliver the investment and operational efficiencies in the plan, the question is how is it funded.  If there are charges like other utilities, that gives the greatest range of certainty to the utility itself.  It was not a commentary on a policy.  It was simply saying that from a utility perspective, if most of its money is coming from its customers, it is doing the projections on customer revenue and applying it to its operations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017011800002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1484746200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Surely it must adjust the charges depending on how much the State could afford to subvent them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017011800002#L00500","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484746200,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Yes, and in the business plan, a steady domestic capped revenue of &euro;475 million was set out.  The secondary point was that if there were no charges, then the choice appears to be general taxation or ring fencing.  Mr. McCarthy has teased out some of the issues with both those approaches.  In other words, ring fencing means that some form of taxation is particularly earmarked for that water investment.  It would give greater certainty to the utility but my colleague has set out some of the issues from a broader public finance perspective.  It is simply saying that there seem to be different ways of approaching it and is asking, if one wants to fund the same money, from where does the money come.<\/p> <p>  As regards borrowing by Irish Water, to date, ministerial consent has been given for an amount of &euro;810 million with various commercial banks.  We understand that the weighted average margin on these facilities is of the order of 1.5%.  Last year, NewERA did a report for the relevant Ministers looking at - in the context in which we now find ourselves - the most sensible way for borrowing by Irish Water to arise.  Should it continue to be through commercial banks?  The original plan would have been to start with short-term facilities, because they were working off-balance sheet and then to move to cheaper long-term facilities.  <\/p> <p>  As my colleague said, in the short term, even under some element of water charging, the decision of EUROSTAT was on-balance-sheet and is unlikely to be reviewed in the near term.  What is the best way, therefore, of funding that borrowing?  NewERA has completed that report, which contains considerable commercial information.  We are redacting that out with a view to having the report available to the committee by the end of the week.  We will send that on.  In teasing out the options, the question is: what is the cost of borrowing through a commercial lender and what would be the cost if the State took on that borrowing?  The conclusion was that we would move to State funding.  <\/p> <p>  By the end of the business plan, one is talking of debt in the order of &euro;3 billion, in terms of where it is coming from.  Ultimately, however, all of the Irish Water capital expenditure, CAPEX, and operational expenditure, OPEX, as well as the debt, is reflected in Government debt and on the Government balance sheet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017011800002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484746200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>On page 8 of the presentation, the first bullet point says that policy choices are a matter for Government.

I will address my questions to Ms Graham.  In her comments on proving compliance with a directive she said the burden of proof was on the member state concerned.  That seems to be completely inaccurate.  In the European Court of Justice <i>v<\/i>. Greece, C 600\/12, the court reiterated that, according to case law on the burden of proof in infringement proceedings under Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it was for the European Commission to establish an alleged breach.  Will Ms Graham correct her remarks and tell us from where she obtained the information that the reverse was the case, as according to the European Court of Justice, it is the court that decides, not the Commission, on whether there has been a breach.<\/p><p>My second question relates to the financing costs.  According to the document, they will balloon over time, with the result that by 2021, &euro;73 million will have been spent, including interest on loans.  According to Ervia, as indicated last week, it is charged a higher rate of interest than would be the case if the State had borrowed directly.  By 2021, &euro;1 in every &euro;10 spent by Irish Water will be spent in meeting financing costs.  If we were to return to the water billing model, over &euro;1 in every &euro;4 raised by Irish Water in water charges would be spent in meeting financing costs.  When one considers that the off balance sheet model is no more, at least in the medium term, why borrow at rates higher than those at which the State can borrow directly?  There seems to be no benefit, only additional costs.  Linked with this, the loans are probably secured on the assets of Irish Water.  I presume if the loans were not repaid, the security could be called in.  That was the model of privatisation which led to disaster in Detroit where there was an attempt to provide for off balance sheet funding of services, with the result that $1 in every $2 raised by Detroit Water went directly to pay the bondholders.<\/p><p>My third question relates to group water schemes.  It is correct to say that in February 2015 the group water scheme subsidy was cut from the maximum figure of &euro;140 to &euro;95 per house and that it was restored following the suspension of water charges.  Therefore, instead of there being a division between Irish Water and group water schemes, it is fair to say that with the forced suspension of water charges those involved in group water schemes also benefited and there is no division between the two groups.<\/p><p>I have a question on EUROSTAT for Mr. McCarthy.  I have the report from EUROSTAT and also a description of the European system of accounts.  One of the elements is that sellers act to maximise their profits in the long term to qualify for off balance sheet accounting.  A particular criticism was made about the lack of economically significant prices.  Is it fair to say that according to EUROSTAT, in order to qualify for off balance sheet accounting, in reality it means an increase in water charges?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017011800002#M01400","speaker":"1308"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484746200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Let me respond to Deputy's first question on the burden of proof.

One of the expert commission recommendations is that we should fund personal and normal domestic use from general taxation.  I have specific questions.  The new word \"hypothecation\" will become very relevant and I thank the Department of Finance for outlining what it means.  We must be sensitive about the policy areas relating to Government but it is definitely the elephant in the room.  We have two choices.  We need a dedicated revenue stream if we are to provide a sustainable supply of water to meet what the expert commission is recommending to us.  That is an adequate allowance for personal domestic users.  How do we provide that dedicated revenue stream?  Do we provide it through the charging system that was in existence or by ring-fencing funding.  The committee would set a precedent by recommending that as it would automatically recommend that policy decisions would be decided by committee rather than the Government.  Am I correct in assuming that as a result of what the Department has outlined?  If that is the case, why are there no similar joint Oireachtas committees for health, education and various other sectors, including housing, that see critical demand but are not achieving the same focus or attention from officials and policymakers like ourselves?<\/p> <p>  Acceptable level of usage will be critical to our deliberations.  It is recommended by the expert commission that there would be a free allowance to an acceptable level of usage.  Figures have been provided by the housing Department but in Ms Graham's view, what is an acceptable level of usage and is adequate funding provided in the business plan as outlined?  That would include funding to deal with quality of water, compliance obligations and asset management systems to ensure sustainability of supply.  I presume this is allowed for in the business plan.  How does that equate to the acceptable level of usage model now proposed by the expert commission?  This must be determined by recommendation by the Commission for Energy Regulation and the public water forum but I am interested to hear the Department's view because of its experience in the area.  What is the effect in terms of cost and being able to sustain that type of system?<\/p> <p>  My next question is important and some members have already raised the issue.  It relates to equity and fairness.<\/p><p>Group water schemes have already been mentioned.  The costs in providing equality of access to quality water for people on a public system and those on a group water system have not been properly analysed.  The figures being quoted so far at this committee are essentially going back to what the subsidy being provided prior to water charges was.  Even with that subsidy, people on group water schemes were paying substantial fees to maintain their systems.  If I am right in understanding what the expert commission is recommending, a normal acceptable allowance would be free to public consumers.  By comparison and for the sake of equity, that normal acceptable allowance should also apply to those people on group water schemes.  Has that analysis been done?  There is a critical difference.  If a free allowance is applied to a public user, that same allowance should be applied to a person on a group water scheme.  That then obviously brings greater costs in terms of subsidy to ensure quality and sustainability of supply to people on group water schemes.<\/p><p> I hope I have made that clear.  We have two systems of supply in this country: people who supply themselves either through group water schemes or private wells and people who are on the public system.  A greater subsidy will be required to ensure that people providing water for themselves or through group water schemes have equal treatment to those who are not going to be charged under the public system if what was proposed by the expert commission goes ahead.  I hope I am clear on that.  If we are going to call a spade a spade, as Deputy Cowen said earlier on, this is going to come down to a revenue stream of funding either by charging or by ring-fencing, which would be a precedent, in my opinion, for the way in which budgetary allocations are made by a Government.  If the committee is going to decide that the funding will be ring-fenced, why would that not apply across the board in other critical sectors?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017011800002#N03000","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484746200,"counter":183,"content":"<p>In response to the first question the Senator asked, the business plan developed by Irish Water to 2021 sets very particular targets in terms of investment to meet infringements, address leakage and all of the key things that seem possible with that level of investment and achievable over that period.  That is reflected in the business plan.  Obviously, the funding reflects the total use of water and the question then arises as to what an acceptable level of usage would be.  The Department has not prepared anything at this stage on what our view would be on that.  The Senator mentioned CER and the public water forum having a role, as the expert commission suggested.  In looking at other utilities in which there have been water charges for some time, there are people who are low, medium and high users.  A normal usage is something that reflects a good and proper conservative usage of water.  What the margins might be above the average usage that would reflect a normal level is something that will need to be tested.  I know that Irish Water has provided consumption figures.

However, as I said, we can run two scenarios if the committee wishes.<\/p> <p>  As mentioned earlier, there are people who are paying for water in the rural water sector.  Some of that is because of agricultural use.  When we reduced the subsidy when domestic water charges came in, we were trying to ensure there was fair treatment.  We were trying to see what the impact was.  We did some work with the federation to get some ideas on what was the average cost being borne by people in order that the average cost to the group water sector was similar to the average cost borne by the Irish Water customer.  When we were talking to the federation, one of the approaches was to set out the principles by which we would try to get a subsidy system that was amenable to it, given that there is a range of group water schemes that are not under Irish Water and are not big systems.  We were trying to bring in a subsidy that reflected the fact that there were capped charges, free allowances for children and a product subsidy.  I can pass these on to the committee.  The principles underpinning the subsidy were to ensure there was fair treatment between drinking water consumers in the public and group sectors, taking into account the inherent differences in the structure, funding and organisation between the sectors, including the ability of individual schemes to set the price of water based on their local circumstances.  There had to be a recognition of their particular cost structures, particularly as some of them have had expensive design, build and operate schemes put in for which we would have to continue to recoup local authorities on subsidy claims.  Subsidy had to be tied to things like customer charters, compliance, optimal management and operational practice and the receipt of capital grants.  The arrangements had to be as straightforward as possible to reflect the scale of the sector.  It was important for the federation that, whatever the arrangements made, they were not too much of an administrative burden.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017011800002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1484746200,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt Ms Graham but a significant amount of that is going to come under the section on equity and fairness.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Fitzgerald, who is deputy chief executive of one of the association's members, the Beacon Hospital.  He has extensive experience in hospital management in both public and private sectors.  He will offer his insight into the potential for the future of health care.<\/p> <p>  Members will have received the association's submission last August.  It sets out the extent of acute medical and mental health care provided in private hospitals in Ireland.  We employ over 8,000 staff and provide 2,500 beds for patients on an ongoing basis.  This enables us to provide, among other things, 250,000 inpatient procedures, 3 million diagnostic tests, over 1 million bed nights to patients and 10% of Ireland's inpatient mental health care annually.<\/p> <p>  We estimate that 50% of all elective procedures in Ireland last year were performed in our members' hospitals.  In addition, half of our hospitals operate either emergency departments or medical assessment units, which in total see more than 1,000 patients each week, admitting at least 250 of them thus providing an estimated 100,000 bed nights of medical care to patients admitted on an emergency basis each year.  I have highlighted these numbers to the committee because they illustrate the scale of care provided by private hospitals.  Such care, in our absence, would fall upon the State and the public system as an additional burden.<\/p> <p>  Earlier in 2016, the association made proposals to the Department of Health with the aim of fostering closer partnership between the public and private systems in the coming years.  We believe there is scope for closer collaboration on several fronts, including reducing waiting lists, tackling overcrowding in emergency departments, recruiting health care professionals and adopting a strategic approach to capital planning.  We are working through several of these ideas with the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>  One welcome innovation has been the reintroduction of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  While the resources available to be spent in 2017 are relatively modest, PHA members will be able to respond and provide treatment to some of the longest waiting patients on public lists over the coming months.  Earlier treatment of those on waiting lists is important for patients but it also brings significant savings to the Exchequer as an increasing complexity of conditions, as they develop, is avoided.<\/p> <p>  Looking forward, the PHA would encourage the committee to take a whole of system approach to planning the future of health care.  It should acknowledge the scope for partnership in delivery between public and private systems and take the following into account: The contribution that private hospitals already make; the modern infrastructure in which we have invested and continue to invest; the highly skilled personnel working in our hospitals; and the capacity we have to work with the public system with hospital groups, community health organisations, etc. <\/p> <p>  In conclusion, as set out in more detail in our submission, the association recommends that the committee does the following four things.  We would like it to acknowledge the mixed nature of health care provision in Ireland and the significant proportion of care delivered by private hospitals.  We hope that the committee will offer a strategic vision of health care in Ireland in ten years' time that recognises the benefits of the mixed delivery system and provides a stable environment for investment in the sector.  We would encourage the committee to focus on the primary care services, which is something that all of the delegations that have met the committee have emphasised.  We want the primary care services, as they develop, to integrate successfully with all of the providers of hospital care.  Therefore, there must be a joined up arrangement between primary and continuing care.  The association also wants the committee to place an emphasis on health sector recruitment and the need for a sustained focus on attracting nurses, doctors and other clinical specialists to work in Ireland.<\/p><p> We recommend the establishment of an expert skills group on the medical professions which tackles all of this in a holistic way.  I know the committee has spoken on several occasions about the importance of e-health and we would like to underline what we see as the importance of investment in e-health as an enabler of truly joined-up health care, facilitating best crossover between different health care providers.  Finally, we urge the committee to support closer cooperation on patient care between public and private systems during the transition between now and 2026.   <\/p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Fitzgerald. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Nugent","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484730000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for their invitation.  I have worked for over 25 years in management in the Irish health care system in the public and private settings.  This committee should give serious consideration to planning a health care system based on all capacity available in public and private settings.  I am not referring only to private hospitals but to all infrastructure.  For example, on any main street in the country one will find private sector operators such as general practitioners, pharmacists, dentists, ophthalmologists, wellness providers and many other health care businesses, nursing homes, etc.  Too often there is an ideological debate regarding the existence of private health care which is narrowly focused on private hospitals.  Health care in Ireland is an ecosystem with many intertwined operators.<\/p> <p>  My organisation, Beacon Hospital, employs just under 1,000 staff and contributes significantly to the economy, for example, we pay approximately &euro;25 million a year in income tax.  Over 90% of staff working in private hospitals were trained in the public system and a fair proportion work in both systems.  Front-line staff should be commended on their work in both systems and many deliberately choose a career of diversity.  They are agnostic on whether they work in the public or private system because their main work ethic is focused on providing safe, effective care to their patients in contemporary facilities.  Without the option of working in the private system I suspect many front-line staff would leave for new shores.  I am satisfied that the medical care provided to patients in the private system is of equal clinical efficacy to that in the public system.  The committee may know that private hospitals are subject to external accreditation.  Private hospitals must hold a valid accreditation certificate to receive funding from health insurers and to be a member of the association.  This is not the case for public hospitals.  For example, recently Beacon Hospital successfully completed its fourth triannual cycle of external accreditation audit and was awarded a performance score of 99.4% across 1,200 measurable elements, which I understand is one of the highest scores ever.  <\/p> <p>  In recent weeks we have read about, and are acutely aware of, the capacity challenges being faced daily in the public health care sector.  The private system has capacity and is part of the solution to these constraints.  In my previous role I frequently availed of services provided by the private system to solve capacity constraints.  In future there is ample opportunity for the public and private systems to collaborate and provide innovative cost-effective solutions for the provision of health care to all citizens.  <\/p> <p>  In conclusion, I recommend that the committee consider establishing a task force to explore innovative, cost-effective private sector capacity utilisation, absorb the fact that Ireland is an ecosystem of public and private providers.  A private health care system is a significant contributor to the economy.  In my experience, front-line staff trained in the public system seek diversity of employment and the private system provides a solution to the problem of staff retention.  The private system is and should be accredited.  That is a standard we have to meet. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for those submissions.<\/p><p>I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

Mr. Fitzgerald said that too often there is an ideological debate about private health care.  I would say that too often there is not.<\/p> <p>  As I understand it, there is no crisis in respect of recruitment and retention in the private sector.  That exists in the public sector.  How do rates of pay for the staff in the private sector compare with those in the public sector?  We can exclude nurses because there is a direct comparison.  I refer specifically to support staff, canteen staff, theatre porters and people like them.  Are they directly employed or are they agency staff?<\/p><p>What functions are outsourced within the private sector?  I am also interested to know how many of the people the association represents have collective agreements with recognised trade unions.  When we talk about the beds, one cannot compare like for like.  Obviously, an ICU bed is not the same as a bed for somebody who is recovering from an operation overnight and who will go home the next morning.

I am open to correction if I am wrong but my impression is that many people are transferred from the private sector to the public sector when their care needs become more acute, or we could say more expensive.  Patients are transferred by ambulance, using probably a public ambulance or certainly an ambulance paid for by the public purse, into the public system from the private system.  I note that two hospitals participated in HIPE, the hospital in-patient enquiry scheme, but they do not do so now.  It is very difficult for public representatives when we do not have these figures.  Perhaps Mr. Nugent could comment on that issue.  I may be looking in the wrong place and I am open to correction in that regard.

Reference was made to the number of inpatients, which I believe is in the region of 250,000.  There were specific comments about the emergency departments, procedures, hip operations, average length of stay and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of emergency departments and patients being transferred from a private to a public hospital, it was reflected in commentary from all the Deputies that perhaps this was in the context of perverse incentives.  I can use examples in both systems because I have worked in both.  There are basically four types of patients who are transferred.  First, there are patients who go by ambulance.  Clearly, private hospitals are not funded to take ambulance transfers, which is a choice.  If the Government wishes to fund private hospitals so they are open 24-7 and can take ambulance transfers, we would certainly look at it.  Second, there are patients who require significant intervention, for example, a patient with a brain tumour.  These are small volume numbers of patients.  It is not in the interests of the State to have lots of providers treating small numbers of patients, and in fact there would not be the specialists to do it.  The private system will not do that because it is not funded to do it and it would not make the best use of resources as one would not find the surgeons.<\/p> <p>  Third, on occasion a patient might arrive at our emergency departments who might need, for example, an ear nose and throat, ENT, consultant and at that moment, although we have ENT consultants, we would not have one available.  This happens all the time in the public system also.  In that context we encourage the patient to go where he or she can, if we deem it to be urgent, whether that is to a public emergency department or one of our sister private hospitals.  The fourth type of transfer is probably the one that comes up a lot.  It is when patients come to the emergency department of a private hospital and there are no beds.  This is not dissimilar to a public hospital.  In that case, we offer the opportunity to the patients to remain in the hospital under medical supervision, we probably give them a light lunch if they can have food, we will try to admit them later in the day or if they are well enough, they can go home and come back the next day.  The bottom line is that we are genuinely only interested in looking after the patient.  We want to make sure patients get the best treatment they need and if they are really sick they are treated quickly.  If they are really sick, they may choose to go to a public emergency department because they feel they will get the care they need in that setting.  That was reflective of a number of queries.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to some of the specifics on procedures.  Some 40% of patients typically in private hospitals are classed as medical patients with respiratory or gastroenterology problems and about 60% are elective patients for general surgery.  We are seeing a huge demand, particularly through our emergency departments, from more medical patients.  Last week, we had over 60 medical patients out of, I believe, 143 patients on one day.  That is a significant number for us.  The elective patients cover areas such as orthopaedics, cardiology, which are the bigger of the general surgery types, vascular surgery and cancer.  They are the big elective areas one will find in the private system.<\/p> <p>  The average length of stay for a medical patient is typically about four days.  My comparison with that, and we watch this every month with our board, is the published public figure of seven days, but in my experience in my previous career I have seen stays of over ten days.  Reference was made to the NTPF and volumes, which are actually quite low.  Last year, it would have been in the order of perhaps 2.5% to 3% of our overall revenue.  Just over 90% of our revenue comes from insurance companies and the rest comes from self-pay, the NTPF or patients who come from abroad seeking treatment in the State.<\/p> <p>  There is a full range of diagnostic tests.  In all the private hospitals, there are full laboratory capability, full radiology capability and full endoscopy capability, which is the main diagnostic test that patients seek.<\/p><p>In fact, there are specialist areas in our hospital that are not provided in the public system for which public patients come in by way of service level agreements with the HSE.<\/p><p> MRI costs is an interesting area.  MRI is the only area, under legislation, in the public system for which the public system can charge.  For all the diagnostic tests that private patients receive in the public system, MRI is the only one for which there can be a charge.<\/p><p> Cost was referred to but I refer to price in my current life because I have to negotiate price with our funders.  We have different prices with different funders, and that is a commercial discussion.  We have different prices for self-pay patients.  Our patients pay less for self-pay MRI and other diagnostics than we would receive from the insurers.  That is a commercial conversation.<\/p><p> We have faced the same recruitment challenges the public system faced.  We have just over 300 nurses but when I joined my current employer we had more than 30 vacancies, which is 10% of our nurses.  We went abroad to the Middle East and anywhere we could and we practically filled all those vacancies in the last 12 months.  The last time I looked we had five vacancies.  Interestingly, I have noticed a trend in the last few months of a lot more CVs coming in from nurses who want to take up roles in the private system.<\/p><p> I need to mention doctors.  I know there is a view about salaries, history and contracts.  I talk to young surgeons in Australia, North America and the UK predominantly who want to come back.  In fact, I lecture in Trinity College and UCD on health care management, and I lecture doctors who want to look at a career.  Doctors want to come back, but it is not just about the salary.  There is a mixture of issues, such as training and career advancement.  Having said that, I have noticed in the last six months that we are having some success.  There are more doctors coming to us now who want a salary in the private system, and will offer their services to the public system.  I am seeing that trend.  It is starting to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#G01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Fitzgerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Just to clarify that last point, Mr. Fitzgerald, you said you have noticed more doctors?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#H00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484730000,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I have noticed a trend.

There was a question about intensive care, and it is an interesting area.  There is lots of capacity in intensive care in the private system, particularly in Dublin, and there are cases today of patients being transferred to Belfast from public hospitals.  In fact, there are patients I am aware of in public hospitals in medical beds that should be in intensive care for the proper treatment.  Some of these patients have health insurance, but their health insurance does not pay the full cost of ICU, so there is a supplement required.  The families, I am sure, cannot pay the supplements.  It is an interesting topic.  In my previous role I transferred patients to intensive care in private hospitals.  If the committee is really interested in that area, I would suggest it talks to Dr. Stephen Frohlich, who is an intensivist in Blackrock Clinic.  He is well regarded, and he has written extensively on ICU in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The last issue is hospital in-patient enquiry, HIPE.  We are not required to be a part of HIPE.

Some of the detail has already been raised but the witnesses spoke about closer integration between the systems, including the primary care system, the public health system in an acute hospital setting and private hospitals.  Reference has been made to an ideological debate and we had such a debate some years ago in the context of co-location.  That was quite divisive.  When the witness speaks about closer integration and co-operation with the public system, what does he imagine or propose?  Would it be in the context of service level agreements or is there more intertwining in the view of the witness?<\/p> <p>  The complexity issue is often raised and there is always the suspicion that there is cherry-picking of patients, with those cases that are more complex and potentially more costly being referred to the public hospital system.  I assume the public hospital system would still be paid by the insurer when there is a referral from a private hospital.  Will the witness provide some clarity on the issue?  Mr. Fitzgerald has indicated he has no evidence of overtesting.  In speaking to insurers, they might say the opposite is the case and there is a need to be very vigilant about the number of diagnoses a person is put through to ascertain health status.  It has been raised with me by insurers.  There are other views on the matter so I would like more clarity on it.<\/p> <p>  I presume the accident and emergency departments mentioned by the witnesses are primarily urgent care centres in a real context.  To be honest, they are not places one would go with heavy trauma.  What complexity of case could be dealt with when a patient comes through the door of the accident and emergency department?  Are they the type of Swiftcare operations with which most people would be familiar?<\/p> <p>  The association cannot speak for each individual hospital.  There is much highly specialised diagnostic equipment in private hospitals and it is probably much better than what we see in many of our public hospitals.  What sort of process is used to procure that type of equipment?  Is it done through lend-lease management systems, full capital buy-out or is there a myriad of contracts?  Who maintains and services the equipment?  Are there purchase or maintenance service level agreements in place?  It seems that in the public system everything is purchased upfront and maintained through either the hospital's maintenance systems or some form of lower level maintenance contracts.  Will the witness provide some clarity on what happens in the private sector?<\/p> <p>  I do not want to repeat the issue but there is a shortage of consultants in the country and the public health system has a very difficult task in trying to recruit or even maintain staff.  A large number of consultants are completing fellowships abroad, as the witnesses have indicated, and attracting them home is proving very difficult.  I understand the commercial confidentiality aspect but when the witness said hospitals are recruiting consultants who would traditionally have gone to the public sector, what types of remuneration packages over and above the public health contracts are being offered?  I am not referring to a specific context but the loose talk around the private health providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#J02600","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.

With regard to recruitment, he said he has little problem in completing the cohort of nurses and doctors.  Will Mr. Fitzgerald explain how there is such a difference between the private and public when it comes to recruiting doctors and nurses?  Will the witness speak about information technology within the private system, specifically how it works to increase efficiency?

The National Treatment Purchase Fund is a good example.  Where there is excess demand in the public system for elective procedures, the NTPF works increasingly well in that patients are transferred to private hospitals to be treated there.  In a range of other areas, if we join the systems up more closely, we can loosen up all of the resources that are available across the health system and make them work effectively together.  For example, private hospitals from time to time also have issues of delayed discharge of patients who are not able to leave and free up the beds, just as in public hospitals.  It would be advantageous if we could have a better arrangement with community health organisations in order to arrange the discharge of those patients so they could avail of services in the community.  That is just one example.<\/p> <p>  Much of this boils down to arrangements at local level.  The challenges facing hospitals in the public system vary from geography to geography, and the availability of private hospitals to respond varies from geography to geography also.  To take places like Cork or Galway, a lot could be achieved if there was a policy of encouraging the private hospitals and the hospital groups to sit down and work out what they might effectively do together.  There are quite a few things that could be done in that area.  As I said, we have set up a working party with the Department of Health to work through some of these issues.  It met in December and is due to meet again at the end of the month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Nugent"},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Is this working party comprised of officials from the Department of Health and the Private Hospitals Association?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#K00300","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484730000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Nugent"},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Will there be a report or is it just-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#K00500","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484730000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Hopefully, there will be practical outcomes.

I have explained about some of the cohorts of patients, so I do not want to go over that ground.  We take patients with strokes and patients who are having cardiac events.  We have an ICU with 14 beds and eight staff because that is the relevant demand that exists.  We have 24-7 anaesthetic cover and medical cover.  Therefore, in terms of the experience I have in both settings, it is the same for that cohort of patients, notwithstanding the other patients who are referred elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  On diagnostics, the point I was making earlier is that we have no incentive to over-test.  We do not get paid for each individual test, unlike the fee-for-service approach one would find in North America.  We get paid a package price regardless, so if we do ten MRIs, we get the same rate.  As happens in the public system also, there is mixture of trained doctors.  We have many doctors who have been trained abroad in different systems, for example, in North America or the Middle East.  They are trained in different medicine and they tend to test more if they are trained in those systems.  That is probably because those systems are incentivised, but that is how they are trained.  In Ireland we are not paid for those tests, so there is no incentive.<\/p> <p>  The point on medical equipment is interesting.  We have just gone through an expansion programme, which we funded in three ways.  First, if we generate enough funds, we buy the equipment outright because we find that to be the most efficient way of procuring.  Second, we have also used bank debt.  The third area, which is becoming more prominent, is what are called managed equipment service contracts, where there is a mixture of servicing and capital cost over a prolonged period.  The servicing of our equipment is managed by an in-house medical physics team similar to what one would find in the public system.  In fact, the team members in the Beacon were trained in the public system and they would collaborate quite a lot with their colleagues in the public system.<\/p> <p>  The shortage of consultants came up in several questions.  Without getting into drop-dead remuneration, the packages that are designed are salaries, and the salary would typically be about 50% more than the starting public salary.  The starting salary for a type B consultant is &euro;120,000 and it drops to &euro;106,000 for a type C consultant, so one could add on about 50% to that.  In addition, consultants coming back to Ireland are facing extreme medical indemnity costs.  A typical surgeon in a very complex specialty is probably paying &euro;70,000 a year in medical indemnity, and I have seen rates of up to &euro;100,000 a year.  For consultants coming back to Ireland to set up practice, bearing in mind they are making professional fees, it takes a while to establish a practice, so they need support for the first couple of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":355,"content":"<p>What kind of time commitment would a contract like that involve?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#K00800","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484730000,"counter":356,"content":"<p>It is a standard 39-hour week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":357,"content":"<p>A 39-hour week with inpatient hospital work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#K01000","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484730000,"counter":358,"content":"<p>They would have inpatients and outpatients, and they would have clinics.

They do not have to come to the Beacon Hospital to do that.<\/p><p> I will try to paint a picture of what I was referring to when I discussed management.  The management team produces a management plan for the hospital.  We submit it to the board every year.  The board scrutinises it and makes amendments as it sees fit.  That is the plan and we are held to task for it.  We are measured every month under a ream of performance indicators.  At an earlier stage in my career I worked with great governance groups but we did not go down to that level of scrutiny.  Earlier I referred to accountability.  The reality is that if we do not perform, there will be inevitable consequences.  In that sense it is no different to any private business.<\/p><p> Recruitment has been mentioned several times.  When I referred to doctors I was referring to consultants.<\/p><p> There are two sides to information and communications technology; corporate ICT and clinical ICT.  In a previous life, the hospital I worked in was in the public system.  It had fantastic clinical ICT and excellent corporate ICT.  In fact it was better on the clinical side than the ICT I am working with currently.  It is mixed.  We have seen the adoption of clinical ICT in the Galway clinic.  I know the Hermitage Medical Clinic has a roll-out at the moment.  Our hospital is just behind that stage.  We are going to catch up and we are planning to invest in that area.<\/p><p> Theatre time is an interesting area.  The set-up is typical of all the private hospitals &ndash; I have discussed this with people from Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Private Hospital.  Typically, staff come in at 7 a.m. and knife-to-skin time is 7.30 a.m.  The first patient is prepared, on the table and the surgeon is in at 7.30 a.m.  If that does not happen, a big red flag is raised.  We have eight theatres in use from Monday to Friday from 7.30 a.m. to 7 p.m. and they go through lunch.  Typically, we have two teams on the nursing side.  I am unsure what specialty was referred to earlier, but four times seems like a lot.  I know of surgeons who could do six joint replacements in a theatre session in one day.  They have put it to me that they would be lucky to undertake one or two per week in the public system.  I do not know the full reason, I am simply saying that is what they have said to me.  That is the process.

It comes to us as public representatives and raises concerns.  I refer to what Deputy Kelleher said earlier about cherry-picking.  I include myself in this, rather than speaking for everyone, but there is probably a misconception of what the witnesses' organisation is or what it does.  I know it is a representative body.  As a result of this, I have a number of questions which I understand they cannot answer because they will have to try to find the information, if they even can find it.  This leaves us with gaps regarding the collation of information from private hospitals.  Mistakenly or not, we probably assumed - some of us, including me, did anyway - that they would have their hands on this information but they obviously do not.  This is not a criticism.  Perhaps we just did not understand or know about this but it does create a gap for us, which we will have to try to fill some other way in trying to find information on the work done in private hospitals.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  I will try not to repeat the questions that have already been asked, although I may have some nuances to add to them.  I have a bee in my bonnet about the issue of ICT and e-health.  I understand and appreciate the answers already given regarding the difference between clinical and administrative ICT.  I respect Mr. Fitzgerald's honesty in saying that in his current role, some of the ICT on the public side is actually better than the private side.  I understand there is a huge cost involved but across private hospitals, is there a kind of coming together or economies gained regarding the type of investment they are putting into ICT across these two completely different areas, namely, the administrative and the clinical?  If so, perhaps this could be shared with the public as well because it is all the one.  Furthermore, where do the witnesses see the breakdowns regarding the transfer of information interoperability between public and private?  I am absolutely convinced that huge efficiencies are possible in this area and I hope we will make reference to them in our final report.  Do the witnesses believe and agree that we need to create one unique identification code for all patients in order that there is interoperability between public and private hospitals and across health care?<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to emergency departments, EDs, and medical assessment units, MAUs, and the 1,000 patients per week.  As the committee will know, I have spoken publicly on this.  It is quite immoral that we found out during the recent crisis in emergency departments, which is not over yet, that private hospitals were supposedly doing their job, in that they were advertising their EDs to patients while many people - hundreds of people - across the country were waiting on trolleys in public hospitals.  How do the witnesses feel their hospitals can play a role in this regard?  I believe in ideological debates.  I would prefer to see these people treated in public hospitals.  However, as an interim step, how do the witnesses believe they could play a better or bigger role in working on an interim solution in the next year or two while we sort out this absolutely chaotic situation?  Is there anything in this regard to which they feel they can contribute?<\/p> <p>  Statistics have been given to us on elective procedures in private hospitals.  Reference was made to 50%.  Does that change when it comes to the NTPF?  Can we break that figure down into types of procedures as opposed to accounting for everything in the one figure?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the lack of data available on the type or volume of activity in private hospitals, Mr. Fitzgerald talked about the HIPE.  Obviously, it is something he feels his sector could work towards into the future.  I knew about this, but it is still very concerning.  Collectively, we need this information.  Do the witnesses feel they are also at a loss because this has not advanced and has not been brought in across private hospitals?  Following on from that, what are their views on the advancements of HIQA licensing across private hospitals, which is also proposed?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Fitzgerald spoke about the transfer of patients from public to private hospitals and from private to public hospitals.  Regarding the latter, he spoke about the four different ways in which this might happen.  I thank him for his honesty and brevity in this regard.  Does this vary by hospital area?  Specifically, given the geographical locations of the private hospitals, does it vary based on their locations because of the types of hospitals that may be near them, that is, whether they are tier 1 hospitals?  Generally, they are tier 1 hospitals.  Does it vary across the country?<\/p> <p>  The questions about recruitment and length of stay have been dealt with.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses have any idea or knowledge of the percentage of procedures in private hospitals provided for public patients but on behalf of the public health care system?  I would appreciate if they would come back to Deputy O'Reilly's questions about support staff across all the private hospitals.  That is very important information to some of us on the committee.<\/p> <p>  I have one final question.  Obviously, the witnesses are advocates for the hospitals they represent, and in many ways private investment is important for the existence of their hospitals.  They have shareholders.  Obviously, because of this, they want profits, etc.  Many of their hospitals have been created because of the way in which health care has been managed in this country, and gaps have been created in the market.  This is more a question for Mr. Nugent than anyone else.  Given the current health care environment in this country - and I hope the committee under this Chairman will change it and have a plan for the next number of decades and the next ten years in particular- do the witnesses envisage any way that they can see new private offerings, private hospitals, etc. being proposed or a need for them anywhere in this country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#M00600","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  Without repeating questions, I will try to be as specific as I can.  The terms of reference of the committee are to try to devise a health system that treats a patient in accordance with his or her need rather than his or her ability to pay.  According to our objective, were we successful in what we do and were everybody treated in accordance with his or her need, I wonder how many people would take out private health insurance and use private hospitals.  The fundamental issue is that people who can afford health insurance get treated and those who cannot, wait.  That is the system we are in and about which we are tasked with trying to do something.<\/p> <p>  In respect of consultants who work in both the private and public systems, do the witnesses know what percentage of consultants - if not across the private system, in their hospitals - do both public and private work?  How many work specifically for the private hospitals?  I would be interested in that figure if they have it.  I know the question was asked but I would like them to come back, if possible, with a specific figure.  I am sure they would know the cost of a hip or knee operation.<\/p><p>May I ask the representatives from the PHA to provide the committee with a figure for the cost of a knee operation in a private hospital so that we could compare it with what it costs in the public system?  <\/p><p> A witness during an earlier hearing told us that it was six times more expensive to get a procedure done in the public system than it was in the private system.  I would like information to back up that comparison so it would be helpful if the representatives would provide us with those figures.  <\/p><p> What percentage of the income of private hospitals comes from the public purse as opposed to the income from health insurance?  It might have been said that the private hospitals are at full capacity in terms of beds.  What percentage of beds in the health service are in the private hospitals sector?  In terms of diagnostics, what is the percentage capacity to provide MRI and CAT scans?  It would be very useful to know the available capacity in the private hospital system.<\/p><p> We have been made aware that many people in the age 70 plus category who have private medical insurance now have a medical card, as the income guidelines for medical cards are far more generous.  One could have a situation where a patient with insurance goes into the private hospital for medical conditions or even an elective hip operation but following discharge would need community health care.  Is there a good liaison system, whereby the private hospitals work with the home care teams, the people who set up home help hours, the community welfare nurses and so on or are they simply referred to the GP? <\/p><p> We were told that about 30% of the 70 hospitals are private hospitals, that the private hospitals employ 8,000 staff, have 2,500 beds, conducting 250,000 procedures and carrying out 3 million diagnostic tests.  Would the witnesses be able to provide an overall cost for the service, so that we would be able to compare the cost of that service in the private sector with the public system?  That would be beneficial.<\/p><p> I have a specific question for Mr. Brian Fitzgerald because he has 25 years experience in management in both the public and private system.  I am asking for an honest assessment of the percentage efficiency in the private hospitals versus the efficiency of the public system?  Can he tell us what the private hospitals do better, I suspect the private hospitals would run at higher efficiency and I wonder what Mr. Fitzgerald does better now than previously when he was in the public system.  What is the reason for the great efficiency?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#M00700","speaker":"1321","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Deputy Brassil made many of the points I intended to make.  I appreciate that the representatives from the PHA have come before us.  Mr. Fitzgerald stated that 5% profit has to be made to reinvest in infrastructure in the hospitals.  How much goes to shareholders?  Is that information commercially sensitive?  How much goes to marketing for the hospitals as well?  They are important parts of how a health service is managed and how the money could be reinvested in the public sector.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Fitzgerald also referred to accountability and how he had to make himself accountable to his board.  Would something similar have applied in his then role as a manager in the public sector?  Deputy Brassil also made the point that this committee is examining ways to bring in a health service that is based on need and not on the ability to pay, free at the point of entry and accessible to all.  <\/p> <p>  In his opening statement Mr. Simon Nugent stated, \"One welcome innovation has been the reintroduction of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and, while the resources available to be spent in 2017 are modest, PHA members will be able to respond and provide treatment to some of the longest waiting patients on public lists over the coming months\".  That is a failure in the public health service being welcomed by the private hospital services because it will generate income from the National Treatment Purchase Fund and more patients.<\/p> <p>  I do not subscribe to private health insurance so I cannot walk up to the door of a private hospital and say that I need a procedure in a private hospital.  That is where the ideological debate breaks down.  We are looking at how patients are dealt with properly, efficiently and it has to be an efficient system, a system where staff are able to work.  The public health service provided such a service for a long time in the general hospitals.  There was movement within the structures, people got promoted and people followed the medicine they were interested in. <\/p> <p>  In 1947 a White Paper was initiated by the Government to look at a national health service similar to the National Health Service established by Bevan and also to examine social welfare payments.  It was buried because the then Department of Finance did not want it.  There were interested parties which did not want that to happen.  With the crisis in the public health service, people want to see a proper public health service that people can access without the need for significant resources or private health insurance. <\/p> <p>  In his concluding remarks, Mr. Nugent recommends that the committee consider establishing a task force to explore innovative, cost effective private sector capacity utilisation and so on.

While that makes perfect sense, there are lots of mechanisms to work out whether the State is getting value for money for any particular expenditure.  If we are to have a universal single tier health service, the committee should anticipate all hospitals - private, public and voluntary - as hospitals that are delivery mechanisms that will deliver services in such a system.  Then it is up to the procurer, presumably the Department of Health, or whoever is responsible for procuring services to make sure that he or she is getting value for money from whichever hospital is delivering the service.  I do not see anything inconsistent between having a universal health service and having private hospitals providing treatment in such a scenario.<\/p><p> In terms of value for money, I would add that the last time there was a detailed exercise done on this was when the NTPF was running previously.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, understandably, took close interest in how it worked.

Various arrangements could be put in place to facilitate patients being routed to a private hospital rather than ending up in a long queue or on a trolley in the public system.<\/p> <p>  We were asked if the numbers we referred to in respect of elective procedures included patients referred by the NTPF.

There are two different initiatives that are relevant in that context.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health, chaired by Deputy Michael Harty, has recently been looking at the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill which will extend the remit of HIQA to the supervision of private hospitals.  This is something that we have supported and looked forward to since the publication of the Madden commission report in 2009.

We have discussed at length the differences between the public and the private sectors and we all acknowledge that nothing different is done in a hip operation in the public sector than one in the private sector.  Obviously, there are efficiencies and savings that are made in the private sector that might not be made in the public sector.  By way of exploring that, I appreciate that Mr. Nugent does not have the information to hand but could he provide the committee with details of pay rates, the numbers of staff by grade directly employed, the outsourcing of functions and the pension arrangements for staff?  I am specifically interested in the pension arrangements for all staff.  Like Mr. Fitzgerald, I have experience of both the public and private health care systems as a person who represented workers in both and I know that sometimes there can be differences in pensions.  It concerns where the overheads are, where the money is going, the extent to which pension schemes exist, how they are funded, whether they are defined contribution or defined benefit and the grades and categories they are available to.  Could the committee be provided with copies of the sick leave schemes or a synopsis of paid, unpaid and partially paid sick leave arrangements that would apply in hospitals?  I am interested in this because, obviously, taxpayers' money goes into the private sector and, clearly, the Government has an obligation to spend that money in upholding good standards, including good employment standards.  I am not suggesting that they are anything other than that.  In respect of the Beacon Group and the statement by Mr. Fitzgerald about not having unions, I would be very interested to know if that is a policy or whether it is simply the way it is.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2017011800002#P04100","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Throughout the morning, we have been very conscious of the dearth of data for the witnesses' operations.

The session today is one in a series of interactions between the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, the Department and the committee.  These meetings provide an important opportunity to update and inform the committee of key developments and progress and for us in the Department to receive feedback from committee members.<\/p><p> The focus of today's meeting is the first quarterly progress report under Rebuilding Ireland, published on 1 November 2016.  That report charted the progress made on relevant actions since the Rebuilding Ireland plan was published on 19 July.  It is the first in what will be a series of reports that will be published on a quarterly basis and we are currently working on the second quarterly report covering the fourth quarter of 2016.  The intention is to finalise and present the fourth quarter progress report to the Cabinet committee on housing at the end of this month with a view to publication thereafter.  <\/p><p> Initially, as members are aware, Rebuilding Ireland contained 84 actions across five key pillars of activity for implementation not just by our Department but also by a range of other Departments and agencies, and of course local authorities.  One key action for delivery in quarter four last year was the publication of a new strategy for the rental sector and that was indeed finalised and published last month.  As members will be aware, the necessary associated legislation was considered by the Oireachtas before the Christmas recess.  Progress on implementing the 29 actions contained in the rental strategy in future will be incorporated into the quarterly reporting under Rebuilding Ireland generally and all the progress reports and up-to-date information will continue to be made available on the dedicated Rebuilding Ireland website.  <\/p><p> Since the publication of Rebuilding Ireland, our attention has been firmly focused on delivery.  Implementation of Rebuilding Ireland is being advanced across a number of Departments, as I have said, and is being taken forward under the oversight of the Cabinet committee on housing, chaired by An Taoiseach.  Within our own Department, an implementation board of senior officials, chaired by myself and including my colleagues here today and other key senior officials, monitors progress on a fortnightly basis.  In addition, an oversight group and a project board with a broader representation of delivery agents and stakeholders have been established.  Working group structures under each of the action plan's five pillars have also been put in place.  It is also planned to continue to hold regular, broadly based stakeholder forums on housing and homelessness, such as those events that were arranged to date in devising Rebuilding Ireland, and the strategy for the rental sector.  These will provide a valuable means of feedback on the practical experience of implementation and will help to inform future policy formulation.  <\/p><p> Subject to the agreement of the committee, I now plan to briefly cover the key issues and progress made under each pillar.  Generally I will cover the progress reported in the quarter three report, and where possible I will update the committee on progress made since then.  I will address the strategy for the rental sector under pillar 4.<\/p><p> Pillar one addresses homelessness.  It is the top priority under Rebuilding Ireland, to be achieved through the delivery of the 21 cross-cutting actions outlined in pillar 1, and the priority associated with this is demonstrated by the extent to which the actions are front-loaded.  Homelessness, as we all know, is a complex area of social policy that requires close co-operation across a number of Departments and agencies and this is reflected in the pillar one actions.  While the key objective of pillar 1 is to move individuals and families out of emergency temporary accommodation, there are also important actions to keep people in their homes.  While all efforts are being made to address homelessness, we must recognise the reality of the situation as outlined in the monthly statistics, which have shown increases since June in overall terms.  Based on details collected from housing authorities in November 2016, a total of 4,436 adults used State-funded emergency accommodation nationally during the survey week.  However, while there have been recent increases in homeless presentations, it is important to note that much is being done to address homelessness and to secure sustainable tenancies for homeless households.  For example, during the first nine months of 2016, housing authorities assisted over 2,000 sustainable exits from homelessness, that is, into independent social housing or supported private rented tenancies.  It is expected that a total of 2,700 sustainable exits will have been achieved during 2016 as a whole.  This is a record level of exits from homelessness in this timeframe and it demonstrates the significant efforts of local authorities to help find more sustainable accommodation solutions.  <\/p><p> Despite this record level of activity, the fact that there has continued to be a net increase in homelessness highlights the imperative of achieving timely and full implementation of the range of actions provided for across the pillars of Rebuilding Ireland in order to achieve the necessary increase in supply of housing in general and social housing in particular.  <\/p><p> The following key achievements will have a significant impact.  Strong progress has been made on the housing assistance payment, HAP, homeless pilot in Dublin.  The final figure for 2016 will be published in the quarter four report.  However, it is clear at this stage that the target to provide 550 stable and supported housing tenancies for long-term homeless households was significantly exceeded.  The HAP scheme for homeless households represents an important new tool to assist in breaking the cycle of homelessness for individuals and families, reducing long-term reliance on emergency accommodation.<\/p><p> Abhaile, the new national mortgage arrears resolution service, and the associated scheme of aid and advice for borrowers in mortgage arrears, was launched by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Social Protection.  There also has been a focus on the provision of further family and child welfare supports for homeless families such as home-school community liaison services, through education welfare officers and Tusla's work on school completion programmes and so on.  The Housing Agency's &euro;70 million rolling fund to purchase vacant properties from banks and investment companies has been established with a target of 1,600 units to be acquired.  One of the key targets under pillar one is to end the use of commercial hotels as emergency accommodation for homeless families by the middle of 2017 except in limited exceptional circumstances.  In addition to the homeless HAP scheme, which I mentioned earlier, the key element of achieving this target will be the provision of 1,500 rapid delivery homes by the end of 2018.  The Office of Government Procurement's rapid delivery framework is now in place and this will be an important tool that will allow local authorities to accelerate delivery in the months ahead.  <\/p><p> Under pillar 2, the target is clear, involving the delivery of an additional 47,000 social housing homes over the period to 2021.  An overall budget of &euro;5.35 billion has been earmarked for this purpose.  These homes are being delivered by local authorities and approved housing bodies through a number of different mechanisms including construction, repair and renewal of existing housing, both public and private, regeneration of certain areas and acquisitions, as well as various leasing arrangements.  While the final detailed figures for social housing output will be collated and published over the coming weeks, provisional figures for 2016 indicate that in excess of 18,300 households have had their social housing needs met under the range of social housing schemes, ahead of the target of just over 17,000 that had been set for the year.  In terms of social housing construction, the pipeline is very positive.  From a situation of very limited new social housing units constructed in 2015, where the reliance was primarily in acquisitions and other delivery mechanisms, it is expected that the projects involving some 2,800 social housing units will commence on site under the main local authority and approved housing body construction programmes this year.  <\/p><p> Pillar three is focused on securing significant increases in the delivery of housing in the wider housing market.  We are currently finalising the housing output figures for 2016, for publication with the next quarterly progress report, but it is clear from the data to the end of November that they will show an increase on the 12,666 units produced in 2015.  While the 2016 increase is very welcome, it is of course just a step along the pathway to increasing housing output to approximately 25,000 units per annum over the course of the Rebuilding Ireland plan.  There are 12 actions under pillar three, dealing with funding and financing of infrastructure provision, active land management, planning reforms, construction design innovation and the construction sector's skills and capacity to deliver.  The skills issue in particular is a very important area, given the estimated requirements for additional skilled construction workers, and our colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS are working to ramp up the delivery of skills training across a range of key areas.  On the infrastructure front, 21 local authorities have applied for funding under the &euro;200 million local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, seeking to open up more of the approximately 17,500 ha of land for development that the planning process has identified nationally for housing, 2,654 ha of which are in Dublin.  There will be a further update on the assessment of these applications in the context of the quarter four quarterly progress report.  <\/p><p> On the land supply side, relevant Departments, State bodies and local authorities have been contacted regarding lands in their ownership or control or both that may be suitable and available for housing development in connection with the development of a national web-based database of State lands.  To make progress quickly, the survey of State development lands is focusing on Dublin and the main cities and urban areas with a view to having the details mapped later in this quarter, after which the approach will be extended to other regions.<\/p><p>Some 23 major urban development sites with the capacity to deliver 30,000 new homes in the medium term in the greater Dublin area, Cork, Limerick and Galway have been identified.  Progress on these sites is being proactively monitored by the Department's housing delivery office, with a view to ensuring that the sites become exemplars for the co-ordination and delivery of plan-led housing development and active land management.<br\/><br\/>The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, which was enacted on 23 December last, enables large-scale housing development proposals to be submitted directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, while also enabling other important streamlining of planning processes and new tenant protection measures.<br\/><br\/>Finally under this pillar, a help to buy scheme was introduced by the Minister for Finance as part of the budget for 2017.  Under the scheme, first-time buyers who purchase or self-build their own homes can avail of a refund of income tax and DIRT paid in the previous four years up to a maximum amount of &euro;20,000.  This refund can be used to satisfy mortgage deposit requirements, making home purchase more achievable for an increasing number of prospective home owners and, in turn, providing confidence to home builders to supply more homes.<br\/><br\/>Under pillar 4, the key action was the publication of a rental strategy.  The strategy for the rental sector was published on 13 December 2016.  Importantly, the strategy introduced the concept of rent pressure zones, RPZs, to provide rent predictability in areas of unsustainable rental inflation.  RPZs have now been given a statutory basis via the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  In these zones, rent increases will be capped at 4% per annum.  The measure was introduced with immediate effect in the four Dublin local authority areas and Cork city.  The Residential Tenancies Board has been asked to accelerate the work to develop more detailed area-based rental data in the Dublin and Cork commuter counties and in the other main cities so that additional areas can be designated where the criteria are met.  RPZs will be designated for a maximum of three years, by which time it is anticipated that new supply will have come on stream and eased the pressures on the rental market in the most pressured areas.<br\/><br\/>The Planning and Development (Housing) Residential Tenancies Act 2016 gives effect to other actions in the rental strategy relating to security.  It prevents the termination of ten or more tenancies at the same time in a single development in order to facilitate vacant possession sale of the property.  Sales in such cases will be conditional on the existing tenants remaining <i>in situ<\/i>.  In addition, the landlord's right during the first six months of a further Part 4 tenancy to end that tenancy has been abolished and the duration of tenancies has been extended from four to six years.<br\/><br\/>The strategy also puts forward a number of measures that will broaden and strengthen the role and powers of the Residential Tenancies Board to more effectively provide key services to tenants and landlords.  In addition, the working group on taxation of rental providers for which provision was made in the strategy has already been established by the Department of Finance.<br\/><br\/>Under pillar 5, while Rebuilding Ireland places a strong emphasis on the provision of increased new housing supply in respect of both private and social housing to meet demand, a further key objective of the action plan is to ensure that the existing housing stock is used to the maximum degree.<br\/><br\/>A particular focus in this regard is to bring vacant residential units back into productive use for social and private housing purposes.  Through a range of initiatives and targeted policy reforms, harnessing the potential of these houses can contribute to the overall objective of increasing housing supply quickly to meet demand while simultaneously helping to breathe new life and vitality into the streets, estates and rural areas in which they are located.  New initiatives, such as the repair and leasing scheme, are designed to realise this potential.<br\/><br\/>The Central Statistics Office has indicated that more detailed information and categorisation of vacant properties will be available in the housing specific report from Census 2016, which is being prioritised for finalisation by April 2017.  This will be a critically important input into the new vacant housing reuse strategy which is to be developed under pillar 5.<br\/><br\/>In terms of use of social housing stock, choice-based letting, CBL, can play an important part in the more efficient allocation of social housing by local authorities, helping to minimise delays that can arise through offers of accommodation being refused.  By using CBL, South Dublin County Council had the lowest reported refusal rate for social housing, at 5%, while in some local authority areas refusals were running at significantly higher levels.  To ensure the further roll-out of CBL nationally, new regulations were made on 30 September 2016, requiring every housing authority to provide for a choice-based letting procedure in their housing allocation schemes by the end of the year at the latest.<br\/><br\/>I have provided a summary of the progress made in implementing Rebuilding Ireland in the months immediately following its publication.  While I have concentrated on the quarter 3 progress report, where possible I have provided the committee with more recent updates on significant actions.  A further and more comprehensive update will be available in the next progress report, which will be finalised and published in the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>As the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, has indicated, Rebuilding Ireland is a top priority for the Government and the Department is fully committed to its effective delivery.  I and my colleagues will be happy to respond to any issues or queries that members may wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484731800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and I call Deputy Cowen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#E00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1484731800,"counter":507,"content":"<p>If somebody else wants to go first, I just have to check something.

I suggest that we ask our questions on a pillar-by-pillar basis.  I have questions under each pillar and doing as I suggest might make it easier procedurally, if that is okay.<\/p> <p>  On pillar 1, I do not want to start on a sour note but we already know most of the information in the presentation.  It is information of which we are aware because we have been working through this matter.  For future quarterly reports, it would be better to get into the nitty-gritty detail that is not in the public domain straight away because that would save time.<\/p> <p>  I will address four specific things on homelessness.  First, the homeless statistics released every month are not correct.  I have raised this matter by means of parliamentary questions on a number of occasions.  The statistics in question do not include adults and children in Tusla-funded domestic violence refuge accommodation or step-down accommodation; they do not include foreign nationals in transitional or emergency accommodation funded by the Department of Social Protection's new communities unit; and they do not include the approximately 400 families that are currently trapped in direct provision or those in transitional accommodation funded by the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, who have their stamp 4 visas.  This means that the figures that are being released every month do not reflect the total number of people - adults and children - in emergency accommodation or transitional accommodation.  It cannot be very complicated for the relevant Departments to feed all this information in so that when the statistics are released, they will reflect it.  I urge the Department to take a lead role to ensure that we have accurate figures on that.<\/p> <p>  Tusla cannot tell me how many people it has in emergency accommodation when I table parliamentary questions on the matter.  The Department of Social Protection will not give me any accurate figures.  The Department of Justice and Equality has provided the figures for direct provision.  If we are releasing a report saying that this is the number of homeless individuals and families and children, it should - irrespective of who they are funded by - include information on all of them.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned at the way in which those figures have been released two months in a row.  I raised concerns when the October report was published because it was put up on the Department's website at 6 p.m. on a Friday, with no accompanying statement.  The statement went up early the following week and it appears as if there was an attempt to bury bad news.  The figures for November were released on 30 December when  everybody was away on holidays.  We had been chasing these figures for two or three weeks and we had thought that they would come out at the end of the second week or the beginning of the third week in December.  Regardless of whether it is the case - and I am aware that the Department is extremely busy - it seems that those figures, which have been bade news for two months in a row, have not been given the same kind of media attention that the Minister is providing in respect of a lot of other positive news.  He is very proactive in the media and many stories emerged over the Christmas period.  The Minister published opinion pieces, press releases, etc., which is great.  However, I am of the view that the figures should be released in a different way and I wanted to raise that.<\/p> <p>  On rapid-build housing units, there is no point in telling us how many of these are in the pipeline.  We want to know how many are on-site and under construction at present.  Another issue arises in the context of the use of such units.  Some of us are currently working Part 8 planning applications in our local authorities.  It is still not clear whether the Department is going to require the local authorities to tenant all of those rapid-build units with families coming directly from emergency accommodation.  We do not know whether they be in there for  a period of six months while they are being moved on to other permanent accommodation, whether these units will be their permanent homes or whether local authorities will be given a certain amount of flexibility, through the use of transfers, to ensure a much more integrated allocations policy.  I would be interested to hear responses in respect of that matter.<\/p> <p>  \"Exits\" is a wonderful word because it does not exactly tell us what we are looking for.  It is a somewhat similar to what happens when the phrase \"social housing solutions\" is used.  What we would like to know is how many of these exits relate to households as opposed to individuals.  Both figures in this regard would be useful.  What do the people exit into?  Can our guests confirm that they are all permanent long-term tenancies and that none of them are short-term supported tenancies of any kind?<\/p> <p>  The other really important thing that must be considered in the context of the figures - both in terms of the homeless figures monthly and the exits - is the average length of time that households are spending in emergency accommodation.  The latter is a really important metric for us.  I know it is difficult to produce.  I imagine, however, that it would be possible - even by region - to say that the households currently in emergency accommodation have been there, on average, for a certain period and also to indicate the length of time for which those who have been the subject exits have been in such accommodation.<\/p><p> Lastly, there has been some controversy between Apollo House, Home Sweet Home and the Minister over the two new facilities in Dublin.  I welcome that funding is being made available for those two facilities.  I am merely interested because Dublin City Council councillors from all parties knew nothing about this until it was in the media.  They first heard about it from the press.  Obviously, there were conversations between the Minister and the housing managers in advance of his meeting with Home Sweet Home but I would be interested to know the timeline because none of us knew about these either.  Did Dublin City Council approach the Department or the Department approach the council?  When did that take place and when was funding agreed?  I understand there are sensitivities about new homeless facilities because unfortunately, some politicians - none in this room but in local authorities - often play politics with it.  Is it proper procedure that councillors and Deputies learn of these significant developments from the press rather than through the institutional meetings of committees, here or in the local authority?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#E00500","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484731800,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I agree with the previous speaker that we should deal with each pillar as it arises and take questions on that.<\/p> <p>  On homelessness, I have something similar.  The figure mentioned 4,436 adults in emergency accommodation nationally during the survey week.  Can that be broken down into the number of housing units?  Do we know how many children are involved?  On the actions mentioned to alleviate this, I am conscious that the Minister and Minister of State with responsibility in this area have almost staked their reputation on this issue through the commitment they have given both to members and to the public that they will rid us of this horrible statistic by June of this year.  Last year, the Department states more than 2,000 were taken out of homelessness and that was a record year.  Now the Department states 4,436 will be taken out of homelessness and out of emergency accommodation by June of this year.  The Department states that one tool that will be used to eradicate that figure to zero by June is the 1,500 rapid units to be built by the end of 2018.  Unfortunately, the Department cannot square that circle.  More to the point, we were given a commitment on the delivery of 350 or 500 modular units last year and we got 22 units.  Somebody needs to tell the committee what exactly was or is the problem, whether it has been identified and will it be rectified.  When Mr. McCarthy and others give commitments to the committee on a regular basis, in this instance that 1,500 units will be delivered by the end of 2018, have the lessons and the failures associated with previous commitments been learned, been owned up to and been rectified?<\/p> <p>  As I stated to the Minister previously, if it is such that there are legislative issues or logjams, let us know and we will do what we can to rectify the situation.  This is an emergency and if emergency legislation is required, members will sit all night to pass it.  It appears as though commitments are being made, left, right and centre, as well as launches, strategies and what not, but yet on the ground an obvious lack of urgency can be seen when that cannot be rectified.  All of us here are more than willing to help, support and see that the commitments the Department makes are realised but Mr. McCarthy must elaborate on the 4,436 figure and break it down.  He needs to elaborate, as the previous speaker stated, on the commitments regarding the 1,500 modular units.  Where is the surplus over 22 units that was committed to last year?  When can people expect to see results in this area?  As far back as two and half years ago, the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, made similar commitments.  I am sure the figures are similar to the commitment Deputy Kelly gave at that time and the same figures have been given repeatedly.  Rather than taking up much more time, Mr. McCarthy should break down the 4,436 into units, into the children involved and into households.  On the 1,500 modular units, what lessons have been learned from the failure last year and how can we be assured that these can be address this time round?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#F00200","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1484731800,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I welcome the team from the Department, and particularly thank the Secretary General, Mr. McCarthy, for his presentation.  First, I want to put on the record it was disappointing that we did not have a presentation on the review of the action plan for housing and homelessness, which was originally scheduled for 7 December.  Mr. McCarthy will recall we had a piece of correspondence from his Department on the reasons.<\/p><p>There is a national housing crisis.  I read a piece by the Minister, to be fair to him, only two days ago in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  It is another one of the pieces to which Deputy &Oacute; Broin refers about the usual such as, for instance, the importance of joined-up responses, how in working together we can rebuild Ireland and the 47,000 units.  I accept all of that.<\/p><p>The Minister got what he wanted.  The Department got what it wanted.  Ultimately, through their Minister, they got Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which is Government policy and which we all are working to and agreed to.  They got the necessary legislative support that was required to give effect to this plan and vision.  That is a fact as is all good.  As I stated at the first meeting I attended as a member of this committee, what the Minister did was a brave decision but there was only one way out.  If he could not explain what he was doing, he was failing.  He published at the back of the document specific dates and timelines.<\/p><p>Mr. McCarthy is talking about the first, second and third quarters in 2016.  We are now in 2017 and Mr. McCarthy is only reporting on one element.  This is so crucial the joint committee will need to have faster responses from the Department.  I might as well say what I feel but it was an affront for the Department not to come before this committee when it was scheduled to so do to give a report on the Government policy.  This is the Oireachtas joint committee and this is one of the key elements that will be considered throughout the work of this committee.  I am conscious that the Chairman wants to deal with the different issues under the pillars, but that is merely an opening remark.<\/p><p>Clearly, coming from the previous speakers is the issue of the format.  Why can we not have a standard format?  Reading a speech is all very fine, but Mr. McCarthy set out his excellent format at the back of this document in which there are timelines, etc.  We should have a format which is consistent through every report on this document, which sets out each of the items and objectives.  We know how many objectives and items are in the report.  There are 84 distinct actions under the five pillars.  It is all clear and well done and is well set out.  Arising from all of this and the ongoing discussion, I recommend that the format be established, that the Department have a proper working format which replicates the format of the Department in this document in order that members can constantly see how it is progressing.<\/p><p>We need to have greater details.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin talked about a metric.  Also, there is an inconsistency on the data every time one reads a paper.  The Department published the delightful Summary of Social Housing Assessments 2016 in December 2016, for which I thank the Department, as I rang up and was sent a copy the next day.  The previous one was dated up to 2013.  We had a housing crisis but we had no summary of the social assessment need until December 2016.  I circulated the summary to a number of local authorities and had feedback from a senior level within these local authorities to the effect that there were inconsistencies about the figures, and I am happy to discuss that with Mr. McCarthy later.  There are issues in this regard and these data need to be validated.  There are inconsistencies in local authority chief executives saying it is something else and the Department stating these are the facts, people are falling off lists but no one really needs to know.<\/p><p>I will finish at that point.  I will come back in at the various pillars, if I may.  I make the point that we have to speed it up.  What is Mr. McCarthy talking about?  Are we talking about the last quarter, which is October, November and December 2016 or what?  We need to be consistent with the quarter of when this was published because I would like to think that for every quarter in 2017, we will have a comprehensive report.  The key point is the format of it.  The format should be clearly set up against the format the Department established in its document.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#F00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1484731800,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I will take three questions at a time, if that is okay with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#F00400","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484731800,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I will start in reverse order, given the issues raised by Senator Boyhan.<\/p><p>To clarify, we have published a quarter 3 progress report in the same format as in Rebuilding Ireland, which was published on 1 November.  That goes through each of the individual actions scheduled for delivery in quarter 3.  It mirrors the format in the document and is the format in which we will continue to publish on a quarterly basis.  The absence of a presentation earlier was on the understanding that the presentation, to a large measure, was contained in the published report so the purpose of my opening remarks was really just to try to give a summary of some of the key points.<\/p><p> On the issue before Christmas, I wrote to the committee and explained to the Chairman that the period before Christmas was an extraordinarily busy period for everybody concerned, including for committee members because the Houses were sitting for hours, day and night.  We were in the throes of trying to finalise a very difficult rental strategy and big legislation, including the legislative amendments associated with the rental strategy.  There is never any disrespect intended to the committee by the Department; we never have and, as long as I am Secretary General, we never will.  The choice we faced was coming before the committee without some of the key people because they had to service other aspects of the Oireachtas in terms of legislation and Government business.  It would not have been the most productive encounter for all of us.  That is just by way of background to explain the pressures at the time.  There was no intention to show disrespect towards the committee or its members.     <\/p><p> In terms of the social housing assessments data, we are very keen to hear any suggestions or comments the committee has received about inconsistency.  The appointed date for the social housing assessment 2016 was 21 September.  The couple of months between that date and the date it was published were heavily devoted to a data cleansing and validation exercise that was undertaken by the Housing Agency.  If there is a suggestion that there are data inconsistencies, it may be because some of the data shown has been cleansed from some of the initial data presented to us.  We are happy to engage with the committee.  If it has details on that, we will explore them.  There is a commitment in the social housing strategy that social housing assessments, which were done every three years up to 2016, will not be undertaken on an annual basis.  <\/p><p> In terms of homelessness and data, which Deputy Cowen raised, the figure I referred to of 4,436 was 4,436 adults.  There were 2,549 children, so in total we are talking about 6,985, comprising 1,200 families.  In terms of the target the Minister has set out clearly in Rebuilding Ireland, that target is to eliminate the use of commercial hotels for emergency accommodation by the middle of the year.  In the most recent data available to us, there were about 700 families in commercial hotels in the Dublin region.  The target we are working towards is getting that cohort of families living in unsustainable hotel accommodation out of that space by the middle of the year.  <\/p><p> The rapid build programme was first spoken about in a demonstration project of different types of modular housing about 15 months ago in September-October 2015.  We progressed quickly towards a pilot project in Ballymun.  At the time, there were delays with the project partly associated with protests on site.  In addition, we ran through some of the worst weather we had experienced over that December into January period.  There was also an important amount of learning involved.  One of the more significant pieces of learning was the extent to which time was being spent in the housing provider's manufacturing facility and the value associated with that.  It meant that any issues arising as part of the construction of the units were dealt with at the earliest possible stage so that when they got on site, some of the issues that can arise when it comes to the actual assembly on site had been taken out.  That is one of the significant learnings that came out of that pilot.  <\/p><p> The Office of Government Procurement has put a lot of time and effort into putting a general procurement framework in place for rapid build housing.  It is now thankfully in place and that will certainly assist local authorities in speeding up the procurement process as they move on with delivery over the course of this year.  Apart from the 22 units that have been delivered, there were 131 units in four projects that were under construction in Dublin city at the end of the year.  The remaining 200 were at various stages of procurement and will come on stream over the course of the year.<\/p><p> Deputy Cowen made an entirely valid point about my reference to the overall rapid build programme being completed by 2018 and how that gels with the mid-year target we have for hotels.  We see the rapid build programme contributing towards meeting the mid-year target but we also see it as an ongoing delivery tool.  The commitment to not use hotels other than in exceptional circumstances for emergency accommodation is one we are trying to meet by June but we need to continue to try to ensure we do not fall back into that space.  The continued development of rapid build housing will assist over the remainder of 2017 and on into 2018 to help us to keep out of that unsustainable space.  We will be organising a session with local authorities in the next ten days to two weeks.  We have already had some discussions with local authorities outside the Dublin area in relation to projects that they will bring forward for rapid build purposes so the purpose of the engagement at the end of the month is to, in effect, identify the remaining projects that will contribute to get us to the point of having 1,000 units delivered by the end of this year and the remaining 520 in 2018.  That covers the Deputy's points.  <\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Broin has made the point to the Minister about statistics and other areas of housing provision through Tusla and others.  I also hear from what the Deputy is saying that he has difficulty getting that information from other quarters.  All I can say is that we have put a lot of time over the past two years into getting the pathways to accommodation support system, PASS, in place to give us good statistics on homelessness so we have a very good handle on what we are dealing with as far as housing authorities are concerned.  That has been our focus and the Minister has been clear that that has been our focus.  I am not in any way arguing the point with the Deputy about the other areas of activity.<\/p><p> As part of the overall implementation of Rebuilding Ireland, we have a lot of engagement with the other bodies the Deputy has talked about, particularly Tusla, in terms of dealing with homelessness in the round.  Responsibility for domestic violence issues was, with the establishment of Tusla, consciously moved away from our Department in the past 18 months to two years.  We will continue to engage with it on what information and statistics it can bring to bear so that there is an overall picture of the accommodation being provided through different mechanisms.  Generally, one of the things flowing from Rebuilding Ireland is that we are putting a renewed emphasis on the timeliness and the comprehensiveness of our statistics across a range of fronts on homelessness, social housing and broader housing market delivery more generally.<\/p><p>Over recent months, we have established a new unit, headed by a senior statistician, as part of the process of bringing greater clarity.  A significant amount must be delivered under the Rebuilding Ireland programme.  It is critically important everybody has a clear picture on where the state of delivery is at any time.  That is a focus of particular attention for us.<\/p><p> We are certainly not in the business of choosing a particular time to put homelessness statistics out because we feel that, in some way, it will get buried by other news.  That is not the business we are in.  As I mentioned earlier about December, there were a significant number of other matters going on and the release of the statistics can get delayed from time to time.  Again, as part of our statistical work and its presentation on our website, we are interested in transparency and getting the information out there.<\/p><p> The main contributors to exits from homelessness would be the homeless housing assistance payment pilot, which was successful last year in Dublin, and, obviously, mainstream housing allocations.  To clarify, I may have given the wrong figure earlier for homelessness exits.  I think I gave the figure 2,000 for last year which is actually the figure for the first three quarters of last year.  The expectation is that for the year as a whole it will be 2,700.<\/p><p> On the two new emergency accommodation facilities, we engage in an ongoing dialogue with the four Dublin local authorities, in particular Dublin City Council, for which the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, acts.  We often meet weekly and fortnightly to discuss a range of issues.  In all of those meetings, particularly in the early part of the autumn last year, the clear basis of our engagement with the local authorities was that, whatever needed to be put in place for additional emergency accommodation, we would support and fund the first three facilities which were put in place and launched in the second week of December.  It brought us to a particular point and gave us sufficient comfort that there would be sufficient emergency accommodation for anybody who needed it.  We always saw this as an ongoing process.  The two new facilities - I do not know the date - arose in the context of that ongoing dialogue with the DRHE as part of the process of trying to be ahead of the issue rather than finding ourselves in a position of playing catch-up in providing accommodation for people in vulnerable circumstances.<\/p><p> On the length of time in emergency accommodation, as part of our improvement of our statistical work, we will talk to the DRHE to see if there is a way the PASS system can capture those sorts of data.  On the allocations of rapid builds, we would certainly aim to be flexible with local authorities.  Many competing factors go into the decision as to whether all the rapid build units should or should not be used for families in emergency accommodation.  There may be local factors where a more blended approach is required.  There are broader issues for each local authority in how they manage the prioritisation and the response to the priorities on their housing lists.  If a local authority wants to talk to the Department about a measure of flexibility which it felt was necessary for good local reasons, we would certainly discuss that with it.  We would not be in an absolute black and white space on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484731800,"counter":517,"content":"<p>Action No. 1.19 stated the Government would work \"with the Central Bank to ensure that the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears provides a strong consumer protection framework\".

For example, the Secretary General outlined various construction programmes and how 21 local authorities have applied for funding under the &euro;200 million local infrastructure fund to open up development plans.

A statistic was referred to that it is hoped to have 700 families out of commercial hotels by June this year.  I would have some reservations as to how that will be achieved.  One of the issues I would like to focus on is the Airbnb situation, specifically in Dublin.  What processes have been put in place or directions given to local authorities to try to address the Airbnb situation, based on An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision that anyone using a property for Airbnb on a long-term basis should have a change of use for the purposes of planning regulations?  It has been identified that more than 1,500 properties are available in Dublin on Airbnb over a 50 week period in any year.  These are homes that people could be living in.  Equally, the federation has identified that 10% of the hotel stock is being taken up for local authority use within the Dublin area.  It is a reversal of what should be happening.  Tourists or business travellers should be staying in the hotel environment and families should be living in homes.  I think that greater emphasis should be put on this now to try to address the situation.<\/p> <p>  I am slightly confused about the rapid build modular houses and whether they are specifically for homeless people.  It was my understanding that we were looking at rapid build modular technology as the way forward in delivering social housing, and I think it was meant for anybody, not just for homeless people.  If we restrict it to homeless people, we are actually saying that this is an inferior product.  If we believe in modular building technology, in fairness to the people who are involved in the industry, the whole modular building concept is a way of moving this industry forward.  Even from the employee's point of view, who has a regular place of work to go to on a daily basis to carry out their work, from child care and everything else, it is a lot easier manage their lifestyle balance.<\/p> <p>  To clarify, my questions concern the issue of families staying in commercial hotels, Airbnb and the rapid builds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#J00300","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1484731800,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I think many of the questions I was going to ask have already been mentioned.  I would like more clarification on the pillars themselves.  As I understand it, the figures and statistics are not available.  That is crucial.  I spent my whole Christmas trying to get people I represent into hotels and trying to get funding in my own area, and it was a massive issue for me.  I will address that another time.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the &euro;70 million allocated for purchasing house, how many have been purchased?  What are the different areas?  I understand that there is a crisis in Dublin and Galway and the bigger cities.<\/p> <p>  I read over the programme over Christmas, because I had a lot of dealings with many people over that period in this regard, and an issue that is not addressed is the staffing issue.  The biggest issue in local authorities is the staffing issue.  For example, people who want to go on the local authority housing list can be waiting from ten to 12 weeks.  That is unacceptable.  I believe that the Department should put in place a rule that nobody should be waiting longer than four weeks for a housing interview.  That is leading to the most vulnerable people in our society not getting rent allowance or the housing assistance payment, HAP.  That is a major issue.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about homelessness, and I think there are different types of homelessness.  Over Christmas I had six families who were taken off the local authority housing list.  I raised this issue with the Department six months ago.  In my own local authority housing list area, there is a limit of 26,250.  I could write the book on it at this stage.  I have people who are being taken off the list.  I had three families in particular who were eight years on the housing list, and because they were over the bracket, as it were, they were taken off.  In neighbouring counties, the very same as in Carlow, they are allowed a limit of 30,000 or 32,000.  That is not acceptable.  The officials are not doing their homework.  I can give them the names of six families today who were taken off the local authority housing list.  They lost the rent allowance and they are now homeless.  We are getting to a stage where unless the most vulnerable are addressed, people are starting to be taken off the housing list.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is the HAP, and I have to say that overall the HAP is a good scheme.  I would be agree with it in that people can declare exactly how much they are paying to the landlord, whereas for years that was a disaster.  Many landlords, however, do not seem to want to accept the HAP, and I believe it is because there is a mismatch in the information they are receiving.  They feel that it is different to the rent allowance, which it is.  It is better, but they do not understand that.  Another area where the Department officials are falling down, as it were, is that people are refusing to accept the HAP.  The local authorities will say that landlords are not accepting the HAP.  One of the reasons is that in this new HAP scheme, and this comes back again to staffing levels, there are supposed to be call outs to make sure the homes are up to a proper standard.  While that is good and we need a proper standard, there is no one to implement it.  There are not enough staff and no one is able to do it.<\/p> <p>  I read through the action plan over the Christmas when I had so many people going into bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels.  It just does not make sense to me that there is a programme in place, and while I know the Department officials are doing their best, the most vulnerable people are not being catered for.  These are not the homeless, but they are next to the homeless.  What I am finding is that these people are starting to become homeless.<\/p> <p>  While the new help to buy scheme is a good scheme, there are no new houses in most rural areas for first-time buyers.  We have brought in a help to buy scheme for people who must be a first-time buyer or engaging in a first-time build.  We have no houses for them.  I promoted this scheme in our local newspapers and I was on the radio about it.  I was delighted to praise this scheme.  People came back to me to say they did not know where there was a first-time house to buy.  They could not buy because there were no first-time builds.  I told them to look for a mortgage from the local authority.  Local authority mortgages are an issue that must be addressed.  There is a lack of information about them and they have not been promoted well enough.  The Department should promote these mortgages through every local authority.  There needs to be a system in place for the people who are refused a loan or mortgage from a bank or building society because of the rules that are there and they do not qualify, which that is fair enough, but who also do not qualify for the local authority housing list.  The help to buy scheme is fine in bigger areas like Dublin, Cork and Limerick where they are building, but there are no new builds in rural counties.  There are no new houses.  This means people will not qualify for it while the local authorities are not promoting mortgages.  These are simple things, but if the Department addresses these in its plan it will make a big difference to the most vulnerable families in society.  That is where the plan is failing.<\/p><p>The issues I raise are not major but the one I really want an answer on is the need to change the income limit for local authority housing from &euro;26,500 to &euro;32,000.  As I said, I will give the witnesses the six names because those people are now homeless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#J00400","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484731800,"counter":525,"content":"<p>With regard to the first point Senator Coffey raised on the local infrastructure housing activation fund, my colleague, David Walsh, might update him on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484731800,"counter":526,"content":"<p>As the Senator knows, 21 local authorities submitted a total of 74 projects.

He will know from previous experience that there is much said about that and a lot of bouncing of the ball around between the local authority and the Department.  All of us in the Department are fully alive to the reality of the very difficult housing situation we face and we are making every effort possible to move things forward more quickly, and we will continue to do that.  However, we have to remember that in many cases we are talking about very large amounts of public funds for which, as Accounting Officer, I am ultimately accountable.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has frameworks in place with which we have to comply.  Previously, there would have been a process that, technically, might have required eight or nine stages.  That has been sweated down to four stages.<\/p> <p>  With regard to smaller-scale projects up to &euro;2 million or 15 units, a one stage approval process has been introduced.  It has not got a huge take-up from local authorities.  In Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, we committed to reviewing the four stage approval process to see if there was anything further we could do in terms of making it operate more smoothly.  That report is almost finished.  The report will deal with a number of issues including clarity on what is required.  It is an issue that what is required to move a project on is not fully understood in some cases, and that can be a cause of delay.<\/p> <p>  Are there standard approaches that can be taken?  For example, standard approaches to internal layouts in housing can form layout templates that can be used as a straightforward part of projects. <\/p> <p>  With regard to turnaround timeframes between the four stages, I would like us to be in a situation where we can agree with local authorities on target timeframes but, inevitably, that requires a clear understanding of what is required because if we do not get what is required, we will not be in a position to be able to deliver on those timeframes.  We will also look to see whether there is scope to streamline the first two stages of the process and move things on.<\/p> <p>  There are a large number of projects within the four stage approval process and we will be finalising an update on those for publication with the Q1 report, many of which have completed all four stages and are either on site or at tender.  A significant number of other projects are in the pre-tender stage.<\/p> <p>  Projects are moving through the pipeline but we are committed to exploring every possible way to ensure that between ourselves and the local authorities, the system works as efficiently as possible.  To help that, a more focused, multi-diciplinary team from the Department will engage with each individual local authority to talk about projects even before they become projects, if that does not sound stupid, to ensure there is a good understanding of where the local authority is coming from and what will be the likely issues in order to expedite delivery.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Casey raised the Airbnb issue.  We addressed that in the rental strategy published before Christmas.  There were two elements to that, one of which was the immediate implications of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la ruling.  That was on a specific case where, in effect, an apartment was being used exclusively for Airbnb purposes.  The An Bord Plean&aacute;la ruling was that that use requires planning permission.  We issued guidance to all local authorities before Christmas bringing that ruling to their attention.  In the event that there are other properties operating in a similar manner, they require planning permission and need to be followed up.<\/p> <p>  On the Airbnb issue more generally, while a significant number of Airbnb properties may be advertised in any location at a particular time, what is not as clear is the extent to which some of those are being offered by people who are making their property available for a week or two when they are on holidays themselves.  There is a big gulf between the numbers of units available in Airbnb and the numbers of units available for housing generally because they are and continue to be people's primary residences.  We have recognised in the rental strategy that there are a range of issues flowing from the An Bord Plean&aacute;la case and Airbnb generally, including issues to do with tenancy regulation, tax liability and the tourism dimension.  There is a commitment in the rental strategy to establish a working group to prepare a report on that by the second quarter of this year.  We will be moving forward with that very shortly.<\/p> <p>  I could not agree more with the Deputy's point about rapid build.  Rapid build housing has been brought forward because of its capacity to deliver projects faster in order to be able to assist in dealing with the immediate issues of homelessness but, fundamentally, we are talking about new and different types of building technologies.  There is considerable scope for those technologies to be able to deliver us a good quality product in faster timelines at competitive prices.  The engagement we are having with local authorities is with a view to building up the portfolio to deliver us the 1,500 units we have referred to in the programme but if a local authority wants to take forward any social housing project employing any one of these new technologies, we will certainly look at it.<\/p><p>Obviously, there are building standards that these new technologies have to meet.  We are not in the business of delivering a less than proper product.  However, as a principle, I agree fully with the Deputy.<\/p><p> On the issues Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor raised, there are always staffing issues in every organisation.  We have staffing issues and have to prioritise and use our staffing resources in the best possible way.  As part of the process of assisting local authorities, we have provided for certain staff costs associated with our capital programmes to be covered in order that they do not have to find the resources to meet them.  Fundamentally, there is a requirement on every organisation to prioritise, our own included, and we have had to do this in delivering Rebuilding Ireland, the rental strategy and getting on with the important business of implementation.  We have to prioritise and try to use our resources in different ways.<\/p><p> On income limits, different bands are set for different areas and there is an entire process behind it.  The ultimate impact of the income bands is that they operate to target the most vulnerable.  There can be much debate on whether it should be at this, that or the other level, but at whatever level they are set, by targeting the households with an income below them, by definition the most vulnerable households are being targeted.<\/p><p> We have rolled out the HAP scheme to all local authorities, bar those in Fingal, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Dublin city, where it will be rolled out on 1 March.  The scheme has been working for the purpose of dealing with homelessness in Dublin generally.  We had a target of 12,000 tenancies last year which was achieved.  The feedback from local authorities is generally quite positive, as the Senator acknowledged.  We do receive feedback from local authorities that there are some tenants who believe the scheme is not the solution for them and it is for an individual household to form its own view.  However, we are working towards ensuring the scheme delivers quality accommodation.  All such accommodation, if it has not been inspected within the previous 12 months, has to be inspected within eight months and the issue of the standard of private rental accommodation is the focus of particular attention in the rental strategy.  There are issues with some landlords in understanding the HAP scheme, but, overall, it has reached the take-up by landlords and tenants envisaged in the targets set for last year.  As part of the further roll-out of the scheme to the remaining Dublin local authorities, we will be engaging with at least some local authorities on a further promotional campaign for both tenants and landlords to ensure there is the level of understanding needed.<\/p><p> I will be brief on the help to buy scheme because it is not in our space but in that of the Department of Finance.  The Senator made an interesting point about the fact that while there was help to buy, there was very little house building in her area.  The rationale for the help to buy scheme is that it has been introduced in response to a suggestion that there is a lack of confidence in the home building sector about the extent to which there is a mortgage-ready pool of purchasers available, if I can put it that way, and that this been holding back supply.  One can look at it as a case of the chicken and the egg, but, certainly, the help to buy scheme has been advanced on the basis that it will have a positive impact on supply.  I take the Senator's point that there may be a timelag, but it has been designed to be a supply enhancing mechanism.<\/p><p> The level of activity on local authority mortgages has been low in recent times.  Again, going back to the Senator's point, perhaps that is not surprising if there is a lack of supply, which, of course, there is.  That is the fundamental underlying problem with which we are trying to deal in Rebuilding Ireland.  Nonetheless, the local authority mortgage system has to be operated in a very careful and prudent way.  We do not want local authorities to get into the space of what might previously have been called sub-prime lending, giving rise to mortgage arrears issues down the road.  For somebody to be able to avail of a local authority mortgage, there is a requirement that he or she be able to show he or she has been refused a mortgage by two other financial institutions.  After that, there is a credit policy in place which has to be satisfied.  When one looks at the profile of the local authority mortgage book versus the private mortgage book, the incidence of arrears in the local authority mortgage book is significantly higher than it is for private institutions.  Therefore, potentially there is a lesson to be learned about whether the rules and criteria in advancing mortgages were what they should have been in the past.  There has certainly been a new credit policy in place for the past few years and it will have to continue to apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484731800,"counter":533,"content":"<p>To clarify, the Department has brought forward the new tenant purchase scheme under which local authority tenants can purchase their home.

Mr. McCarthy gave the impression that these units were of high standard.  I am sure we have all been approached - I have - by people who provide these modular homes and they look perfectly good to me.  I do not know why there has been such a huge delay.  This irritates me, given that we are all talking about the crisis, yet, when we there is a rapid build solution, it does not happen.  There is something wrong in the system, given that it delivered houses for decades.  There seems to be a huge inability to get started or have anything delivered.  Many of us were very critical about this during the debate on the evictions Bill last night.  We have had various announcements of funding by several Ministers in this and the last two Governments, yet the local authorities state they have no money.  I am delighted that Mr. McCarthy said the process had been reduced from eight or nine stages to four, but four is still too many.  I acknowledge that he said it was down to one or two stages for smaller projects, but there are still too many stages.  He also said the Department wanted to consider having a common internal layout.  We have screaming for this for years.  Every time my council in County Tipperary wanted to build four houses in any village, it had to tender for architects to engage in design and procurement.  Surely we can have designs for one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom, four-bedroom and even five-bedroom units and then adapt them.  Of course, there will be site and infrastructural issues, but, other than this, there should be a standard design.<\/p><p>There is a whole industry developing around architects and design for which there is no need and which must be cut out.  It is jobs for the boys in the industry, as far as I am concerned.  It is slowing down the entire process.  These are standard houses.  Once they are up to standard, they should be supported.<\/p><p> We ask about the voluntary sector.  Mr. Walsh said 21 out of 31 authorities have applied for this special fund.  I ask that members - me in any event - be provided with a list of them so that we know which ones did not apply.  I would also like to see similar figures for the voluntary sector.  I was very involved in the voluntary sector and I still am to a certain extent.  We were able to build a 14-bed scheme in a small rural community in 1996.  We had people in the houses within three years of our first meeting.  We were a group of laypersons.  There was not one professional in the group.  We had to hire in professional expertise and we did so.  At the time to which I refer, the county council was building a scheme for the elderly in the same field.  It ended up having 17 steps and parts to it.  We did not have one step in our project.  The county council's scheme took six years to build, with four different builders - all supervised by the council - involved.  The thing is rotten.  It is not working.  The Secretary General must sit up and take note.  I am glad to see he is present.  It is just not happening.  The county council tells us that it does not have the staff, which is true, but those involved will have to do a bit more as well, to be fair.  There is lethargy and ineptitude.  It is not acceptable to have to wait for so long in a crisis.<\/p><p> Mr. McCarthy mentioned the commercial hotels and said the Department wants to see their use as emergency accommodation stopped and 700 families removed from them.  On the day on which the announcement in this regard was made in the D&aacute;il, I was contacted by a developer in Dublin who told me the Department had bought a hotel that was for sale for that very reason.  One arm does not seem to know what the other is doing.  It appears to be absolute bedlam and chaos.  It is not functioning - full stop.  I am sorry to be so critical but that is my position.  I agree 100% with what Senator Murnane O'Connor said about families being removed from housing lists.  I know families that spent seven or eight years on housing waiting lists and then, because they went over the limit by a little, they were removed.  This was despite all the effort they make to be included on the main list and on the four-month waiting list and all the trauma they underwent.  More than 3,000 people are approved in Tipperary, a rural county.<\/p><p> Then there are individuals who want to build houses and have a few bob and couples who want to settle down and have their money and site secured.  They cannot get planning permission because local authorities are too rigid.  It is a real dog-in-the-manger job.  The county council, supervised by the Department, will not let them build and the Department will not build.  We will have to cut out all these stages.  The voluntary sector, at the time I was talking about, had one unit in the Department with which it could deal.  Before that, there were three or four.  Then it was cut down to one.  Do the witnesses know exactly how many different sections of the Department the voluntary groups have to deal with?  It is frustrating.  There are voluntary groups that have the capacity, enthusiasm and energy to build and they will and can do it.  They get local buy-in from people and get sites at better prices than local authorities.  The latter see every problem as the glass being half empty, whereas the glass is well over half full for private individuals who can do it because they are left to do it.<\/p><p> There is an awful lot of unshackling to be done.  There are too many jobs, too many conferences and too much HSE jargon.  I heard one of the witnesses talk about some kind of special group the Department set up to talk to local authorities.  I made a note of it.  It is definitely HSE jargon, and this contagion has spread throughout all the Departments.  It is a matter of pushing paper backward and forward and sweet Fanny Adams happening.  That is my honest position.  I am involved in construction and I know a bit about this matter.  I know that modular units can be built on site and that this can be done by private people, but we cannot do it.  We have all the strategies in the world but they are little good to people.<\/p><p> Then there are the evictions - the banks and the competitive aspect on the other side - whereby people are being dispossessed.  We saw yesterday that hundreds of farmers will face repossession because of another vulture fund.  More people are facing the housing crisis.  We were playing catch-up in any event but we will now be at a standstill or near standstill.  I could count on my fingers the number of houses built in Tipperary in the past three or four years.  I asked the Minister before Christmas, during the debate about rent control, to call in the county managers, make them accountable and say, \"Come on lads, for God's sake.  We're at this for a number of years.  What the hell is going on?\"  They are not held accountable.  It is not happening.  I am not being personally critical of any of the witnesses, but the system has become badly contaminated and is not working.  There is no efficiency.  As I said, voluntary groups are being starved.<\/p><p> The tenant purchase scheme was a disaster.  I think three were approved in my county in the last scheme.  That is not happening either.  How come every scheme that is introduced just does not happen?  Then there is NAMA, which recently told us it offered 1,600 units to councils.  I went about checking this out and I am confused at this stage.  We had letters back from NAMA, from my local authority - which was in a panic - and from the Housing Agency.  It is just a paper trail that we are all justifying.  Figures have been bandied about and people and families are being completely neglected.  We are part of it because we are responsible for holding the system accountable, but it is not accountable.  In fact, it has not been accountable for a long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#L00400","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484731800,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I have one specific question.  The witnesses may have touched on it already in so far as they have elaborated on the commitments made in the document last year about the establishment of new teams within the Department to work closely with local authorities in order to try to fast-track house-building.  I tabled a parliamentary question some weeks ago to seek details of what might have been approved last year alone, whether in the first half of the year under Deputy Alan Kelly's previous magnificent plan or the new Rebuilding Ireland document produced in July.  I did so with a view to seeing how this acceleration was working or whether there was evidence on the ground identifying the urgency that we know, feel and see by virtue, as previous speakers, particularly my colleague in Carlow, have alluded to in our clinics when we meet and converse with constituents around our constituencies.  They are at their wits' end in an effort to see this urgency before their eyes, which, unfortunately, they do not see.  The Minister, in response, said to refer to the Department's website, which identifies the figures.  Looking at the figures I have since got from the website, from January 2015 to date, there have been 591 new schemes for approved housing bodies and 2,775 for local authorities.  I did not get a specific breakdown for 2016.  Mr. McCarthy then says that up to about 2,700 will move towards construction this year.  I know that he must qualify his remarks and use terms such as \"move towards\", but with the help of God these houses will proceed to construction.  This frightens me because it would seem to indicate - Mr. McCarthy can correct me if I am wrong and can prove that to be the case also- that there do not seem to have been any new approvals in 2016.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that we are informed that the eight stages of the approval process have been reduced to four.  Much of what is contained in the figures I have acquired relates to schemes that might even predate 2015.  In my county, for example, two schemes for 60 houses were approved over two years ago and no ground has been broken yet.  People are watching these proceedings or they will read the record of the debate afterward.  We are merely trying to tease out where the problems and issues lie so that we can seek to have them resolved.  Our duty and responsibility is to act properly and effectively with the massive amount of funds that have been put before us, which I acknowledge and do not dispute.  I want this to succeed and I want Rebuilding Ireland to succeed.  We all want to see progress and to be in a position whereby in 12 months' time we can collectively acknowledge that progress has been made with the Minister with responsibility at the helm.  I have no problem with that.  We can play politics some other day.  We fight elections whenever we have to on the issues of the day.  However, this is the greatest emergency facing the country and we must deal with it urgently by means of an evidence-based approach.  I do not see evidence-based figures and statistics before me that I can relay to those constituents whom I meet weekly and for whom I cannot outline any progress.  It is hugely frustrating and annoying and deeply disturbing that these people are attending my clinics - I am sure the position is the same for other members - and I cannot show the urgency I think is necessary and I would hope to see in the context of replies to parliamentary questions I have tabled.  Could the witnesses clarify the new projects, proposals or developments that were approved last year and that are proceeding?  If they cannot, I ask them to make the information available to me as soon as possible.<\/p><p>If there are only 2,700 this year, and the plan refers to 1,000 to 3,000 up to 2018 and increasing to 5,000 in the years thereafter to 2021, there should be many more in these responses on the website, if it were to reflect the urgency and the effort that is being made.  As Deputy Mattie McGrath said, let us analyse who is and is not performing and let us start holding people to account to ensure the progress that is sought is made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#M00200","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484731800,"counter":539,"content":"<p>My questions will deal specifically with the Secretary General's opening statement.  Before that, in my earlier remarks I referred to the meeting of 7 December last.  I accept the Secretary General's response.  I have no problem with it and I am glad he explained it.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy stated with regard to pillar 2: \"While the final detailed figures for social housing output will be collated and published over the coming weeks, provisional figures for 2016 indicate that in excess of 18,300 households have had their social housing needs met under the range of social housing schemes, ahead of the target...\".  There are 31 local authorities in the country.  It would be helpful for us to have the figures for 2016 when they are finally collated.  These are the hard facts we must deal with and the figures are evidence based.  Perhaps Mr. McCarthy would do that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy also mentioned, and Senator Coffey raised this issue, that \"On the infrastructure front, 21 local authorities have applied for funding under the &euro;200 million local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, ...\" and he went on to outline the information on that.  We also heard from Mr. Walsh that 74 projects were involved.  Senator Coffey's question was not answered.  What 21 of the 31 local authorities are involved?  Can we have details on that?  This is the type of detail that local councillors will contact us about when they are seeking to find out the position, because they hear various things.  We must make more facts available.  There are 31 councils in the country and 21 were involved, so perhaps we could have those facts.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Walsh made a good and important point about the cost-benefit analysis of this.  I have no problem with, or ideological hang ups about, private developers but we are talking about private developers seeking this money.  They talk about it publicly and we know private developers in our constituencies who are seeking this money.  However, we must be careful about using public funds to assist and support private development over and above local authority or co-operative development.  It is an important issue.  There is a major strategic development zone, SDZ, in south County Dublin that may or may not seek some of this money.  We must be careful.  It would be wholly appropriate that a full cost-benefit analysis be carried out in this regard because this is public money and we have a public housing list and social obligations.  Perhaps the Secretary General would provide us with the list of 21 local authorities involved.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Secretary General's progress report that accompanied the papers we received today, pillar 3 refers to building more homes.  One of the actions behind schedule is No. 3.8: \"We will develop and publish an implementation plan to prioritise implementation of key recommendations within the An Bord Plean&aacute;la review\".  The An Bord Plean&aacute;la review has been completed.  Can the Secretary General explain the delay?  If something is behind schedule, there should be another column to explain how it will be brought back on schedule.  Will this be dealt with fully in the next quarter?<\/p> <p>  Finally, with regard to pillar 4, there is another action, No. 4.6, behind schedule.  It states: \"We will introduce a new affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.\"  That is one of the key issues debated in the legislation, but again it is behind schedule.  Will the Secretary General give the reasons for it being behind schedule and, more importantly, explain how he will get it back on schedule?  If this committee is to be successful in terms of scrutiny, we must work together.  This is not a case of any of us being against each other.  I echo the point Deputy Cowen made in that I, too, would be delighted if this could be delivered.  This is the Government's policy.  It is being funded and supported by the Oireachtas, so there is great consensus on it being delivered.  We wish to be helpful on these matters, so perhaps the Secretary General will elaborate on the questions I raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#N00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1484731800,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I note the importance of the LIHAF funding.

In response to Senator Boyhan, where any actions in a quarterly progress report are delayed, the intention is that we would give an update on those in the following progress report.  There were five or six actions in the third quarter reports that were delayed and we will give an update on all of those in the next quarterly report in the next few weeks.  I believe they are almost all done.  The Senator mentioned the An Bord Plean&aacute;la action, in particular.  That implementation plan has been published and is on the Department's website.  There is no problem with providing the Senator with the list of the 21 local authorities that have applied for funding under the LIHAF.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Cowen's points about ramping up progress, in an earlier response I referred to all of the projects that are in the system at present.  When something gets approved at stage 1 it must go through the design and procurement process to get it to construction and to get boots on the ground.  Over the course of 2016 projects would have moved through that approval process very extensively.  We will publish a list of all the projects - we are currently updating it - and their position in the various stages.  We will publish that on our website and send a copy to the committee at the same time.  To give the Deputy a sense of the activity ramping up, in 2016 just over 50 construction projects with approximately 700 units would have started construction on site.  On site starts, on the basis of the progress of projects to date and the work that local authorities will carry out, we estimate there will be approximately 200 projects with 2,800 units starting on site this year.<\/p><p>With the progressive ramping up from last year to this year, it demonstrates a significant uptick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484731800,"counter":547,"content":"<p>The witness alluded to my point in his commentary before giving the figures.

On the Airbnb issue, yesterday there were 1,500 properties available to rent in Dublin on the market and 6,500 properties on the Airbnb website.  I know a large number are for short letting but a very large number are for long-term letting.  My worry is that if the working group only reports back in the second quarter, we are really only looking at regulations for September, October or November.  Is there any way the working group can be brought forward or the gap between the report and regulations could be sped up?  It is an urgent issue in terms of supply.<\/p> <p>  I am sure Ms Mary Hurley is pulling out her hair with regard to the approval process.  I will make a comparison.  We rushed through very substantial and controversial legislation to fast-track the private sector planning process because of an 84-week delay.  The very first Part 8 provisions I voted on at South Dublin County Council in 2013 were for 11 houses and they have still not been built.  It is 160 weeks since we voted on that planning permission.  I know that is an extreme case but I do not get the sense, whether it is from the Minister or officials, of the same urgency in tackling the considerable delay in the four-stage process as we got we got with the private sector 100-unit plus proposal.  I share everybody's frustration.  I do not care who is responsible and this is not really about blaming the officials or local authorities.  This needs an urgent solution, as waiting 160 weeks for 11 houses is just insane.  I am sure Ms Hurley would be the first to say that privately.  We need some movement on that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, confirmed in a reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Pearse Doherty before Christmas that AIB and Permanent TSB were making available two blocks of properties totalling 1,000 vacant units to the Housing Agency, clearly in response to the agency's &euro;70 million fund.  The Minister confirmed that money for 200 of those units has been approved.  I have asked the Minister responsible for housing, Deputy Coveney, twice in parliamentary questions why funding has been made available for only 200 and he has evaded the answer twice.  If we are looking at rapid build and emptying 700 families from hotels, if there are 1,000 vacant units not on the private market - so they are not competing with first-time buyers - why are we not buying them?  Perhaps some are not suitable or they are too expensive.  Maybe some are in the wrong place.  The committee should get a list or some information on this so we have a clear explanation on the issue.<\/p> <p>  I would like an update, whether in writing after the meeting or here, on the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, funding for social housing under the plan and the ongoing debacle of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  I know it is not primarily stuck in the Department but any information would be useful.  On the housing needs assessment, we have had a 30% drop from the figures that local authorities were giving to a number of us through freedom of information requests in May last year to the September deadline.  In my local authority there was a 40% drop on the number of people on the list.  It cannot be the case that 40% of the 9,000 households under South Dublin County Council had housing needs met between May and September.  Some have gone to the housing assistance payment and some have fallen foul of the stricter application of the financial threshold, which was wrongly applied much more strictly this time around.  Dublin City Council has given until 31 March for people to contact the council to try to rectify any unfair removal from the list.  Is that a Dublin City Council issue or could a note be sent to all local authorities to say they should apply that measure?  This has been the single largest drop in the housing list seen in any recent housing needs assessment and I am very worried about it.<\/p> <p>  I have other questions but I will submit them as parliamentary questions.  We need a separate and dedicated meeting on the 29 actions in private rental strategy as we have not had a substantive debate about it.

I hope I will not repeat what others have said and will try to focus on the social housing pillar.  Homelessness is an international problem and is evident in every country.  A baby died on the streets in Portland, Oregon, which is in the richest country on the planet, and homelessness is at a phenomenal level there.  The root of the problem is the aversion to public home building compared with the 1970s, 1980s and previously.<\/p><p>From looking at the figures the poverty of ambition is incredible if one considers that we have a housing emergency.  The best-case scenario is 2,800 public houses, according to Mr. Walsh's presentation.  I also cannot get over why it is not targeted.  We know where the homeless crisis is worse and I am getting tired of saying this.  If one looks at the figures for the area breakdown for the first nine months of 2016 - figures which went very quietly up onto the website yesterday by the way - 42 social housing units were completed in the Dublin City Council area.  We know the homeless crisis is everywhere but as it is actually focused in particular parts of Dublin, why is the Department not targeting the key black spots with a huge amount of social housing and other measures?  There have been 36 units completed in Fingal.  I was a member of the local authority in Fingal for 11 years.  There are 200 families in emergency accommodation in that area at present and another 98 families - as far as I know - who are homeless but not in emergency accommodation.  Approximately 300 of the 760 families who are homeless are in Fingal and yet a paltry amount of houses are targeted to be built there and not one in the greater Blanchardstown area, where I guarantee most of the 300 families are from.  Can someone from the Department explain that please? Fingal County Council has two sites left in the Blanchardstown area where a lot of the housing crisis is.  Some 40% of the homeless in Dublin are from Dublin West.  I and other Deputies get a lot of visits from them.  There are two sites and they have not even been developed.  I would like a written case study, by a Department representative here, as to why not.  The 20 modular houses in Wellview were talked about 13 months ago.  The area is the most deprived area of the constituency and now modular houses are being lumped in.  I am not going to oppose them as anything is better than nothing - but where are they?  Let us stop calling them rapid build because that is a bit a joke at this stage.  They are not so rapid houses.  It was 13 months ago and where are they?  Of the two sites, a plan for Church Road was brought before the council, again I believe it was more than one year ago, and there is still no sign of any houses.  There is one site left beside Wellview, which is called lands north of Wellview.  Could the witnesses investigate why Fingal County Council has not bothered its barney developing that site when it has a homeless epidemic all around it?<br\/><br\/>I do not like blaming the council or officials.  Political decisions are made but the councils are telling us that the Department is telling them there is no shortage of money.  We know the tender process is a big problem - not the planning process <i>per se <\/i>but the fact that it must be put out to tender and this delays some of the process.  I believe that people should have an answer as to why, in the homeless black spot in Dublin, there has not been a house built by the council in years - since I was on the council actually.  Why have those two sites not been fast-tracked and moved?  I would have thought that if the Department wanted its figures to go up, it would target where the need is greatest.  Cork city has had one council house provided in the whole of the first nine months on 2016.  There have been 20 units built in South Dublin County Council and 16 in Limerick.  I feel for the departmental representatives as I would hate to be coming before this committee because that is an embarrassment, given the scale of the problem.  Last night the Minister said it takes time to build houses and yet, my point is, that the available sites are not even being developed by the council. <br\/><br\/>The other key problem we have is that NAMA, which is State run, is selling off so much land at the moment to vulture funds.  This is land that would definitely be needed.  If one considers the greater Blanchardstown area, which is the fastest growing area of the last ten or 15 years, the council sites are minuscule at this point.  It is, therefore, only with NAMA that we could build enough houses in the area.  NAMA is building lovely mansions up in Castleknock that are unaffordable to the vast majority.  In one deal in December 2015, a US vulture fund called Lone Star Funds bought 20% of the residential development land in Dublin.  That is absolutely incredible given that Ireland has a housing emergency.  The sites were &euro;19,000 and now they are being sold for &euro;100,000.  Nothing is being done by the Government to stop the vulture funds buying up all the valuable land that we could have used for social and affordable housing.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the homelessness figures two different accounts were given on the &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot; programme in on 4 January.  The Minister for State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Damien English said &quot;... by June next year there will be nobody living in emergency accommodation ... we will fix this.&quot;  He also said that he, the Minister, Deputy Coveney and the Department are confident they will have tackled that end of it by June.  Which June are we talking about? Are we talking about getting people out of emergency accommodation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#O01900","speaker":"1254","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484731800,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time Deputy, and that I want to get on to answers and we did go over this earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017011800002#P00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1484731800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I will finish on that point.

I wish to clarify that yes, the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland is to be using commercial hotels for emergency homeless accommodation only in exceptional circumstances by the middle of this year.  That is the commitment.  With regard to prioritising a number of different strands of activity are being deployed to be able to respond to priority areas and priority issues, particularly in homelessness.  For example, that is why there is a HAP scheme for people who are homeless operating in Dublin with greater flexibilities.  It is not operating anywhere else.  The scheme significantly achieved its target last year.  It applies across the four Dublin local authority areas.  There is a significant programme of projects at various stages across the Dublin local authorities, including at construction stage.  The rapid build programme will continue to add to that.  The question of why local authorities decide to bring forward some sites and not others, we would say to the local authority that it is for the local authority to decide and prioritise itself.  They are the local authorities for their own areas.  We ask the local authority to come forward with proposals.  On many occasions I get to hear public representatives - quite legitimately - challenging the Department for being too prescriptive and providing one-size solutions across the State.  There is a balance to be struck and in doing so we rely on local authorities as the housing authority for their area to decide where within their area they should prioritise.  Quite legitimately I would have no answer if councillors in a local authority were to ask the Department why the Department had chosen an area or that the local authority should prioritise one area over another.  It is for the local authority to decide which of its projects it wants to bring forward, and in what sequence, as part of its overall strategy for responding to housing need in its area.  This will be in the update when it is published.<\/p> <p>  There is a range of projects across the four Dublin local authorities.  To clarify for Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I can assure him that whatever frustration he senses my colleague might be facing in this regard, it is shared - with 50% more - on my part because like the Deputy, I am interested in where the problem is for the purposes of resolving it.

We have equally said to local authorities that if they have proposals which they felt they could not accommodate within the budgetary allocation provided to them they should come and talk to us.  We have said this ever since the targets were first set in 2015 because things move at different paces.  Things that we might expect to move at a particular pace in one local authority for one reason or another might not do so.  The last thing we want is to be in a situation where collectively we are not using all the valuable resources that have been made available to us for meeting housing needs.<\/p> <p>  Last year, through that agile management of projects that were moving slowly and being able to move in with other delivery mechanisms, we spent our entire housing budget.  We have a significant increase in that housing budget this year and aim again to spend wisely every single euro that is available to us.  It will require ongoing agile management.  I am not sure whether Deputy Coppinger was here earlier but in respect of recognising the priority and pressures in Dublin we engage on an incredibly regular basis with the four Dublin local authorities at chief executive and director of housing level in order to ensure we are doing everything we possibly can to be able to work with them to deliver on their housing programmes.

I am humbled and honoured to have been nominated by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality as chairperson of the Legal Aid Board for a five-year term and to be here before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  My appointment as a member of the Legal Aid Board, together with that of the other members, took effect from 8 November 2016.  I am grateful for the responsible role given to me and I look forward to the challenges that will arise.<\/p> <p>  I served a full five-year term as an ordinary member of the previous board.  That board's term of office expired on 10 October 2016 and I am the sole member to have been reappointed.  I served on a number of the board's committees and I chaired its audit and risk committee.  My experience as a member of the previous board has given me a very good understanding of both the organisation and the challenges it faces and I believe it also ensures both corporate memory and good governance practice.<\/p> <p>  I am a solicitor with over 30 years' experience in private practice.  My professional involvement continues with the firm of FitzGerald Solicitors in Cork, of which I have been the managing partner for over ten years.  I currently practise law, particularly in the area of commercial and private client.  For the benefit of the committee, I set out my involvement in areas of legal practice, community and sport.<\/p> <p>  Working in a busy legal practice, with 13 solicitors and 19 support staff, means that I am experienced in overseeing a range of areas, including commercial, child care, family law and private client.  I practise law with the benefit of up-to-date technology and case management.  Part of my work involves taking a multidisciplinary approach and directing efficient resources for timely and successful outcomes.<\/p> <p>  I come from a modest background and I understand that poverty is not just about a lack of money, it is also about a lack of access to opportunities, education and justice.  I continue to have a deep empathy and understanding of the clients of the Legal Aid Board who are persons with modest incomes and I understand the importance of access to justice for all, which is an important part of any functioning democracy.<\/p> <p>  I was involved with the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, in Cork for over 15 years.  I chaired the Cork organisation when I was a student in UCC many years ago.  I was a founding member and director of the Farranree Sheltered Housing Association, FSHA, a not-for-profit body providing accommodation to the elderly in the community.  The FSHA developed and built 39 new units locally and continues to provide sheltered accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I understand the importance of voluntary work in the community and, like most Cork people, I am passionate about hurling.  I am a member of Inniscarra GAA club and I am actively involved in coaching its under-age teams.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.<\/p> <p>  As I said, I have been a member of the Legal Aid Board since December 2011.  The Legal Aid Board commenced in 1979.  Its principal function has been to provide civil legal aid services to persons of modest means.  The board was established as a statutory body on foot of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  It provides legal services using a mixed model of delivery &ndash; it employs solicitors and support staff in law centres and it refers cases to private solicitors on a fee-per-case basis.  There are 30 law centres located throughout the country along with three specialist offices.<\/p> <p>  The board's head office is located in Cahirciveen, County Kerry, with some functions being provided from an office in Dublin.  The move to Cahirciveen was one of the early decentralisations and the permanent office opened there in 2002.  The board has a full-time equivalent staff of 425, of whom just over 300 work in law centres - 120 of these occupy solicitor positions - approximately 40 in the family mediation offices, 21 of whom are mediators, and over 80 in head office support functions.<\/p><p>The board's grant for 2017 is just under &euro;39 million.  The grant constitutes approximately 93% of the board&rsquo;s income.<br\/><br\/>Over 17,000 clients applied for civil legal aid in 2016.  The gateway to civil legal aid services is the law centre, where the vast majority of persons make their applications.  There is a merits test and there are financial eligibility criteria.  Most persons who receive legal services are required to pay a contribution.  Most areas of civil law come within the ambit of the Civil Legal Aid Act and the approach that the legislation takes is that a matter comes within the Act unless it is specifically excluded.  In practice, the majority of persons seeking civil legal aid services from the board, do so in respect of family problems.<br\/><br\/>My work with the Legal Aid Board included membership of the appeals committee, which deals with appeals on the refusal of legal aid certificates by the executive, and I have adjudicated on over 500 appeals to date.  I also chaired the audit and risk management committee.  This entailed supervising the overall risk management strategy for the board's operations.  My private practice experience has been instrumental in shaping the risk management strategies of the board in the practice of law over wide ranging areas.  I have also advised on the important liaison with the Comptroller and Auditor General's office on the annual audit of the board's activities.<br\/><br\/>The board's law centres have waiting lists, which is a continuing challenge.  In some ways the recession was the perfect storm for the organisation as demand for services increased very significantly at a time of constrained resources.  On 1 January 2014, there were over 5,000 applicants waiting for legal services.  The figure is now under 2,000, which is a welcome improvement.  Urgent cases are prioritised.  Nevertheless, the fact that there are persons waiting is not ideal.  I wish to work with the board and to support the staff in continuing to reduce the waiting list to a manageable number.<br\/><br\/>I have mentioned the financial eligibility criteria, which have not been significantly revised in over ten years.  I wish to examine the criteria to ensure that those who genuinely cannot afford to pay for legal services are not disqualified for financial reasons, particularly in cases where working people of modest incomes are provided with additional State support, for example, the family income supplement, thus potentially creating a poverty trap.<br\/><br\/>Change in the legal arena is ongoing and some of it impacts on the board&rsquo;s business.  The board is a key player in the recently launched Abhaile scheme which aims to support, with financial and legal advice, those at risk of having their homes repossessed.  There is a statutory provision, yet to be commenced, to transfer responsibility for the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s legal aid scheme to the board.  There are also significant legal aid provisions in the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 that have yet to be commenced.  I see the board as having an important role in ensuring that these and other similar changes are given effect in a manner that best serves the client.<br\/><br\/>In November 2011, a legislative amendment transferred responsibility for the State-funded family mediation services to the board.  The rationale for this was that there was considerable scope for synergising the delivery of civil legal aid services in family cases with the provision of a family mediation service.  The board&rsquo;s family mediation services are provided out of nine full-time and eight part-time offices.  Mediation services are provided without reference to a person&rsquo;s means and are free of charge.  The board opened its first co-located family mediation office and law centre in Jervis Street last year.  There are plans to co-locate further offices.  The board also has mediators situated full-time in the District Family Court in Dublin.  We can do more to divert those experiencing difficult family problems from the adversarial court process to the process of mediation and I wish to work with the board, the staff and other stakeholders to ensure that real options are available to those experiencing relationship breakdown and that the court process is not simply seen as the automatic default.<br\/><br\/>In November 2010, the Government transferred the responsibility for the administration of criminal legal aid from the Department of Justice and Equality to the board.  To date, responsibility for three <i>ad hoc<\/i>schemes, namely, the Criminal Assets Bureau legal aid scheme, the legal aid &ndash; custody issues scheme and the Garda station advice scheme, have been transferred.  The transfer of responsibility for the main criminal legal aid scheme requires a statutory amendment.  I understand that a criminal legal aid Bill incorporating the amendment is likely to be published shortly.  I want the board to work with the Department on the forthcoming criminal legal aid legislation.  This legislation will transfer responsibility for the administration of criminal legal aid in addition to putting in place reforms to the system.  The expenditure on criminal legal aid in any year is approximately &euro;50 million and a priority, when the board has responsibility, will be to ensure good governance.<br\/><br\/>A longer term objective I have for the new board is to have a more holistic look at the broader access to justice landscape and to examine if the board is playing its role as effectively as it could or if there should be a refocus in terms of the work it does and does not do.  I am aware of significant changes in the legal aid landscape that have either occurred or are being planned in neighbouring jurisdictions.  I am not suggesting that we should follow some of the actions that they have taken but to quote Francis Bacon, &quot;Things alter for the worse spontaneously, if they not be altered for the better designedly&quot;.  I am keen to ensure that there is coherence and logic to the legal aid regime we have and that it continues to contribute meaningfully to access to justice.

The Abhaile scheme was introduced in October 2016, so it is relatively new.  The scheme is being co-ordinated with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.  The involvement of the Legal Aid Board is that if MABS decides that a person is entitled to legal advice, a voucher is issued which entitles the person to get legal advice from a private practitioner.  I am not aware of the number of practitioners who have signed up to the scheme today, but that information will be furnished to the committee as necessary.  Approximately 1,000 vouchers for legal advice have issued since the scheme opened and about 450 of the vouchers have been redeemed to date.<\/p> <p>  The Abhaile scheme also deals with personal insolvency matters.  Under new legislation, there is now a facility to challenge a personal insolvency application if the lending institutions do not agree with the proposal.  The method of doing that is an appeal to the Circuit Court.  A number of legal aid certificates have been granted in respect of such appeals before the Circuit Court.  The most recent figures I saw show that between 16 and 20 of those legal aid certificates had been issued.<\/p><p>I am also aware of four certificates having been issued for an appeal from the Circuit Court to the High Court on points of law.  The third point on the Abhaile scheme is that a duty solicitor has now been put in place in the office of the repossession registrar and the courts in order that persons coming before the courts who are often unrepresented will be given the opportunity to receive some legal advice and directed towards the various schemes now available.  <\/p><p> The Senator also asked me about the minimum contribution.  Currently, it is &euro;130.  There are no plans to reduce it, but, as I said in my address, the question of eligibility for legal aid is being considered by the board.  It was put in place in November and we have had one board meeting so far.  There will be another tomorrow and on the agenda is the question of eligibility and putting proposals to the Minister in due course.  On the waiver of contributions, a waiver scheme operates and is often applied in domestic violence cases.  I have looked at the agenda for the meeting tomorrow and that issue will be before the board for consideration.  I do not want to pre-empt its decision, but the matter will be given a sympathetic hearing.  <\/p><p> The final question the Senator asked was about waiting times and the use of the private practitioner scheme.  The board operates a number of private practitioner schemes.  The one of particular interest is probably in respect of District Court matters, including domestic violence, custody and access.  The scheme is utilised as best as possible within the budget to alleviate waiting lists.  We are constrained in the use of the scheme, but in any given year approximately 5,000 cases are referred to private practitioners to try to alleviate waiting lists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017011800002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I will come back in briefly on that point.

I am more interested in how long people have been waiting than in how many are on the list.  The number on the list is determined by demand, which can vary from centre to centre and depend on what is happening in society and the legal arena.  The real question is for how long people have been waiting to get a service.  The board's objective is to have a substantive service available to people within four months of being seen.  As we are not meeting that objective in every centre in the country, we are trying to reach that point.  In addition, during the term of the last board we introduced what was known as a triage system, whereby if a person did not receive a substantive service within four months, we would try to get to a position where he or she would see a solicitor within six weeks to receive advice.

I have never met or represented anybody who managed to receive civil legal aid.  That is the problem.  Let us be clear about this.  Most people cannot access civil legal aid.  That has been my experience.  That is not Mr. O'Leary's fault and I am not blaming him or personalising the matter; it is just an evaluation of the process.  There must be a complete overhaul of how the system is administered.  Is it not the case that the law centres are the only places that deal with civil legal aid applications and that for an ordinary practising solicitor to qualify or be vetted and approved, as appropriate, to provide free legal aid, he or she must undertake a huge volume of free work to such an uneconomical level that most do not do it?  I am not sure, but is that a correct characterisation of the process?<\/p> <p>  On the number on the waiting list, there are obviously financial and repossession cases, but there are also family law issues.  In many instances, my experience has been that women in a vulnerable position have not been able to receive free civil legal aid where timing is of the essence and there is a certain urgency.  In these circumstances having a waiting list is not acceptable.  What is the story in that regard?  It appears that there are very few people who can provide a civil legal aid service.  The other aspect is repossession cases.  The number turning up in such cases without representation is growing.  Is Mr. O'Leary saying there is now somebody in every court who will go to every person involved in a repossession case and say, \"I am the local fellow here and if you want some legal advice before the case is heard, you can talk to me\"?  If that is the case, I was not aware of it.<\/p> <p>  On criminal legal aid, I do not wish to be derogatory, but from visiting courthouses in many parts of the country it is something of a gravy train for solicitors who take on free criminal legal aid cases.  The same solicitor stands up in every case.  It is cursory representation.  One gets the impression that he or she does not know the person involved and does not care.  He or she makes the same points in every case.  It is like a treadmill and completely unacceptable.  What level of oversight is there in that regard?  A legal firm which is seeking to be approved by the Legal Aid Board must make an application in every jurisdiction.  Can that system be overhauled?  There should be just one application to cover all counties, rather than having a solicitor vetted in each county.  It is increasingly becoming a problem in the District Court around the country.  Because of a certain cosy atmosphere in these courts, a defendant might wish to be represented by someone from outside the jurisdiction, yet his or her legal firm in Dublin, for example, must be vetted in Clare, Kerry or another county.  From the point of view of simplifying the bureaucracy involved, surely one application should cover every county.  Would that not help to streamline the process and save an enormous amount of administrative resources?  It is a practical suggestion.<\/p> <p>  In addition, will Mr. O'Leary deal with the legal aid custody advice scheme?  I understand the fees being paid under the scheme are incredibly low.  They almost act as a deterrent in making it difficult for legal practitioners who might wish to take on prisoner cases.  If they wish to do so, there is a substantial cost involved because the fees are lower.  Is there a difference between the fees paid under the scheme and those paid under other schemes?  Will Mr. O'Leary outline the fees paid in such cases or how it works?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017011800002#D01400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484730000,"counter":627,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her good wishes.  She raised a number of issues.  <\/p> <p>  On criminal legal aid, as the board has not yet taken over the substantive scheme, I do not have the details.  <\/p> <p>  A sum of &euro;1.4 million was spent last year under the custody scheme.  I cannot give the figures for the individual payments per attendance.  <\/p> <p>  The criminal legal aid scheme has served the country well for the more than 30 years it has been in existence.  Thankfully, tere are very few cases involving a miscarriage of justice in this country.  We have seen miscarriages of justice in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and America.  Our system is robust.  A defendant has a constitutional right to select his or her own solicitor.  When the Deputy says that sometimes the same person stands up in the District Court, it is because the defendant has sought that particular individual who might be very well versed in the particular area of law.  I practised for approximately 15 years in the District Court, but that was some time ago.<\/p> <p>  On the numbers receiving civil legal aid and the Deputy's observation that people do not qualify, the number who qualified last year was just over 17,000.  The majority of those cases involved family law matters, including family disputes, domestic violence, custody, access or child care, and take up a considerable length of time.<\/p><p>The question of priority and waiting lists is important.  There is no doubt that cases requiring priority, such as domestic violence, are given urgent priority and effectively no waiting lists will apply to a person who is in need of advice on a domestic violence matter.  Where a child has been taken into care or where a statutory provision under the Statute of Limitations arises, the cases are carefully examined by the board and are prioritised - I can guarantee the committee of that.<\/p><p> Reference was made to free work by practitioners to get on the civil legal aid scheme.  First, the civil legal aid scheme is not free.  Contributions are paid.

They might have a pending court case.  I echo the comments of Mr. O'Leary with regard to waiting times for certain types of cases, such as domestic violence or child custody access cases.  Our experience in the Cork office is that people will always get representation and advice and there is no waiting list.  If there is an ongoing case, it may be transferred to a different practitioner but the initial court case will always be dealt with efficiently.  That should be noted.<\/p> <p>  I know the board will be examining income thresholds.  There is a cliff-edge threshold and if a person is &euro;100 over the threshold, it is a problem.  I presume no discretion is available to the board to consider cases in the whole.  If not, could that change if the Minister so wished?  Could the Minister give some level of discretion to the board?<\/p> <p>  The other area I am keen to touch on is the family mediation service.  How successful has the service been in dealing with waiting lists?  In my experience of cases, especially family law cases, a person who approaches the board is diverted to the family mediation service.  It may be dealt with there without having to go to court proceedings.  Does the board have figures or statistics on how successful it is and whether it will be expanded?  I realise it involves a number of sectors.  Anyway, in the coming five years is this something the board is looking to expand?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017011800002#E00700","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484730000,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Brien for his kind wishes.  It is nice to speak to a fellow northsider from Cork.  I agree with the Deputy on the point about income thresholds.  The cliff-edge effect is unsatisfactory.

In that way, at least people would still qualify and we would not have the effect of all duck or no dinner.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Brien referred to the family mediation service.  That is an important part of the work of the board.  The board took over the family mediation services five years ago.  Considerable work has gone into integrating both services.  I referred to the Jervis Street co-located office that opened recently.  My view and the view of the board is that the more cases we can keep out of court and keep within mediation, the better.  This brings better outcomes for the parties involved and is less adversarial.  An agreement is more likely to stick in the long term than a court-enforced judgment, no matter how well intentioned.  I examined the statistics recently.  In cases where people attend mediation and both parties engage, we are getting up to a 50% success rate in terms of a mediated agreement.  That is a positive and impressive statistic and one we can maintain.  New schemes are being operated including in Cork, Athlone and Castlebar.  These are termed mandatory information schemes.  This means if a person wants to get a legal aid scheme to go to court, then he has to attend a mandatory information session first.  I am not suggesting we are forcing people to go the mediation route but we are giving them the opportunity and the information that is necessary for them to engage in that route.  From a holistic view of the court services and access to justice, mediation is an area where there could be significant improvement in the sense of the way we have managed society and access to justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017011800002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I realise the income question is something the board will examine.

I will offer the Deputy an example relating to a social welfare payment such as the family income supplement.  That is taken into account.  If a payment is not a social welfare payment, then it is not taken into account.  I came across an example recently involving a housing assistance payment.  This payment is replacing rent supplement.  If an applicant is on rent supplement, the payment is taken into account in the income.  However, if the applicant is on the housing assistant payment, it is not because it is not a social welfare payment.  Instead, it is paid by the local authorities.  Such anomalies have to be sorted for everyone to be treated equally.  In an ideal world, some level of discretion should be allowed.  If we could remove some of the anomalies relating to the allowance and avoid the poverty trap to ensure those on modest incomes get access, it would be an improvement.  To be fair, everyone involved in the organisation &ndash; it is a large and fantastic organisation &ndash; is interested in access to justice and they understand the importance of it.

We had largely understood the subject matter in our appearance would mainly be the N59, on which we are working with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  In the past few days and again this morning we received notification that various members wanted to speak about different roads.  I have not been briefed on all of them and I am not sure if the issues are being raised in the context of our role with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, but we are happy to discuss them with the committee.<br\/><br\/>We thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to discuss the N59 road project.  With a broad range of functions, including in the areas of rural affairs and regional development, the Department is fully cognisant of the importance of the project to the western region and keen to assist in whatever way it can to ensure it is delivered in a way that is compliant with national and European Law. <br\/><br\/>The N59 stretches from south of Sligo town, through County Mayo and Connemara, to Galway city, but the portion in which we are interested today is the portion in County Galway stretching from Oughterard to Clifden.  The project encompasses two separate but related development projects &ndash; the Oughterard to Maam Cross and the Maam Cross to Clifden projects.<br\/><br\/>The development of the Oughterard to Maam Cross section of the N59 was approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in December 2013.  The board made its decision at the time subject to certain conditions.  The Department&rsquo;s involvement at this stage of the road project is very unusual.  In the normal course of events, when an application is approved by a planning authority, whether it be a county council or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, following consideration of observations made by a range of statutory consultees under planning law, including the Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, such a development is free to proceed without further reference to the Department.  In this instance, however, the role of the Department post-consent arises from an unusual condition attached to the planning permission imposed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It provides, &quot;Prior to the commencement of construction, the Construction Stage Erosion and Sediment Control Plan and all method statements will be finalised by the construction stage contractor and will be subject to the approval of Galway County Council and the Agreement of NPWS and IFI&quot;.This condition was proposed by Galway County Council at the second oral hearing during the planning process.  It is our understanding such a condition was included to ensure, <i>inter alia<\/i>, that the project would proceed in a manner consistent with Ireland's legal obligations under the habitats directive which all public authorities, including Galway County Council, are required to fulfil. <br\/><br\/>Eight method statements have been submitted by Galway County Council to the Department.  Unfortunately, it has not always been possible for the Department to approve the method statements submitted for a range of reasons, including because they had not been approved by the council in the first instance prior to submission, inconsistencies in data presented or because of the omission of or uncertainty attached to key information.  On such occasions, the council was requested to provide the outstanding information or revise and resubmit the method statements in accordance with the terms of the planning permission.<\/p><p>To date, two of these have been approved by the Department.  To ensure a more unified approach to the development, on this Department's initiative, senior officials from the Department and the then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government met the chief executive and other senior officials of Galway County Council on 27 April last to discuss the project.  The purpose of the meeting was to see how the project could proceed as quickly as possible in compliance with Irish law, European nature directives, the council's obligations and, in particular, having regard to the freshwater pearl mussel, of which there is a significant and important population in the Owenriff river.<\/p><p> The freshwater pearl mussel is protected and is an extremely sensitive species that is dying out in many places.  As Ireland has a large proportion of the European population of these mussels, the Commission has paid particular attention to activities here that might be harmful.  Indeed, following the An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision of December 2013, the Commission contacted Ireland and raised concerns about the impact of the project on the pearl mussel.  We understand that a number of complaints related to the board's decision were made to the Commission as well.  Since 2006, an ongoing legal process has been under way with the Commission.  Thus far, Ireland has managed to prevent an escalation to a full case before the European Court of Justice.<\/p><p> In this instance, primary responsibility for complying with the European nature law lies with Galway County Council as the developer and, as such, the need to ensure compliance with European law was fully endorsed by all at the meeting.  It was agreed that the Department would work with the county council to see how best the project could proceed.  This approach was subsequently endorsed on 15 June last year at a meeting chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Kyne, and attended by Oireachtas representatives from west Galway, officials of Galway County Council and officials of our Department.<\/p><p> On 16 September 2016, officials from the Department travelled to Galway to meet council officials to see what practical steps could be taken to move on the project.  It was agreed that the best approach would be to progress the road project section by section.  The idea behind this was to allow the development to advance by progressing the less sensitive sections of the road quickly.  In parallel, it was agreed to continue to explore how best to deal with the more challenging sections.  At that meeting, the Department gave a commitment that it would review and respond to method statements submitted to us within ten days of receipt.<\/p><p> We understand that the local authority is making arrangements for the preparation of a method statement for the Maam Cross to Bunakill section now.  This is approximately 5 km from Maam Cross to the edge of the pearl mussel catchment.  While this is still awaited from the council, at this point the Department does not envisage any significant problems advancing that part of the road.  In the meantime, it is also understood that Galway County Council is considering upgrading the surface of the other sections of the road.  We understand that this is not being put forward by the council as a long term solution but rather is intended to improve the road on an interim basis while the council charts the best way forward to develop the entire route.  At this point, it is largely a matter for the council to decide how best to progress the remainder of the road project.<\/p><p> The Department has engaged with, and has provided advice to, the developer, that is, Galway County Council, throughout the pre-planning stage for the Maam Cross-to-Clifden section of the road project.  The receiving environment for this project is of great importance for nature conservation.  Extensive areas of the project form part of the Natura 2000 network of European sites.  The network is made up of special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  Four such sites are intersected by the projects, namely, the Twelve Bens Garraun complex SAC, the Maumturks SAC, Connemara bog complex SAC and Connemara Bog complex special protection area.<\/p><p> On 20 May last, An Bord Plean&aacute;la published its decision to refuse planning permission for this section of road for reasons related to the habitats directive.  The decision appears to have been reached as a result of a lack of information and data presented to it in the context of the habitats in the location of the proposed road development.  The Department understands from recent discussions with Galway County Council that the council is now considering how to progress this portion of the road in sections.  We understand that the council believes it should be possible to advance some sections of this element of the road relatively quickly while finalising the best way forward for the entire route.  Again, this is a matter for the council to bring forward but the Department will work within its remit and proactively to assist the council.  The Department wishes to assist the county council in whatever way it can with this project.  We believe that by complying with national and European laws, the project should avoid falling foul of legal challenge.  While key decisions on exactly how to move the project forward remain to be made by the council, the Department will keep in contact with it, will provide such advice and assistance as it can and will deal with any submissions, method statements or proposals received in a timely fashion.<\/p><p> We will be happy to provide further information and to try to deal with any questions that members may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017011800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Fitzgerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>M&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas as sin.

Would it be possible to amend the proposed legislation to include a more general provision about removing lands from national heritage areas?  Would it be possible to set aside enough land from the NHA to build the road to An Spid&eacute;al on the line that the people of Connemara want?  Part of the way out of An Spid&eacute;al is all in a national heritage area rather than a special protection area.  If the legislation was amended would there be any ecological reason to refuse it and put in place some other compensatory measure to allow that road to get built?<\/p> <p>  I seldom hear a statement from the Department as damning of another agency as the statement from Mr. Fitzgerald.  The Department is normally careful in what it says.  Mr. Fitzgerald said that Galway County Council asked for this condition to be included.  When the proposal for the Maam Cross to Oughterard stretch went to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, did the Department express concerns that remained following the two oral hearings?  In other words, have the concerned of the Department not been addressed?  Were there outstanding issues or concerns that the inspector was being asked to adjudicate on?  I presume Mr. Fitzgerald understands what I am trying to say.  Was that the reason the county council suggested the Department should submit method statements?  If that is the case, it seems to indicate some lack of communication between the two agencies in developing a plan for the road.  Perhaps that is what has led us to this frustrating position.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, Mr. Fitzgerald said that the Department could not approve method statements because some simple things had not been done.  For example, the council had not approved something it was under an obligation to approve.  If it was something simple, it could have been brought to the council to get it approved.  Mr. Fitzgerald also referred to inconsistences in the data presented and the omission or uncertainty of key information.  Perhaps Mr. Fitzgerald can confirm whether I am reading it correctly, but he seems to be suggesting that these method statements were deficient.  I presume the council used expert consultants to do this work.  This raises a question that we will have to ask the county council.  Should the council be paying these consultants if they are not delivering top-quality documents?<\/p><p> I have a few questions on pearl mussels.  Europe seems to have destroyed most of its pearl mussels but we did not.  How prevalent is the pearl mussel in Ireland?  It seems to be in every god-damned river in the west of Ireland.  How scarce it is in Ireland?  I accept we probably have the best remaining examples of machair habitats but are we becoming the whipping boy for Europe because we did not destroy our heritage?  I ask the delegation to give a general explanation, I am sure Dr. O'Keeffe will be able to do so, on the prevalence of pearl mussels.  <\/p><p> Mr. Fitzgerald said in his presentation, \"Since 2006, an ongoing legal process has been under way with the Commission.\"  I take it that has to do with the pearl mussel but nothing to do with the pearl mussel in this particular river or anything that has happened there.  In other words, the case relates to other incidents of pearl mussels and has nothing to do with the N59.  In fact, one of the amazing things about the N59 is that planning permission was refused for a new bridge because its shadow might interfere with a few pearl mussels underneath. <\/p><p> The Maam Cross to Clifden section went to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  When the Department was in An Bord Plean&aacute;la process, had it withdrawn all of its concerns?  Was it still expressing concern before the inspector about the proposals of the county council and others?  Are we again in a situation in which these issues were not resolved beforehand despite the fact that the Department had said it had engaged with the developer?  In this case it was the local authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  <\/p><p> Mr. Fitzgerald has put a damning statement on the record of this House.  He stated, \"The [board's] decision appears to have been reached as a result of a lack of information and data presented to it in the context of the habitats in the location of the proposed road development.\"  In other words, the Department is saying again that the county council and the experts that it hired, who would have received a massive amount of money, did not do their homework and that this is what has left us in a lot of the mess.  I ask Mr. Fitzgerald to confirm this.<\/p><p> I ask the delegation to confirm that between Clifden and Derrylea, which is the western section of the road, there are no significant adjacent natural heritage issues.  I ask them to also confirm that the county council is fairly free to go ahead and develop its project between the town and the new and improved section of the road, which is a stand-alone piece, that it is unlikely there would be natural heritage or habitat implications and that the project could go ahead, thus benefitting the people of Connemara.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017011800002#F00300","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":660,"content":"<p>Would the witnesses like to address the questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017011800002#G00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484730000,"counter":661,"content":"<p>We will do our best.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about the number of infrastructural projects with which our Department, and in particular the National Parks and Wildlife Service, may have raised concerns as part of the planning process as a statutory consultee or later on when something was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

I cannot think of any other in which we are involved at this level.  It has nothing to do with Galway County Council and how it operates.  It is operating well in conjunction with the Department.  What is at issue is that we have been placed, with Inland Fisheries Ireland, as a secondary consent authority after An Bord Plean&aacute;la made its decision.  As I mentioned, in the normal course, such developments would proceed once the statutory process had been completed.  The problem is not particular to Galway County Council; it is just the way the decision was made.<\/p> <p>  The two method statements approved were relatively simple.  They concerned the construction of compounds and some ground investigation works.  We held a workshop with Galway County Council to see how best they could be presented to the Department and agreed to a template for them.  It was difficult for both organisations to do this because Galway County Council does not have any experience in submitting method statements for approval to another body, namely, the Department which also has no experience in dealing with them.  The lack of engineering expertise in the Department was not an issue because we had not reached the stage of actually looking at the issue of road construction.  At that stage we were looking at the design and the nature of the conservation elements.  That is why we met council officials in April last year to determine how we could work better together on the method statements and so on.  That is the solution which has been reached by Galway County Council in dealing with the project section by section.  It may be the best way forward.<\/p> <p>  I can understand how there is frustration about the project.  We did meet council officials in September, but we have not received a method statement from Galway County Council since.  I understand, however, that it is in the process of acquiring engineers to do so.  The commitment to turn around the method statements within ten days remains.  If a method statement for the Bunakill-Maam Cross element of the project is sent to us, we do not see any issue arising because it is outside the pearl mussel catchment area.  The element of the project in the Glengowla and Lough Agraffard area is difficult because of the presence of the pearl mussel population.<\/p> <p>  On compensatory measures, the Senator is probably referring to the IROPI, imperative reasons of overriding public interest, process, whereby projects may go ahead, evn though they may cause damage to Natura sites, if there are imperative reasons of overriding public interest.  In these cases, several conditions are required to be met.  First, as the name suggests, there have to be imperative reasons of overriding public interest and there have to be no alternatives available.  I am sure these arguments could be made in the case of the N59 project.  Compensatory measures also need to be put in place to compensate for any habitat loss.  As far as I understand, this is not a route Galway County Council or Transport Infrastructure Ireland is intending to pursue at this stage.

We, as public representatives, are getting it constantly.  Practically not a week goes by in Galway but there is some comment on the radio or something about a meeting being held regarding this project, and we are still no further on.<\/p> <p>  I remember - Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was involved in this - we secured funding a number of years ago to get a pedestrian bridge in Oughterard so that the children from one end of the village could cross the Owenriff river to get where all the schools are on the other side and the National Parks and Wildlife Service objected on the grounds that the shadow from the bridge would affect the freshwater pearl mussel, and the funding had to be sent back.  Then one has to stand up in front of a meeting and explain to parents who are trying to get their children to school safely that the fresh water pearl mussel is more important.  In 1974, when they built the new bridge in Oughterard, they used dynamite to blow the rock out of the river.  I presume one or two freshwater pearl mussels flew out with it, but they survived.  We all have a responsibility to protect the environment and we all play our role in that as a Oireachtas Members, but we have a responsibility also as Oireachtas Members to provide better roads for those who use them.  A total of 187 people were killed on the roads last year.  The number has already risen this year.  We have a responsibility to ensure we put a proper road in place.  We can put a man on the moon and bring him back but we cannot build a bit of a road between Oughterard and Clifden.  Mr. Fitzgerald should try to explain that to the public.  What is so important about the freshwater pearl mussel?<\/p> <p>  I remember, as a boy, going out to Ballyconneely.  I was only six or seven, and we were practically on a dirt track.  In all fairness to various Governments down through the years, significant upgrades have been made to that road but the freshwater pearl mussel has still survived.  When that work was done the National Parks and Wildlife Service did not have any role, but with all these new rules and regulations, and when one hears President-elect Donald Trump turning his back on Doonbeg because of Europe and these rules and regulations that have come down on top of them, what kind of signal does that send out about investment in Ireland?  We are too strict in implementing these rules.  There should be a little bit of leeway on this.  We had spent &euro;14 million of that &euro;19 million on the proposal to build a new ring road around Galway city.  That was knocked down because of the bog cotton and the limestone pavement.  One would have been better if we had put that money into a carpark and burnt it.<\/p> <p>  We are going through a process in Galway city to build a new N6 road project.  What consultation has taken place between the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Arup and Galway County Council on this project and will there be problems regarding that project as well?  I would like Mr. Fitzgerald to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  Returning to the N59, my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, touched on the fact that eight method statements were submitted by the local authority and, as Mr. Fitzgerald stated, only two minor ones were approved.  Mr. Fitzgerald stated he went down and met the local authorities.  I presume these method statements are being put together by consultants who are being paid and, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated, the meter is running and the cost is rising.  Has Mr. Fitzgerald met the consultants?  Have the local authority, the consultants and the Department sat down around a table to try and find a solution to this?<\/p> <p>  Finally, in his conclusion, Mr. Fitzgerald stated, \"We believe that by complying with national and European laws, the project should avoid falling foul of legal challenge.\"  Can he outline who will take the legal challenge, on what grounds this legal challenge could be taken and who would instigate this legal challenge?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017011800002#J00200","speaker":"1313"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484730000,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I will try and deal with those issues and let my colleague, Dr. O'Keeffe, in only on the importance of the freshwater pearl mussel, which Deputy Grealish raised.

The Commission raised its own concerns about the N59.  People are very aware of this and as we know, there are people who have particular interests in various ecological issues and could at any time raise a challenge, whether seeking court injunction or whatever.

I know that a lot of what is happening there is happening and has happened in relation to the Macroom bypass and other infrastructural projects in County Kerry.<\/p> <p>  Surely the people who pay motor tax, and that is the people of Galway, and west Galway in this case, are entitled to a proper safe road when going back and forth in their daily lives.  I cannot understand the reason that the many bodies who are charged with looking after the interests of people cannot sort out the provision of a road for the people.  I am referring to bodies such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the local authority, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Should it not be the business of the local authority, Galway County Council, TII or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to sort out how best the road could be built, first for the safety of the people and as a secondary consideration to the best of their ability to mind the pearl mussel or any other species of importance.  Surely it should be left up to the people who are building the road to deal with secondary considerations.<\/p> <p>  I have built roads within 30 metres of the pearl mussel and we did not damage the species.  I know all about filtration and silt ponds and all that goes with dealing with sensitive areas in dry weather.  That should not be the business of the National Parks and Wildlife Service at all, it should be the business of the people building the road.  The Department should keep its nose out of it.  I welcome the representatives from the National Parks and Wildlife Services, but I cannot see it has a role to play in the building of the road.  It should be up to the people who are doing it, such as the local authority, to deal with matters arising.  There is a proper method of building the road and if they do not comply with that, it is the role of the NPWS to get stuck into them if they do damage to the pearl water mussel or to any other species.  Once they have followed the plan to the best of their ability, it should not be the business of the NPWS to focus on the method statement or to see how they would do the work.  There is a way to proceed and we should let them at it.  If they do not comply, that is the time to step in.  It should be the body that is building the road that must comply with method statements.  It is a matter between them and the contractor.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Grealish states, there is a road already.  It is not interfering with the pearl water mussel.  The people in Europe had no say in it.  The people did their best and had to provide a road to get to their homes, villages and towns.  They need to be able to go to Galway city.  People always did their best.<\/p> <p>  Whether we realise it or not, the landowners and people living in an area, take pride in their place and do not try to damage it by just wanting to live in the place.  They always take pride in their place.  One can see evidence of that in all local communities, be it the Tidy Towns committee or other community development organisations.  People have pride in their place.  I am asking the witnesses to stay out of it and let the people who are building the road do the work but have somebody checking that the work is being done according to plans.  As a nation we should have one objective, namely, the road must be built because the people need a road that is built to a standard to prevent fatalities.  I appeal that they be allowed to go ahead with this project.<\/p> <p>  Let me outline what will happen if this project is held up.  The Macroom bypass was of significant importance to the people of County Kerry.  The project was held up when we had money by people protecting a snail.  Now we do not have money and we have our hand out and the objectors have gone to ground.  Now we cannot get the money to build the road.

In that case, there might be a clear case that the bog would be damaged and compensatory measures would be required.  That is very black and white.  If I understand correctly, the issue between Oughterard and Bunakill is different.  The issue is that were the road to be built properly, it actually would be better for the pearl mussel because unlike the current position where everything that comes off the road - such as bits of tyres, debris from wear and tear and silt - goes straight into drains and rivers, there would be these silt ponds and so on and cleaner waters would be delivered into the rivers.<\/p> <p>  My understanding is the challenge is to build the road without damage and that so doing is not that difficult.  The problem is to build a road and be absolutely sure, no matter what weather circumstances arise, that there would be no damage and to prove that beforehand.  My understanding is the European Union has put in a test with an incredibly high standard, when human realities are taken into account, with a view to eliminating the damage.  If one followed that test sitting in one's car going home this evening, one would not drive home because one could not pass the test because one could not be sure of arriving home safely.  One would do nothing.  One would not get up in the morning and nor would one stay in bed because one might die in bed.  One just would not move.<\/p> <p>  My question is very simple.  Supposing all reasonable precautions were taken to minimise the risk, supposing the road was built and supposing there was no damage, which would be very likely if all reasonable precautions were taken but one did not adhere to this ridiculous test, what could the European Union do then?  I can see a situation where somebody would get killed on that road because of the condition of the road.  Then we will have decided that a very minor risk in the short term to the pearl mussel during construction, but not the long term in which we know the situation will be better, was more important than a person's life.  That insignificant risk is more important than people's lives because of the impossible test Europe has put in place.  I live in Connemara.  Give me a choice of a person's life over an insignificant risk to a pearl mussel and I will take a person's life any day of the week.  It is time that we start asking ourselves some hard questions.<\/p> <p>  I have been hearing for years about this grave terror of Europe in court, but as Mr. Fitzgerald said himself, Ireland has never been fined.  Although they keep threatening fire and brimstone, it seems to me that they do not act, and even if they were to issue a fine, Mr. Fitzgerald has admitted it would be totally insignificant.  We must start deciding the balance between people and the environment, as we were doing for hundreds of years, when we preserved our environment and they destroyed their environment.  I think when we did it for ourselves, we were doing fine and the evidence is there all over the country.  It is in Connemara in particular, with the amount of SACs we have where the people preserve nature.  A lot of the threats to nature we now face in Connemara threaten the pearl mussel much more significantly than the possible risk from a once-off building of a road, including policies followed by the State on the usage of the lake.<\/p> <p>  I also am told, for example, that what is killing the curlews is not the cutting of hedges but the mink species, which was introduced into Ireland and is running totally amok.  They are on the islands where the curlews used to nest and are now destroying it.  We always seem to be chasing the wrong problem.  We seem not to listen to the people on the ground who have intimate knowledge of nature, who preserve that nature and care for that nature, the lakes, the rivers and the land.  It is time that we started making hard decisions as to where the interests of the people lie and taking our chances with Europe.  If the road was built, I am sure Mr. Fitzgerald is going to tell me that they could not take any case because no damage would have been caused to the habitat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017011800002#L01700","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":728,"content":"<p>To come back to the current logjam with Galway County Council, it is important to note, and we are all aware, that there was a significant bereavement in Galway County Council involving a director of services who was dealing with these issues.

If not, what reasons has Galway County Council given Mr. Fitzgerald for the delay?  Is the delay due to a lack of staffing and expertise in Galway County Council or too great a workload?

My understanding is that IROPI is used extensively in countries such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and Germany.  I have looked at quite a number of projects that have been brought forward.  They include roads and electricity projects, shopping centres and other projects, yet this country has not put forward one IROPI project.  Why are we afraid of putting forward an IROPI case?  The section from Maam to Clifden would be an ideal scenario in which to try that and we should just get on with it rather than \"faffing\" around as is happening now.  What is Mr. Fitzgerald's sense of it from dealing with his counterparts who do similar work across Europe?<\/p> <p>  Also, are there other member states with significant populations of the freshwater pearl mussel?

I do not believe the delay is due to a lack of staffing.  Galway County Council is trying to get the engineers it has on board to prepare this method statement.

It might be that there is a concern on behalf of organisations that they do not where it will go or how long it will take.  There is a potential IROPI in Galway in the case of Galway Port.

I am aware it has happened in other countries.  As mentioned, there were some cases in Spain and Portugal but they are not common.  There are a number of tests one has to take to prove that the issues are of public importance as opposed to private importance, and there have to be no alternatives.  It strikes us that there could well be a case made in regard to parts of the N59.  It would not be for us to decide that.  We could get involved in discussions on compensatory habitat and so on but it would be a matter for the developer and also the decision maker, which would be the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017011800002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1484730000,"counter":730,"content":"<p>To clarify, my recollection from reading the relevant European Union information is that there are at least scores of cases in countries.

The Department needs to have an index of risk to human beings versus an index of risk to the habitat, with some balance between the two.  If Europe wants to be stupid, we should just go ahead and build the road and let them come after us.  When the road is built and there is no damage done and it is better than the first one, it will have no case against the Department.  We need to have a bit of courage and get on with the job.

In fact, it has deteriorated disgracefully in the meantime.  Dr. O'Keeffe might remember the time we paid the farmers for the sheep we took off the hills.  They were getting very worried about it.  I said we have paid them and we will worry about that again.  It took Europe five years to approve it.  It approved it retrospectively but if it had fined us, so what.  If we are spending &euro;58 billion a year, a fine of &euro;2 million is not significant in the greater scheme of things if it is unavoidable and a lesser evil in terms of getting the job done.<\/p> <p>  The message has to be got across that the people have had enough, particularly in areas like Connemara where there are special areas of conservation, SACs, all over the place and where many people believe they cannot do anything to preserve the right to live in Connemara, the culture and the language of Connemara, all of the human aspects which are much more scarce.  If we had SACs for linguistics, Connemara would be a quadruple A priority habitat because there is no Irish language in any other country as a community language anywhere in the world.  There are pearl mussels in other places.<\/p> <p>  If we are really concerned about heritage and all these issues, and I am deeply concerned about them - I would not be in Connemara if I was not concerned about them - the human, linguistic, heritage and community interest trumps a zero risk to the pearl mussel from some unusual weather event only during the building phase.  As I pointed out, if the road was built it would be far superior in terms of the run-off compared to the road in its present state.

As Chairman I am delighted to welcome to our joint committee the heads of the three biggest sporting organisations in the country.  We are a sporting nation and sport is hugely important to us, therefore, the role of this committee is very important in terms of doing our best to try to advance sport and to support the sporting organisations.<\/p><p>In attendance today are representatives of the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA, and the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU.  I am delighted to welcome Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy, Mr. Philip Browne and Mr. John Delaney.  All three organisations are to be congratulated for the massive contribution they make to Irish society at grassroots, club and county level but also at the elite level in terms of the international stage.<\/p><p>We are very proud of our sporting organisations and our athletes.  In particular, I commend the GAA on its Healthy Clubs initiative, which plans to encourage more clubs to support communities in pursuit of better physical, social and mental health well-being.  The GAA championships and the national league are also a vibrant part of Irish society, and it was great to see the GAA inter-county calendar get up and running in recent weeks.  The excitement is already building, and we are getting ready in Kerry for the 38th coming of Sam in September; we live in hope.<\/p><p>The developments and achievements in rugby and soccer recently have been huge.  I mention in particular the achievement of our national soccer team in 2015, whose members did the country proud in France and who, on another day, might have made it to the quarter finals and possibly beyond that.  We can all be very proud of them, and they have got off to a great start in the qualification campaign for the World Cup in 2018.  I hope we will have success in 2017 also.<\/p><p>I want to mention the League of Ireland, and the success of the Dundalk team has been a fantastic story.  In terms of its success in the Europa League group stages and looking at the tables, four points was a great achievement but when we consider the results, each game was lost by only one goal.  That says a lot about how far the League of Ireland has come.  There are exciting times ahead for Irish soccer as well with some of the games in the 2020 European Championships coming to Dublin.  Hopefully, it will be a case of onwards and upwards.<\/p><p>I congratulate the IRFU on its continuing success and wish it the very best in the Six Nations Championship, which is due to start the first weekend in February.  I have to mention also the fantastic results in the autumn internationals.  We waited a long time for the result against the All Blacks but good things come to those who wait.  The Australia result was outstanding as well.  It is very encouraging to see the performance of the Irish provinces in the Champions Cup.  I hope there are very good times ahead for Irish rugby.  I congratulate all those involved in that.<\/p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.

It is one of the largest sporting organisations in the country, representing an estimated 450,000 players and participants across Ireland in 2,600 clubs, making football the biggest team participation sport in the country.<\/p> <p>  Our organisation is run through a democratic governance structure, which is outlined in the FAI rule book.<\/p><p>The FAI is affiliated to UEFA and FIFA and must comply with any rules and regulations imposed by those bodies.  Our national structure can best be split into three sections: the FAI council, board of management and the standing national committees, and the FAI administration staff.  The FAI council is made up of 58 members from across the Irish football family.  The council meets at least quarterly when it receives updates and passes major decisions and rule changes.  The board of management of the FAI has ten members and all voluntary members are elected.  They oversee the strategic direction of the organisation and the implementation of strategy.  The board is made up of honorary officers, chairpersons of various standing committees and me, as CEO.  The president and vice president sit for fixed terms of four years and chairpersons of each committee are elected every two years.  In the year ahead we will welcome our first board representative from women's football, which has now come under the umbrella of the FAI.<\/p><p> Key sub-committees within the association are the governance and risk committees.  The FAI executive structure reports directly to me, and I report its activities and actions to the board during monthly board meetings.  The FAI holds its annual general meeting, AGM, in July each year.  The reports of the CEO, financial director, honorary treasurer, audit committee and standing committees are presented to members and the media at this meeting.<\/p><p> In terms of gender quotas, the FAI has two women on the national council.  Women are also represented on the national finance, legal and corporate, international and under-age committees.  The chairperson of the audit committee, as well as the heads of the legal and HR departments and the business partnerships director are women, and we have female representation at UEFA committee level.  The women&rsquo;s teams played 43 international matches last year.  The role of women in Irish football is growing all the time and increasing female participation in the game is key to the strategic plan for 2016 to 2020 and the women's strategic plan 2015 to 2018, both of which we have submitted to the joint committee.  The more women and girls who are involved in football, the stronger the game becomes.<\/p><p> In terms of funding and the sports capital programme, grassroots funding through Sport Ireland and many local authorities allows us to have a national spread of 54 development officers, implementing grassroots programmes across all communities including: summer soccer schools which had 31,500 participants; Football for All, which involves 34 clubs; Soccer Sisters, involving the participation of 3,600 and; the FAI primary schools five-a-side competitions with 24,000 participants of which approximately 40% of participants were female.  Government funding through the sports capital programme allows for the development of vital football facilities locally and nationally.  Funding is currently being sought for a number of important projects, including Dalymount Park, the Munster centre of excellence at Glanmire and an indoor pitch at the National Sports Campus.  All funding is vital to the lifeblood of the grassroots of the game which underpins the base of the pyramid structure right up to elite level.  It is at this broad base where the delivery of resources is funnelled directly, and we are extremely grateful for all support through Sports Ireland funding under Kieran Mulvey, John Treacy and the board of Sport Ireland and we continue to invest heavily in the game ourselves.<\/p><p> While it is important, Government funding only accounts for a fraction of overall expenditure and for every &euro;1 of the &euro;2.7 million invested by the Department and Sport Ireland we invest &euro;3 of our own money, which amounts to approximately &euro;8 million.  To put it in another context, funding contributes approximately 6% of annual turnover.  Continued funding and our commitment to invest in the game will directly affect the improved well-being, fitness and health of players at all levels, and allow us to develop the game at grassroots level through three key vital cogs, namely, people, programmes and infrastructure.  While funding is fundamental to the development of the sport and we could always do with more, I emphasise the need for funding to be consistent, including during recessionary times, where it has previously declined.<\/p><p> In terms of challenges and strategies, our overall challenge is to achieve the strategic goals.  The FAI's strategic plan 2016 to 2020 and the women's strategic plan from 2015 to 2018 are the roadmap to deliver improvements across the game for players, clubs, leagues across grassroots and communities for the continued growth and prosperity of the game at every level.  The development of football in every town and village in Ireland is to the benefit of all communities.  The various challenges we face include: continual growth of participation numbers across areas of the game; increasing the number of people working across administration, volunteerism and coaching; the effective delivery of consistent coaching methods through the player development plan to ensure the very best and most appropriate coach delivery to all; changing the mindset of the win-at-all-costs mentality and changing philosophies for children where every child gets game time and is included; recognition of the value of a team sport which has additional benefits in developing life skills and competencies, due to the nature of teamwork, discipline, shared goals and co-operation, which are required to participate in a team environment; the use of football as a social inclusion tool is a priority for many stakeholders and a balancing act for the association to ensure successful football development for all, including Walking Football initiatives, programmes for those with disabilities including Football for All and those marginalised by society, those who suffer from addictions through our Kick Start to Recovery programme, run in conjunction with the HSE, and other socially-disadvantaged groups through our late night leagues, drop-ins and street football; and safeguarding, in the areas of child welfare, anti-doping and addiction support, in order to provide a safe environment for all.<\/p><p> I hope that gives some insight into the work we do and the ambitions we want to achieve for Irish football.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak to members and for the funding we receive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Delaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":744,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Delaney.

The GAA is a community-based volunteer organisation with a network of 1,600 clubs in Ireland and 400 overseas.  Our vision is that everybody has the opportunity to be welcomed to take part in our games and culture, to participate fully, to grow and develop and to be inspired to keep a lifelong engagement with the association.<\/p> <p>  In terms of governance, the GAA is run as a democratic organisation in accordance with the rules and constitution which are available on the GAA website.  All officers at club and county level are elected, with the exception of a small number of full-time employees, and that is mirrored across the operations of four provincial councils.  Between the association's annual congress, the organisation at national level is run by a central council and the management committee.  The vast majority of those serving on the committees are also elected.<\/p> <p>  Good governance lies at the heart of the GAA's activities, exemplified by the transparent nature of its financial practices.  All accounts, at every level of the association, are published, shared with the relevant membership and distributed to the media.  The GAA enforces a five-year term limit for county officers with terms at provincial and national level limited to three years.  A recently published governance guide, which I have attached with the submission, applies to all units of the association and to all its members, volunteers, officials and employees.  It outlines key roles and responsibilities, the formal governance policies to be implemented in respect of conflict of interest, term limits, grievance and disciplinary procedures, data protection and information security, diversity and equality, and the Speaking Up policy.<\/p> <p>  The GAA is an inclusive family-based entity that offers and promotes a role for everyone within the games and administrative structure and is fully committed to the core principle of inclusivity.  However, it is worth pointing out that with the exception of some under-age activity, the games are played by boys and men.  Although they are independent organisations, we work closely with An Cumann Cam&oacute;ga&iacute;ochta and the Ladies Gaelic Football Association in the promotion and support of their games.  Ladies football and camogie are generally played on GAA grounds and there is a huge overlap in the membership of all three organisations and a sharing of resources, sponsors and partners.  An increased number of females have emerged in GAA officer positions in recent years at club and county level, reflecting the expanded role of women in clubs.  We are supportive of efforts to encourage greater female participation at all levels of administration within the GAA and believe that, given the increase in such involvement that is already taking place, a better balance of gender membership will occur naturally in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  In terms of funding and the sports capital programme, in 2016 the GAA received Sport Ireland funding of &euro;2.4 million for which we are extremely grateful.  The funding supports the deployment of games development personnel nationwide who are responsible for the implementation of the various activities under the auspices of the grassroots to national programme.  From central level in Croke Park, we contribute a further &euro;7.9 million with a similar total investment from provinces and counties.  That has enabled us to boost participation numbers.  For example, 2016 saw the GAA set a new record in the number of children in the five to 13 years age group who attended the Kellogg's C&uacute;l camps.  There were 1,200 camps held across all 32 counties in 2016.  These were attended by 127,473 boys and girls, an increase of 25% on 2015.  In addition, the number of children aged between ten and 12 who are registered as GAA members increased from 39,778 in 2010 to 61,487 in 2015.  The games development personnel provided in excess of 17,000 coaching sessions to approximately 258,000 primary school pupils during 2015.<\/p> <p>  The return of the sports capital programme has been a most welcome development.  Our units embrace its potential fully and its absence frustrated their ambitions for growth and further development.  It is important to make the point that, while allocations from the sports capital programme are vital in allowing sporting bodies to provide improved facilities for members and communities, clubs must raise a considerable amount of money on their own initiative in order to bring their plans to fruition.<\/p><p> I will outline our challenges and strategies.  As an organisation we are working towards completion in the implementation of our 2015-17 strategic plan that I have attached with my submission.  The key goals of the plan are as follows: to increase player and member participation and support the continued growth of the association; improve support for county and club volunteers; implement a governance code that will strengthen all units of the association; improve the financial, commercial and fundraising framework for our units; utilise all communication platforms to engage effectively with players, coaches, administrators, members, supporters and the wider public; and develop our partnership with ladies football and camogie.<\/p><p> We are confident that we will have met most of these targets by the end of the year but acknowledge that we face many challenges.  In particular, the GAA is striving to cope with the growth in population in urban areas and the decline in rural Ireland.  We have witnessed a pattern of declining rural population, which has been accompanied by a gradual diminution of services in rural areas.  We have witnessed the closure of rural Garda stations, post offices and banks, a reduction in transport links and a growing threat to GP services.  Also, broadband roll-out has been much slower than is needed to sustain a rural economy.  There has been a decline in employment in all rural towns at the same time as larger urban centres and cities have continued to grow.  Young people also move to the larger population centres for a third level education and often must stay there in order to pursue employment opportunities.  If they cannot find employment, they emigrate.  The consequences for the GAA are serious and have already had a negative impact on rural clubs all over the country, in particular clubs in counties along the west coast.  For many clubs, this has meant a reduction in the number of teams available to compete in county competitions and for others that has been a struggle to remain in existence.  The decline of rural Ireland is a crisis that is not within the power of the GAA to resolve, but it is a problem that must be a priority for the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":747,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duffy for his presentation.

I will cover the specific areas outlined by the committee in its invitation.<br\/><br\/>The IRFU was founded in 1874 and is the governing body for rugby football on the island of Ireland.  The IRFU is a representative body that is grounded on the club as its basic representative unit.  The IRFU is a federal body with four autonomous provincial branches to whom the clubs are affiliated.  The clubs elect representatives to their respective branches.  The branches, which comprise the clubs, then elect persons to represent them at the national level of the IRFU.<br\/><br\/>Democracy is the fundamental governance principle that underpins the game and its structures in Ireland.  Under the current laws, clubs have discretion as to whom they select to represent them at the various levels of the game's administration, including the IRFU at national level.  The IRFU, as an administrative body, is made up of a committee of 21 elected representatives with two additional positions held by our World Rugby representatives.  There is scope to co-opt a further two persons.  At present, one of these co-options has been used to accommodate the appointment of Ms Mary Quinn to the IRFU committee.  Ms Quinn has previously been the chair of the Leinster women's rugby committee in the Leinster branch.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the women's game, virtually no women's rugby was played in Ireland 25 years ago.  Up until 2008, there was a separate Irish Women's Rugby Football Union, IWRFU.  It organised embryonic competitions and representative teams through the existing IRFU club structure.  In 2008, following extensive discussions, the IWRFU was disbanded and women's rugby came under the umbrella of the IRFU.  This was the first major rugby union in the world to integrate.  Since then, all IRFU development resources cater for both men and women's rugby.  The IRFU now operates the successful national Irish women's team and the Irish women's 7s programme and under age development squads.  However, that does not get away from the fact that contrary to public perception, the women's game, though growing, is still in an embryonic state.  Currently there are just under 5,000 females playing the game.  In the past ten years, the percentage of clubs with women's sections has increased from 12% to 54%.  This is something we have outlined in our current strategic plan.  There is an ongoing commitment to promote participation of women within our game.<br\/><br\/>Clubs have been proactive in promoting women from within their membership not because they are women <i>per se,<\/i>but because they have been involved in the running or coaching of the game.  They are respected as people who have accumulated rugby wisdom or skills set and an affinity for the game which makes them effective representatives and administrators.  Last year, we published our long-term development strategy for the women's game that we will leave with the committee secretariat.  The aim of that strategy is to encourage more women to undertake leadership roles in coaching, volunteering and the administration of our game.  This is an ongoing project and one that we hope will develop even more women of the calibre and experience of Mary Quinn.<br\/><br\/>In terms of gender quotas, the suggestion by the Government that it is considering the imposition of gender quotas on sports organisations is a concern for the simple reason that female rugby is still in its infancy and it will be difficult to find suitably qualified female candidates with the accumulated rugby wisdom and skill set to fill such quotas without retreating towards tokenism.  Apart from being anti-democratic and a potential breach of the laws of the union, such an activity would be the very antithesis of good governance.  The inference behind the suggestion of quotas is that in some way the existing governance model of Irish rugby holds back the women's game.  I suggest the evidence is quite the contrary.  Since the IRFU took on responsibility for the women's game in 2007, we have seen a threefold growth in the women's game.  We have also witnessed the success of our national women's team who have twice won the Women's Six Nations Championship.  In fact, the team became the first Irish rugby team to beat New Zealand.  We have also witnessed the emergence of a successful and promising Irish women's 7s team.  It has worked its way up the rankings and hopes to qualify for the 2020 Olympic Games.  Furthermore, our commitment to the promotion of the women's game is second to none, particularly this year with the hosting of the Women's Rugby World Cup in Ireland.  I suggest that the evidence shows that regardless of the fact that the emergence of the women's game has not yet been matched by the emergence of women with the accumulated skills and desire to work their way through the democratic structures of Irish rugby, the IRFU has in no way inhibited the development and growth of the women's game.  Governance is a constant work in progress.  Our governance working party is considering all aspects of rugby governance.  The women's game and representation is part of that brief.<br\/><br\/>In terms of funding and grants, the effective delivery of any sport is based on the work that occurs in communities, clubs and schools to develop male and female players at youth level and beyond.  The effective delivery of sport is resource intensive.  Resources must be applied to support the volunteers who are the bedrock of most sports and rugby is no different.  With the assistance of Sport Ireland funding, the IRFU continues to develop and invest in the foundation that creates our success.  Last year, the IRFU's turnover was &euro;72 million and Sport Ireland grants amounted to 3.6% of the turnover or &euro;2.6 million.<br\/><br\/>The IRFU's investment into the club and community game has grown in recent years to &euro;10 million.  The IRFU allocates around &euro;3 for every &euro;1 of funding it receives from Sport Ireland.  We are more than grateful for the funding from Sport Ireland.  However, it should be noted that its funding has declined during the recession.  We hope, like the rest of the sports community, that this situation will be rectified by an increase in the budget available for Sport Ireland.  Funding must move further up the priority list of the Government given the obvious and well documented benefits of all sports, particularly the role played by team sports in terms of physical and mental well-being of our youth, along with the personal development opportunities that come with team sports.<br\/><br\/>The capital sports grant programme is imperative for the modernisation of rugby clubs.  In the last grant round, rugby only accessed 7% of the available grants, which is a similar trend that occurred in previous funding rounds.  Growth in participation has placed increased pressure on our existing club and school infrastructure.  The IRFU aspires to have a network of 16 artificial pitches across Ireland that can be accessed by clubs, schools and community groups, especially during periods of heavy weather.  The IRFU would like to work with the Department to support clubs accessing grants for this purpose.  The IRFU has previously proposed that there is an opportunity for economies of scale through a single application.  It is estimated that there would be a list price reduction of 15% per pitch should the IRFU make a signal application for multiple pitches and the development being centrally managed by the IRFU.<br\/><br\/>My final comment on capital funding relates to the development of the national sports campus.  I commend all those involved, including Mr. Kieran Mulvey, Mr. John Treacy and Mr. David Conway of Sport Ireland, and the current Minster and his predecessors.  What we see emerging is a world class set of facilities for multiple sports on the same campus.  The venue provides the benefit of cross-fertilisation of ideas, philosophies and methods between high-performing sports for the benefit of all of Irish sport.  It may end up being a unique international facility and provide Irish sport with a unique advantage over other sporting nations.  From a rugby perspective, we urge the Minister and the Government not to lose the opportunity to finish the project.  In this regard, I specifically reference phase 2 of the soon to be opened national indoor arena.  The phase 2 development incorporates a high-performance rugby facility that will, with additional investment by the IRFU, cater for the needs of our men's and women's international teams at senior and age grade levels.  Currently alone among tier 1 rugby nations, we have no training facilities for our successful international teams and rely on the goodwill of clubs or schools.  This is far from ideal if we aspire to be the best that we can be in the world of rugby. <br\/><br\/>Since 2004, the IRFU has published successive strategic plans.  We are in the process of finalising our latest strategic plan for the period up to 2021.  Our focus is to continue to grow and promote our game with reference to our core values such as inclusivity and respect.  These values ensure we welcome and promote diversity not only in the playing of our game, but in our clubs, governance and administration.<br\/><br\/>As our playing numbers increase so too does our need to educate and ensure that anyone who plays our game understand our values and ethos.  Last season, we worked with our colleagues in Sport Ireland on a new anti-doping programme.  The programme has been championed by our international teams and continues to be rolled out across our clubs and schools.  The IRFU is fully committed to the World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, and Sport Ireland's anti-doping code and regulations.  We have utilised new media to reach out to our youth.  We use this medium to educate people on anti-doping as well as issues such as player welfare and anti-bullying, which are issues that are also important to the Government.  In addition, we operate partnerships with Pieta House on suicide awareness and prevention, and we work with the CARA organisation on tag rugby programmes for players with special learning needs.<br\/><br\/>A key challenge for rugby and all sports in Ireland is how to continuously adapt to a rapidly changing environment.  I will list the challenging areas for the IRFU.  The changing and increased regulatory environment for sport has implications for volunteers and clubs in terms of legal liability and costs.<\/p><p>On foot of socio-economic changes in Irish society and changing social trends, team sports face competition from a much wider range of pastimes and activities, many of them solitary, than in the past.  We also face the challenge of maintaining the competitiveness of our professional teams in the face of competitors based in the larger, more valuable markets in England and France.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for providing me with the time to address it and for the sports funding we receive.  We could always use more.  I hope members will take time out of their busy schedules to enjoy some of the top quality rugby on offer this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Browne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":750,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Browne and note that the committee plans to have a meeting in late March to address specifically the 2023 Ruby World Cup bid.

The pleasure, entertainment, organisation and skills they provide to everybody are fantastic.  Local communities owe a large debt to all of the organisations.  It is a family and an atmosphere whether one is playing football, managing a team, refereeing, acting as a linesman or selling tickets.  It is fantastic.  I have been lucky all my life to have played soccer, Gaelic and rugby and in fairness it kept me off the streets and set me on the right path.  We all talk about sport and winning trophies, but what these organisations really do is provide a family atmosphere and look after young people and that is fantastic.<\/p> <p>  I have a set of questions for everyone and then one or two individual questions for each witness.  I will not be too long.  Can the witnesses clarify their organisations' approach to the treatment of concussion among players?  This is the approach filtered down through all areas of the organisation and in particular at underage level.  Can the witnesses clarify what policies are in place to allow children with special needs to participate in their sports?  Can they clarify what policies are in place to address the issues of mental health among their organisations' members?  The win-at-all-costs attitude is still very apparent in sport, in particular at underage level.  What measures have the witnesses' organisations taken to remove this attitude among underage teams?  Are the child protection measures in place not only robust but religiously enforced at all levels within the organisations?<\/p> <p>  For the individual questions, I will go to Mr. John Delaney of the FAI first.  Mr. Delaney said that every town and village in Ireland benefits from the whole community being involved in sport.  In fairness, soccer has been fantastic.  The thing I liked was what he said about soccer being focused on social activity, as such.  Can he elaborate on that?  Obesity is a big issue in this country.  As the organisation for the biggest sport in terms of participation in Ireland, what is the FAI doing to combat obesity?<\/p> <p>  Can Mr. Philip Browne please expand on the point he made that it would be difficult to find suitably qualified female candidates to fill roles in his organisation?  Does he feel the success of the provinces has had a negative impact on clubs at grassroots level?  In fairness, the four provinces are doing fantastically at the moment, but is that success affecting clubs?<\/p> <p>  Next, I turn to Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy.  As a GAA man and a sportsperson, I have concerns about rural areas, especially coming from County Louth where communities are finding it very hard to get teams together.  If there are three or four clubs in a parish, the last thing one wants to do is amalgamate them.  Does the GAA have any plans going forward to look after rural clubs?  In the urban areas, we seem to have the opposite problem with a lot of people participating in clubs.  What is the GAA doing about that rural-urban issue?  The biggest problem I find being involved in sport is that the most delicate age for people is between 16 and 18.  A lot of people decide when they turn 16 to go out socialising instead.  What is the GAA doing to keep people involved in sport between the ages of 16 and 18?<\/p> <p>  To conclude, I cannot emphasise greatly enough what these three sports have done in my life and the lives of many others.  It is a family thing and we should do whatever we can to help.  People are talking about homelessness, obesity and everything else at the moment but one thing to note about sport is that it is a fantastic topic of conversation no matter where one goes and no matter if it is soccer, Gaelic or rugby.  I cannot emphasise enough the value these organisations give to people.  I thank the witnesses for coming in today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#D00300","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":752,"content":"<p>I think everyone shares the Deputy's views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#D00400","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":753,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses who have spoken on behalf of the three powerhouses of sport in Ireland on a national or an inter-county basis.  One cannot but praise these organisations.  Trying to be critical might be impossible but I am sure we will find issues as we go along.  One of the issues might be governance.  Recently, the Minister of State with responsibility for sport spoke about gender quotas and the witnesses have touched on the approach they are taking.  The Minister of State has set a timeframe, albeit in contradiction to his senior Minister.  Will the witnesses' organisations need to set their own targets?  They may only have three years to get this in place.  Are we rushing it too much?  Even the ladies themselves feel they need time to fit into place.  Can we have a comment on the issue of gender balance and whether we are going in the right direction?  In fairness to the three organisations, they are well able to raise money on their own separate to State funding, but there is no point in rushing this too fast.<\/p><p>A very interesting comment was made on the availability of players.  Historically, one remembers players depending on the background and tier of the sport they played, even in colleges.  Even last week in my own county, Christian Brothers College from Cork city was playing my own <i>alma mater<\/i>, St. Colman's College, Fermoy, in the quarter finals of the Dr. Harty Cup, which is a major thing.  At one time, one would not see a rugby ball inside the gate.  Are we putting fierce demands on juveniles growing up who now have to play in more codes?  One saw lately that one of the good rugby players was well known in three codes and eventually had to make a call on one.  Should they make the call sooner for the sake of their own health and fitness?  It is a big thing.  Parishes are under pressure.  Mr. Duffy mentioned that people are migrating to the bigger hubs and cities and one sees team amalgamations.  I am concerned about player availability and whether we are asking too much in having them play four or five codes when they are in college.  Perhaps we should draw a line and set out recommendations in respect of an earlier stage so that they can focus on the code at which they are best.  That may be another day's talk.<\/p><p>Is Mr. John Delaney happy with FIFA's decision to increase the number of teams that can qualify for the World Cup?  Does that dilute the quality of the eventual finals?  More importantly, what can the FAI do to promote the League of Ireland?  In fairness to our national networks, the FAI has good coverage, but it is always good to see a crowd at a match.  I am not saying I am a great attender myself, but what can we do to get more people onto stands and terraces?<\/p><p>Mr. Browne is on a big road having regard to bringing the Rugby World Cup to Ireland.  I wish him all the best in that.  The IRFU is making steady progress on the issue.<\/p><p>I have asked Mr. Browne previously whether he is happy with the co-operation he receiving from various Departments in the provision of facilities.  Lately, we had the unfortunate news that the venue in the birthplace of the GAA, Thurles, would not be considered for use in the Rugby World Cup, which I find alarming.  I am not stating it should be used as a host venue, but 50,000 people could get into and out of that little town in one day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#D00500","speaker":"1278","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":755,"content":"<p>We might keep questions on the Rugby World Cup in 2023 for the specific meeting to be held in March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#E00200","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":756,"content":"<p>My next question is for Mr. Duffy.

I, therefore, ask for an explanation for the changes.  <\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Delaney outline the various pay levels for FAI staff?  Have cuts been endured by staff, particularly since the recession kicked in from 2008 onwards?  <\/p> <p>  Has the FAI put in place any mechanism to encourage players to remain in the national league?  I am speaking, in particular, about Daryl Horgan and Andy Boyle who recently left Dundalk for Preston.  <\/p> <p>  There has long been criticism of the FAI regarding its support for the League of Ireland.  Will Mr. Delaney outline the level of funding and operational supports provided?  What support does the league receive from the FAI?  <\/p> <p>  Out of curiosity, having heard Mr. Delaney's opening statement, how are members of the FAI board chosen?  Is the CEO re-elected regularly or is there a work contract?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Duffy and is on GAA television rights.  Many people throughout the country have been complaining.  Will he elaborate on the role played by the GAA in the decision to sell viewing rights to Sky?  It has forced many people to go to the pub to see matches.  Does the GAA have plans to review or revisit the contract, given the effect the decision has had?

Our brief covers transport, tourism and sport and we are very anxious to pay attention to each of these areas.  Governance is a topic we very much want to cover because if we do not get it right, we will end up with issues similar to the ones we had last summer which brought sport into disrepute and raised questions about public funding.  Another topic we wish to cover is participation in sport.  These are the two dominant issues we want to deal with in our work programme, but the one we will discuss today is governance.  I am very impressed when we look at the level of participation in the three codes collectively.  One cannot be Irish without being interested in sport.  Whether one likes it, one is drawn into it and I happen to like it.<\/p> <p>  A number of governance issues are raised in the case of the FAI.  The Genesis report was produced 14 or 15 years ago.  It contained a number of recommendations which ended up not being implemented, including that independent non-executive directors be appointed.  Why was that the case?  It was a big initiative after the events in Saipan and should have fed into the area of governance.  Recently, the age until which people could serve on the board was extended beyond 75 years.  Some people have been members of the FAI board for many years.  Turnover is very important to bring freshness and avoid groupthink.  It also helps good governance.  Things that are not desirable in terms of good governance are jumping out at me.  Will Mr. Delaney address this range of topics?<\/p> <p>  Finance is another issue about which there is public concern, particularly when public funding is given to organisations.  A number of people have commented on the figure of &euro;5 million, including Niamh Brennan and Mike Flynn, but it was not mentioned in the accounts subsequently.  Was it a loan?  I am referring to the &euro;5 million received after the Thierry Henry handball incident.<\/p><p>That matter needs to be clarified because it keeps cropping up.  It would be useful to get a resolution in respect of it.<\/p><p> The women's game has been well established for a long time.  I am aware of it through a number of clubs in my area.  It is disappointing that we are not seeing the throughput of women in sport and are talking about issues such as quotas and so forth.  I would like to see that happen naturally.  If one looks at the people involved in clubs, even at junior level, including referees and so forth, one sees greater female participation.  However, women tend to be involved at a lower level.  I welcome the fact that a woman will be appointed to a senior role in the near future.  I would like to see more of that but would prefer if it was not by way of quotas.

In the last six months the whole country has been immensely proud of our sporting achievements, including at the European Championships, in Chicago and in Connacht.  The GAA is spreading throughout the world, which is a big aspect of its work at present.<\/p> <p>  I will try to confine my questions to the three issues of governance, gender quotas and funding.  Mr. Delaney referred to the democratic governance structures of the FAI.  He also stated that the FAI is affiliated to both FIFA and UEFA and must follow their rules too.  Those organisations have had huge governance issues, which Mr. Delaney has taken on himself, in the past six months.  Does he feel that those issues have had an impact on the FAI?  Have matters been resolved at European and world level?  What happened was absolutely disgraceful.  I am looking at this from the outside and would not know anything other than what I read in media reports.  Has it impacted on the FAI?  Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned Mr. Sepp Blatter and Mr. Delaney seemed to have a good relationship with him, particularly in the context of the deal referred to earlier.  Was it, from the point of view FIFA, arrived at on the nod?<\/p> <p>  At every AGM of the FAI, issues seem to arise with regard to League of Ireland clubs.  Is that an issue for the FAI in general?  As regards funding, I understand that the winners of the league, Dundalk FC, received &euro;100,000 or &euro;120,000.  Is that a realistic amount in the professional game or is it merely what can be afforded?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#F00500","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":771,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

This committee agreed before Christmas to invite them in.  The main issue at that time was the lack of consultation before the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy O'Donovan, made his announcement on gender quotas and governance in the various sporting organisations.  Since then, the organisations have had consultations with the Department.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Delaney said that his organisation has a democratic governance structure.  We are all democratically-elected Members of the Houses but we had gender quotas imposed on us in advance of the most recent general election.  I was not in favour of that, I must say.  I do not think it is the way to make progress.  That said, there is no doubt that we should be encouraging more female participation in politics and in sport, particularly in the governance structures of various sporting bodies.<\/p> <p>  The board of management of the FAI is the premier governing body of the organisation.  It appears that only one person on the board of management is female.  That signifies a very poor representation of women in the governance structures of the FAI.  Mr. Delaney made reference to an FAI report on increasing women's participation.  If there was no threat of a gender quota being imposed, what exactly are the FAI's targets, goals and policies in terms of ensuring greater female participation in the governance structures of the organisation?  Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned the Genesis report and pointed out that some of its key findings still remain to be implemented.  In that context, can we be confident that any policies of the FAI relating to increasing female participation will be fully implemented?<\/p> <p>  Reference was also made to the FAI's AGM.  I remember when the organisation came to Athlone, under the stewardship of its former president, Mr. Paddy McCaul.  It was very welcome then and would be most welcome to come again.  On that day, we travelled around Westmeath with representatives of the FAI and saw the unbelievable good work it is doing, especially in areas of high deprivation.  The FAI does great work in promoting participation in sport.  Many previous speakers have outlined the benefits to society of participation in sport, in terms of improving health and well being and I must acknowledge the role played by the FAI in that regard.<\/p> <p>  What percentage of the FAI's overall annual budget is derived from direct State funding?  Sometimes the State can try to take a heavy-handed approach to organisations that it does not fund adequately.<\/p> <p>  I also have a question about something that seems, unfortunately, to be increasingly prevalent in our communities, namely, sudden adult death syndrome, SADS.  Some of it is linked to over-exertion from a sporting perspective.  I am not saying it is all related to that but it is certainly a factor.  What is the FAI doing in terms of screening, not just at the higher level but also at club level, to prevent incidents of SADS?<\/p> <p>  Finally, on big sporting occasions such as All-Ireland final day or the occasion of major international rugby or soccer matches, the people who have given most in a voluntary capacity cannot get tickets to attend.  Earlier this week, we heard that tickets for a forthcoming U2 concert have been resold at multiples of their face value.  What is the FAI doing to ensure the elimination of ticket touting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#F00700","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":773,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Troy.

I welcome the witnesses.  We are very proud of each organisation in terms of their work at local, national and international level.<\/p> <p>  I am the Co-Chairperson of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I also previously served as Chairman of the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Two of the three organisations here today operate on an all-Ireland basis, while one only operates in the Twenty-six Counties, with the Irish Football Association, IFA, operating in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>The Irish Football Association recently took a case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport where it was determined that players from the Republic of Ireland could play for Northern Ireland and players from Northern Ireland could play for the Republic of Ireland.  They had a dual nationality.  What is the view of Mr. Delaney on that?<br\/><br\/>Somebody ran a double-decker bus to Germany in 1988.  We went for two weeks and in the <i>Evening Press<\/i>we were told where we could or could not go.  That was the organisational capacity of the time but we have moved on.  There are now iPhones, fan zones and Republic of Ireland supporter clubs.  One thing seems to be lacking, which is a fan embassy.  I am part of an <i>ad hoc <\/i>cross-party group in Leinster House.  The Welsh fans have embassies that work closely with its department dealing with foreign affairs.  We are hoping to work in the same way.  It was joyful to see the fans from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in particular working together.  There will always be a bad apple and I am always afraid that sometimes the exuberance could get out of hand.  We need to put fan and supporter clubs on a particular footing and I understand there are fan embassies all over Europe now.  We are working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to try to get this up and running.  What is the view of the witness and does the FAI welcome it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#F00900","speaker":"1424","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":776,"content":"<p>I apologise to Mr. Duffy and Mr. Browne but we will come to them.  I have a question on the sports capital programme.  I am not asking Mr. Delaney to bite the hand that partially feeds his organisation but could this be improved for applicants and the FAI?  There is the issue of governance in the organisation.  Unfortunately, we have seen within the League of Ireland some problems with crowd trouble.  It is a small amount in the vast minority of games but it is something that must be absolutely nipped in the bud.  Is the governing body taking this very seriously and how does it plan to address it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#G00200","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484748000,"counter":777,"content":"<p>I thank members for their questions and I will try to deal with them in as detailed a way as I can in the order in which they were asked.  We are one of the most inclusive organisations in the country and our approach to the game is that everybody has the right to play, irrespective of ability, disability, colour, creed or sex.  Getting kids away from PlayStations and on to playing fields is our ethos.  It is a pyramid structure from grassroots.  If one is building a house, one builds a foundation first and the chimney is at the top.  The chimney for us is international football but we cannot have a chimney without a very strong foundation.  Inclusivity is what we are all about and anybody working closely with us or who knows us sees that at first hand.<\/p> <p>  We operate to the highest standards with regard to the concussion issue.  We have a medical committee, including Dr. Alan Byrne, who works with the international team.  He has spoken before committees here about concussion and how we deal with those matters.  We deal with them to the highest professional standard.  We are quite emotive about special needs.  We have 24 clubs and Football for All is one of our strongest programmes.  There are kids with cerebral palsy, the amputee team, the homeless team and blind supports.  We give international caps for people who play the sport under the auspices of the Football for All programme.  We are very strong in allowing every kid the right to play, irrespective of their ability or disability.  There are 24 clubs in Ireland formed specifically for the Football for All programmes, including special needs.<\/p> <p>  We dealt with winning at all costs under the player development plan.  The ethos and thinking behind the removal of win at all costs, particularly at the key younger level, is to give every kid the ability to love the ball.  They are taught to pass it and not kick it long, which was the approach when I was growing up.  There is the rolling on and off of substitutes so every kid can play and we do not keep competitive tables until the age of 12, which is something we feel strongly about.  It is outlined in our player development plan, which was introduced recently under our technical director, Mr. Ruud Dokter.  Effectively, this allows kids to enjoy playing football.  It gets competitive later in life but when they are younger, they should really enjoy the experience and learn not to be afraid to make a mistake with a football.<\/p> <p>  With regard to mental health, our Kickstart 2 Recovery programme helps with addiction issues.  Coach education is very important for mental health if we give people a role in life.  We have 32,000 or 33,000 people who are coaching and it gives people status.  We work very hard at coach education, which provides good training, and we run many programmes through our development officers all over the country on mental health.  I have spoken as a guest at many functions on suicide prevention.  I feel very strongly about that as it is a scourge on our society.  Everybody in this room, and not just sporting bodies, could do more.<\/p> <p>  With regard to child protection matters, I refer the committee to our statements of 25 November and 1 December last year.  We take these matters really seriously, given the events in the UK.  We have a child welfare officer and committee.  We operate to the highest standards that sports bodies would be on these matters.  Every parent, including me, would want their kids to be safe.  Members spoke about social aspects and we run some tremendous programmes.  We have the midnight soccer league, working with different agencies, including local authorities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, identifying children at risk.  In the areas where we play these games at night, crime has dropped tangibly.  In Ballymun the rate has dropped by 60% or 70%.  There are approximately 30 or 40 of these programmes being run all over the country and if we had more funding, we would run more of them.  We have given a snapshot of what is being done in the community and that programme identifies kids at risk.  It is about working in true partnership and not ticking boxes.  We work with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities, football clubs and different agencies to achieve real results.<\/p> <p>  Gender quotas have been mentioned by most members.  The Women's Football Association of Ireland ran women's football in Ireland until recently.  It was responsible for the development of the game.  It is a bit like Mr. Duffy's comments about GAA counterparts.  I will read what the chairperson of the WFAI, Ms Niamh O'Donoghue, wrote in the strategic plan.  She states \"We are fortunate indeed that the FAI believes in the future of women's football and has clearly demonstrated its commitment to the development of the game.\"  That is her quote and not mine.  We took over the running of women's football and developed eight regional committees which report to a national committee within the FAI.  That national committee is responsible for the development of women's football in this country.  Within the next 12 months, the chairperson of that women's committee will become a member of the board of the FAI.  We have appointed women to very senior positions in the association and our target is to get to 25,000 registered players by 2021.  When I started as chief executive officer, there were approximately 8,000 registered women players.  We have played 50-odd international matches, as I outlined, and we are very strong in the development of women's football.  It is okay for me to say it but I refer the committee to Ms O'Donoghue's quote.  If one studies our organisation, one can see our actions.  Approximately a year ago we took over women's football, established a women's national committee with eight regional committees beneath it and within the next 12 months the chairperson of the committee will come to our board.<\/p> <p>  There was mention of FIFA increasing the number of teams in the World Cup to 48.  Many years ago I addressed a UEFA congress - I think it was 2007 - about increasing the number of teams from 16 to 24.  Along with many colleagues, I spoke about increasing the number of teams.  I am a big follower of hurling and if Kilkenny play Tipperary, they do not have to play the French champions.  The rugby world cup is easier to qualify for than the FIFA equivalent, although Mr. Browne might disagree.  For countries like us, such as Norway, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Iceland, it is difficult to get to major tournaments.  It is important that we do in order to celebrate with our great supporters and do well for a sense of national pride.  I brought the proposal to a UEFA congress and I won by 48 votes to five on the day.  It has proved a big success to go from 16 teams to 24 in that competition.  It did not affect the quality of the competition and most of the narrative on the European Championships has been very strong.<\/p> <p>  In theory the FAI is supportive of increasing the number of teams to 48.  There will be meetings at UEFA next Monday and Tuesday under the top executive programme to see how it affects UEFA.  Currently, there are 13 European teams at a World Cup.<\/p><p>How many extra slots would that mean for UEFA?  I would support any opportunity that gives Ireland a greater opportunity to get to a World Cup, in theory or in principle.<\/p><p> When the FAI took over the running of the League of Ireland, the collective losses of the clubs were &euro;7 million.  I am a big League of Ireland supporter and my father was chairman of Waterford United Football Club.  I was secretary when they won the cup in 1980.  As a young boy I travelled to League of Ireland matches every Sunday even though we lived in Tipperary.  Richie Hall and Al Finucane, who lived in Limerick, came to our house and every Sunday we went to Kilcohan Park or another stadium around the country.  The League of Ireland is in my DNA and it is a big part of what we want to improve in this country.<\/p><p> We took over clubs with a collective loss of &euro;7 million and they are now at about break-even and there will be a profit this year because Dundalk has had such a great year.  It has been difficult because we have had to impose club licensing on many of them.  There are great people in the clubs, as well as great supporters, but we are trying to drill them down in order that they are not just senior clubs.  We created an under 19 national league and an under 17 national league while an under 15 national league starts this August.  This will give pathways to players in Cork, Waterford, Sligo, Dundalk and Drogheda to play for all these levels and then progress to the highest level.<\/p><p> We formed a marketing group with the clubs to market the league better.  I had a meeting last Monday morning with Michael Cush, who has been appointed by the clubs and club members.  We are seeing how we can collectively improve and a report was produced just before Christmas.<\/p><p> The improvement of facilities is crucial to everything we do with clubs.  Deputy Munster asked me about going from a premier league and first division of 12 and eight teams, respectively, to ten and ten in the year after this season.  This was based on the recommendations in the Conroy report, an independent report done a year or so ago.  We asked the clubs for their opinions and recently they informed us, through Michael Cush, a barrister, that they would prefer to go to ten and ten.  Based on that, the FAI accepted that three teams would go down and one would go up in the coming season.  There will never be a unanimous view on what a structure should be and P&aacute;raic Duffy will tell members the same as regards hurling and Gaelic football.  We got the report from Declan Conroy and then asked the clubs for their position and they voted, in the majority, to make it ten and ten.<\/p><p> More than 180 employees work for the organisation.  During the more difficult times there were pay cuts, like everywhere else, which we are now restoring.  The staff in the FAI love what they do because they are being paid to be involved in association football and that is a privilege for them.  We have very good staff who work day in and day out, particularly the development officers in every part of the country.  It is very difficult to get players to stay because of the money they are offered when they go abroad.  S&eacute;amus Coleman played for Sligo Rovers but he obviously gets a greater salary and a greater profile at Everton, and that is the nature of Irish soccer.  For many years players have been developed in Ireland and then go to the UK to play and get paid at a higher level.  Our aim is to keep the players for longer in order that they do not go at such a young age.  An under 15, under 17 and under 19 national league will help enormously in keeping the players and will give them a good education before they go.  Daryl Horgan made his full debut for Preston last weekend and played very well, and ultimately the best players in world football will go to play against the best, at club, county or international level.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Mahony made the observation that is it not just about prize money; it is about what we do for clubs.  We were significantly involved in saving Dalymount Park, getting a certain amount of the debt written down and getting Dublin City Council to buy it.  Now we are looking to the Government to fund its redevelopment.  Turner's Cross would be the same.  It is an excellent stadium now, with 7,000 seats, and the Belarus game was held there recently.  The FAI has invested a lot of money in that and the same is true of Eamonn Deacy Park.  We took the Wexford Youths ground out of receivership and saved it for football and we made a strong financial contribution to the regional sports centre in Waterford.  We need, from the committee and the broader Government and Chamber, to have more investment in the infrastructure of the League of Ireland, because with better facilities there is a greater chance of getting people into the grounds.<\/p><p> On the question of my role on the board of the FAI, it is written in the rulebook that the CEO is a board member and that was recommended by the Genesis report many years ago, to which Deputy Murphy referred.  We met Alistair Gray of Genesis subsequent to the implementation of the report and he said they were more than satisfied with what we had done.  The report was issued and we went through an implementation process.  As a young honorary treasurer we went around the country trying to reduce our board from 23 members to ten as well as making other changes.  Genesis gave us a health check and was more than satisfied by what we had done.  The FAI currently has a governance group chaired by a woman and an outside person to look constantly at governance within the organisation.  There was a rule change recently.  There is an age limit of 75 on the board but a member re-elected before the rule change can stay beyond that.  Our board is changing and a new member will be elected in Abbotstown today.  We will have a new president and vice president next year and we will have an additional woman on our board in the next 12 months.<\/p><p> The &euro;5 million fee was a contentious matter and a committee here decided, a year or two ago when Senator O'Mahony was Chairman, that it would not be discussed in this House.  All the money was properly accounted for and signed off by our auditors.  A sum of &euro;1 million was given initially and &euro;4 million was given a later year.  We issued a detailed statement at the time.<\/p><p> We were all disappointed with how events turned out in FIFA but I would not describe Sepp Blatter as a good friend of mine.  We voted for the new president, Gianni Infantino, who is bringing in some reforms at the moment and I am hopeful more reforms will come.  We also support Aleksander eferin, the Slovenian president, for president of UEFA, and on Monday and Tuesday next week we will get updates on how reforms are progressing in UEFA.  The brand of FIFA was very much damaged by events and they will continue to unfold over the next period as certain cases take place.<\/p><p> Our AGM was a huge success.  Deputy Troy commented on it and Senator O'Mahony was present in Mayo.  There was no negativity from the League of Ireland at the AGM in Tipperary last year and we came to an agreement during the week on giving it an allowance towards developing strategic plans.  We visit a county extensively and give out in excess of &euro;100,000 in grants, bringing people like Martin O'Neill, Ray Houghton and current footballers like Keith Andrews with us.  It is a remarkable success and something that is very close to me.  In my time I have visited 2,200 clubs throughout the country, and last Saturday I was at Achill Rovers on Achill Island.  I am booked out every weekend.  Supporting grassroots clubs is key to what we do and the AGM is a great snapshot of that.  Deputy Troy spoke about women's participation on the board and I have dealt with that.  I have dealt with the women's national teams committee and with the Genesis report.  As I outlined in my opening remarks, only 6% of our overall turnover in the year gone by was State funded, so we got &euro;2.7 million while our turnover was &euro;46 million.<\/p><p> I am sure Mr Browne and Mr Duffy would agree that we would like it to be illegal to sell tickets at above face value, but that would depend on Government legislation.  All the sporting bodies can do is distribute tickets as best we can through our supporters clubs and affiliates, and if it is brought to our attention that anybody is profiting, we will deal with it severely.  I urge Government to bring in legislation to make it illegal in this country because once that happens, it will help us greatly.<\/p><p> Senator Feighan brought up the case of Daniel Kearns, but that was many years ago.<\/p><p>We have a very good relationship with the Irish Football Association.  Its president, David Martin, is a good president and is someone with whom we would have a very good relationship.  Ultimately, my view and that of the association is that it is the player's choice.  If James McClean wants to play for the Republic of Ireland, it is his choice, but if he wants to play for the Northern Ireland football association, the Irish Football Association, we are not going to interfere.  To my mind and that of the association, it should always be down to the player.  The player should pick the national association he or she wishes to play for.<\/p><p> I support the Deputy's view regarding the fans' embassy.  Naturally, our supporters were fantastic in France.  They got the award from the mayor of Paris and a UEFA award as well.  They are probably the best ambassadors this country will ever have and we are very supportive of anything that would help that.  We have a supporters' club network that represents 2,000 season ticket holders.  I meet them regularly and will do so in the next week or so.  We take on board any issues they bring to our attention and we try to work with them as closely as possible.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Griffin, we welcome the fact that sports capital grants were brought back over recent years.  They are the lifeblood of grassroots clubs.  As I travel extensively through the country, I want to help more.  The national associations have a very good overview of where the money can be best spent and should continue to have more involvement in the allocation of sports capital grants because, ultimately, we would know through our strategies where best to spend the money, be it Mounthawk Park in Kerry, Glanmire in Cork or Dalymount Park.  I could give the committee many more examples.  We would like more of an involvement but we appreciate the programme, which is a great programme.<\/p><p> In respect of the behaviour of a minority of supporters at League of Ireland matches, the vast majority of League of Ireland supporters are very good football people.  We have noticed that a small minority have engaged in what I would call unacceptable behaviour, particularly in the past year.  Workshops are being held with the League of Ireland clubs under the direction of our head of security, Joe McGlue.  We treat these matter seriously, as do the clubs, and we are working with clubs to ensure the behaviour of fans at League of Ireland matches creates a family environment.  I reiterate that most League of Ireland supporters are great supporters of football.  It is only a small minority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Delaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":780,"content":"<p>Senator O'Mahony and Deputy Fitzpatrick indicated that they wanted to ask supplementary questions.

I would say there is great support for sport and when one is very forthright, it almost says that everything is all right.  It seems very controlled.  For example, there have been no questions at recent AGMs.  The publication of the FAI's accounts has been a point of criticism by the likes of Niamh Brennan.  Would it not be better to publish them on the website?  It strikes me that going about it in this way is good governance and avoids questions in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#J01000","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484748000,"counter":789,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Fitzpatrick, what Dundalk achieved was exceptional and made everybody in Ireland proud, especially those in Irish football.  Everybody adopted Dundalk as their League of Ireland team, particularly in respect of its performance in Europe.  We have given an allowance to all the clubs to develop a strategic plan and 15 strategies are in.  We will work with the 20 clubs when the full strategies are in regarding how we implement them.  The key to making League of Ireland clubs stronger is making them stronger in the community.  Therefore, the under 15, under 17 and under 19 national leagues are really important, as are the improvement of facilities and infrastructure.  When Dundalk and Cork, which did very well in Europe as well, reach certain standards and do well, it means that other clubs will aim to raise their own standards.  In the case of Shamrock Rovers, the third stand in Tallaght has been completed and the club has an academy in Roadstone.  Again, this is an example of a club that is on the rise again.<\/p> <p>  In respect of gender quotas, what I said clearly was that we have come to an agreement with the WFAI, which is very happy about what we have agreed in terms of consultation, namely, that there would be one woman on the board of the FAI.  Along with Mr. Browne, I do not see the requirement for gender quotas.  If the game is being developed correctly with the affiliate and it is happy with how we are developing participation and giving representation, we are better off doing real stuff and making it happen rather than engaging in tokenism.  It can be seen and there is no doubt that the association has achieved a lot of success in women's football and will definitely achieve more into the future.<\/p> <p>  The decision regarding the ten teams of ten came from the Premier Clubs Alliance which voted on that.  I understand that the first division clubs did not have a vote on that matter.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Murphy's question, sometimes what someone may read is not always the way it is in reality, so perhaps some of the Deputy's impressions were formed through media reports.  We publish our accounts.  We hand them to the media on the given day.  Our accounts are freely available to anybody who wants to see them.  Questions in advance are requested but the real work of the FAI at committee level is done week in, week out.  There are hundreds of meetings, including national committee meetings, executive meetings, board meetings and national council meetings.  Many questions are asked at those meetings.  The AGM might just be a snapshot in time but the real work of the association is done in the other 364 days and many questions are asked daily.  I assure the Deputy that when I leave this chamber, there will be many questions waiting for me.<\/p> <p>  We do publish our accounts and, under the new governance structures requested by the Minister of State, we will put them online.

That can be seen in some of the press coverage and things like that.  I understand that a club in Ireland is vested in headquarters.  What happens with clubs overseas?

None of us was expecting the quota announcement.  When talking about the skill set, is he talking about women representing women's rugby on the board?  What kind of skill set does the IRFU require for the board?  We have all been on boards.  Very often governance and board-related items do not relate to the experience of, in this case, playing a game, but to the kinds of things that make up good governance.  What is the skill set that women would not have given that we have 50% of the intelligence or something like that?  I am curious about Mr. Browne's thinking in saying that.

Based on the presentations, I take it that both organisations have a concern about it.  Wearing my sporting hat, I agree with them.

I ask both Mr. Browne and Mr. Duffy if there is any way that the deadlines will be met.<\/p> <p>  On governance, the GAA requires a two thirds majority, which I know well.  Does Mr. Duffy see that as a help for good governance or is it becoming a restriction?  In other words, is it holding back change?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Duffy referred to the rural-urban issue.  The GAA has problems in urban areas because of too many numbers and problems in rural areas because it has too few numbers.  He spoke about the Government closing post offices and Garda stations.  That is certainly an issue for Government.  Will the funding structure of the GAA not result in a continuance of this?<\/p> <p>  I want clarification on this because I am not aware of the answer.  Funding came through the Irish Sports Council that was ring-fenced for Dublin GAA about ten or 15 years ago.  Is that ring-fenced by the Government or by the GAA?  I do not in any suggest that money be taken away from Dublin because the outcomes have been hugely successful for the investment, in other words, it has been value for money.  Wearing my sporting hat as well as my political hat, there is a major issue for the GAA down the line unless extra funding is distributed to the weaker counties and the weaker clubs in the counties because otherwise we will perpetuate the problem.  Mr. Duffy can perhaps rightly be critical of successive governments over rural policy.  However, we do not want to see that in a sporting sense.<\/p> <p>  I come to Mr. Browne and the IRFU.  We will not talk about the Rugby World Cup because that is coming up later.  I was delighted to hear his reference to Abbotstown.  I have been out there and have seen the magnificent GAA facilities there.  What are the IRFU facilities on the site at the moment?  What is the potential for rugby there?<\/p> <p>  We have talked about the fantastic success of the rugby clubs and the international teams.  The way Irish rugby has adapted to the professional game has shown the rest of the world how it can be done in that respect.  When it is professional at the top level, one of the downsides can be getting volunteers.  I would not be aware of it in rugby clubs but it seems to be suffering at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#K00500","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":795,"content":"<p>It is good to get an opportunity to speak again.  I would be far more aligned to the GAA than I would be to rugby, but not nearly as much as my two colleagues on the right, Senator O'Mahony and Deputy Fitzpatrick, based on their inter-county successes over many years.  They have played a very meaningful and positive role in the GAA.<\/p> <p>  I want to focus on the gender quotas in both organisations.  I have served as treasurer in my local club in County Westmeath.  I can say without fear or favour some of the best people on the committee were the women.  There was no gender quota.<\/p><p>Sometimes AGMs are held at which people are coerced into being members of committees.  I refer not only to women but also to men.  I have a grave reservation about this.  We are talking about volunteering, be it at club level, county level, provincial level or all-Ireland level.  Are we taking a sledgehammer to try to crack an egg?  I suggested we discuss this at a meeting of the committee because the proposal emanated from the Government without any consultation.  I am interested in hearing whether the delegates and the bodies they represent feel any more confident that the concerns that emanated from the various sporting bodies when the announcement was made through the media one Monday morning are been addressed.<\/p><p> Before Mr. Delaney left, I asked him what is being done about sudden adult death syndrome.  Within the GAA, screening is compulsory at intercounty level.  I believe we need to have screening at club level, however.  Has the GAA any plans in this regard?<\/p><p> One of the biggest issues from the GAA's perspective is the amalgamation of clubs.  I apologise to the IRFU for concentrating so much on the GAA.  I am glad that the GAA highlighted how rural areas have been decimated over recent years with a reduction in services.  As Senator O'Mahony rightly said, we do not want to see our rural clubs going in that direction.  Quite often, rural football clubs are the only organisations gelling communities together, even at junior level, as in the case of my club for the first time in many years.  I am interested in learning what role the GAA can play in offering support in this regard.<\/p><p> Signing up to a deal with Sky is forcing people to go to the pubs to watch matches.  If only every pub were subscribing to Sky.  Now many of the pubs cannot afford to do so because they face an increase in the fee for commercial premises.  Since there is a decline in the rural pubs, they do not have the capacity to offer the service.  It is disappointing that an organisation founded in 1884 and based on volunteerism has gone so much towards commercial activity.  Perhaps the delegation will offer its rationale in that regard.<\/p><p> It appears the IRFU has but one lady representative.  The organisation is correct in that it does not want to be seen to be promoting somebody for the sake of doing so or having a token candidate.  I do not believe any woman would want to be in any position exclusively based on her gender.  We must do something, however, because women have a huge role to play.  From my experience at club level in the GAA and from working within my political party, I believe women have a huge, meaningful role to play.  They bring a different thought process and perspective to many decisions.  They need to be in key positions.  Mr. Browne said he has reservations about the proposals of the Government.  What are the IRFU's proposals to support greater female participation in governance roles?  I asked the president of the FAI the percentage of the annual budget derived from State funding.

I apologise to the witnesses because I am trying desperately to master the skill of bilocation with the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.<\/p> <p>  My question or point applies to both organisations.  My impression is based on the rugby scene and my experience in my club, as Mr. Browne will know.  It touches on what Senator O'Mahony mentioned in regard to the plight of clubs.  I refer not only to rugby, Gaelic games and soccer.  I am very concerned over the drop-off rate in active participation among adults.  When I played mini-rugby in the 1990s, there might have been 20 children for the entire club.  We now have 450.  When I used to go to watch matches, I went to watch one of seven or eight adult teams but now we are lucky to get three or four in any one club.  I appreciate the pressures associated with being able to watch so much sport on television, be it terrestrial, free-to-air or pay-per-view.  I appreciate also the lure of the gyms and the attraction of going to watch professional teams of the highest level, which opportunity might not have arisen in the past.  The IRFU's document mentions this as a challenge.  How can we address the challenge associated with a falling off in the number participating?  We are constantly talking about getting children active, active society and \"Operation Transformation\" and all that go with them but I believe involvement in clubs and team sports, especially in the community, is far more beneficial to mental and physical health than CrossFit or FitPit, or whatever one opts for.  What are the two organisations doing to address this challenge?  How could the sports capital grants target areas in this regard?  Is the problem a lack of high-quality changing facilities and playing facilities and is there a need for more all-weather turf and floodlights to allow for evening games?  Is it a matter of general emphasis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#L00200","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":798,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their patience.

What measures are being taken at all levels of performance to ensure drugs are not taken and that, if they are taken, the practice is stopped?<\/p> <p>  My next question was raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I am very concerned about concussion in all sports.  It is unfair that rugby sometimes stands out in this regard.  It is associated with more high-profile cases.  All sportspeople are susceptible to concussion.  The more physical the sport, the higher the risk.  It is an area of concern.  Speaking to parents of young children, I know it is in the interest of both rugby and Gaelic games to ensure people are confident the matter is being addressed.  From speaking to parents in my constituency, I note there is concern over starting children at underage level in rugby because of the fear of concussion.  In recent days, a number of high-profile individuals expressed further concern arising from the incidents at the Champions Cup games at the weekend.  The recent George North issue was very high profile.  Could the delegates comment on this matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#L00300","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484748000,"counter":799,"content":"<p>I will respond to the people who are present first and then answer the other questions.  I will first respond to Deputy Fitzpatrick, who raised three points.  The challenges in rural areas were raised on several occasions.  It is a considerable matter for the GAA.  We are finding it tough.  The heart of the GAA is in rural Ireland.  We are currently finding it tough simply because of the movement of population from west to east.  Depopulation along the west coast, in particular, has made it hard from clubs.  I am not blaming the Government.  It is very hard for the GAA to solve the problem.  All we can do is examine our own structures and make arrangements, through our own rules, to allow clubs to stay in existence.  We have done that and are trying to be much more flexible in terms of things coming together, forming independent teams for particular competitions, amalgamations and so on but it is a real challenge.  If society is to be increasingly built around urban areas, it will be hard for the GAA because our strength is in rural areas, probably much more so than with rugby and soccer.  That is a real concern for us.  Our contribution is to make our rules as flexible as possible to allow teams and clubs to continue in existence.<\/p><p>I will come back to some of the other points that were raised about this later.  It is a challenge for us.  In urban areas, we have had huge growth in numbers participating in the GAA, as Senator O'Mahony mentioned, particularly in Dublin, but the problem we have there is the availability of facilities.  The GAA model very often is that one tries to form a club and one establishes a community around it with a social centre, pitches and so on.  It is almost impossible to do this in Dublin because one simply cannot afford the cost of land and the cost of facilities is so high.  In fairness, we get support from local councils and so on, but the challenge in urban areas is that there are so many big clubs in Dublin that have the numbers but simply do not have the playing facilities to cater for all those who want to play.  In the west of Ireland there are facilities and not enough players.  This is not something we can easily solve.  We are very aware of it.  We are doing the best we can, but it is a challenge for us.<br\/><br\/>Senator Richmond and several others mentioned the drop-out rate.  This applies to Mr. Browne's organisation as much as to ours and to Mr. Delaney's as well.  We lose many children and young people from sport from the age of 15 or 16 onwards.  Some of the answers to this are within our own organisation in terms of our competitive structures and so on.  One of the things that happens is that kids play all sports up to ten, 11 or 12 but, as time goes on, they realise that perhaps they will not be good enough to play at a competitive level and they drift away.  Young people develop other interests and hobbies as they go through their teenage years and adolescence.  The drop-off in participation in sport at this age is a worldwide problem and covers a multitude of sports.  We are all trying in different ways to remedy this.  This year we brought in what we call super game centres whereby we had 80 different places throughout the country where kids who were not affiliated to clubs could come and play the games at particular times and organise games.  We are making efforts in this regard, but it is a huge challenge.<br\/><br\/>To come to Deputy Murphy's points, the first he raised concerned the issue of the separation of boys and girls.  He is right that in the summer camps, up to the age of 12, they are together in one group and then the organisations go their separate ways.  It is very important that I make the point that the GAA is a stand-alone organisation, but the Camogie Association and Ladies Gaelic Football are independent organisations.  Having said that, we have a very close relationship with them and they play all their games on our grounds, which is what we want.<br\/><br\/>The GAA would like in the long term to become one organisation with the Camogie Association and Ladies Gaelic Football, but we cannot force this on these organisations.  They know our views on this.  We are working very closely with the three CEOs of the three organisations to put together a template for working together at club level.  This is already happening.  The GAA is very open to the idea of one organisation encompassing all these organisations but we will not force it because we are the largest organisation and we do not want to be seen to be putting pressure on the other two.  However, we are very open to and would be very happy to have the closest possible relationship.  Our previous president, Liam O'Neill, and our current president, Aog&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, have made this message very clear.  In the long term, I would love to see one gaelic games organisation covering all the sports.  That is our aspiration.  In the meantime, we will continue to support the two women's organisations in every way we can, financially or otherwise.  On the point of gender quotas, this makes us a little different because the GAA <i>per se<\/i>only caters for the boys' and men's games.  I will come back to gender quotas in a moment but I ask the committee to remember that we are separate from the camogie and ladies' football organisations, which have their own structures, governing bodies and management boards.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Murphy asked a second question, an interesting one, about clubs overseas.  She is absolutely right that the model overseas is very different.  The clubs abroad are at club level virtually all amalgamated, whether camogie, ladies' football or GAA, because that is the only way it would work.  This is the first thing that is different about the overseas clubs.  The second is that in Europe most of the clubs do not have their own grounds and properties so the issue of vesting property does not arise.  In America, however, it does.  We have grounds in places such as Philadelphia, New York, San Francisco and so on.  The vesting model is different, but the clubs or units have their own grounds.  They are vested in the GAA, but it is a different model for legal reasons than operates here.  Generally speaking, securing property abroad is not as big an issue as it is here.  In a number of places outside Ireland the GAA is part of a wider cultural centre and a broad Irish-American unit.  Deputy Murphy's point is a good one.  There is huge growth overseas and it is growing very quickly.<br\/><br\/>Senator O'Mahony also raised the point of gender quotas.  To be fair to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, although this has caused a huge controversy, whatever else one might say, at least he started a debate, which is no bad thing.  People can have their views on the level of consultation or the lack thereof and so on, but one must say at least he has created a debate.  For any organisation, ours included, there is nothing wrong with that.  A certain percentage within a certain space of time would be very difficult to achieve.  All I will say is that the GAA is open to engage in this debate.  We have many female people in responsible positions, certainly at county level: county chairmen, county secretaries and county treasurers responsible for payrolls.  On our management board we do not because everybody there, bar two people, is elected, and we have not had women standing for those posts as of yet.  This will happen in time.  We are open to engaging in this debate as it goes on.  As I said, it would be better if it were not done through enforcement and if one could get agreement.  I do not think this is impossible.  I am sure all the organisations would be quite happy to work with Government to see how this might be achieved without being too draconian in how it is done.<br\/><br\/>Senator O'Mahony asked a question about the two-thirds majority in the GAA in terms of governance.  This is tricky.  I know first hand that when one tries to introduce reforms, it is very hard to get a two-thirds majority.  At last year's congress a number of very good suggestions for change fell because they got a majority but not a two-thirds majority.  We have our annual congress in Croke Park at the end of February.  There are a number of motions to change this rule, some suggesting a 60% majority, one suggesting a bare majority.  The problem is that to change the rule will require a two-thirds majority because this is the rule, so it is a bit of a catch-22.  I agree that two thirds is a little high.  I think 60% would be fair.  I can understand why people want to have more than a 50% majority, but two thirds is high and does make change rather difficult.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of funding and the funding for Dublin, to which Senator O'Mahony referred specifically, when the money was originally allocated to the GAA, it was allocated specifically for Dublin, for the development of hurling and football.  I think this was when Bertie Ahern was Taoiseach.  To be fair, this has been very successful in broadening participation in the games in Dublin.  Now, as I think Mr. Browne mentioned earlier, the funding we all get from Sport Ireland or through Government is much less than it used to be.  We understand this is because of the recession and so on.  At the moment the funding is not ring-fenced.  It is a matter for us to decide how it is used.  We have a manner of deciding how to allocate it.  We still allocate a considerable amount to Dublin for two reasons: first, because there is a huge level of activity there; and second, because the initial process that was put in place was that full-time development officers were appointed to clubs all over Dublin, there are people in employment there, that funding pays half of their employment costs and the club pays the other half.  Clearly, if one were to remove that funding just like that from those clubs, they probably would not be able to afford to keep those people in place.  However, we are aware, particularly our organisation in Dublin, of the need to rebalance that.  This is happening at the moment with the approval of the GAA in Dublin.  There will be a reduction in the funding going to Dublin, allowing us to invest in other places.  Senator O'Mahony's question is a valid one.  This is happening and will continue to happen.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the general distribution of funding, so many parts of the organisation would benefit from more and more funding, both from our organisation and from Government, but much of the time it is a matter of availability of resources.  Like every other organisation, we could do an awful lot more if we had more funding, however we get it.<br\/><br\/>I think I have responded to Deputy Troy's question about gender quotas already.<br\/><br\/>Regarding sudden adult death syndrome, Deputy Troy is right that players at inter-county level generally are tested.  One would love to test every single player at club level for heart issues, but the cost is the big factor.  Many players get tested of their own volition, but simply because of the cost factor, we as an organisation and most clubs would not be able to afford to fund testing for every single player.  However, we are very well advanced in health training and the use of defibrillators and so on and have done much work around that.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the amalgamation of clubs, as I said, we prefer if clubs can retain their own identities.  The ideal, even if they are small, is that they can remain separate.  If they cannot, the next step is amalgamation.  Both models are happening, particularly in rural areas.  As I said, we would like if they could stay on their own, but if they cannot, amalgamation is the next best thing.  What one does not want is a club or an area losing its GAA identity.  So far we have done fairly well to retain this, but it is very challenging.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Troy raised the question of Sky Sports, as did Deputy Munster.  I am glad they did because it is important that I respond to this.  I wish to put a few points from the GAA's point of view to the committee on this because there are a few myths out there around it.  First, we want people to go to the games.  Second, if they cannot go to the games, clearly, we would like to give the opportunity to people at home and abroad to watch them on TV.  It is important that people realise that now and over the next five years, more than 100 live games per year will be shown on terrestrial free-to-air TV.  It is important to keep this in perspective.  Sky has only 14 live games exclusively.  It has six more, including the finals - football and hurling semi-finals and all-Ireland finals - which it shows at the same time as RTE.  This allows people in Britain-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":801,"content":"<p>Over five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#M00200","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484748000,"counter":802,"content":"<p>Yes, it is a five-year contract.  A huge number of games are shown live on free-to-air, including all the big games, as I said.<\/p><p>That is the first point I want to make.  I will make another couple of points.  People have an idea that because a number of games are on Sky, many games that they could watch in the past cannot be seen now.  It has always been the case that certain games are not shown on television.  Every year, many championship games are not shown live on television.  I want to give a little perspective to it.<\/p><p> The other point I would make is that we were very anxious.  We had a huge demand.  I attended the Global Irish Forum in Dublin Castle on several occasions.  We were hammered because people were unable to see our games abroad.  This was a huge issue during the five years prior to the signing of the original deal with Sky.  Through GAAGO and Sky, we have opened up our games to the Irish abroad in a way that was never possible before.  People in New York, Sydney and elsewhere can now watch more than 100 games per annum free to air through GAAGO.  People in Britain can access our games on television.  It is great for the GAA in Britain that games are now available on Sky.<\/p><p> I would like to respond to the assertion that it is disappointing that the GAA has been driven so much towards commercial activity.  We are in a competitive world.  We spoke earlier about the need to invest in GAA facilities and coaches in rural areas and in Dublin.  We cannot do that without finance.  As an organisation, we have to be aware of commercial realities.  That means engaging in commercial activity and that is what we do.  The Croke Park venue hosts concerts and is a commercial vehicle for us.  The television rights we have sold to RTE, TG4 and Sky are hugely important for us.  We have to get the value of our products.  If we do not do so, we will be unable to compete.  With respect to Mr. Browne and Mr. Delaney, we are competing with soccer and rugby for resources and for the minds and hearts of young people in Ireland.  We have to be able to put coaches into schools.  We employ 350 full-time and part-time coaches all over Ireland.  We go into thousands of primary schools every year.  We need funding to do that.  The money we get from our commercial activity is absolutely vital for that.<\/p><p> I would like to dispel the myth that the arrangement with Sky was foisted on the GAA by people in Croke Park.  Last year, a terrific motion was brought to the GAA congress proposing that a new rule be enacted to provide that all televised intercounty championship games should be available on free-to-air television.  The motion was defeated by 200 votes to 36.  People within the GAA understand and accept why this arrangement has been reached.  I appreciate that in a perfect world, everybody would want every single game to be live and free on terrestrial television.  People in the GAA understand why a small number of our games are televised on a subscription channel.<\/p><p> The Chairman raised the drugs issue.  Like all the organisations, we are in total compliance with the rules of the World Anti-Doping Agency and Sport Ireland.  I think we have an excellent record in this regard.  We have blood testing.  Our players are open.  We meet all the requirements.  That will always be the way.  In fairness to the GPA, it does a lot of good work to educate our players.  This is an absolute priority for us.  That will always be the case.<\/p><p> We had a seminar on concussion before Christmas.  It was attended by personnel from the University of Pittsburgh, which is a world leader in this area.  Our policy is that if there is any doubt about a player who has received a knock on the head, he is taken out of the game and he stays out.  I would like to make a point about concussion that I suggest is valid for all organisations.  I think we all do pretty well at national level.  That is fine when big games take place in Croke Park or the Aviva Stadium, but I am worried about what happens when a fellow gets as big a knock during a junior B game or rugby fifth team game down the country as anyone might get in the Aviva Stadium or Croke Park.  If there are no doctors or first-aid people on the sidelines, will those in attendance know what to do?  That is why we are trying to tell people our view is that if there is any doubt at all, they must take the player in question out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484748000,"counter":804,"content":"<p>Some of this ground has already been covered.  We will keep going.  I will begin by dealing with concussion, which was raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick and a number of other speakers.  We have a zero-tolerance position in cases of suspected concussion in the amateur game.  If a player has a suspected concussion, he comes off and is banned from playing for two weeks.  A player under the age of 18 is banned for three weeks.  A person in these circumstances is required to get a certificate from a doctor before he can come back to play.  Rugby is probably one of the leading sports in the world at the moment in relation to concussion because of the focus that has been on us in this regard.  Education is the key issue.  It is a matter of educating players, coaches, parents and doctors.  There have been cases in which doctors have not been able to comply with the concussion regulations.  We have invested heavily in a significant educational exercise throughout our club and school system.  This is a zero-tolerance area as far as we are concerned.<\/p> <p>  The situation is slightly different in the professional game.  Under the concussion protocols that apply in the professional game, the doctor and the medical team can withdraw a player for a head injury assessment in the event of a suspected concussion.  In international games and in some professional provincial games, they have an opportunity as part of the assessment to look at replays of video footage to check what happened to the player, who is put through certain protocols.  One of the misnomers in all of this is that people think the ten-minute head injury assessment is there to diagnose a concussion.  That is not the case.  The assessment establishes whether there is a suspected concussion.  If there is a suspected concussion, the player does not go back on the park - he has to go through graded return-to-play protocols that are generally put in place via the neurologists we employ and our own team doctors.  Concussion is an extremely serious issue for sport and in general.  There is as much chance of a child getting a concussion while running down the school corridor as there is of him or her getting a concussion playing Gaelic football, hurling, rugby, soccer or any other sport in the park.  I think the Department of Health needs to have a role in making people throughout the schools system aware of the dangers of concussion.  People have started to gain a greater understanding of this issue in recent years.  That is our position on concussion.<\/p> <p>  I was also asked about our policies regarding children with special needs.  We have started a relationship with the Cara Centre.  We are trying to find a short form of the game that would be suitable for children with special needs.  That is an ongoing work in progress.  As rugby is a contact sport, we have to find non-contact forms of the sport to allow children with special needs to participate in it.  We are very supportive of that.<\/p> <p>  I would like to respond to the questions that were asked about mental health issues, child protection measures and the win-at-all-costs mentality.  The IRFU set up a committee approximately 18 months ago to run its spirit programme, which tries to communicate the specific values of rugby and sport.  The spirit committee has rolled out educational programmes to support the mental health of our players within the club game and to ensure everyone understands what is required from a child protection perspective.  We have a full-time welfare officer who goes to schools and clubs to educate our administrators on all aspects of child protection.  Obviously, we follow the child protection guidelines that are in place.  The spirit committee has worked with Pieta House to roll out the \"mind your buddy\" mental health programme, which provides supports for players, coaches and volunteers within clubs, makes them aware of mental health issues and helps them to recognise such issues as they arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":805,"content":"<p>Does the spirit programme receive public funding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#N00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1484748000,"counter":806,"content":"<p>No.  It is funded by the IRFU.  We would welcome such funding.  We sometimes find that there could be a little more joined-up thinking between the Departments of Health, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Children and Youth Affairs in availing of the ability of the three major sporting organisations to provide certain supports and resources through our channels.  The great advantage we have as organisations is that we have the infrastructure to access the cohort of the population that the three Departments are all looking to access.  We are thrashing around looking for funding to roll out programmes that are part and parcel of our social responsibility to our children and to the people who fall under our wing.  I think this probably needs to be looked at a little more carefully.<\/p><p> Regarding gender quotas, people ask about what we mean by \"suitably qualified candidates\".  The skill sets to which I referred were rugby skill sets in terms of understanding the game, how clubs work and how clubs and the game fit within the structure of Irish rugby.  One of our main issues is that we have few ladies involved in coaching and administration.  The few that we have are very good.  Without having to change the laws or structure and governance of our game and reverting to our clubs and branches to ask them to tear our governance up and start again, it is unlikely that we will have sufficient numbers of women in the club game coming through the branches up to the union committee within the proposed three-year period.  It probably takes the average IRFU committee member ten to 15 years to get there.  They have gone through running the minis in clubs, coaching in clubs, handling administration in clubs, moving into their provinces to run competition and disciplinary structures and so on before being elected.  We are conscious of this issue.  Last year, we used one of the two co-options allowed under our governance to bring Ms Mary Quinn, who has been an effective administrator in Leinster's women's rugby, onto the IRFU committee.<\/p><p> We are starting to see some changes.  We have women's committees in each of the four provinces and women are involved in those.  I am confident that women will come through the system, but if we tear it up, with what alternative will we end up?  Will this make any difference?  Deputy Munster probably took me up wrong regarding evidence.  What I meant was that there was no evidence to suggest that not having women on the IRFU committee had held the women's game back.  As far as we are concerned, the roll-out of our rugby programmes is for women, men, girls and boys.  We draw no distinction between them.<\/p><p> We would have some difficulty in reaching a quota of two thirds, one third or whatever it is within a three-year period without ripping up our governance structure.  That said, we have a working party that is examining our governance.  Due to our democratic and federal structure, that party comprises representatives from each of the four branches.  The party will make its recommendations.  This is one of the issues that it is examining, given that it needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> All team sports face concerns about the club game and the grassroots level.  Solitary sports have grown in recent years, creating difficulties for team sports.  Mr. Duffy referred to population movements within and outside Ireland.  They have caused difficulties for all major sports.  We have done a great deal of work with the ESRI regarding the population.  When one compares the numbers playing the game with population trends, rugby is probably holding its own.  However, the overall population in the 17-25 age bracket is declining.  Inevitably, fewer people in that bracket will be playing sport or be available to play.  The good news is that there is a demographic bulge coming up through the system.  The three major sports have to gear themselves up and get fit to deal with that bulge and provide access for those people.<\/p><p> We could also try to provide different versions of the sport.  Due to the distractions of modern life - the fact that people have to earn a living and how difficult it is to get about compared with previously, particularly in urban areas - people are looking for something different.  They are not necessarily looking for 20 or 30 weeks of rugby.  They might only be looking for ten weeks of rugby.  We are trying to find competition structures to offer them different ways of playing the game, for example, tag or touch rugby.  We need to be more innovative in our offering.  The same applies to GAA and soccer.  We have had some reasonable success in that regard.<\/p><p> I will reiterate Mr. Delaney's point on ticket touting, in that we would be delighted if the State introduced legislation on same.  It is as much a headache for us as it is for anyone else.  Legislation would help to resolve some of the problem.<\/p><p> Senator O'Mahony raised a good point about creating the conditions for equality of opportunity between the genders and trying to get women involved in the game.  As part of our women's strategy, we have rolled out a programme that tries to upskill and encourage women to get involved in the various levels of the club game.  Unless they are willing to put themselves forward and feel confident about doing so, it will be difficult to know from where women administrators will come.<\/p><p> The Senator also referred to Abbotstown.  We have been a strong supporter of its facilities from the word go.  We have seen similar facilities elsewhere in the world.  Almost by accident, even though I suspect that Mr. John Treacy had a design in the back of his mind, Ireland is in danger of creating a unique facility at Abbotstown that has multiple sports, including all of the high-performance ones, on-site.  We can exchange information, ideas, philosophies and methods.  It could create a unique environment that gives Irish sport a sporting advantage.<\/p><p> We are waiting for phase 2 of the national indoor arena to be built.  That phase will include a high-performance rugby facility, a half-sized covered artificial pitch, a world class gym and facilities for our national coaching staff and our various national teams.  The IRFU is making an additional investment to put three pitches into the facility.  We have no presence in Abbotstown currently beyond our lease over some of the land, which we hold on the basis that we will eventually be able to move onto the site.  Phase 2 is important for us and we will welcome its progress.  While I understand that there are financial issues, I hope that they will be overcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Browne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":808,"content":"<p>Our committee might visit Abbotstown, as getting a better understanding of what is there would be worthwhile.

We had a big discussion about this in the last committee.  The witness said that there are so many games on free-to-air, and I agree with him.  I was glad to see it was not increased.  The previous time I believe it was more about promotion.  Now it seems to be the finance side of it.  In fairness, the money the GAA gets for those broadcasting rights such as those when Croke Park was opened up to rugby and soccer, was disseminated round the State.  The GAA has centres of excellence and so on.<\/p> <p>  There are some anomalies there and I will be parochial for a minute.  I believe that four of Mayo's championship games were exclusive on Sky last year - or it could be Kerry, I do not see that Dublin would be beaten this year.  Mr. Duffy makes the point that the GAA wants people to go to games but certain people just cannot go to games.

It did at the time.  I want to go back to the first point.  It is not just about the finance.  I made this point when I responded to Deputy Troy's query.  Three years ago, when we made the first arrangement with Sky it was part of an arrangement to try to have our games broadcast all over the world.  That was successful.  We have achieved that through Sky in Britain in particular, which I believe has been terrific for the diaspora over there, and also through GAAGO.  This time around we want to continue that, which we have done.  It is about finance also but it is not just about finance.  Consider Senator O'Mahony's point about Mayo.  Sky take 14 games, eight of which are qualifier games.  It happened that last year, because Mayo lost to Galway in the first round, it was in the qualifiers the whole way through which was a bit unusual.  I understand, however, why people in Mayo would feel that all their games were on - it was because they came through the qualifiers.  It was just bad luck in the number of games but the point to remember is-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017011800002#P02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1484748000,"counter":835,"content":"<p>If I may interrupt for a moment, I would see the success of the promotion through GAAGO right throughout the world.

I want to ask the witnesses about the availability of grant assistance to the grassroots of their respective organisations?  For example, say a small club in Kerry is looking to do X, Y or Z, to reseed or drain the pitch or whatever.  We have the sports capital programme, which is a great programme.  It is ideal but may be a bit difficult to apply for and get the application valid.  Not everybody gets funding.

That has been difficult in recent years but we certainly do all the major grounds.  We have two huge commitments at the moment.  We are redeveloping P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh which, as members know, is an &euro;80 million project.  We are very grateful that &euro;30 million of this funding is being provided by Government.  The remaining &euro;50 million, however, must come from the GAA.  Some &euro;20 million will come from Croke Park, &euro;10 million will come directly from Cork's own savings of &euro;30 million, and the rest must be raised.<\/p> <p>  Of the &euro;80 million for P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh, the GAA must provide &euro;50 million.  It has been a very difficult process but we are also in the process of redeveloping Casement Park and the GAA contribution towards that is &pound;15 million.  One of the few advantages of the sterling situation is that we have benefitted in a small way.  The point is that the GAA must provide not far short of &euro;70 million for those two stadia and to be fair they absolutely must be redeveloped.  If we do not develop them they will fall down and it is also very important for us to have major stadiums in our major cities.  We have one each in Dublin, Cork and Belfast.  They are also important in the context of the rugby World Cup.  They are a huge financial burden on the GAA.<\/p> <p>  In answer to the Chairman's question, we also fund the clubs through the provinces and make grants available through the provinces.  The Chairman's own province for example, where the Munster council gets a grant every year towards club grounds and they add to that fund from their own resources.  There are grants available for all the things mentioned by the Chairman.  Munster is very good in that space.<\/p><p>The level of grants would depend on the amount of money that they have.

Speaking as someone who has a keen interest in sport, I thank the witnesses, their employees and their thousands of volunteers throughout the country for the fantastic work that they do in bringing us sporting joy both at a local level and at a county and international level as well.  The work that is done is amazing.  As was mentioned by numerous contributors earlier, the work that is being done in communities is preventing many bad things and changing lives for the better.  It makes a positive impact on our health, on society and on communities.  I cannot overstate how grateful we are as a committee for the work that the sporting organisations and the people in them do, and I thank their witnesses again.
