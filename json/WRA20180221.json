The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector.  Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention. <\/p>  <p>  In April 2017 the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE) published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available on his Department&rsquo;s website, www.broadband.gov.ie.  This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP. <\/p>  <p>  The Map is colour coded and searchable by address\/eircode:<\/p>  <p>  -  The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  <\/p>  <p>  -  The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  <\/p>  <p>  -  The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of this year as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with Minister Naughten in April.      <\/p>  <p>  In the South Dublin County Council area 98% of premises fall into the BLUE area while 1% of premises are in the AMBER area.  Approximately 1% of premises fall into the LIGHT BLUE area. Individuals can check which category their premises falls into accessing www.broadband.gov.ie and entering their eircode into the High Speed Broadband Map.<\/p>  <p>  The DCCAE is in a formal procurement process to engage a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  That procurement process is now at an advanced stage. &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; have been evaluated by the NBP specialist team. This is the last stage of the procurement process before moving to the final tender stage, which will be followed by the appointment of a preferred bidder and contract signature.  When the procurement process reaches a satisfactory conclusion and a subsidy level is agreed by Government, a contract will be awarded and the network rollout will commence.<\/p>  <p>  In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. <\/p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.

The report also identified a number of reasons for the underspend, including delays in implementing programmes and a lower than expected level of uptake for some schemes.<b><\/b><\/p><p>My Department has commenced a full review of the Disbursement Scheme 2013-2016.  This review, which will be completed by the end of June 2018, will set out to improve the administrative procedures governing Dormant Accounts funding to maximise the effectiveness with which funds are distributed in order to better support the people and communities at whom the funding is aimed.  It will specifically address the issue of underspend and ensure improved administrative procedures are put in place to maximise the impact of available funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100066#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Improvement Scheme Funding","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100066#WRA03350"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[8740\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100066#WRA03400","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the status of local improvement scheme allocations to local authorities throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>The Local Improvement Scheme (LIS)\u00a0is a programme for improvement works on small private\/non public roads and has been funded in the past by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and subsequently\u00a0by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There has been\u00a0very little funding available for this scheme in recent years due to constraints on public expenditure.\u00a0 However, I was very conscious of the underlying demand for the scheme in rural areas throughout the country. <\/p><p>I therefore announced the provision of &euro;10 million\u00a0to Local Authorities for a Local Improvement Scheme last September. \u00a0Based on demand and the capacity of Local Authorities to complete works before the end of 2017, I allocated an additional &euro;7.4 million to Local Authorities for LIS roads at the end of November.

Additional capital expenditure allocation of &euro;4.3bn over four years will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead. There was also increased funding provided to my Department for the opening of six new diplomatic missions as part of Global Footprint 2025, which will contribute to helping our exporters find new markets. Our Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams. <\/p><p>Our longer-term economic strategies will also be critically important in addressing the challenges of Brexit, notably Ireland 2040 &ndash;the National Development Plan. The Enterprise Strategy 2025 is also under review,  and we are in active discussions with the European Investment Bank for a potential increase in investment in the country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100067#WRB04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Data","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100067#WRB04200"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[8840\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100067#WRB04300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of passport applications being processed; the number of renewals and first-time passports respectively; the average processing time for each; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":103,"content":"<p>The Passport Service provides a range of channels to Irish citizens wishing to apply for a passport, including a postal application system, online service, and through the network of Irish Missions worldwide.

In order to respond to seasonal demands and anticipated application increases, the Passport Service has received sanction for 210 Temporary Clerical Officers (&ldquo;TCOs&rdquo;) to be appointed to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork this year. Training for the first intake of TCOs has already commenced, with a sizeable proportion already in place.  All TCOs are expected to be fully trained and in place by the end of March at latest.

The National Plan aims to give effect to the Guiding Principles through the promotion of responsible business practice at home and overseas, and was developed following an extensive consultation process. <\/p>  <p>  The National Plan is designed to be a living document which will permit updates to reflect contemporaneous developments.  One goal of the National Plan is to assist and encourage businesses to understand that respect for human rights is good for business.  Part of this process is to encourage businesses to promote human rights within their business operations and engage positively with organisations and individuals seeking to do the same.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has responsibility for the operationalisation of a number of actions set out in the National Plan, including the establishment of a Business and Human Rights Implementation Group.  This group will consist of representatives from Government, the business community and civil society.  It is envisaged that the group will meet twice a year to review implementation of the National Plan.

It is also the subject of a stakeholder conference today in Croke Park.<\/p><p>The report examines the Strategic Implications Arising for Ireland from Changing EU-UK Trading Relations and provides an evidence base on key trade and investment questions which will help to inform Ireland&rsquo;s position as part of the wider negotiation on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU.<\/p><p>It will also help to inform our evolving domestic policy response and measures necessary to mitigate risks and maximise opportunities arising as a result of Brexit.  Using a computable general equilibrium model to quantify new barriers to trade in goods and services which might emerge as a result of Brexit, the study: <\/p><p>- Quantifies impact of six possible Brexit scenarios on trade and investment &ndash; the impact of these scenarios on metrics such as GDP and exports is considered, and analysis of both short and long term impacts is examined; and <\/p><p>- Provides analysis of the likely impact of Brexit on key sectors. <\/p><p>All of the scenarios examined produce a result that is less favourable than a non-Brexit scenario.  However, regardless of the scenario, the Irish economy is still expected to record strong, positive growth out to 2030 - Brexit has a dampening impact, resulting in a lower growth rate than would otherwise have occurred. <\/p><p>Given the scale of the Brexit challenge, detailed cross-Government work is continuing at home to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s exit, in parallel to work in Brussels.  This includes contingency planning for all possible scenarios. <\/p><p>My own Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) continues to work with colleagues across government through the various structures including the Cabinet committee on all aspects of Brexit, to ensure the growth and resilience of Irish enterprise. <\/p><p>My Department plays a key role in implementing the Government&rsquo;s policies to stimulate the productive capacity of the economy and create an environment which supports job-creation and jobs maintenance.  Brexit impacts upon all of these areas, and on many others within the Department&rsquo;s remit. <\/p><p>In relation to Brexit, our objective is to support firms to adapt to the challenges and opportunities Brexit presents by ensuring we have fit for purpose policies.  Our strategy is to minimise risks and maximise opportunities by ensuring the growth and resilience of Irish enterprise post-Brexit working across four pillars which are: <\/p><p>- Helping Firms to Compete;<\/p><p>- Enabling Firms to Innovate<\/p><p>- Supporting Firms to Trade;<\/p><p>- Negotiating for the Best Possible Outcome;<\/p><p>My Department recently published &ldquo;Building Stronger Business&rdquo; which summarises the issues facing enterprise, the policy measures my Department has already taken, those we plan to take, our research programme designed to inform these policies, and the Departmental structural reforms put in place to ensure that we can work as efficiently and effectively as possible to support our companies.<\/p><p>Several important steps have already been taken to prepare our economy, including through a range of measures announced in Budgets 2017 and 2018, the commitments included in APJ 2017, and the targets included in the Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy. <\/p><p>From my Department&rsquo;s perspective, we are leveraging the expertise and enhancing the capacity of our Agencies to ensure that they are in the best possible position to address the needs of their clients in relation to competitiveness, innovation and trade diversification. This is being achieved through the provision of information, advice, training and other supports. <\/p><p>Specific DBEI actions to date include:<\/p><p>- DBEI has made an additional &euro;6 million in funding to its agencies, in 2017 and 2018, to recruit up to 100 additional staff, specifically to assist in the response to the evolving Brexit situation.  These resources have been distributed across Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority<b>.<\/b>These additional resources will be assigned to both overseas offices in markets that are growing and in Irish offices to address a range of Brexit issues, including the support for internationalisation activities, a strengthening of the LEOs ability to respond locally to help micro-enterprises, and enhanced support for innovation.<\/p><p>- The rollout of the Brexit Loan Scheme to provide affordable financing to Irish firms impacted by Brexit.  The scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million available to business with less than 500 employees.<\/p><p>- We are developing proposals for a Longer-Term Business Investment Loan Scheme together with a new Business Advisory Hub service which would focus on business development to allow enterprises to position themselves for a post-Brexit environment. <\/p><p>- The EU Commission has approved a &lsquo;rescue and restructuring&rsquo; scheme.  The scheme can be drawn on in exceptional circumstance for a company severely affected by Brexit.<\/p><p>- We are working with DG Competition examining other possible measures to support some of our most exposed and impacted companies should the need arise.  Such measures may need a greater level of support than is required under current State aid rules.<\/p><p>Looking forward, Action Plan for Jobs 2018 will continue to act as an effective lever for driving reforms that enhance the competitiveness of Irish firms, increase jobs and grow the resilience of our economy in the context of Brexit, while we are also finalising a review of Enterprise 2025 to take account of Brexit and other global challenges over the longer term.<\/p><p>Our response to Brexit will continue to evolve and the Copenhagen Economics study, along with evidence emerging from other relevant studies, as well as continued engagement with a broad range of stakeholders, will assist in informing the evolution of that response. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100070#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100070#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[8894\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100070#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the contingencies and supports in place to safeguard Irish small and medium enterprises and export businesses from a hard Brexit scenario, including revision of State aid rules; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":244,"content":"<p>My\u00a0Department is carrying out extensive work to prepare for all Brexit eventualities.\u00a0Informed by detailed research,\u00a0\u00a0my Department is \u00a0putting in place a package of measures that will allow us to respond to the needs of businesses including the Brexit Loan Scheme which was announced in Budget 2018, and will provide affordable working capital financing to eligible businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future. <\/p><p>The recent signing of the counter guarantee from the EIB group (through its InnovFin Guarantee)  means that the &euro;24 million exchequer funding announced in the 2018 Budget (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) can be leveraged to provide a fund of &euro;300 million.

The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles.\u00a0<\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN.<\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. <\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster.

The Directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross border healthcare within the EU, for those occasions where the care patients seek is provided in another Member State rather than in their home country. <\/p>  <p>   The HSE, as the National Contact Point (NCP) for the Directive has the responsibility to ensure Irish patients who seek to have healthcare abroad under the terms of the Directive are assisted with access to the information they need to make an informed choice. The HSE  advises where a patient is in any doubt as to the need to seek prior authorisation before availing of a consultation or treatment abroad to contact the NCP.  The NCP will advise patients of the reimbursement rate that will apply to the assessment\/treatment being accessed. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding prior authorisation of healthcare, Article 8 of the Directive permits this in certain circumstances and was transposed into Irish law by Regulation 12 of S.I. 2013 of 2014 on 14 July 2014.  Regulation 12 lists the circumstances where the HSE may specify particular cross-border healthcare as subject to prior authorisation.  These circumstances are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  (a) involves planning requirements relating to the object of ensuring sufficient and permanent access to a balanced range of high quality treatment in the State, or the wish to control costs or avoid, as far as possible, any waste of financial, technical and human resources, and -<\/p>  <p>  (i) involves overnight hospital accommodation of the insured person for at least one night, or<\/p>  <p>  (ii) requires the use of highly specialised and cost-intensive medical infrastructure or medical equipment,<\/p>  <p>  (b) involves treatments presenting a particular risk for a patient, or,<\/p>  <p>  (c) is provided by a healthcare provider that, on a case-by-case basis, could give rise to serious and specific concerns relating to the quality or safety of the care, with the exception of healthcare which is subject to European Union legislation ensuring a minimum level of safety and quality throughout the European Union.<\/p>  <p>   However, the HSE may refuse to grant prior authorisation in the following circumstances:<\/p>  <p>  (a) the patient will, according to a clinical evaluation, be exposed with reasonable certainty to a patient-safety risk that cannot be regarded as acceptable, taking into account the potential benefit for the person of the sought cross-border healthcare;<\/p>  <p>  (b) the general public will be exposed with reasonable certainty to a substantial safety hazard as a result of the cross-border healthcare in question;<\/p>  <p>  (c) the healthcare is to be provided by a healthcare provider that raises serious and specific concerns relating to the respect of standards and guidelines on quality of care and patient safety, including provisions on supervision, whether these standards and guidelines are laid down by laws and regulations or through accreditation systems established by the Member State of treatment; or<\/p>  <p>  (d) the Health Service Executive can provide healthcare that is the same as, or equivalent to, the healthcare sought by the patient within a time limit which is medically justifiable, taking into account the patient&rsquo;s current state of health at the time the decision under this Regulation is taken and the probable course of the medical condition to which the healthcare relates.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, a patient may, if they wish, request prior authorisation for any procedure regardless of whether or not this is required under Regulation 12.  This has the advantage for the patient as they will receive an indication of the level of reimbursement to expect and also an assurance they are complying with any conditions necessary under the terms of the Directive.<\/p>  <p>  As the HSE has responsibility for the administration of the Cross Border Directive I have asked the HSE to examine the issues raised concerning the information on the Cross Border Directive on its website and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100071#WRF05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":353,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100072#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":354,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[8959\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100072#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) has not been facilitated to return to work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":355,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100072#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100072#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[8960\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100072#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that assessment of needs policy has changed in County Mayo; if children must now have a pre-diagnosis before being accepted for assessment of needs appointments; if the policy has changed; if this policy has changed nationwide; if it is restricted to County Mayo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The Programme aims to enhance competitiveness, to encourage more sustainable farming practices and to deliver real and quantifiable results for rural communities and the rural economy generally.\u00a0Achieving these results is very much dependant on farmers engaging with and participating in the various schemes and initiatives on offer, and I am pleased to say that, as with previous RDP programmes in Ireland, farmers are enthusiastically signing up to schemes under this RDP. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In fact, Ireland leads other Member States in terms of our implementation of the Rural Development Programme and currently has the second highest rate of drawn-down of EU funds among all Member States.  The average EU financial rate for draw down\u00a0of funds up to the end of\u00a0December 2017 was 25.9%, whereas Ireland&rsquo;s execution rate was 44.3%.  This progress is testament to the successful roll-out, uptake and implementation of schemes under the Programme to date.<\/p>  <p>  I fully anticipate that based on current up-take and projections, the entire budget allocation of some &euro;4 billion for the Rural Development Programme will be spent and that the entire &euro;2.19 billion of EU co-funding will be drawn down.\u00a0 It is expected that the majority of funds will be spent by the end of 2020, although there will be some carry-over. Under EU regulations governing the Rural Development Programme, funds for multi-annual commitments entered into by the end of 2020 may be claimed up to the end of 2023.\u00a0 RDP spending is\u00a0also subject\u00a0 to the annual estimates process and budgetary rules, but this\u00a0should not affect the overall spend and any\u00a0EAFRD funds unspent in a year are carried forward to subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of RDP participation levels, I am pleased to say that there\u00a0has been \u00a0excellent uptake to date.\u00a0 At this stage of the programme, some multi-annual schemes such as GLAS, BDGP\u00a0and the Organic Farming Schemes are fully subscribed. Other\u00a0schemes such as ANC are applied\u00a0for on an annual basis,\u00a0and others such as TAMS will continue to recruit participants in tranches.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Reaching the targets set out within the RDP is central\u00a0to meeting the objectives of the Programme and to producing the desired results and outcomes. \u00a0It is therefore important that\u00a0progression toward these targets is kept under review. To this end, and in line with\u00a0EU regulatory requirements, my\u00a0Department carries out an annual review of implementation by reporting on indicators collected on all schemes and measures.  This Annual Implementation\u00a0Report,\u00a0and a Citizens Summary on the results of this assessment is, once approved by the Commission, \u00a0published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  We will continue to review the implementation of the programme to ensure that we\u00a0 are on target to meet all identified objectives and that all EU funding is fully drawn down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100072#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Applications","counter":368,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100072#WRG01700"},{"type":"question","counter":369,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[8833\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100072#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding an application for a single farm payment by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":370,"content":"<p>A 2017 Basic Payment Application was received from the person named on 27 April 2017.<\/p><p>Following processing,\u00a0an error was identified\u00a0relating to land that formed part of another applicant's forestry contract.\u00a0 An official of my Department has made direct contact with the person named and outlined the position.\u00a0 My Department\u00a0will pay the\u00a0person named\u00a0on the remaining land pending\u00a0a resolution of the forestry issue.<\/p><p>Payment will issue to the nominated bank account of the person named in the coming days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100072#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100072#WRG02000"},{"type":"question","counter":372,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[8844\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100072#WRG02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive their balancing GLAS payment for 2016; his views on whether it is fair that due to information technology incompetence the person must wait 16 months for their payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":373,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[8845\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100072#WRG02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive their balancing GLAS payment for 2017; his views on whether it is fair that due to information technology incompetence the person must wait 16 months for their payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":374,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 168 together.<\/p><p>The person named was approved into GLAS 1 with a contract commencement date of 1 October 2015 and has received full payments in respect of 2015 and the 2016 scheme advance payment.<\/p><p>The Department is aware of an issue with this case that resulted in the subsequent payments not being made.

Full details can be found in the applicant guidelines. <\/p><p>Of the five strands of funding available, Strands 1 (Early Years) and 4 (School Age) relate specifically to the creation of new childcare places.  In predicting the outcomes of these strands at such an early stage, it is important to note that every application for funding is subject to a number of variables.  For example, for Strand 1 (Early Years), applicants may apply for any amount between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000 in grant funding; for Strand 4 (School Age), the equivalent amount is between &euro;3,000 and &euro;20,000.  Individual projects for these strands can exceed the maximum available grant but evidence of funding for the full project must be demonstrated. <\/p><p>Further to this, there is a large variance in the amount of childcare places that must be created per grant approved under each strand.  In early years services, the age group for which places are being created is a significant factor.  As you will be aware, childcare regulations require different staff ratios and floor-space per child.  This is considered in the design of the Early Years capital programme so that, for example, under Strand 1 (Early Years), applicants must create a minimum of either 3 new places for 0-1 year olds, 5 new places for 1-3 year olds, or 11 new places for ECCE (3-5 year old) children. <\/p><p>For an applicant seeking funding under Strand 4 (School Age), the minimum amount of places to be created is determined by whether the project for which funding is sought is a relocation\/expansion project (11 places), or a new build project (8 places).<\/p><p>At this early stage, and given the variables mentioned above, it is not possible to give an accurate prediction of the amount of new childcare places to be created under the Early Years and School Age Capital programmes in 2018.  In particular, it will not be possible to estimate how many places might be created - and for which age groups - until the appraisal process is concluded in May 2018.  <\/p><p>As the Minister I am committed to continuing to ensure access to high quality and affordable childcare.  To this regard I ensured that childcare capacity was identified as a strategy priority in the recently published National Planning Framework which attracted additional funding of &euro;250m in the National Development Plan.  I am also committed to further research to comprehensively identify the capacity needs of the sector which may emerge over the next decade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100073#WRH03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":446,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100073#WRH04100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Improvement Scheme","counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100073#WRH04000"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[8911\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100073#WRH04100","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"when the &euro;1 million in funding secured for local improvement schemes in County Cork will be made available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1262","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>The Local Improvement Scheme (LIS) is a programme for improvement works on small private\/non public roads and has been funded in the past by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and subsequently by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  <\/p>  <p>  There has been very little funding available for this scheme in recent years due to constraints on public expenditure.

The State is not responsible for funding pension arrangements for such employees even where the companies in question are reliant on State funding.  It is open to individuals to make provision for a pension by way of PRSA which all employers are obliged to facilitate. <\/p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that the issue of CE supervisors&rsquo; pension provision is currently being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  My Department is represented on this group, as are the unions, Pobal and other relevant Government Departments.  <\/p>  <p>  The Forum last met on 23 November 2017 and I understand that a paper outlining the costs involved was presented.  Following on from this, I understand a meeting is being arranged in the coming weeks between the unions and my colleague, Paschal Donoghue T.D., Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/p>  <p>  If circumstances arise where a CE supervisor is made redundant by their employer (the sponsoring organisation), and qualifies for a payment under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2007, the supervisor would be entitled to statutory redundancy at a rate of two weeks&rsquo; pay per year of service, plus a further week&rsquo;s pay (subject to an earnings limit of &euro;600.00 per week).<\/p>  <p>  My Department (and previously F&Aacute;S) have consistently maintained that the only circumstances in which it will fund enhanced redundancy packages to CE supervisors is where the redundancy arises because of the actions of the Department due to restructuring of the CE programme e.g. mainstreaming schools-based CE schemes to the Department of Education in 2001 or the reduction in the overall numbers on CE, such as happened in the late 1990s\/early 2000s due to reduced numbers of long-term unemployed on the Live Register.  Enhanced redundancy packages under the above circumstances were only funded by F&Aacute;S\/DEASP where the sponsor\/employer did not have the ability to fund the enhanced package. <\/p>  <p>  This does not apply where the employer is the instigator of the redundancy e.g. no longer wanting to run the CE scheme, closure due to Company Registration Office strike-off, or where the sponsor organisation does not comply with the terms of their contract (maintain participant numbers etc.) and it is necessary for the Department to discontinue funding for the scheme\/supervisor\/assistant supervisor positions.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has not made a decision to reduce the overall number of CE places or to mainstream CE places in the case of any CE scheme closures in recent times.  Therefore, in these circumstances, there is no liability on my Department to pay enhanced redundancy. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100074#WRJ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","counter":496,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100074#WRJ03200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreshore Issues","counter":495,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100074#WRJ03100"},{"type":"question","counter":496,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[8945\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100074#WRJ03200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a matter will be addressed regarding the purchase of land in the case of persons (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":497,"content":"<p>The\u00a0persons named have made an offer to purchase an area of\u00a0reclaimed foreshore occupied by them for many years without consent.

For the purpose of ensuring consistency in the adoption and implementation of development contribution schemes by local authorities, the guidelines recommended that all local authorities should include a specific waiver for broadband infrastructure (e.g. masts and antennae) in their schemes. <\/p>  <p>  Most development contribution schemes adopted by planning authorities currently provide for such waivers.  In this regard, 23 local authorities have adopted schemes which include a full exemption for broadband infrastructure.  Six local authorities do not specify a waiver for such infrastructure in their current schemes; however, as there is no provision included in their current schemes to charge for telecommunications infrastructure generally, the practice adopted is not to do so.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been engaging with the remaining two local authorities regarding the incorporation of explicit waivers in their schemes.  Both local authorities have since prepared draft schemes that incorporate waivers for broadband infrastructure, which are currently out for public consultation.  Notwithstanding the fact that the adoption of these schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members, I anticipate that these schemes as finally adopted will comply with the 2013 guidelines in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100074#WRJ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water and Sewerage Schemes","counter":501,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100074#WRJ03700"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[8907\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100074#WRJ03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 768 of 6 February 2018, the work in his Department to deal with the problem of residents that live in an end of terrace home in which the private sewage line for a group of houses ends and such residents are continually faced with the problem and expense of having blockages in the line dealt with; if the attention has been drawn to the burden the lack of legislation in this area places upon such persons, the tensions this causes between neighbours and the frequent public health risks that arise in circumstances in which disputes arise; the grants available to persons to deal with such expenses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[9008\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100074#WRJ03900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the powers available to State bodies to take enforcement action against a person that fails to take steps to resolve a sewage leak emanating from their property onto a public footpath or roadway; the State bodies that have such enforcement powers; the specific legal provisions under which enforcement action can be taken; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":504,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 and 216 together.<\/p><p>The Water Services Act of 2007 sets down the obligations and responsibilities of water services authorities and property owners in respect of wastewater infrastructure.
