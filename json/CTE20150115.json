We have a short presentation which deals with the immediate short-term market outlook and looks somewhat into the long term, including the issue of volatility and how it will affect Irish dairying through 2015, in particular.<\/p><p>   I shall give a flavour of the Irish Dairy Board.  The organisation has a turnover of just over &euro;2 billion and we are Ireland's largest dairy exporter.  We export 60% of Irish dairy to over 100 markets around the world which is equivalent to just over 3.3 billion litres.  In EU terms that means we are a sizeable dairy organisation.  About 14,000 dairy farmers on this island depend directly to indirectly, to some degree, on the fortunes of the Irish Dairy Board and the returns it makes for Irish farmers.<\/p><p>  We have a team of 3,100 professionals scattered around the globe who sell premium Irish dairy.  We have been established since 1961 as a State organisation, as members will know.  That means we have over 50 years experience marketing Irish dairy around the globe.  We are an organisation of brands but we have an ingredient business as well.  Possibly our best known brand is Kerrygold but it is not our only brand.  Kerrygold has achieved the No. 1 position for imported butter in Germany with a significant market share and earns a serious premium in Germany and in the USA.  <\/p> <p>In Germany and the USA, it is also the No. 1 imported butter with sales at retail level of over &euro;500 million.  Other significant brands in the business are Pilgrims Choice, which has achieved the No. 2 cheddar cheese brand position in the UK and is a significant outlet for Irish dairy.  Moo is a brand aimed at younger consumers in the UK, which is performing well, and Beo is a brand we sell on the African continent.  We also have an ingredient business which is business-to-business with significant global food manufacturers and dairy customers around the world.  That ingredient business accounts for approximately one third of our &euro;2 billion turnover.  That is a little about the Irish Dairy Board itself.  A little about the journey we have been on over the past two and a half to three years follows.<\/p> <p> In mid-2012, drought in New Zealand dampened milk supply while Chinese demand began to ramp up and we saw the impact of that coming into dairy prices.  Chinese buying began to take off in mid-to-late 2013 due to low domestic milk production and foot and mouth issues eliminating herds in China.  Prices began to drop sharply following a boom in supply.  Every milk production region in the world responded to higher demand from China and some other milk consumption regions.  We had a perfect storm of good weather and good prices driving milk production in every region in the world.  In late 2014, Chinese demand had dropped to very low levels while the Russian ban came into place.  That meant that two of the top five dairy importers in the world were, in effect, out of the market.  It affected sentiment at buyer level very significantly but also had a real impact on market prices.  We have seen market prices fall right through the second half of 2014.<\/p> <p> Volatility in general in our view is supply side, or milk supply side, driven.  Prices in the mid-to-high 30 cent per litre range are not sustainable in the long term.  We say that for the foreseeable future because \"never\" is a long time.  For the foreseeable future, prices at that level are not sustainable for two reasons in the main.  First, they drive milk supply around the world to excessive levels.  When milk supply gets ahead of global demand, we see downward pressure on prices.  Second, they constrain demand growth in that they become affordability issues for consumers in many international markets.  Markets have become more volatile since the complete deregulation of CAP about ten years ago.  Volatility normally originates from the supply side with weather being a key driver.  Weather drove milk supply through late 2013 and right through 2014 and has been a key catalyst in getting us to where we are today.  Obviously, currency, energy supply and demand, biofuel versus conventional fuels, geopolitical events such as those I have outlined with the Russian ban, and the pace of global economic growth and growth in emerging markets play into the volatility agenda also.<\/p> <p> The outlook for 2015 is that we see a very difficult year ahead from a farming point of view.  We have had record global milk output growth through 2014 of approximately 5.5% driving high stocks, particularly in whole milk powder and cheese.  Slowing demand from Russia and China, two of the globe's top dairy import markets, has weakened sentiment and prices.  Milk output has continued its momentum into 2015 despite the downward sentiment and some downward impact on prices.  Milk prices in the EU and Ireland today have not reflected where markets are at for a number of reasons.  Today, the global dairy trade auction run by Fonterra from New Zealand would return a price for Irish milk in cent per litre terms of just over 20 cent.  Today, milk prices in Ireland are approximately 30 cent.  Spot milk, if one is unlucky and does not have a customer or contract for it in the EU, is 24 to 25 cent.  Milk output in Ireland and through much of the EU continues to be quite strong because milk prices to farmers are not at those spot levels - the global dairy trade levels - yet.  Many of us, including IDB, have a market strategy which has allowed us to deliver better returns to farmers than the spot market, as I will go on to outline.<\/p> <p> Current market sentiment is not in a good place although it has improved somewhat in recent weeks since year end.  We can cover that in more detail during questions.  Buyers have moved from more strategic long-term purchasing to tactical buying, taking very short-term decision and very short contracts.  All sellers of dairy products are concerned about stock build, particularly in some commodities like whole milk powder and cheese.  As with a car dealership, if one has stock, it is not getting more valuable at this point.  Milk prices are lagging product prices by about three months because of contractual situations.  As such, farmers have yet to see the full impact of even contracts done in the second half of 2014.  Our prediction is that the market will remain week until milk supply puts the brakes on and is constrained and, or, there is an uplift in demand following a Russian return to the market or improved demand from China.  There are some signs of stability coming into the market place albeit at very low levels and small levels of trade.<\/p> <p> In the medium to long term, we are still very positive on dairying.  However, people need to eat in the short term and farmers and everybody else in the supply chain needs to get through this difficult market situation.  We see a stabilisation occurring later in the year and a return to sustainable levels for both the farmer and the consumer.  We are in the middle of the supply chain.  At one end we have a farmer who would like sustained and high prices while at the other we have a consumer or customer who would like sustained and low prices.  Marrying those is not an easy task.  China will return to the market and Russian should stabilise over time, although that is possibly a more difficult one.  The marginal costs of milk production are high around the world.  We are one of the lower cost production regions in Ireland because of our grass and comparative advantage in producing milk from it.  Where costs are higher, milk production will be choked off before it gets to very low levels.  The exceptionally good weather conditions we have had right through 2014 in all major milk producing regions are unlikely to persist for the long term.  Where one takes a five-year view, consistency does not come in weather any more than it comes in milk prices.  We have relatively low levels of milk production and low levels of farmer debt.  Of our farms, 60% have no or low levels of debt, which is a good position to be in facing into the challenges we have ahead.<\/p> <p> In the long term, our outlook is positive.  The population will continue to grow around the world to 8.5 billion or thereabouts by 2025 and will be 9 billion by 2050.  The emerging market economies where IDB has had a very strong focus over the last number of years, including the continent of Africa, Russia, and China, will deliver growth.  The growth will not be in Ireland or Europe, it will be in the emerging market economies.  As diets in these economies become more westernised and people incorporate more protein, we expect good demand and growth for dairy.<\/p> <p>Also, across the world, we are seeing more focus on nutrition for active aging and all other life stages, as well as sports nutrition, which is quite positive for dairy.<\/p><p> As I stated earlier, if the Irish Dairy Board, IDB, sold all its milk on the Global Dairy Trade, GDT, auction, it would see a return to the farmer of 20 cent per litre.  Our strategy has been different in building brands to help sustain our prices in times like this.  We are developing value-added and differentiated ingredients which is a hand-to-hand business with key dairy and food companies across the world.  The IDB has been diversifying markets.  Over the past five years, the UK, Germany and the US have been core markets but we have invested in Saudi Arabia, made acquisitions in Spain and elsewhere, as well as placing sales teams in Russia, Africa and China.  We are active in selling forward on financial markets but there is limited liquidity in this area in Europe.  The board is one of the larger traders on the Eurex Exchange.  We do much contract management with customers which includes fixed-price milk schemes and stock management.  There is a limit, however, to the extent that this can be useful.  Most customers do not want to contract all of their requirements and most farmers do not want to contract all of their milk.  Contracting has a role, however, in protecting the entire supply chain from volatility.  Ireland is more exposed to volatility than most.  We export nine out of every ten litres we produce.  Ireland has four times greater exposure to world markets than other European dairy companies because of our need to export.  There are also logistical costs involved in exporting that a typical Dutch, French or German dairy company would not have.<\/p><p> The board&rsquo;s aim is to pay the best achievable prices.  Performance on milk prices and gross returns is measured by the purchase price index, an index of the basket of return for all products the IDB buys.  This is benchmarked against the prices of 18 of the top EU dairy companies.  We had a record year in 2014 for product price.  Product purchases and exports were up 16%, some 41,000 tonnes, important as farmers and members gear up for life after quotas in April.  The IDB will pay a record bonus for 2014 of &euro;11 million to its members, up 12% year on year.  While our 2014 results have not been finalised, it will have been a good year for profitability.  This is important to the IDB, its stakeholders and funders.  It also facilitates significant working capital availability to the industry of &euro;300 million.<\/p><p> The industry is, unfortunately, facing into a significant superlevy bill.  Due to high milk prices, farmers kept producing.  My own co-op, Aurivo, is facing a significant superlevy bill as is every other co-op.  It will be potentially one of the highest ever imposed.  This needs to be reduced in any way possible.  The GDT price is 20 cent per litre.  Intervention prices would return 20 cent per litre.  We have got support from the Minister on the introduction of market support measures that would send a signal that the baseline should be higher than 20 cent a litre which would be tremendously useful.  We urge that intervention support should be set at levels more reflective of production costs.  While the European Commission would have an objection to that, it needs to be more reflective of reality of dairying today, namely somewhere in the mid-20s.<\/p><p> As trade deals are negotiated by key trading blocs, it is important the EU moves at pace on it and preferential access to key markets around the world is put in place.  The support from successive Governments for the IDB in communicating the grass-fed and premium qualities of Irish dairy products in markets around the world is always appreciated and hopefully will continue.<\/p><p> Market volatility is a reality of competing in global markets, particularly when we need to export 90% of our dairy product off the island.  We have a difficult year ahead but the medium to long-term outlook remains positive.  The IDB has strategies in place to best manage volatility and will continue to pay its members a leading product price.  It is working with one of the leading brokerages on the Eurex Exchange to see what else can be introduced to the Irish market to insulate farmers and processors from volatility.<\/p><p> Our ambition for Irish dairy across global markets is great.  Over the past 18 months, up to 40 trade team members have gone off to fly the flag for Irish dairy in various markets around the world.  When we get to the other side of this difficult year, there will be positive outcomes from that work.  We count on the Government&rsquo;s support to ensure EU policies work for us.  As a team, we are building a robust and valuable diversified asset for the Irish dairy industry and its 14,000 farmers that will deliver strong sustainable medium-term and long-term returns.  We are confident the global markets we are building will generate strong and sustainable returns for Irish farmers.  There are short-term difficulties because supply of milk has outpaced demand, which, unfortunately, has gone in the opposite direction.  We believe the fundamentals are there to pick this up again later in 2015.  All involved, from the supply chain to the processor must ensure we have a business that can come through these difficult times.  Thankfully, 2013 and 2014 have been good strong years for milk prices, averaging at 39 cent per litre.  We face into the upcoming challenges in good shape and, hopefully, will come through in late 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015011500003#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aaron Forde","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421318100,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Forde for his interesting and comprehensive presentation.  It was very useful.  I have a few questions in order to get clarification on issues.  Mr. Forde said the Irish price at the moment is about 30 cent per litre.  The spot market price is quoted at 24 cent per litre.  He said that the New Zealand world price was 20 cent per litre.  Would he be able to hazard a guess as to where the Irish price, on present trends, will fall?  How far can we sustain the differential by targeted marketing, premium products and so on?<\/p><p>  The big concern at the moment is that there has been expansion in dairy product and in production.  Presumably, some farmers have been doing this on the back of retained profits, have a lot of experience and very high productivity and will weather whatever storm comes because they have seen this coming and going in the past.  However, are there farmers who have got into dairying, quota levels and so on, or who have been involved in major expansion in anticipation of the end of quotas and who have borrowed very significant amounts of money?  One might say that the sustainability level in Ireland is x cent per litre and, on average, that might be true.  However, have we any idea how many farmers are above that because of commitments made, namely, overheads, borrowing commitments and so on?  These farmers might not be the most efficient or have the greatest experience.  Do we know, as the price comes down, how many farmers are likely to get into financial trouble?  Does the industry have a plan in place to try to assist these farmers and to avoid suddenly facing a crisis?  Such a crisis might not affect all farmers but it might affect a reasonable number, particularly those who expanded too rapidly.  Like many industries, when things were going well, there was a lot of talk about getting in more, producing more and borrowing more.  As the price comes down, what is the tipping point at which we are going to see significant numbers of farmers getting into trouble?  <\/p><p>  Mr. Forde mentioned that marginal costs of production are lower here than they are internationally.  Would it be possible to quantify this?  Is it two cent per litre or three cent per litre?  What is the difference resulting from the natural advantages we have with grass?  This would give us some measure of how we can take a hit in terms of a change in the global price and how sensitive it is to price.  <\/p><p>  Will the reduction in energy costs have an upside or a benefit?  Taking in the whole industry, is that significant?  Taking it from grass production through to getting it on the market, how much will it be a counterbalance or does it have any significance at all?  On mitigation, at the end of the day we are an Oireachtas committee and a big part of our role is to get information but what are the things we can do or what are the things, politically, that could be done?  <\/p><p>  I was interested in what Mr. Forde said about the superlevy penalty because I queried the Minister a few times about this.  He seems to think the best he was able to achieve or was going to be able to achieve would be a deferral of the superlevy penalty.  I know that the witnesses collectively, and as individual co-operatives, etc., have a lot of contacts in Brussels.  Do they think there is a realistic possibility of getting the superlevy reduced?  It seems to me to be farcical.  There was some talk about the butter fat content and so on.  Could the witnesses clarify what angle we should be pushing?  What case should we make to the Minister?  Is it on how it is measured as a superlevy or just a reduction of the superlevy? <\/p><p>  The second issue Mr. Forde mentioned is that intervention at 20 cent per litre is too low and that it would have to relate to production costs.  This goes back to my previous question on the marginal production costs.  In the Irish context, what would that have to be, give or take?  I will not hold the witnesses to the last cent but it would be important to give us the figure in ballpark terms. <\/p><p>  We often talk about the promotion and maintenance of Irish agriculture products, whether it is beef or dairy, because it is grass-based.  Is it sufficient for us to continue just to say it is grass-based?  Does that suffice in the market?  Will the day come when we will have to define what grass-based production or largely grass-based production is in order to reassure the market?  Is that an issue we should be looking at in the medium term? Should we be saying that there will be a definition?  There is a definition of organic farming.  Do we need a definition and if so, would it be beneficial in the longer term?  Should we have a certified definition of grass-based production to which a farmer could adhere? A person could then put a certificate on his or her product knowing no one else can claim to be doing it this way if he or she is not actually doing it the same way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015011500006#J00100","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1421318100,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I also welcome the delegation here today and thank them for the very informative presentation.  This is going to be the big agricultural story of the year.  The superlevy is going to be the number one difficulty starting off the year.  The witnesses are right to point out that we are facing huge penalties and unfortunately those who are going to be penalised are more than likely those who are depending on a drive in milk production in the next number of years in particular.  If they are going to be facing these serous penalties, we are at a very delicate starting point.  Something has to be done.  To follow on from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's point, deferral rather than reduction is not going to sort out this problem.  How do we get around this issue and the difficulties that we seem to be having and which have been outlined by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v?  Are we the only country experiencing this issue?  Are there other options we could be looking at with regard the reduction of the penalty?<\/p><p>  We seem to have been continuously facing penalties over the past years and this year seems to be the worst year ever.  Would that be correct?  Over the past years there would have been substantial penalties but this year the penalty seems to be the most substantial to date.  Are we being penalised now, or potentially being penalised now, because of our faults in the past and because we have not been hitting our quota or thereabouts?  We have been over the quota and because we have been over the quota continuously, and the pressure is coming now, are we being excluded from support at EU level?<\/p><p>  There was a statement made about too much production internationally.  We are going to have a 50% increase in production in Ireland, we are set for that and we have all been talking about it for the past years.  How do we square that circle?  If we increase production we will immediately drive down prices.  Supply and demand always results in the same outcome.  How are we going to balance that equation?  This is the big question we need to address and there needs to be more discussion on this.  <\/p><p>  On the price range, the witnesses spoke about the spot price and the actual price at the moment, which is 20 cent per litre.  The witnesses spoke about the cost of production.  We have a low base cost in Ireland, given our grass-based production and so forth. but unfortunately, we do not produce all our milk off grass.  There was a discussion here prior to Christmas with regard the liquid milk for example.  At 20 cent per litre, we will not have liquid milk production in Ireland.  It is as simple as that.  It would not be possible.  Gone are the days when it was a hobby to turn in the cow's milk and a person would get 20 cent per litre, with an expression of appreciation and a request to do the same the following year.  This will not happen.  How are we going to overcome that issue?<\/p> <p>That is the big challenge we will face in the new term post-2015 and it is a longer term challenge.  The issues will balance out in terms of where we are in the world market.  The bigger challenge for Ireland will be the cost of liquid milk production going forward over the next period, and not just in the short-term.  That big issue needs to be tackled in some form or another.  Are there plans to deal with it?  I would like to hear the view of the board' on the matter.<\/p><p> As the delegation rightly said, consumers always want value for money.  However, quality was not mentioned.  The quality of milk here is as good as anywhere else, an aspect which should be sold to consumers.  I like to think that consumers will always opt for quality rather than a cheaper offering.  In my opinion as a milk producer, we have substantiality increased the quality of milk over the past 20 years and now test for everything and anything.  Obviously the producer must bear some of the  cost.  We should make more of our quality product.  We are not doing enough to promote the quality aspect.  Perhaps, due to the recession, consumers will opt for a cheaper product but it is not always the best product.  <\/p><p> As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned, volatility in prices is the biggest issue to face the dairy industry for the next period.  Can the board state what it believes will be the average price-range for the next five years?  In 2008, a specialised dairy farmer's average income was &euro;45,000 per year but within a year it fell to &euro;23,000 which was almost a 50% decrease.  A number of farmers have invested substantially and are investing substantially.  I am afraid they will get into serious financial difficulty trying to meet the liabilities generated by such investment, be it increased numbers or increased infrastructure.  My comment follows on from the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.<\/p><p> Earlier it was stated that only 60% of farmers have no or low debt levels.  Is that an old percentage figure?  What is it based on?  The reason I ask is because farmers, in the past year or two, have invested substantially and had to borrow.  I do not mean to be alarmist but a 50% reduction in farmers' income is similar to what happened when the construction bubble burst.  We need to address the matter and make plans.  Are there plans to tackle the matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015011500006#J00200","speaker":"968","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421318700,"counter":13,"content":"<p>There is a vote in the D&aacute;il but I shall allow Deputy Penrose to contribute if he so wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015011500007#K00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1421318700,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Forde for his informative and comprehensive presentation.  He outlined the stark reality facing dairy farmers in the next year or so.  Some months ago I read, with deep apprehension, about what lies ahead for people who have recently entered the dairy industry.  A lot of people are availing of the abolition of the quotas and everything else and existing farmers are planning ahead, all of which will increase the level of production.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Deering has rightly stated, 60% of farmers have manageable debts but 40% of farmers will have challenging debts.  One of the big issues is the cost of funds in Ireland when compared with the ECB rate and the differential margin charged by the associated banks and other lenders.  The Government must look to funds being made available to the farming industry by a strategic investment bank or somebody else, but particularly to the dairy industry in the years ahead.<\/p><p>  Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Deering are correct that the years ahead will be very challenging and competitive.  We are in the midst of a perfect storm.  We have had a very significant increase in supply at our own level but we must get rid of 90%.  There is also a declining world market as evidenced by the reference made to the Fonterra 20 cent market.  We are heading towards an equilibrium price which is what the board is trying to achieve but I am worried that some farmers have not paid attention.  I have read that some of them will plough ahead but I think they should hasten slowly.  That is my advice to farmers and I used to deal with a lot of them.  <\/p><p>  There must be a reduction in the superlevy but there is a pathological resistance to doing so at EU level.  We debated this matter here intensely about 12 months ago but nothing has moved.  Unless there is a move this matter will form part of the perfect storm.  Everything else has fallen and now the superlevy will be removed as well.  It is the worst confluence of circumstances to face the industry.  <\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made a point about grass-based production.  I agree with what Deputy Deering said about quality.  I agree with him that quality is critical, that people pay more for quality and that we should promote our quality product.

New Zealand is quite similar in population size to Ireland, albeit in the middle of nowhere, but it has commandeered the Chinese market.  It now has 30% of the world's dairy.  Is the IDB collaborating with it?  Has the IDB, for want of a better word, poached some of Fonterra's best minds?  Surely that must be in Mr. Forde's vision for the future of the IDB?  How is Fonterra making a profit at the prices it is receiving?  The IDB has better brands, even from where it is starting.

Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked where we predict the price to fall to. While there is always some reluctance to make these predictions in markets, as is the case when prices are on the way up, most commentary predicts an average price for the year of somewhere in the region of 26 to 28 cent including VAT.  We fall in that range according to where we see markets today.<\/p><p>  In terms of how many farmers we see to be in financial difficulty, that picture is not visible at this point.  Perhaps groups like Teagasc have a better handle on it.  In Auriva we have a farm profitability programme in place where we work with people who are not in difficulty but who want to make their enterprises more efficient, whether they are milking 40 cows and just want to make more money out of those 40 cows, are new entrants at any level, or want to expand.  Many co-operatives around the country have similar programmes in place.  Our aim is to make each of those farm enterprises more sustainable and see their way through difficult years like this.  Whatever stage in the supply chain one is at, whether at the farm production end, the processing end, or the customer end, one's business must get more and more efficient and sustainable year-on-year, given the increased volatility we are all experiencing.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's third question concerned the marginal cost of production.  Teagasc has quantified that at an average of 26 cent per litre.  That is from farms which do profit monitors, which not all do, and there is a range up and down from that.  There are farms that have their cost base quite a bit lower than that and there are some higher than that, but that is where it is.<\/p> <p>I will ask Mr. Condon to deal with the question about energy costs.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015011500008#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aaron Forde","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421319600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>The reduction in energy costs is quite a complex question because it has three different impacts.  The first is that it reduces the cost of production so it reduces the cost of producing milk for the farmer.  It is a major input into what we call \"the three F's\" - feed, fertiliser and fuel.  The negative element associated with that is the fact that it has much more of an impact in production systems with a high variable cost base.  For example, a US factory farmer will benefit far more from a low fuel price than an Irish farmer who is producing off grass.<\/p><p>  The second impact is on demand in developing countries.  If one looks at some of these big dairy importing countries such as Venezuela, Algeria or indeed Russia, one can see that they are very heavily dependent on oil dollars.  Generally speaking, a low oil price is demand-negative in developing markets.  However, in developed markets where a lot of energy is imported, a low oil price generally gives a boost to domestic demand and is demand-positive.  When one graphs energy prices and dairy prices, they are very closely positively correlated so in general, lower energy prices lead to lower dairy prices.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015011500009#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Condon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421319600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms Randles to answer a number of questions led by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.

The great thing about Irish butter, which we can compare to continental or American butter, is that it is softer and more spreadable than other butters, it has a lovely golden colour whereas other butters have a white colour, and it tastes lovely and creamy compared to other butters.  What we have tried to do is brand that under the Kerrygold brand and extract a premium from the market for that.  I believe this is where we have the leverage and where we have seen massive success.  Over a third of the product we currently buy goes out under the Kerrygold brand and this generates a significant premium in the market.  Our plan and our investments are aimed at increasing that proportion year on year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015011500010#O01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Condon"},{"type":"speech","time":1421320200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Are the quality standards we have in Ireland ahead of the European standards and how do they compare with New Zealand standards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015011500010#O01200","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1421320200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien asked about the price New Zealanders can take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015011500010#O01300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421320200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>In terms of the technical standards of that product, they are very similar.

We can only take it from the market perspective, although there is another side, which is the cost of production.  From a market perspective, we see markets functioning in an appropriate way when milk prices are between 28 cent and 32 cent per litre.  At that level, generally speaking, a reasonably efficient farmer can make a decent living and, generally speaking, it is a reasonably affordable level that allows developing world demand growth at an acceptable level.<\/p> <p>The only other point I would make is that, particularly at the low end, it looks very lean compared to the average cost of production, which was discussed earlier.

Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien asked our views on Fonterra.  Not all of them are for publication here.  The Irish and New Zealand industries started at a point in our journey 30 years ago with similar output levels.  We entered the quota system which put a regulatory cap on our output.  Fonterra drove on and now processes 17 billion to 18 billion litres of milk in New Zealand and almost 20 billion litres in various other parts of the world while we are at 5.7 billion litres, which is similar to where we were when we entered the quota system.  Fonterra has had major opportunities to grow.  Structurally, it was very different in the past.  There were three big dairy companies, which have since morphed into one.  This mirrors a trend of consolidation in global dairy, including here in Ireland to some degree, albeit slower.  Fonterra has significant scale in world dairy.<\/p><p>  IDB is not small.  We are the market facing arm of 60% of Ireland&rsquo;s dairy, comprising 3.3 billion litres.  We are significant and have good relationships with Fonterra.  We regularly meet it and all the other significant dairy actors on the global stage.  We collaborate with them by exploring projects in markets in which we might potentially have synergies, for example if another company has strengths and we are not so strong.  A number of projects are ongoing with global players, which is healthy.  When we were in a no-growth scenario from a volume point of view it made sense to do much of our business from an Irish base.  Now that we are in a growth scenario we have packed 36 of the brightest and best we can out of Ireland, some of whom came from other dairy companies, including Fonterra.  We have a team of very good people.<\/p><p>  Fonterra is returning what the market delivers to it through the Global Dairy Trade, GDT, auction, and eight or nine months ago it had a view that the GDT was the best thing that ever happened to New Zealand dairy farmers.  I am not sure that is its view today.  An auction system which it runs for a large portion of its output it amplifies volatility on the way up, but also on the way down.  Our strategy of investing in brands, markets, people and innovation delivers a much more stable income to dairy farmers over time.<\/p><p>  The Chairman asked about the 40,000 tonnes of additional product.  In 2013, IDB had more demand for dairy than supply, particularly butter, because of the good work being done in many of our growth markets.  Thankfully, much of that 41,000 tonnes of extra product, an increase of 16%, has not posed any difficulty and we have been able to place it in markets and deliver returns in line with our EU peers in the industry.<\/p><p>  IDB looks at acquisitions from one of two points of view, either as a route to market or as a route to value.  A route to market would be a business in an overseas jurisdiction that can take Irish cheese, butter or milk powder and put it under a brand or has relationships with customers or facilities that can further process it and deliver tonnes of Irish dairy into the market.  A route to value would be a business that can take some Irish dairy, not necessarily a lot, but has a good brand or customer relationship or it is in a market in which we want to grow that will deliver value in terms of profitability home to the parent for distribution back to the members.<\/p><p>  I will give examples of four recent acquisitions.  In 2013 we acquired a company in Saudi Arabia called Al Wazeen Trading.  We are constructing a facility there to produce soft white cheese under patented technology developed with Teagasc and we are very excited about the prospects of the Saudi acquisition as a hub into the developing markets of the Middle East.  In Spain we acquired a cheese business and established IDB Espana, which will deliver a good route to market for casein, cheese and powdered dairy ingredients.  As a bolt-on to our dairy ingredient business in the UK, Adams Food Ingredients, we acquired a company called FoodTec, which will take us further up the value chain and deliver synergies to our ingredient business there.  In the US, we acquired the remaining stake in Meadow Ingredients, a cheese ingredient business that is profitable in a growing market for IDB.<\/p><p>  The issue of support measures was raised.  We were thinking more in terms of trade agreements and Ms Randles will deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015011500011#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aaron Forde"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421320800,"counter":67,"content":"<p>As our chairman said, one of the key focuses of our strategic plan over the past three years has been to grow new markets for the additional product that will come on line.  We are working in a very low-margin business and any differential we face in terms of market access, particularly in terms of tariffs, can have a very disproportionate effect on our competitiveness in a third country market.  China is the major focus in this regard.  As Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien said, New Zealand has a free trade agreement with China which has allowed it to grow business substantially there.  The fact that New Zealand enters the Chinese market with zero or very low average tariff levels gives it a very beneficial strategic advantage over us in one of our most important third country markets.  We have been dealing with this, and it is not easy.  We were disappointed that Australia has also negotiated a free trade agreement with China to give it comparable market entry conditions to New Zealand.  It puts us on the back foot again.<\/p><p>  There is an element of frustration at a European and an Irish level, given that our focus is on third country market development, that China is not on the list of countries with which the European Commission is prepared to negotiate a free trade agreement.  There will be no opportunity in the short to medium term for us to gain similar market access to the most important import market in the world for dairy products.  This must be addressed in some form.  If there is not to be a free trade agreement across all products, is there any opportunity to differentiate and negotiate just on dairy or agri-foods?  Standing back and saying it will not happen is frustrating for us.<\/p> <p>It is not acceptable in the longer term.  We ask the Irish authorities and the Government to see what can be done in that regard.<\/p><p> In terms of market access, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, negotiations with the USA are crucial for the development of business for the Irish dairy industry as well.  We have had phenomenal success with Kerrygold in the US and we have grown that brand substantially.  On foot of many of the issues we have discussed already in terms of promoting Irish dairy, its points of differentiation and grass-based production, particularly on the branded side, we foresee enormous benefits and opportunities to grow that business.  It is a premium branded business for Irish dairying and it is a key and mature market that can take a significant amount of additional branded business.  We would strongly support the swift conclusion of those negotiations and, hopefully, quite ambitious market access for dairy products into the US.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015011500011#P00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Randles","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421321400,"counter":69,"content":"<p>You asked about China and Russia, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015011500012#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aaron Forde"},{"type":"speech","time":1421321400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Some of it has been answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015011500012#Q00300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421321400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Yes.

It appears to have created a big difference between dairy farming in the North and in the South, which shows in the liquid milk market.  It also appears to have had the effect of depressing the price because the larger farmers increased their production.  One would expect that since the farms are more northerly than the southern counties of this State they would not have any reduced natural production costs as they have a shorter growing season.  Has the experience been that one gets what I call treadmill farming?  In other words, one increases one's production, the price drops and one ends up trying to just keep the cash flow going.  One is selling the product to make sure one gets rid of it.  Has that been the net effect of what happened with, effectively, the abolition of quotas in Northern Ireland?

Today's agenda is item No.1, a discussion with Professor Patrick Honohan on the report for the Minister for Finance by the Governor of the Central Bank entitled The Irish Banking Crisis, Regulatory and Financial Stability Policy 2003 - 2008.  I welcome everyone to the third public hearing of this committee and, in particular, I welcome the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan.<\/p><p>The tenth Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, Professor Patrick Honohan, was appointed on 26 September 2009.  Before his appointment as Governor, he was professor of international financial economics and development at Trinity College, Dublin, from 2007.  Prior to this, he spent almost a decade at the World Bank where he was senior adviser on financial sector policy.  He was previously a research professor with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, economic adviser to the former Taoiseach, the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald, and spent several years as an economist at the Central Bank of Ireland and at the International Monetary Fund, IMF.  A graduate of University College Dublin, UCD, he received his PhD in economics from the London School of Economics in 1978.  He has taught economics at the London School of Economics, the University of California, San Diego, the Australian National University, UCD and Trinity College, Dublin.  In recent years his research has mainly focused on monetary and financial sector policy.  <\/p><p>In February 2010, the then Minister for Finance, the late former Deputy Brian Lenihan, requested the Governor of the Central Bank to conduct a preliminary investigation into the performance of the respective functions of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator over the period from the establishment of the Financial Regulator to the end of September 2008.  Governor Honohan's report was published at the end of May 2010.  It is important to remind the committee that Professor Honohan is here to discuss his report alone.  We will have an opportunity to discuss other matters with him, including the bank bailout, during the next phase of the inquiry which will commence in April 2015, at which time we expect the Governor to appear before this committee again. <\/p><p>I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, he is protected by absolute privilege in respect of his evidence to this committee.  However, if he is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continues to so do, he is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and is asked to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. <\/p><p>I now invite Professor Honohan to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015011500002#A00100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421280000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>The report that I submitted to the Minister for Finance in May 2010, entitled The Irish Banking Crisis, Regulatory and Financial Stability Policy 2003-2008 responded to a request by him for a &quot;preliminary investigation of the performance of the respective functions of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator&quot; over that period.  Drawing on internal files as well as interviews with key officials, the report was able to provide answers to two questions.  First, why was the danger from the emerging imbalances in the financial system that led to the crisis not identified more clearly and earlier and headed off through decisive measures? Second, when the crisis began to break, were the best containment measures adopted?  The report noted the relevance of factors other than the performance of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, including the performance of directors and senior management at the banks, their auditors and accountants as well as pro-cyclical elements of Government policy.  However, in line with the terms of reference, it focused on the design of micro-prudential aspects, the approach to overall financial stability and the failure to undertake decisive and effective remedial measures.<br\/><br\/>The report runs to 130 pages, as members know, so what follows is very telegraphic.  As far as micro-prudential policy is concerned, the supervisors did not accumulate enough relevant information for several reasons, the first being an excessive reliance on a regulatory philosophy that implicitly trusted that well-governed banks could be relied upon to remain safe and sound.  This approach emphasised process over outcomes and downplayed the quantification of risk.  The second reason was a deficiency in skills and staff resources.  There should have been a greater degree of intrusiveness and assertiveness and a less deferential approach to the banking industry.  This would have disrupted the pattern of inconclusive engagement with the banks, a pattern which spilled over into the macro-prudential area, reflected in the fact that the belated and relatively modest tightening in 2006 of capital requirements for high loan-to-value mortgages was adopted only after prolonged and agonised debate.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of the analysis of systemic risks, the language of successive published financial stability reports was too reassuring, representing a triumph of hope over reality.  Much has been made of the institutional separation of the regulatory authority from the rest of the Central Bank.  The 2003 legislation that did that created the risk of ambiguity with regard to which entities were responsible for what.  Certainly communication between the macro-economic specialists assessing systemic risks and the micro-prudential supervisors dealing with individual banks was not fully effective.  Each side subsequently felt that they would have acted more vigorously had they been more aware of what the other knew.  That probably reflected a lack of mutual understanding of the methodology and professional language as between economists and supervisors more than the institutional separation, which was by no means rigid.  In the end, senior officials in both institutions or both parts of the institution, as well as many elsewhere, both at home and abroad, were too optimistic about the strength of the economy and the Irish banks.  One should recall that several other central banks and financial regulatory authorities suffered similar failures in the run up to the crisis.  However, with the exception of Iceland, they had not allowed the scale of their banking systems to get so completely out of control as happened in Ireland.  <br\/><br\/>The report's section on crisis containment includes an assessment of the 29 September 2008 decision to guarantee substantially all of the liabilities of the banks.  While several other countries followed suit in subsequent days with more limited guarantees, the guaranteeing of subordinated debt of the banks was clearly a mistake.  The formal guarantee, backed by legislation, of all long-dated debt was also unnecessary and bound to constrain the authorities' ability to restructure or wind down failed banks before the expiry of the initial guarantee.  That is the best summary I can give of that but I am sure that members will want to discuss it in more detail.<br\/><br\/>With the benefit of hindsight, had the regulatory authorities had any notion that heavy losses - or rather such heavy losses - could be involved, an alternative strategy, as mentioned in a footnote in the report, of putting Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society into liquidation on 29 September while standing behind the rest of the system should have been more favourably considered.  I am not saying that it should have been done but it should have been more favourably considered given how resistant external authorities subsequently proved to be to the imposition of losses on unguaranteed senior bank debt of failed banks.  External partners might, at that moment, have responded to such an idea with compromise proposals that might have alleviated subsequent pressures on the Irish Exchequer.  More generally, greater consultation with EU partners would have been highly desirable and could have helped Ireland to be less on the back foot in subsequent negotiations.<br\/><br\/>Despite the passage of time, I have seen no reason to alter the assessments I made in May 2010.  Obviously there are a few bits and pieces that one might add but overall, there is no reason to alter the assessments.  I wish to add a footnote here on costs.  At the time of the report, only a broad indication of the potential fiscal costs could be attempted, given the unprecedented scale of troubled loans and the fact that so few had yet been worked through.  At that point in May 2010, only a handful of NAMA&rsquo;s loan purchases had been priced, for example, and there were other complexities.  Even now, five years later, a precise estimate is not yet possible.  Current valuations of the State&rsquo;s banking shares suggesting a figure for the net long-term fiscal costs of bank recapitalisation of the order of 22% of 2008 GDP may be compared with the phrase, &ldquo;in excess of 15%&rdquo; used in that report.  Moreover, the latest figure of 22% still is within the maximum of the range I conjectured here in this room before an Oireachtas committee hearing in the summer of 2009, before I became Governor.  Consequently, broadly speaking, even in that case I do not really need to make a substantial alteration of the assessment.  We could talk again about costs as the costs of the crisis are much bigger than the costs simply of the bank recapitalisation.<br\/><br\/>Accordingly, extensive changes have taken place within the Central Bank, in view of those conclusions, to ensure that identified shortcomings have been removed as far as possible.  While not strictly the topic for today&rsquo;s hearing, if I may I wish to include some words on this point for completeness.  On institutional reform in the Central Bank since 2009, the 2010 legislation, that is, the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, confirmed the reintegration of the regulatory and supervisory apparatus fully within the Central Bank.  The separate authority was abolished and its powers transferred to what used to be the board but now is the renamed Central Bank Commission, with most regulatory powers delegated to the deputy governor financial regulation.  The legislation also introduced some changes, including a clearer definition of the goals of the Central Bank.  Extensive actions were launched to enhance the Central Bank&rsquo;s capacity and ensuring its delivery of an intrusive and effective risk-based financial supervision, as well as a proactive approach to systemic financial stability policy.  These have been addressing, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the identified issues of insufficient co-operation and limited communication between different divisions and sections, an unduly hierarchical structure and deference to authority and a reluctance to carry decisions to conclusions and effective action.  There have been significant changes in the policy approach.  For example, banking is no longer de facto exempt from enforcement actions as it was in practice before 2008.  Banks now know that regulatory breaches leave them open to penalties.  Thanks to the new legislation, the Central Bank&rsquo;s focus no longer is blurred by the potentially conflicting objective of developing the financial services industry.  There has been substantial expansion of staff on supervision and regulation, responding both to objective assessment against comparators that more staffing was needed and to public demand that underachievement could not be tolerated.  This included injecting new energy and a fresh approach by opening up the numerous senior appointments that needed to be made to candidates outside of the bank.<br\/><br\/>I will not elaborate here on the additional powers that have been sought by the bank and granted by the Oireachtas on various regulatory and resolution issues.  However, as far as bank supervision is concerned, the European Union's single supervisory mechanism, SSM, has since November 2014 taken over much of the decision-making, while implementation remains primarily a locally-managed task.  There are improved decision making processes in regulation in the bank, including separation of policy and risk, as well as enforcement functions from supervision, significant strengthening of the legal division and an emphasis on better working interaction between the macro and microprudential staff.  There is an extensive and continuing programme of cultural renewal engaging all staff and using many tools including a clearer definition of mission, performance management, all-staff meetings, monthly cascade briefings, investment in information technology systems, leadership training etc., all to ensure a more effective working environment that is more conducive to, among other things, constructive challenge internally.  Current plans involve even greater use of on-site inspection of banks, as well as a thoroughly overhauled organisational structure to decentralise further decision-making, co-operative working and career progression.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude by noting no regulatory system can or even should attempt to eliminate all possibility of failure and regulation and supervision must be able to change with a constantly-changing financial industry.  However, I think the more assertive and risk-based system of prudential supervision we now have in place has struck the right balance and will help ensure that the banking system helps the economic performance of Ireland, rather than causing the economic destruction which we all have been seeking to repair and rebuild.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015011500002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1421280000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I thank the Governor.

Central banks go around telling people that they really have to rein in things, really, this is going to end badly.  They tend to overplay that, in good times and bad times, be very careful now.  The messages are broadly correct but they have to be graduated and there was nothing along the lines of, &quot;Forget about all the letters I have sent you, this is really serious and we are going to have to do something.&quot;  Actually, the Central Bank had powers to do things to stop themselves.  It is not a question that they should have told the Government - yes they should have told the Government.  One will find that there is a lot of documentation saying, &quot;Look, I said here, this is a very risky situation,&quot; and there are those things, but the message did not get through because it was not communicated in a way that would have really rung the alarm bells.  In preparing for this session I found a very interesting document on the PAC website that I had not noticed before.  It is not an important document, it was probably prepared by a junior official in the Department of Finance.  It is not signed but it is presented to the Minister on 3 September 2008.  It includes this, third paragraph:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>The overall conclusions of the financial stability report of the Central Bank for 2007 was that the shock absorption capacity of the banking system left it well placed to withstand pressures from possible adverse economic and sectoral developments.  While it is too early yet to anticipate the context of the Central Bank-FSAI report for 2008...<\/blockquote>So the advice being given, at least in this written document, to the Minister was capturing the relatively benign tone of a document which, if that is the message the Department of Finance was receiving from the Central Bank and communicating to the Minister, how could the Minister have expected that a decision like a guarantee was going to lead to the thing?  I have the greatest sympathy for the people in the room, the political people on the night of the guarantee.

Sometimes in discussions with people they might ask if I am entitled to have that view and if it is not just my personal view of the ethics of banking.  I do not think banking and finance can work without a high ethical standard, a standard that tells top bankers that they have a heavy responsibility here, that this is not money they are being given to gamble with but money they are being given which forms the basis of a huge underpinning of the economy of society.  Regarding developers, they probably think that the bank did give them money to gamble with - it is a different environment.  I think there is a heavy responsibility, but perhaps it is more an ethical than a legal concept.<\/p> <p>  One thing should be said.  This inquiry will be looking into those dimensions of the banks, and to some extent Peter Nyberg looked at that as well.  I am often puzzled over something.  We all know that senior bankers, and I am referring not just to Anglo Irish Bank, were very well regarded.  There were clever, able, serious, solid and honest people of integrity.  How could they have got into this situation?  The conjecture I am left with, and which the inquiry might wish to explore, is that in the back of their minds they might think, \"Gosh, this could all go wrong, but if it all goes wrong there will be a rescue, it will not be that bad because a floor will be provided and the State or Europe will step in - something will be done and it will be all right\".  Even though they might have accepted subliminally that there were risks, they brushed those aside.  Of course, this gives the situation, and this is not the way they would have put it or even thought of it, of heads I win, tails you lose.  That could explain why serious people said, \"We are making a lot of money here, we are distributing it to shareholders and we are generating the economy.

It is part and parcel of this approach.  If all the Central Bank wanted to check was whether there was a good governance committee and good approvals then it could do so with a lighter staff.

This is the basis of an asset quality review, AQR.  It is very costly.  We have spent tens of millions of euro on asset quality reviews during the period of the bailout and heading into the single supervisory mechanism.  The idea is that we know that the basic data is okay and revisions have been needed for that.<\/p> <p>  The stresses used in 2006 were not very strong.  That is evident to everyone.  One test was whether a bank would survive if there was a 5% fall in GDP next year and a given fall in house prices.  The stresses were not severe enough.  We can see the stresses now.

It is quite interesting.  One has to compare what happened with an alternative.  What is the counter-factual?  The counter-factual I would suggest - a good counter-factual, if one thinks about this - is: had there been a very strict regulatory environment which inhibited the banks from doing all that lending in 2004, 2006, and so forth, how would it have panned out?  Of course, the economy would have been hit by the post-Lehman's international crisis and so forth.  One has to try to model that counter-factual and with a colleague, Thomas Conefrey, we tried to work out how the economy would have moved.  That is one thing, and it gives an overall number.<\/p> <p>  However, also, and very often neglected in this, there are distributional effects and that is what we have been focusing on a lot - the paying for the banking crisis.  There are capital gains and losses as well as the different economic effect.  The economy would have been weaker during the early 2000s.  Wages would have been lower, there would have been fewer jobs, there would have been less immigration, there would have been fewer houses and so forth.  In the post-crisis situation, we would have been in a higher position.  So there is balancing gains from losses and then there are the distributional effects - the winners and losers.  The winners were people who sold property at a good time.  The losers were the people who bought property at a wrong time, the Government, the shareholders and the poor subordinated debt holders of the banks who would actually have got their money back in full instead of with a big haircut.

One of these was the role of auditors.  In his report, he details that the then Minister for Finance, in December 2006, made it known to the Financial Regulator that before introducing a regime which would force bankers and auditors to sign a statement confirming their compliance with proper banking practices that it was important that they, and this is a direct quote, \"assess the competitiveness issue\".

The project was not taken very far.<\/p> <p>  On 15 June 2008, I remember having a discussion with the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Lenihan, along with a colleague, who was another professor, and I think somebody that the committee will meet later on.  We talked about fiscal policy because the big topic was the adjustment of fiscal policy which was going wrong.  We did not talk at all about the banks.  It might have been earlier than August, say in June, but I could probably find the date.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make another point.  In December of 2008 I was quite concerned.  I had made public statements about why one covers subordinated debt.  At that stage I really did not have a concept that this was all going to end up as big in terms of tens of billions of euro.  I thought it was going to be quite important how the Government handled the recapitalisation.  I wondered if it put in &euro;2 billion or &euro;3 billion of capital whether that would make the subordinated debt holders get off free.  So I wrote to the Minister, got a response from his office in December and I talked to some of the officials at that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015011500002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1421280000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>In terms of the Professor Honohan's conversations with the Minister in the months before the guarantee, as a banking expert, did he raise any issues in terms of the banking model?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015011500002#O00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421280000,"counter":377,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015011500002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1421280000,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Professor Honohan has said to the committee that it was obvious that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015011500002#O00500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421280000,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I did not talk-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015011500002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1421280000,"counter":380,"content":"<p>-----the banking model was unsustainable.

However, if they do not respond, it has to be followed up with enforcement, strict directives and rules.  It is not principles versus rules but principles and rules.  If you only have rules, you are going to have big problems like the Americans because banks say, \"All we have to do is abide by the rules\".  Now we are seeing a lot of lawyers and a lot of financial engineers finding ways of getting around the rules.  They have to be supplemented by principles.  Principles does not mean \"Now, be good\".

That is not an empty - I am not saying it is fatal.  I do not think it was just used as an excuse.  Resolution legislation was introduced but not as drastic as some resolution legislation which would actually remove property rights in a more aggressive manner.  Although we do have resolution legislation, it is not as dramatic as it might be.  The British authorities brought in a very complicated piece of legislation in January 2009.  They started in September, or whatever it was of 2007 and they got it enacted in January 2009.  It is not as if we could have lifted something off the British statute book, tried it out on the Constitution and had it ready before September 2008.  It would have been better if it had been there.  There was a sense, certainly from Brian Lenihan, that we do not really need that because we nationalise.  The thinking was never how do we impose losses on creditors of banks, it was how do we protect the banks from stopping functioning?  His idea of nationalisation and that then confidence will return was taken without sufficient regard to the possibility that perhaps we would want to separate part of the liabilities of this bank into an entity which would be one down and losses would go where they had to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015011500002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1421280000,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I suppose-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015011500002#R00700","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421280000,"counter":484,"content":"<p>In terms of the particular difficulty in the Irish legislation, the senior bonds and depositors were treated <i>pari passu<\/i>.

I do not dispute the fact that regulation was a relevant factor and that encouraging an open door policy was relevant for influencing regulations that affected the IFSC, but it was not as if the regulations were brought in to ease the way of IFSC banks and were seized on by local banks.

The ratio became completely different.  They had not thought through this.  They were in a different world, whereby they were effectively participating in property speculation.  They were not doing old fashioned banking, according to which they would take no risks, hold onto security beyond the value of the loan and charge a nice premium for doing so.  That is the old style of banking but they had moved into a different sphere completely without changing their thinking.  I think they were surprised.  We know from the various Anglo Irish Bank tapes and so on that the bank knew it was running out of cash.  Everyone knew that the cash was running out.  During the summer they were probably starting to think that the market did not believe in their business model.  They were hawking it around and nobody believed in them.

Supposing the banking system had been restrained and was just like a normal banking system, what would have happened to the economy and how does that compare with what we have now?  The &euro;40 billion, or whatever it is, is only a part of that component, and we find that in the early years the economy would have been doing less well, wages would have been lower, employment would have been lower, and house completions would have been lower in the more steady path.  However, since the crisis, although there would have been a dip following Lehman's, there would have been a higher level of output, employment would not have slumped as much, unemployment would be lower.  In addition, and there is where some of the &euro;40 billion went, there is the distributional effect.  The bondholders did not make any difference one way or the other.  They would not have invested in Irish banks because the Irish banks would not have wanted the money because they would not have been able to lend, so the foreign bondholders would have said: \"Oh, okay, no takers in Ireland, I think I will invest in France.\" <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015011500002#AA00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1421280000,"counter":799,"content":"<p>Professor, every Christmas in my local credit union, as they did around the country, people in previous years went down to pick up their interest rebate and their dividend at Christmas and there was a couple of hundred euros, just like a Christmas bonus for credit union members.

All events to date have been recorded on film, and footage has been used in a one-hour television documentary which will be broadcast in 2015.

Stories are gathered from local communities whom we work with and are presented to the communities in the form of dramatic performances.  This is always followed by a post-show discussion on the themes presented.  Current stories in these performances centre on the journey of a paramilitary from violent action to engagement in peace, a story about a couple involved in a cross-community relationship and the story of an ex-member of the Greenfinches.<\/p>  <p>  Our second play, \"Uprising\", is scripted by Tara McKevitt and devised by the company.  It explores the Troubles through the eyes of the rap or hip-hop generation.  It juxtaposes stories from the past with contemporary music and the lives of young people today.  \"Uprising\" engages the audience not only in an examination of the past but in a quest for a vision for the future as well.  Our company creates living theatre.  These original performances are a combination of fiction and real stories; true fiction, in that the work is fiction yet based on fact.  Everything expressed on stage has actually happened.  Teachers and youth workers have pointed out to us that sometimes they work with vulnerable young men and women who may be at risk of being recruited into violent activity.

A young person interviewed following a performance said his parents believed they were raising him in a secular non-political environment but the messages seeped through and that the performance and post-show discussion had given him a broader understanding of the issues involved.

These address anti-racism, anti-sectarianism and gender equality and use storytelling to promote reconciliation.  Workshops always begin with theatre games and exercises to introduce the issue, develop creativity and confidence and prepare participants for improvisation.  Improvisation, for example, on issues of racism and sectarianism, enables participants to use their bodies and emotions to put themselves into different roles and to stand in the shoes of others.  Participants rehearse alternative approaches to conflict in a safe environment which they can then choose to use in their daily lives.  A similar process is used in storytelling through drama workshops.  Shared storytelling is a way to recognise and acknowledge the hurts that have been inflicted and explore the idea that my truth is not necessarily another's truth.  By listening to other people's stories, participants are hearing about a different reality to their reality.<\/p>  <p>  Smashing Times supports cross-Border, cross-community arts projects and believes they are key to long-term and lasting reconciliation between communities.  The arts play a powerful role in discussing divisions that still exist and how we move forward in respect of dealing with the legacy of violence, addressing issues around flags emblems, parades and protests as well as the fact that sectarianism, racism and gender inequality still exist.  They raise questions on how we can express our identities while respecting the identities of others.<\/p>  <p>  One striking feature of our work is that when we first work with a group, they hold an initial belief that racism and sectarianism does not exist in their community.  However, through the process of the workshop and performances, people gain a deeper understanding of its presence and need to be alert to it.  Recently, I worked with a group in Craigavon.  When we went in initially, the young people said there was no racism or sectarianism in their communities and that it did not exist.  However, during the workshop, one young Catholic girl, 15 or 16 years of age, said that she went out with a Protestant but she felt intimidated when it came to going into his estate.  She said he was also intimidated when it came to going to GAA events at which she socialised with her family.  Her view was that both sets of parents felt that the relationship was not necessarily a good thing.  She said that in future she would not go out with a Protestant because it was too difficult.  This is the view expressed by a young girl who has grown up post-Good Friday Agreement.  Certain issues need to be addressed, including the issue of expression of culture, gatekeepers, fear of paramilitaries, the so-called peace walls and interface violence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015011500004#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Freda Manweiler"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421316900,"counter":832,"content":"<p>We are calling for more recognition, visibility and funding for arts-based companies that use creative processes to promote peace-building, reconciliation and community relations at grassroots level throughout Northern Ireland, Border counties and on the island of Ireland.  Sabina Coyne Higgins has become a patron of Smashing Times theatre company, a mark of support for arts-based work to promote peace-building and reconciliation.  The support of political leaders can lead the way in recognising and making visible grassroots arts work.  We have secured funding from the Erasmus Plus programme in Europe to build on the anti-racism work we have been doing in Northern Ireland.  The idea is to work with European partners to adapt what we have learned and to apply it in a Europe-wide context.<\/p> <p>It is important systems are put in place to support and enable the learning gained from the peace process in Northern Ireland in order that this learning can be distributed across Europe and in other conflict zones in order that people do not continue to reinvent the wheel.  Worthwhile academic papers will have been published on the peace process, but we also need arts-based practical manuals and models of practice which other practitioners can take off a shelf and adapt to their communities.  We also need more structures in place to ensure an organisation like Smashing Times theatre company can operate more easily across our two jurisdictions and to ensure we can access accreditation for training that is the same for both jurisdictions.<\/p> <p> We thank committee members for listening to our presentation and for affording us the opportunity to address the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.

It is obvious the work in which she has been involved and this presentation cover a wide area of activity that works to address a significant number of issues of critical importance.  In her presentation she mentioned that Acting for the Future uses theatre to promote positive mental health and suicide prevention, an area of significant importance for society.  This issue is not just critical for young people but for older people as well.  Unfortunately, all age groups are afflicted by suicide and mental health difficulties.  Any presentations, productions and work in that area which get across a message and act towards prevention are extremely important.<\/p>  <p> Ms Moynihan mentioned work in both the Six Counties and the Border counties of the South.  What presentations have taken place in these Border counties and what level of activity has Smashing Times had in the Cavan-Monaghan area or the other Border counties of the South?  It is critical that this work has a solid basis for planning for the future and I hope it is supported and funded.  Is the company reaching out to people in the most disadvantaged areas?   We are all aware that it is often people from more affluent areas and from more settled communities with a good standard of living who are more likely to attend arts activities, and often these important and welcome productions do not reach the less well-off in society.<\/p>  <p>  This committee has had formal presentations made here, but often when we visit communities in the Six Counties, whether loyalist or Nationalist communities, we learn that those communities feel disenfranchised and that they are not benefitting to the extent they should from the dividends that follow on from the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.  Therefore, we need to ensure that those communities at particular disadvantage are targeted specifically in the work of Smashing Times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015011500005#E00200","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421317500,"counter":835,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

We have had a number of independent evaluations and feedback from community workers on this.  For example, we have worked with a community group where the youth workers have told us the group does not engage in any of the activities set up, but they sit and listen to what we are doing and engage with our work.  We are continually being asked to come back to work with groups that might be designated as difficult or who are difficult to engage with.  Our work seems to engage them.<\/p>  <p>  It is important we go in and work with young people and that we listen to them and hear what they have to say.  We have performances, but there are also workshops and these workshops enable the young people to become part of the work and central to the process, particularly in the area of suicide prevention.  We have worked with the Samaritans and the Irish Association of Suicidology since 2005.  We have visited schools in the Border counties of the South and have recently started to work in Northern Ireland on suicide prevention work.  There is huge demand for this work because of what is happening and the Samaritans and the Irish Association of Suicidology are very supportive of that work because they believe it engages with young people and is getting the messages across to them.

I have sat at the back of the room and watched what happens.  They are engaged first because it is a live performance.  They have not seen an actor before and might start to giggle initially, but as the story unfolds and as the actor presents his or her craft, the kids start to sit up, silence falls over the room and they become completely engaged.  I always feel there is a moment where we can go: \"We've got them now.\"  Afterwards, they can ask questions about the story, which seems slightly removed from the issue, but is the issue.  It is not like one person telling his or her story.  It is removed from the individual.  Then we have a discussion about the character and what he or she would do.

I believe that where Smashing Times misses out is the areas of Acting for Peace and Acting for the Future.  In Acting for the Future, the group must show the reasons there is conflict, why sectarianism exists and continues to exist and why social, political and economic inequality are a contributing factor.  It must also be shown that the fact there is not a more integrated educational process is a contributory factor.<\/p> <p>There is rampant sectarian in the Six Counties and, equally, there is a growing problem with racism.  Even today a number of people are being charged for killing a Chinese man, for whatever reason.  In regard to racism, one has only to look at the events of the past week, the killing by Boko Haram of 2,000 black people, who were badly treated, and those who were killed in Paris, which was also disgraceful.<\/p> <p> I commend the representatives on the work they are doing.  In order to achieve the aims of Acting for the Future, one has to reach young people.  Are the representatives going into cross-community schools in the Six Counties and in the Border region, including south of the Border?  With what age group are the representatives dealing?  It strikes me that the younger one can influence children in terms of Acting for the Future, the better.  They have said that much of their work is in the more economically deprived areas, where there is probably more sectarianism.  Have they challenged the role of the structured perpetuity of sectarianism by the State?  The role of the State is significant in terms of reconciliation, peace and so forth.  In order to achieve what we want to achieve, we must identify the mistakes of the past.  The witnesses mentioned that part of it is challenging the role of parliamentarians, but they must also challenge the role of the State.

Part of their role would be to look at the State structures with regard to racism or sectarianism.  One is bringing together people working to combat racism and sectarianism to work with artists.  The role of the artist is not to tell people what to do but to engage people in a discussion on what is happening in society and to encourage critical thinking so that people can question what is happening in their society.  Part of that questioning with young people would be to question institutional structures if they are going against equality.  We are very much on the side of promoting peace and equality of opportunity.  Our role is to go in and maybe raise awareness of those issues and then encourage young people to question what is happening in society.

I was interested in the name of the theatre, Smashing Times.  It is a great name and perhaps the witnesses might tell us the history of it.

Whether it is Galway, Sligo, Waterford or Dublin, theatre companies have very good names and often there is a message in the name of the company.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that what the company is doing continues, particularly in schools, and its work with vulnerable people, those on the margins and those with disabilities.  Given the way the school curriculum is structured, these issues do not get discussed.  While I was a Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs for a year, I recall visiting many countries in Africa.  Teenagers there were more inclined to act out issues in the classroom, such as violence and, in particular, domestic violence, and were not afraid to do so.  Sometimes in our education system we are afraid to talk about these issues.<\/p>  <p>  What the representatives are doing is great.  I like particularly the music part of it, which is very important.  One of the witnesses mentioned that the stage is a dangerous place.  I hope it is not as bad as the Abbey Theatre was years ago, when there were riots.  Nowadays we accept some of the things we may not like to hear off the stage, but it is good for our conscience and our experience to hear those.  I think our committee would like to support what the representatives are doing.  We have not had too many groups appearing before the committee from the arts area.  It is usually some other committee that talks to people in the artistic and creative world.  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which is a very good Department, deals with such issues.

That was always very important and it does not happen frequently enough.

To inform members, they have some papers in front of them which I hope will be helpful to guide them through what I am saying.  I will start by saying something about coeliac disease - in case members do not know what it is - and to let them know how people with coeliac disease are affected.  I will also outline why it can be difficult to find that one has coeliac disease or for doctors to think of the possibility that one has coeliac disease and how it can be quite difficult for people to live with the dietary treatment, which is the mainstay of treatment.  I will also give members some idea of what kinds of supports and services people with coeliac disease need to help them through this condition.<\/p>  <p>  First, coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition and it leads to poor absorption in the gut for most people who develop it.  In the past, coeliac disease was thought to be a childhood condition and it was thought that people grew out of this childhood condition.  As this was believed as recently as the 1970s and 1980s, there still are people in practice in medicine who would have learned this in their medical student days.  More recently, it has been recognised that coeliac disease is not something out of which one can grow and once it begins, it lasts for life.  Unfortunately in some ways, the condition does not always present in the same way and has quite a lot of different manifestations.  The classical presentation about which everybody learns in medical school is somebody who presents with weight loss and diarrhoea and this improves on a gluten-free diet within a few months.  The condition initially was not very well understood and over the last 30 or 40 years, a lot of molecular detail now has become understood.  This progression in immune research and in understanding the immune system has been very important in understanding diseases like coeliac disease that have an immunological basis.  Unlike many of the autoimmune conditions, which include types of arthritis and systemic illnesses such as systemic lupus erythematosus, coeliac disease is distinct from those in that we know mainly what is the instigator.  In this condition, the instigator is pieces of protein digested from a large protein present in grains, which roughly is called gluten.  In fact, gluten is not a single protein but is a mixture of proteins whenever the flour in which the protein is found is hydrated.  From the point of view of food, gluten is important in baked products made from wheat flour because its lends body to the dough and the bread and makes it better textured and more enjoyable to eat.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately however, people with coeliac disease have a problem with the gluten present in those foods and it can lead to an autoimmune process that can damage both the lining of the gut and other tissues.  More worryingly, it can damage tissues in other organs and this was not really understood 30 or 40 years ago.  The severity of the autoimmune damage is quite variable between people and it can even vary throughout life in the individual concerned.  It begins usually because somebody gets gastroenteritis and he or she has inherited the genetic possibility of developing autoimmunity.  We now know there are more than 40 genes involved.  It is not a single gene defect like Down's syndrome or Klinefelter's syndrome or anything like that.  It is a quite complicated mixture of mechanisms but the real problem is the inability to switch off abnormal autoimmune sequences in the immune reaction to gluten.  While there are lots of autoimmune targets, one that we use for diagnosis is an enzyme in the gut called tissue transglutaminase.  As this enzyme also can be found in nerve tissue, in the skin and in various other places, the antibody reactions can occur in lots of different places in the body and not just in the gut.<\/p>  <p>  I have listed some of the manifestations in the summary I have provided for members.  They can see that in the gut, the coeliac disease we all recognise reasonably well can cause diverse manifestations, including recurrent mouth ulcers.  Most people have digestive complaints that are relatively mild such as a bit of bloating or cramps in the stomach occasionally when they eat too much gluten.  Sometimes there is nausea or diarrhoea but not everybody gets all of these and a smaller proportion can develop the skin manifestations, which include rashes and itching.  Some people have itching only while others develop the full manifestation with a blistering rash, which is called dermatitis herpetiformis.  Some people present to skin specialists and subsequently are found to have coeliac disease.  This condition also responds well to a gluten-free diet and may not need any treatment other than a gluten-free diet.  More recently again, it has been recognised that tissue transglutaminase 6 antibodies can occur in the brain and in the cerebellum and this can give rise to quite an unpleasant condition called gluten ataxia, in which people develop unsteadiness and a difficulty with balance and in co-ordination of movement.  Once again, if this is detected early enough and the gluten is removed from the diet, this can improve after several years.  Unfortunately, many people who have been diagnosed with this have been on gluten-containing diets for years and their condition is not reversible.  Consequently, the ataxia is permanent although it could have been prevented.<\/p>  <p>  As members can see from this summary, coeliac disease is not just a gut condition, which really is my main message.  There also are people who develop poor fertility.  Women who have difficulty conceiving, are subsequently found to have coeliac disease and are treated have a better chance of conceiving.  Members can see there are nutritional complications because of bad absorption and one of the most common reasons for diagnosis is recurrent anaemia in women.  This is often initially thought to be because of menstrual difficulties or poor diet but in fact is due to bad absorption.  Osteoporosis is another very common complication, which can be due to poor calcium and vitamin D absorption and is much worse when gluten is in the diet.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, we do not know exactly how many people in Ireland have coeliac disease.  If we assume the commonly-held view that 1% of populations in northern Europe have coeliac disease, we would expect approximately 43,000 to 45,000 individuals to have coeliac disease in the Republic of Ireland.  However, nowhere near this number of people have been diagnosed and nowhere near this number have joined the Coeliac Society of Ireland as members.  We do not have a coeliac disease register unfortunately, although in my clinic that I run in St James's Hospital with my gastroenterology colleagues, it is clear that the pattern is the same as in other places, where one has two to three women per man diagnosed.  It also is clear that there is an increased risk in first blood relatives, in which between eight and ten times the normal rate would get coeliac disease.  There are twin studies showing there is a high genetic potential.  However, we think there are many other conditions associated with coeliac disease because of the genetic reasons and these include type 1 diabetes and Down's syndrome.  Moreover, autoimmune thyroid disease is one of the more common associates of coeliac disease.  Although these other conditions will not necessarily be improved by a gluten-free diet, it now is thought by immunologists that if people have coeliac disease first and go on treatment with a gluten-free diet, their chance of developing a second autoimmune condition is reduced.<\/p>  <p>  One problem we have is we do not have an adequate diagnosis rate of coeliac disease here.  There are many people in the population who have coeliac disease but do not know that and are not being treated and are likely to be suffering the complications if they are not found.  I do not know whether any members present have family members or friends who have coeliac disease and I do not know how well they appreciate the life they lead on a gluten-free diet but people who are on a gluten-free diet face many challenges.  First, when people are diagnosed it is not a terribly welcome diagnosis in some cases.  In other cases, people are relieved that a cause for their long-standing symptoms at last has been found.  Moreover, they know what to do about it and it is a relatively straightforward treatment involving diet and not many tablets or recurrent visits.  However, it is not easy to remove gluten from one's diet, as it is contained in many staple foods.  More worryingly in some ways, it is in many other foods as an additive or a contaminant and it can be very difficult to know which foods will be harmful in a situation.<\/p>  <p>  What happens when people have been diagnosed?<\/p> <p>First, they have to come to grips with having coeliac disease and, second, they have to come to grips with what a gluten-free diet entails.  They then have to be successful in implementing that, which can take months or years.  Some people never manage it.  <\/p> <p> I will return to the issue of diagnosis.  People are often misdiagnosed prior to having their coeliac disease diagnosed.  One of the most common misdiagnoses is irritable bowel syndrome.  It has been found in some studies that up to 15% of individuals first diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, IBS, in fact had coeliac disease.  Another confounding possibility is that someone has an allergy to wheat, which is IgE-mediated and not coeliac disease.  This tends to occur in people who have other allergies such as asthma, hayfever, etc..  Some people with coeliac disease can also have allergies to grains but that is a different mechanism.  <\/p> <p> More recently gluten-free dieting has become a fad because it is perceived to be a healthier diet, for some reason.  This fad has been driven by the media and celebrities who have turned to a gluten-free diet.  Gluten-free foods are now being bought by many people who do not need a gluten-free diet for health reasons but are choosing it as a lifestyle.  A study carried out in UCC suggests that for every one person who is buying a gluten-free food for their coeliac disease there are nine who are buying it for other reasons.  This is resulting in a huge increase in the sale of gluten-free products and will, perhaps, make available a greater range of gluten-free products, which is to everybody's benefit but it also means that people who are serving gluten-free foods in restaurants and other food service areas are less convinced that people needing a gluten-free diet do so for health reasons rather than lifestyle choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500004#F00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Nicholas Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421315100,"counter":895,"content":"<p>I must ask Professor Kennedy to conclude his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500005#G00200","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421315100,"counter":896,"content":"<p>The gluten-free foods that I have spoken a little about are difficult to prepare domestic kitchens because of contamination.

These recommendations are aimed at ensuring services for people with coeliac disease are more equitable and at improving the outcomes for people with coeliac disease.<br\/>First, a coeliac disease register should be established.  Such a register would continuously record and update data on individuals who have coeliac disease, including their age, gender, duration and nature of symptoms at the time of diagnosis, associated diseases such as diabetes type 1, thyroid disease, osteoporosis and others.  Analysis of registry data would increase knowledge of the disease, help facilitate research and audit and improve outcomes for people with the condition.  All data on the register would be anonymised, stripped of personal identifiers and access to the register and management of it would be in strict compliance with data protection regulations.  The best example of a register which has helped to improve outcomes for people is the national cancer registry, although that is on a much greater scale than what we are seeking.  We are also aware of the cystic fibrosis registry, which has also been very helpful.  We are well aware that there is a great deal of work involved in establishing and maintaining a disease register.<br\/>Second, there is a need for a policy on targeted screening, which would be community and hospital-based, of people who are apparently well but have first degree relatives with the disease and of people with associated illnesses who would be at higher risk of having coeliac disease.  In the first instance, a blood test would be carried out and then to confirm a diagnosis a biopsy would be undertaken.  We recommend this because, as already stated, there are probably more people with coeliac disease who have not been diagnosed than there are people who have been diagnosed as having the disease.  <br\/>Third, we recommend the introduction of practice guidelines and audit.  Clinical guidelines are aimed at helping professionals to implement best practice and to make the best clinical decisions for their patients.  They are based on evidence of what best practice is and do not remove the need for clinical judgments to be made.  It is expected that clinicians, including doctors, nurses, dietitians and others, would operate broadly within those guidelines.  The organisation of health care affects outcomes for patients.  As such, this should also be the subject of guidelines.  We recommend that a national guideline be adopted.  However, there are a number of alternatives to this, including development of the guideline <i>ab initio<\/i>, which is a fairly painstaking task and takes about two years to do or a guideline could be taken from another jurisdiction and adapted for Ireland.  We believe this would help in greatly standardising practice and would improve outcomes for patients with the condition.<br\/>We specifically recommend the establishment of a network of hospital-based coeliac clinics, which would be staffed by consultants, gastroenterologist with a special interest in coeliac disease, as well as dietitians and nurses with special training.  Doctors would be encouraged to refer patients to these clinics, which would operate on the basis of best practice guidelines.  I again make the analogy of the cancer programme under which cancer treatment has been centralised in eight centres, although I am not suggesting we need to establish eight clinics.  That is a matter for further discussion.  We believe the establishment of these clinics would ensure a higher quality service for people with coeliac disease.  It is much easier to implement guidelines in two large centres where there would be a designated clinician who would lead audit of the practice therein.<br\/>Next is the issue of access to nutrition care through HSE dietetic services.  Dietetic services in this country are generally seriously inadequate.  Dietitians provide services for a range of categories of patients in hospitals and in the community, including, for example, people with cancer, heart disease, obesity, diabetes, malnutrition, particularly in older people, and people with coeliac disease.  Diet is obviously a key issue in coeliac disease.  All best practice guidelines recommend that people newly diagnosed with coeliac disease have a one-to-one consultation with a dietitian and at some intervals afterwards, especially if a question arises in regard to non-compliance, which might be inadvertent, with the diet.  Unfortunately, one-third of our 380 primary care teams do not have access to a one-to-one dietetic service and approximately half of them have access to one for only a half day or one day a week.  This is inadequate.  The Coeliac Society recommends that recruitment of dietitians be given much greater priority in the health services.  We know that this will not happen today or tomorrow and so recommend that in the mean time - we have raised this in discussions with the HSE - we explore how best the resources we have can be used to better effect.  For example, group sessions could be established and dietitians could be required to train other health staff such as public health nurses in dietetics generally and, particularly, in regard to coeliac disease.<br\/>The next issue is policy on the availability of gluten-free food in health care institutions.  Some of our members have told us that they have been served food in health care institutions that was obviously not gluten-free.<\/p> <p>That is not acceptable.  We recommend therefore that there should be training for all staff involved in the cooking, preparation and serving of food and that, furthermore, this training should be as a team because people have to work as a team to do that.<\/p> <p> I will give the members some examples.  Contamination can occur very easily in kitchens where ladles are used for non-gluten free sauces and so on.  If gluten free bread is put into a toaster that is used for other bread that can be contaminated.  Also, the meal could be served to the wrong patient.  Some people know their disease very well and they will say that to staff but others might not.  There are people in the health institutions who are not able to speak up for themselves.<\/p> <p> This is a big issue and we believe there should be written protocols, which would be stronger than guidelines, because there are certain things we simply must do with regard to serving gluten free food in every institution, and the training should be mandatory.<\/p> <p> On the funding for the community outreach programme, the society has already applied for a full-time person to run a community programme.  The society has a very small number of staff in Carmichael House.  We want a community worker or somebody with that kind of training to head up a community programme educating people with coeliac disease, perhaps in group sessions but also linking in with the dietetic services.  We would like to take on one full-time person.<\/p> <p> In terms of our overall approach, the members are probably aware of the Healthy Ireland strategy.  Our approach is to improve the level of health and well-being at all stages of life; to improve early detection of coeliac disease; to allow for successful intervention through community-based services; and to increase the degree to which associated diseases with coeliac disease such as those we mentioned already can be prevented.<\/p> <p> Some of these actions we are recommending are highly cost-effective.  Dietetic services, for example, are low tech and low cost compared to many other interventions in the health services and the outcomes are extremely beneficial, including the prevention of osteoporosis and other illnesses I have mentioned already.  We hope to have a meeting with the Health Service Executive soon where we will raise all of these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500005#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Doorley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421315700,"counter":900,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Doorley.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500006#H00200","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1421315700,"counter":901,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  Everybody knows somebody who is a coeliac or is aware of somebody who is a coeliac and we are probably all conscious of the broader issues around the disease itself but when we outline the impact it can have on individuals, the difficulties with lifestyle in terms of requiring a gluten-free diet, and the lack of resources and supports for sufferers of coeliac disease, it is clear it is an issue that has to be addressed in the context of resourcing.<\/p>  <p>  The witness said that approximately 1% of the western European population is diagnosed with coeliac disease.  We do not have that rate in Ireland so either we are not diagnosing or are hereditarily different from the rest of western Europe, which is unlikely.  Why is that the case in view of the fact that we know a good deal about the disease, that we have a poor detection rate and a poor diagnosis rate?  What are the reasons for that?<\/p>  <p>  A seriological blood test can be done to diagnose coeliac disease, and duodenum biopsies can be performed also.  Are people presenting with the symptoms and not being followed up in terms of the diagnosis?  Are general practitioners mistaking irritable bowel syndrome for coeliac disease?  All of those issues have to come into play.  We all talk about primary care settings as the front line in terms of the provision of heath care but if we are not diagnosing at the rate that should be anticipated in a normal population it is clear there are problems at the coalface in terms of detection and diagnosis.  What can be done in those particular areas to address that?<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the health implications of non-diagnosis, the witness referenced vitamin absorption.  That is a critically important area in women of child-bearing age whereby mineral deficiencies can cause problems initially in getting pregnant and also during pregnancy.  Should we have a greater awareness programme among our health professionals and equally among the broader population?<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of the dietetic services, coeliacs are not alone in having poor dietetic services.  We have poor dietetic services in general, which are under-resourced.  We have not taken that issue seriously, not only in terms of coeliac disease but in obesity and many other areas.  <\/p>  <p>  There is also an obligation on the owners of food outlets.  When the witness mentioned institutions I presume he was referring to hospitals, large institutions and, equally, the small restaurant on the side of the street.  Should there be some form of inspection process through the Food Safety Authority, for example, whereby when it is inspecting other areas there are clear protocols for ensuring there is non-contamination and that the staff are informed of their obligations to ensure they have gluten-free diets available but, more importantly, if they are providing those diets that they are done in a way that there is no potential for contamination.  I am merely posing the question.  In terms of food safety in general, is this not something that should be examined to ensure we protect those who have been diagnosed with this disease?<\/p>  <p>  The witness said that nine out of ten people who are using gluten free products do not have coeliac disease but if someone is using gluten free products it is difficult to detect whether they have coeliac disease because they are not showing with the symptoms.  People who have irritable bowel syndrome might hear from another person that if they follow a gluten free diet they will get better.  They may never have been diagnosed with coeliac disease but they had the symptoms and dealt with them themselves and if the witnesses' organisation does the test, obviously it will not diagnose as many people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500006#H00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1421315700,"counter":902,"content":"<p>I call Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in who will be followed by Senators Jillian van Turnhout and Colm Burke.

If the figure is as high as nine out of ten, they would be as well advised that the reasons for opting for gluten free products are not diet related.  There are a number of people taking gluten free products who are not coeliacs, and for the wrong reasons.  They might be surprised to know that it may not contribute in the way they expect.<\/p>  <p>  I am the father of four children who are coeliac.  I have one who is not; I do not know how she escaped.  We are very familiar with the condition and dealing with it.  It is important to say at the outset that big advances have been made.  There have been major developments and improvements in increased awareness, increased choice of foodstuffs and the quality of foodstuffs.  I remember the quality of some of the foodstuffs in the early stages of my children's diagnosis was very unattractive but that has changed dramatically.  It is important to put out the positive story because huge strides have been made, and the coeliac society has contributed enormously to that advance.  More restaurant menus are offering clear coeliac choices and the allergen highlights on food products, which is not just about coeliac disease, about the presence of wheat, rye, oats or barley covers a whole spectrum from nuts, dairy product and eggs, depending on the issue the individual may have.<\/p> <p> Promotion of awareness is hugely important and I very much welcome the fact that the witnesses are here before the health committee today.  I hope that in itself will be a contribution, not only in terms of our being re-briefed but also in terms of public awareness arising out of this engagement.  I would like to ask if Ms Denning would mind circulating the members with a copy of the gluten-free booklet, the product listing, after the meeting.  She may not have one for everyone in the audience with her but if she does that is even better.  It would be helpful because many of the members would not have had sight of the different publications and information the Coeliac Society continues to furnish to those who are registered.<\/p> <p> As regards coeliac clinics at hospital sites, Professor Kennedy mentioned the current position in his presentation.  What is the current position across hospital sites?  My own experience would suggest Crumlin hospital is where the great bulk of final diagnoses - in terms of the biopsy - are made.  Professor Billy Bourke and the team there are excellent and I pay tribute to them.  Is that the only location at this time?  Can Professor Kennedy give us an outline of the network, if one exists, and what he thinks should be the optimum arrangement to work and lobby towards? <\/p> <p> It is very important for this committee to be able to reflect patient needs in hospitals, certainly to the HSE.  Concerning food provision and preparation, it is very important to highlight preparation as much as the actual food provision itself.  That is something the committee can certainly do.<\/p> <p> The screening programme mentioned in the presentation is very understandable.  Dr. Doorley talked about this as well.  It is understandable to target siblings and immediate family, but we all accept that the extent of coeliac disease is much greater than the confirmed statistics suggest.  Its presence is much wider than that.  How could initial screening programmes be rolled out beyond just that target base?  I am firmly of the view that the earliest diagnosis possible is in the interest of the young person and the individual's life path, but it is also cost effective because we are saving people from having to look for other interventions later in life as a result of neglecting the condition.<\/p> <p> I noted the list of associated conditions and would like to ask either Professor Kennedy or Dr. Doorley to elaborate a little on EE?  We were wrestling earlier with the name of the EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety and here I go again, I am going to wrestle with this but I will do my best.  Eosinophilic oesophagitis, EE, is the effect on the lining of the oesophagus.  I have picked up recently that EE is showing itself more and more as an associated condition in those diagnosed with coeliac disease.  Can the witnesses comment any further on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500006#H00500","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421316300,"counter":905,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation and note their recommendations.  I do not want to go through each of the points but there are three specific areas I would like to raise.  My understanding of coeliac condition would be mainly from my involvement as a volunteer with the Girl Guides in organising events.  Dietary requirements come up and we have many discussions on the issue.  The majority of leaders would say it is difficult when we have events, mainly in hotels or other types of facilities, and the issue was touched on by Professor Kennedy.  There is a lifestyle change whereby some people are opting for a gluten-free diet, which leads some establishments to believe a little bit will not do any harm.  The people running the hotels think they are looking to change their lifestyle and that gluten will not really affect them.  I have seen the direct effects it has on individuals.<\/p>  <p>  For many restaurants, if they changed their stocks and sauces, the menu would open up.  That shows the lack of awareness about coeliac disease.  It is not just a fad, and maybe that is an awareness we could get across.  Some hotels are excellent but some may indicate that a little gluton will do no harm.  There is an issue there.  When I heard about an increase in gluten-free diets as a lifestyle choice, the optimist in me was saying that is great, it means there will be a wider selection of products and prices will hopefully come down.  The witnesses have explained the downside of it to me.<\/p>  <p>  On the screening process, what age of detection is more usual?  Most people I know were diagnosed in young adulthood rather than as children.  The screening process and early detection have been mentioned but unless there is a direct family member it does not seem to come up as a possibility.  I noted from the presentation that previously it was thought children would grow out of it.  I hear parents being told by dieticians that their daughter or son will grow out of it if the parents introduce little bits of gluten to them.  That attitude may still be prevailing.  I see heads shaking but this is not only me thinking this, it still prevails today.<\/p>  <p>  I was surprised to hear about the cross-contamination issue in the health care institutions.  They are not being mindful of the dietary needs of the individual residents and patients.  I know food in our health care institutions is an issue our Chairman, Deputy Conway has raised on several occasions, but perhaps this committee could look more widely at the dietary needs of individuals in different recovery stages or life stages.  I have direct experience of the quality of the diet as my father is in a nursing home and, for example, the cross-contamination issue of the toaster seems obvious although it is not.  I would have thought those working in health care institutions would be trained and retrained on a regular basis and that the issue would be stressed.  Perhaps the committee could consider those wider issues also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500007#J00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1421316300,"counter":906,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their detailed presentation and the documentation we have received.  As regards the area of specialisation, how many specialists are working in this area and how are we doing in terms of the ratio of specialists to population?  Is there a need for a lot more people in this area?<\/p>  <p>  The first point of contact people have is with their GP  and a lot of GPs are working together as groups now rather than on an individual basis.  Is there a need to encourage sub-specialisation by GPs in each region so that people can have access to a quality service?<\/p> <p>I note from the Ms Denning's presentation that support services available from health professionals for the management of the disease were rated as poor by 46.5%.  What needs to be done within the medical profession to improve that rating?  A figure of 46.5% is a very high proportion of people to consider the level of health care they received to be poor.<\/p> <p> The second issue follows from Senator van Turnhout's point about dieticians.  I know of one case, for instance, where dieticians in hospitals will not see people who are pregnant unless they have been diagnosed with diabetes, which I find astonishing.  It would be far more beneficial also if dieticians based in hospitals could visit or if there were some scheme in place for them to visit nursing homes, because the current procedure is that a patient who wants to get support from a dietician in a hospital must be transported from the nursing home to the hospital and back, at huge cost.  An issue is arising in nursing homes where there are dieticians - and this is not a criticism of these dieticians - who are employed by pharmaceutical companies, who are visiting nursing homes and giving favourable-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500007#J00300","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421316900,"counter":908,"content":"<p>Senator Burke is straying a little.

They have been very comprehensive.  They have outlined all the issues and have made a series of recommendations.  Their presentation is stating the obvious about what we need to do.  With regard to people going undetected, a friend of mine found out only last year that she was a coeliac, having lived her life to date without knowing.  The witnesses made recommendations with regard to databases as well and I can see that if one does not have a database, it is difficult to know how to improve services.<\/p>  <p>  What strikes me, aside from points others have made is that people can be in hospital or care home situations and not even be provided with the correct food.  That is a serious concern because one is supposed to be caring for someone who is sick and is actually making them sicker if one is not giving them what they need.  I would never have thought about how easy cross-contamination is, as was highlighted, and that it may happen simply by putting something into a toaster or through food processing or cross-contamination in kitchens, perhaps because people have not been trained.  This is also a huge concern.<\/p>  <p>  I picked up on another issue about the Coeliac Society and the key role it plays in helping people.

On cross-contamination in hospitals and so on, particularly around a toaster, a friend of mine was in my local hospital last week for an operation and when she asked for a slice of toast a few hours later, she was told that they do not make toast anymore because of health and safety.  I do not think it was anything to do with being coeliac, but that is what she was told.<\/p>  <p>  A few things popped off the page, so to speak.  I have a family member who has very severe coeliac disease.  It was discovered about ten years ago when he was in his 30s.  He has a young family and it is difficult at times for his wife to cater for his needs as well as those of his children because of everything that goes on in a family home with young children.  As he was diagnosed with it quite late, it is quite severe.  I do not understand the level it can go to, but I believe it is very serious.  One of the things he constantly reminds me of is the cost of gluten-free products in the supermarket.  Professor Kennedy was saying that people are now buying it for a lifestyle.  It is nothing to do with lifestyle for him.  It is to do with necessity more than anything else.  I have seen some of the products and I have tasted some of them.  They are not very pleasant, but they are very costly.  Particularly for that family member, it has been a very difficult, life-changing experience, not only for him but also for his wife and children.  It has made life quite difficult for them, even though they try their best.<\/p>  <p>  Does it affect young children and how is it diagnosed in young children?  Is it tested from birth?  I will say in a moment why I am asking that.<\/p>  <p>  Why, according to the Coeliac Society membership database, have 76% of those who have contacted the society been female, compared with 24% who were male?  Is that because men generally do not look after themselves or bother about their health?  Regarding the cost and if there is a bigger market for it, is it to do with the fact that it is difficult to produce these food products because of contamination and so on?<\/p>  <p>  The reason I asked about young children was that I recently had a new granddaughter.  She is four months old and the hospital has spent the past couple of months trying to diagnose what is wrong with her, because she has been put on a food called nutramigen.  I am asking that because when one is a young mother and has a young child, one is conscious of the fact that if something goes wrong, one is trying to find out as much as possible.  My daughter has searched the Internet and done everything.  That is the reason I asked.  It is ongoing.  They are treating her with this food or milk product, but at &euro;18 a tin, the cost is huge.  I was shocked last week when she told me - it is probably nothing to do with coeliac disease, but I am just referring to the cost issue - that she pays her &euro;144 drugs payment and then she was called back to the pharmacy to say that she could only have ten tins of this food on this &euro;144 and everything else after the &euro;144 she had to pay for herself.  On average the baby is using a tin every three days now.  At the end of the month it will cost them &euro;300 to feed a four month old child.  That is astronomical.  It just does not make sense.  I know I am straying from what the witnesses said, but it relates to the cost factor.  Can it be diagnosed in young children and how is it diagnosed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500008#K00600","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1421316900,"counter":913,"content":"<p>There is an array of questions.

Deputy Kelleher's comments were first.  He asked why we did not have 1% of people diagnosed in Ireland.<\/p> <p>The 1% I referred to are people who are likely to have coeliac disease.  I do not think there are very many countries in which they are all diagnosed.  In Europe, probably the country with the highest rate of diagnosis is Finland.  I accept that we have a poor diagnosis rate here.  The most important reason for this is probably low awareness of the variety of symptoms and signs that can be manifested by coeliac disease.  This applies to the general population not being very aware, to GPs perhaps not being aware enough and to specialists who may not be aware enough, in some cases, to screen for coeliac disease, for instance, in all cases suggesting the possibility through IBS.  This is one of the biggest categories of patient attending gastroenterology outpatient clinics.  I agree that training is needed for quite a few categories of health care staff.  There should also be an improvement with a greater public awareness campaign.  The Coeliac Society of Ireland gets involved in a coeliac awareness day every year.  It is very difficult to reach everyone without spending a lot of money on expensive media campaigns.  However, that could be a way of improving awareness.<\/p> <p> Deputy Kelleher also asked about vitamin absorption in women of child-bearing age.  This probably goes back to the same point on awareness.  Improved awareness is a key issue.  Everyone here is probably aware of the recommended need to take folic acid supplements when considering pregnancy to reduce the risk of neuro-tube defects.  If a person has active coeliac disease, the absorption rate of these folic acid supplements will be lower.  That is something else people need to know.  People with undiagnosed coeliac disease think they are doing their best by taking 400 mg folic acid a day, but it is not going to be absorbed properly and it is not going to have the desired effect.  In undiagnosed coeliac disease, there has been research in a number of countries showing an increased rate of neuro-tube defects occurring in people with undiagnosed coeliac disease who do become pregnant.<\/p> <p> Deputy Kelleher asked about the need for inspection and whether training was needed for people working in restaurants.  Training is required.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland does offer training for HACCP and it includes a certain amount in that training about gluten.  However, it is not a specific training programme about gluten and its importance to people on a gluten-free diet.  The focus of such training programmes on coeliac disease could be improved.  The Coeliac Society of Ireland met the Food Safety Authority of Ireland with that hope in mind two years ago but has not made much progress in getting a better training programme designed.  In the UK, the coeliac society has developed a training programme for caterers and those involved in food service.  It is possible to take this online.  It issues a certificate of completion for online completion.  There are other models that could be used in Ireland.  The UK coeliac training programme is not entirely suitable for Ireland because of some of the different ways of doing things here but it could be adapted.<\/p> <p> I am not sure if there were any other issues which Deputy Kelleher raised which I could answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500008#K00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Nicholas Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421317500,"counter":916,"content":"<p>Following up on the pregnancy issue, a paper was published in 2014 that showed in 1,000 women a significant increase in the risk of spontaneous abortion and premature delivery and at later age of menarche associated with coeliac disease.  There is quite a significant impact in terms of fertility and pregnancy.  There are probably many women who could be saved going through the fertility process if a GP did a simple blood test in terms of an early screening process.  There are definitely savings to be made in terms of IVF, both for people who have to do it privately or via the public sector.<\/p>  <p>  I am a dietician and previous president of the Irish Nutrition &amp;amp; Dietetic Institute, INDI.

Screening is not going to pick up coeliac disease for an individual until he or she develops it.  Even though a person may be born with the genetic potential of coeliac disease, he or she may never develop it.  Therefore, screening on a regular basis is not necessary.  Population screening has not proven a realistic prospect in any country because of the relatively low pick-up rate.  However, specific groups should be screened.  That is in recommendations that have been published over many years and it is not being carried out properly in this country.  There are recommendations about screening that are scientifically based and they would be better used rather than not.<\/p>  <p>  Senator Burke asked about specialists.  Most gastroenterologists are quite capable of diagnosing coeliac disease.  I cannot give a figure for the number of gastroenterologists in practice, or the deficit, but I know that the endoscopy services are saturated.  If GPs think of coeliac disease and they need an endoscopy to prove it, there is going to be a wait.  There are different waiting times in different parts of the country.  Paediatric gastroenterology is a particularly difficult area.  There are particular areas in the country where the waiting times for adult gastroenterology are longer.  A person does not need to be sub-specialised in coeliac disease, but it is true that all gastroenterologists are not equally interested in coeliac disease or equally aware of the large variety of presentations of coeliac disease.  It would be better if there was recurrent training for people with gastroenterology practices.  This is something that could be addressed through the Royal College of Physicians for continuing professional development design.<\/p>  <p>  The dieticians, equally, need to be trained.  Not all dieticians are aware of or efficient in dealing with coeliacs.  There is a lot of opportunity, or need, for training in many different areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500009#L01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Nicholas Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1421317500,"counter":926,"content":"<p>Will Professor Kennedy comment on the current provision in terms of coeliac clinics?

Huntington's Disease is a genetic neurodegenerative life-limiting condition that leads to progressive physical, cognitive and emotional symptoms.  Each child of a parent with the HD gene has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition.  It usually presents between the ages of 30 and 50 years and can cause serious psycho-social consequences for affected families.  It can impact inter-personal relationships, parenting, family planning, employment, future health and well being, and access to insurance and mortgages.<\/p>  <p>  Juvenile Huntington's disease may occur in 10% of cases, with onset before 20 years of age.  A Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland member and family carer described HD as, \"A combination of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and motor neuron disease with the added horror of transmitting the disease to your children\".<\/p>  <p>  There are often complicated dynamics within HD families.  Emotions such as anger, resentment and guilt are often seen along with a high level of care, commitment and resilience.  For a significant period of the person&rsquo;s life, family members are the main care givers.  I will read some case studies to display the scenario of Huntington's disease among families.<\/p> <p>Anna is 67 years old.  She was a carer to her husband for ten years before he needed full-time nursing home care in 2007.  She is his next of kin and regularly visits and cares for him in his nursing home.  Her two twin adult children who in their thirties are now also symptomatic.  One has moved back to the family home and is currently being cared for by Anna.  The other has been in a psychiatric hospital for almost two years.  An acute psychiatric hospital is an inappropriate environment long term but funding for suitable long-term care at Bloomfield Hospital has been refused.  Other long-term care facilities have so far refused to accept this patient due to her complex symptoms. <\/p> <p> Tony is 68 years old.  His mood and personality began to change in his early fifties.  He and his family spent seven difficult years not knowing what was causing these changes until he was eventually diagnosed with HD.  Four of his five children went through the predictive testing process and all four tested positive for the HD gene.  His four children will therefore develop HD unless a suitable treatment is available in time.  He has a fifth child and six grandchildren with a 50% risk of developing HD.  That is the uniqueness of Huntingdon's disease.  It goes through families and generations of families.  <\/p> <p> There are a number of gaps in existing services.  The major issue is an urgent need for prevalence studies in Ireland so that services may be planned in an accurate manner.  People have difficulty getting medical cards.  HD symptoms including apathy and lack of initiation can prevent some HD patients from filling out application forms.  Genetic services is an area of concern.  We are concerned that the change in designation of the National Centre for Medical Genetics will have an impact on adult genetic testing and on regional services in Cork, Galway and Limerick.  <\/p> <p> Turning to mental health services, general adult psychiatry teams are often ill-equipped to provide specialist services to those impacted by HD.  Specialist education and clinical mental health support programs are needed for medical and allied health professionals.  Bloomfield Health Services have developed multidisciplinary experience and expertise in caring for those with HD and they provide a range of necessary mental health services.  <\/p> <p> With regard to neurology and neuro-rehabilitation services, currently the majority of people with HD do not receive timely referrals to rehabilitation therapists.  Often referrals come too late when function has already significantly deteriorated and the complexities of neuro-psychiatric and cognitive symptoms have alienated people from their loved ones.<\/p> <p> With regard to care services, ideally people with HD will remain in their own home for as long as possible.  However, this is dependent on comprehensive home care supports, respite care, community rehabilitation, specialist mental health services and palliative care support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500010#M00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Towey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421318700,"counter":935,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt Ms Towey, but there is a vote in the D&aacute;il so could we hear the end of her presentation as we must suspend the meeting?

I have submitted a written document which is a bit long and from which I will provide the committee with highlights.  As a neuropsychologist, I have worked directly with Huntington's disease patients for over 17 years from pre-symptomatic stages through their disease progression.  I have sat with them at the late stage and end of life.  It is impossible to overstate the devastating nature of this condition for patients and their unaffected families and friends.<\/p>  <p>  The committee heard a little bit from Ms Patricia Towey a moment ago, but I would like to begin by restating a brief overview to set the context as to what Huntington's is.  It is an inherited, progressive and incurable brain disease and it is due to an extended mutation in a gene inherited from an affected parent.  Each child of an affected parent has a 50-50 chance of getting this disease.  If one gets the gene, one will have the disease.  While the specific features about the onset and speed of progression vary with the size of the genetic mutation that is inherited, most people develop symptoms in their 40s.  Many will have had subtle difficulties prior to that stage.  The disease progresses very steadily over approximately 20 years and in the last few years of life most patients will require 24-hour care.  Unfortunately, most patients have witnessed their parents, aunts, uncles, cousins and siblings with the disease and in many cases will witness the horror themselves of seeing their own children diagnosed with it.  Many, however, will not live to see their children symptomatic of the disease.  Unaffected spouses and siblings bear the brunt of the burden of care with many spouses caring for their in-laws, their own spouses and, unfortunately, their own children.  The burden is unsustainable and in many cases there are no support or community services for patients.<\/p>  <p>  Huntington's disease is rare, but its prevalence is higher than motor neuron disease, with which members will be familiar from the recent ice bucket challenges.  Patients live longer and have a greater burden of care as they live.  Multiple family members are affected across several generations.  Approximately 700 people are diagnosed in Ireland currently with Huntington's disease while hundreds more suffer its effects.  HD is a devastating disease.  It robs the individual of almost all aspects of the self and of dignity.  Patients present with a triad of a movement disorder, psychiatric difficulties and cognitive impairment leading to dementia.  The movement disorder results in uncontrollable muscle jerks and spasms in almost all muscle groups making it impossible for patients to continue to walk unaided, sit comfortably without injury or even to eat and function independently.  Many suffer multiple choking episodes and death is due to aspiration pneumonia.<\/p>  <p>  The psychiatric and cognitive difficulties limit education and occupation early in the disease and result in the need for frequent periods of care and support although little is available in Ireland.  Patients suffer depression with high rates of suicide, psychosis and complex patterns of cognitive impairment which limit their capacity for independent living and place them at risk of homelessness.  The disease results in significant weight loss, speech difficulties and reduced mobility.  The rate of decline of the triad of symptoms varies within and between patients and, as such, the needs of patients differ at different points in time as the disease progresses.  Mental capacity is affected due to the psychiatric and cognitive symptoms, which in turn affect the person's ability to make decisions on complex issues, increasing vulnerability.<\/p>  <p>  For many, there is a hopelessness around Huntington's disease, but these patients bear their illness with such dignity that it is humbling.  For many, the illness carries a stigma, and few HD patients will talk about their illness or campaign for funding.  One rarely sees events or fundraising for HD and, as such, the HD community has no voice.  We must ensure that we care for and help the most vulnerable people in our community in a dignified and appropriate manner.  The standard of care in HD anywhere must be flexible; a responsive multidisciplinary team that can meet the needs of patients from diagnosis through the various manifestations of their illness.  Such a team should provide care and support for unaffected family members and also have a basis of research.<\/p>  <p>  There is no cure for Huntington's disease.  The management of the disease requires the responsive treatment of symptoms as they arise.  Patients require experienced and expert multidisciplinary team members.  I worked with such a team in London and the benefits for patients and their families were immeasurable.  Patients were treated in a timely manner by a fully accessible team and they built relationships with team members over many years before the need for hospitalisation and palliative care arose.  Research is essential to understand the nature and course of this illness and there are a number of international trials underway.  It has been very difficult recently for Irish patients to engage in these due in part to the lack of any centralised clinic and funding for the early stages of projects.  In Beaumont Hospital, we have just signed up to the Enroll-HD project which is a new international observational trial that will accelerate development of therapies for HD.  This should provide a great opportunity for patients.<\/p>  <p>  We have no dedicated multidisciplinary team in Ireland and limited access to specialist knowledge.  We have limited access to long-term care beds with expert knowledge.  The model of care in the national ALS clinic in Beaumont run by Professor Hardiman is an excellent one which has greatly benefitted motor neuron patients who attend in terms of life expectancy, disease progression and quality of life.  It stimulated a national register and long-scale longitudinal research.  We have a limited clinic in Beaumont Hospital but it is falling far short of the needs of patients.  It is provided out of existing resources and we have no separate funding for it.  As a group, we would like to propose a model involving three centres based in Dublin, Cork and Galway, staffed by full multidisciplinary team members with ease of access from primary and secondary services.  Patients require access to specialist late stage and palliative care and we envisage this all being undertaken in collaboration with the Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland.  It would enable patients and their families to have quick access to facilities.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, we need to provide services as a matter of urgency.  Patients are struggling desperately and scrabbling for all the care they can get.  It is not available in Ireland currently.  We must meet the needs of patients at various stages of the disease and provide respite beds for their families and themselves.  We need a dedicated late stage facility for the appropriate and dignified palliative care of these vulnerable patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500012#P00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Pender"},{"type":"speech","time":1421319300,"counter":948,"content":"<p>I joint the Vice Chairman in welcoming the panel this morning.  We have a number of sessions here today, but the written and oral submissions Ms Towey and Dr. Pender have made have had a huge impact, certainly on me personally and, I have no doubt, on my colleagues on the committee.  It does not take a great deal of analysis for us to realise just how devastating this diagnosis must be.  All four panel witnesses by their respective contributions have made that abundantly clear.<\/p>  <p>  There can be no question as to the need for the committee to reflect this directly to the Minister, the Department and the HSE.  This is a diagnosis that could present in anyone's life.  I note that Dr. Pender indicated that approximately 700 families are affected.  Of course, with a 50% chance presenting, that could expand exponentially.  There is no question about that.  How many people are directly affected?  How many people does that translate into?  Forgive me for having returned a little late from the vote, but I did not hear the earlier part of Dr. Pender's presentation.  Is it the case that the diagnosis is reflective of particular points in the development of life and age groupings?  The manifestation of the symptoms is in later life, I understand, but Dr. Pender can correct me if I am wrong.  The diagnosis can be made even though the symptoms have not yet presented.  I do not want to cause any upset, but are there clusters in certain parts of the country and areas where the disease is more prevalent?  If so, are there obvious explanations for this?<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the work of the Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland, or HDAI, the health canvas is huge as we have noted already today.  I can only imagine that the role of the HDAI is crucial in supporting these families and individuals.<\/p> <p>I am concerned about the difficulties the HDAI may have in carrying out its work.  Can Ms Towey tell me what is currently provided by State subvention and support?  The association is the national resource centre for people impacted by Huntington's disease.  Does it translate into a physical structure?  Is there outreach work?  Do people work in a centre?  Can people go to a building or structure?  I want to hear about a more expanded profile of the HDAI.  <\/p> <p> There are existing sites in Dublin, Cork and Galway and the association has proposed that these are developed in terms of multidisciplinary provision and supports.  Can the delegation list areas that should be prioritised?  Should neurology and psychology services be prioritised?  Please give us a sense of the association's priorities.  I appreciate that these things are required.  I want the critical deficiencies at this moment in time identified and prioritised.<\/p> <p> Does the HDAI have a corresponding organisation north of the Border?  If so, what is the extent of its engagement with same?  There are clinics or existing sites which offer support in Dublin, Galway and Cork.  In terms of the rest of the island, is there a similar facility in Belfast?  Is there more than one such facility?  I am unaware of that detail.  Is there any level of interaction, co-operation or supports that could be enhanced through greater co-opertion between North and South?  This committee will travel, in a short number of weeks, to meet its counterparts in the Northern Ireland Executive.  That is why I want to learn what further impact we could make, not only here in this institution but to share it with elected colleagues, of all opinions, north of the Border. <\/p> <p> I shall leave it at that.  I sincerely thank the witnesses who came before us this morning to discuss Huntington's disease. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500012#P00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421319900,"counter":950,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and for the submissions they made in advance of the presentations.  I know a family friend who has Huntington's disease.  The case studies provided touched on the point raised by Dr. Pender, the fact that one rarely hears about fund-raising or awareness raising outside of the circles where Huntington's disease is present.  Therefore, it is important we hear more about the illness because it will give us a greater insight.  The case studies are based on real people but we still must hear them.  The evidence provided is equally important.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to ask questions on three areas.  My first question is on the Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland.  I note, from the submission, that the association is comprised of 1.5 full-time staff or whole-time equivalents.  Any of us who have read these professional presentations and heard the evidence provided will be surprised by the number of staff.  In terms of the number of families who seek support and the importance to raise awareness, where does the association currently get its funding from?  Some funding comes from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government through the scheme to support national voluntary organisations.  I apologise for the fact that the Department keeps changing the name of the scheme, which is an important one for community and voluntary organisations.  The funding the association received through the scheme was cut last year and had to be re-instated for a two-year period.  Equally, here we have talked about section 38 and section 39 organisations.  When we hear the amount of funding provided we will all be shocked that there is not more State funding being spent considering the important work that is done by the organisation.  It would be good for us to hear the amount.  All too often we hear about large amounts of funding being spent.  Unfortunately, the association has nowhere near enough funding and that is an issue we must raise.<\/p>  <p>  When I read the submissions I tried to work out what recommendations the committee should make.  During the short break earlier I conducted a small poll on the people in the Visitors Gallery.  My understanding is that we should concentrate and co-ordinate our services into, as was suggested to me, Bloomfield Health Services or a multidisciplinary service.  I asked people in the Visitors Gallery the question and now I shall ask the witnesses the same question.  Normally, we hear how important it is to access services locally.  I understand,  which I want confirmed, is that people are willing to travel if they knew a multidisciplinary team and supports were available.  Therefore, we should recommend that the State invests in these types of services.  I want to be sure about the matter.  If the committee agrees on points we need to know when we will be supported.  I do not have a constituency but my colleagues do and support is an issue that can arise.<\/p>  <p>  Is a genetic unit planned for the new children's hospital?  Have the witnesses been involved in scoping or a needs assessment?  I assume the new children's hospital will include such a unit but perhaps I am wrong.  It is an important issue.  This committee  visited the site of the national children's hospital and we plan to continue to engage in discussions about the hospital.  What recommendations should the committee make about the children's hospital and specifically about a genetics unit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500013#Q00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1421319900,"counter":951,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming here to deal with this issue.  Both presentations referred to a need to develop a facility in Cork.  Has a consultation or discussion taken place?  There are three hospitals in Cork city.  Has a suitable unit been identified to deal with this matter on a long-term basis?  Is a new unit just a proposal and no discussion has taken place?  Can the proposal be advanced?  How can we advance the matter?<\/p>  <p>  I wish to mention research.  I note that Dr. Pender mentioned that Beaumont Hospital has signed up to the Enroll-HD research programme.  How can this committee ensure we benefit from such research?  How can we ensure Ireland becomes involved in the research?  If Ireland is involved in research then we can benefit from the results in the long term.  What deficiencies prevent us from getting involved in research?  How can we resolve the matter?  <\/p>  <p>  Access to medical cards is of major importance to families.  What recommendation can this committee make that will assist families who need medical assistance?  A diagnosis of Huntington's disease does not go away because a person has it for life.  Therefore, it is very important that people have unlimited access to services and a medical card can give assistance in this regard.  What can this committee do to help the situation?  We are talking about 700 people which is a big number in real terms but not in the context of the overall cost of over 1.9 million medical cards.  The committee could make a recommendation.  I ask the witnesses to let us know how we can assist them in dealing with the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500013#Q00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1421319900,"counter":952,"content":"<p>I apologise for not being here for the beginning of the presentation.<\/p>  <p>   My queries relates to the 700 people that were mentioned.  Senator Colm Burke has already asked a question on research and what the committee can do to pursue the matter.  <\/p>  <p>  I have only met one person with the disease.  She was a very young girl and it was difficult to see the type of life she had.  The Senator and I, along with many members here, will fondly remember our two colleagues, Deputy Nicky McFadden and Councillor Mary Harty.<\/p> <p>Mary was a councillor and Nicky a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, and motor neuron disease had an enormous effect on their lives and that of their families.  I have only met one person with Huntington's disease, whose whole life fell apart in a very short space of time.  <\/p> <p> The witnesses have said that there is no dedicated team to deal with this, and I would like to know why that is the case.  Is it because of a lack of funding or a lack of expertise on the part of medical personnel?  Obviously people are being treated, not by a dedicated team, but through the mainstream health services.  It seems that they are only getting the crumbs from the table.  <\/p> <p> I have no other questions.  I agree with what Senator Burke said about the importance of research both here and abroad.

I read through the submissions last night but it is important that we hear the real-life stories, because this is about real people in real situations.<\/p>  <p>  A number of issues struck me, the first being the fact that when the disease is diagnosed in a family, it has an enormous knock-on effect down through the generations.  It can affect families into the future in the context of securing mortgages and work and can change a family's whole lifestyle.  I note that most of those who are diagnosed with the disease are cared for at home by family members.  However, when it reaches a point at which the person needs to move into full-time care, there seems to be a real difficulty.  In one of the stories, the wife of a sufferer was given a list of 40 nursing homes but only four of those could actually take a person with his particular care needs.  That does not leave people with a whole pile of options.<\/p>  <p>  I also noted the point made in one of the presentations today that patients in Ireland can be admitted to psychiatric hospitals due to being refused by other long-term care facilities.  What are the reasons for that, other than a shortage of funding?  Are the staff in psychiatric hospitals trained to provide for the other specific care needs of people with this disease?  <\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to clinical trials and the fact that 1,200 people are going to Europe to take part.  We do not have anyone from Ireland going, nor do we have any special care units here.  Is there any particular reason why Irish patients cannot participate in the trials?  The witnesses made comparisons with Scotland, which has a similar population size.  The Scots have seven dedicated HD clinics and nine HD specialist centres.  The Scottish Huntington's Disease Association has a staff complement of 30, in comparison with 1.5 here.  Is it the case that there are thousands of families in Scotland with Huntington's disease?  Why are we so far behind?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500014#R00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1421320500,"counter":955,"content":"<p>Please accept my apologies for not being present at the beginning of the presentation.  This is an extraordinarily cruel disease.  The word \"cruelty\" repeatedly springs to mind.  It is as if nature conspired to make something about as bad as it can be.  One can only imagine the horror of most people on understanding that they have the disease and on seeing their future, both in terms of the genetic consequences and the actual physical decline.  Being pessimistic about it, there is no huge optimism that in the short term there will be a great treatment for the disease.  Hopefully there will be.  I live in the world of research and one hopes that things will improve.  We should support research and make sure it is available to our patients.  We may or may not get a pay-off from doing research, but we could get a pay-off tomorrow from fixing the social supports for these people.  About 90% of what can be palliated, theoretically, could be palliated if we had the will to do so.  We are not waiting for anybody to discover something.  All we basically need is to have enough support facilities for people who are in a phase of their illness which can be managed at home with augmented support, to give some degree of relief to their incredibly hard-pressed family members.<\/p>  <p>  I ask that the witnesses quantify something for me, and I apologise if they have already done so during the course of their presentation.  How many dedicated inpatient bed equivalent units do we need for people who are in the final stages of the disease, when it becomes very difficult for people, with the best will in the world, to look after a severely disabled, advanced HD patient at home?  What would we need?  How many beds would we need?  I also ask the witnesses to give us a broad outline of a person's life expectancy after he or she becomes totally disabled and entirely dependent.  What is the average length of the phase during which a person is exhibiting symptoms but can still maintain a fairly high degree of self-care?  That would be very useful information to have.  I have a suspicion that there are two very simple numbers here, one of which is how many beds or inpatient units we need and the other of which is how many extra carers we need so that people can get some respite during the phase of their lives when they are being cared for at home.  I suspect that what is needed is not incredibly expensive.  I can tell the committee one thing we could do tomorrow which would help, and I have raised this before.  We can say that all those people with Huntington's disease will automatically get a medical card.  I cannot understand why that is not the case now.  I do not care how rich or how well-off these people are.  Given the level of support they need, they should not have to worry about getting or losing a medical card.  It is a very uncommon disease and such a measure would not impose a huge economic burden on society.  <\/p>  <p>  I thank the witnesses for the great work they are doing.  I hope we will see advances in the treatment of this disease, but we must consider the worst-case scenario - maybe we will not.  Finally, I have one more tougher question.  Is there much prenatal testing being done in Ireland?  Do we have adequate support services for people who may wish to explore the route of prenatal testing, with all of its implications?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500014#R00300","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1421320500,"counter":956,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations and the documentation they submitted to us prior to this meeting.

We have not mastered the art of bilocation here yet.  I have a number of questions and observations to make.  I have received a number of e-mails from people with Huntington's disease and their family members.  They are concerned about a number of issues.  As Professor Crown has said, we must look at the worst-case scenario but also deal with where we are currently in terms of many of those with Huntington's disease.  Speech and language therapy, physical and occupational therapy, neuropsychology and social work services are the key areas about which Huntington's disease patients and their families are concerned.  Family members need supports.  The patients themselves obviously need support, but their families also need a broad support base around them as well.  Where are we in the context of developing individual care plans or pathways?  Such plans are commonly espoused for people with rare diseases.  Clinical care plans need to be put in place, particularly in the context of a lack of nursing homes that are capable of dealing with a person who has Huntington's disease.  How far down that road are we at present?<\/p> <p>People with Huntington's disease, motor neuron disease and many other neurological diseases cannot get medical cards until they are in the very final stages of a very debilitating illness.  Clearly, we have to look at that.  Reference was made to the fact that it places a very small burden on the State but a huge burden on a family.  We must tip the balance in favour of the individuals and families concerned with these particular illnesses and diseases.<\/p> <p> Reference has been made to genetic testing.  Senator Crown mentioned how cruel the disease is.  It is bad enough to have to deal with one's own illness, but there is also the issue of knowing it could be passed on to the next generation.  Is genetic testing automatically provided to a family where there is a diagnosis of Huntington's disease?  Is there a cost implication or is it always provided by the State?  In the context of international research, it is often the case with rarer diseases that we will never have the capacity to do enough research here on our own.  We do not have a large enough pool of people, enough clinical expertise or sufficient research facilities.  How far down the road are we in terms of linking in internationally?  We will meet the Commissioner next week, and I note this is an area where the European Union should play a greater role in driving medical research to ensure there is a link among researchers around Europe.  Where are we in those terms?<\/p> <p> For the organisation supporting people with Huntington's disease and their families, respite and social care are very important.

We are slowly beginning with our fledgling service to reach out to the community.  Ms Towey is aware of at least 700 people, perhaps 450 of whom are active on her casebook.  Together, we need to come up with a solution for developing a network and a database, and we can have people access services from there or tie into research.  That is very important.<\/p>  <p>  We were asked about clusters.  There are definitely pedigrees.  As Professor Crown knows, we have a great deal of inflammatory bowel disease and many other diseases in terms of which Ireland is unique, according to population studies.  With Huntington's, we do not know yet.  We hear of pedigrees and of areas of the country, but we are getting referrals from all over the country at the moment.  We have been working very closely with the team up North, where a new neurologist started in April who has an interest in Huntington's disease and who moved from the Mater here.  The team in the North has two clinical nurse specialists and we at Bloomfield are training one clinical nurse specialist in Huntington's disease.

The Huntington's Disease Association in Northern Ireland has two people employed and two specialist nurses.  There are some linkages.  We had a joint youth group and a youth camp.  It is very important to link people in at an early stage, as Dr. Pender noted.  Having people connected through youth activities can keep them linked into a service and perhaps eliminate some fear for the future.  Dr. Pender mentioned clinics he worked with where families were supported for years, and that is what needs to happen in Ireland, as people are often in denial due to the cognitive aspects of the condition and do not seek the services they need.  They can alienate themselves from family members and it is important that they are linked in as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Northern Ireland had some funding to develop youth services and to look at needs in that regard.  To compare, however, Scotland has three youth workers in place and the Scottish association has many specialist clinics.  I do not necessarily think that there are clusters as such, but there is a remote part of Scotland where there is a higher prevalence of Huntington's disease.  There is anecdotal suggestion, as Professor Morrison has mentioned, that people might have moved there from Donegal.

We have a part-time family support officer and she tries to facilitate support groups in Cork, Limerick, the west of Ireland and Dublin.  She provides one-to-one support for people and in particular seeks to meet people when there is a diagnosis in a family or where a person is going through the predictive testing process.<\/p>  <p>  Diagnostic testing is where symptoms have already emerged, but people can choose to find out whether they have the gene.

It will change at different rates.  Sometimes a patient will need a psychiatric service, while at other times he or she will have movement issues, physical issues or dementia.  In terms of the staging process, there will be many years when the patient will be well, depending on when he or she gets the gene tested.

This matter was discussed in a Topical Issue debate in the D&aacute;il yesterday and is also the subject of the Private Members' motion in the D&aacute;il this week.  At present, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, is covering for me for the second part of the Private Members' motion debate in the D&aacute;il.  Rather than repeating everything I said yesterday I thought I would keep it quite short to allow Mr. O'Brien to give a more detailed statement and also allow time for questions and perhaps a free-flowing discussion on some of the solutions to this very long-standing problem.<\/p>  <p>  At eight o'clock this morning 256 people were on trolleys, of which 141 had been on trolleys for more than nine hours; it is after nine hours that it becomes a patient safety issue.  Most of these people will be in beds by tonight and the number is continuing to fall.  Within this is huge variation.  In the midland regional hospitals in Mullingar, Portlaoise and Tullamore, in Kerry General Hospital and in Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown nobody was on trolleys for more than nine hours this morning.  In St Vincent's University Hospital, Tallaght hospital , St. James's Hospital, University Hospital Waterford, Letterkenny General Hospital and South Tipperary General Hospital in Clonmel only one person was on a trolley, whereas in Beaumont Hospital the number was 22 and in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital it was 25.  There is long-standing chronic overcrowding in Beaumont Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which has been going on for as long as I can remember, certainly since I was working in Beaumont Hospital which is a long time ago.  There are also hospitals which are not always in difficulty but are at present, such as University Hospital Galway and Portiuncula Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  When comparing year on year we tend to compare the day of the week, with regard to seasonal factors and the time of the year.  To use the special delivery unit's numbers, on this day of the week last year 280 people were on trolleys, so the number is lower than it was this time last year.  If we use the trolley watch figures of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, to compare the third Thursday in January going back historically, 244 people on trolleys were on this morning and the last time it was that low was in 2005.  Based on these figures, comparing like with like, it is at its lowest level in ten years.  Ward watch includes patients on trolleys in wards, which is done in some hospitals to relieve pressure on emergency departments.  These figures have been collected for the past two years so they do not compare like with like, but if I were to use statistics against me and make us look as bad as possible the figure is still lower than it was in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011.<\/p>  <p>  It is fair to say the actions which have been put in place by hospitals, the HSE, social care and departments have worked, and I want to express my appreciation to HSE management, hospital staff, social care in particular, and nursing homes for pulling out all the stops over the past while to deal with this surge.  I have been looking back over numbers, and surges are not as predictable as one might think.  Some people refer to \"black Wednesday\", which is the worst Wednesday in January, which does happen, but it happened a week earlier this year for a number of reasons, particularly the fact there was a very long Christmas period this year compared to previous years.  Surges can happen at other times and we have had peaks in previous years in February, March, April and May which were often linked to respiratory illness and an increase in presentation as a result of this.  We are not taking anything for granted and I guarantee the committee there is no level of complacency.<\/p>  <p>  At present approximately 140 people are on trolleys for more than nine hours, and this figure generally reduces to 100 at the end of the day.  We are back to what has been normal in Ireland for the best part of ten years, but I do not accept it should be normal.  Almost every country in the world has surges of patients, which mean that from time to time patients are on trolleys.  Various countries have various ways of dealing with this.  In a number of hospitals in Ireland we have a chronic overcrowding problem, which has been going on for the best part of 15 years.  When a surge occurs it becomes a total disaster, which is what we need to focus on resolving once and for all over the coming months.  This is what the emergency department task force, co-chaired by Dr. Tony O'Connell of the HSE and Mr. Liam Doran of the INMO, will do.  It will dust down old plans which were not implemented and come up with new plans.  We will focus on this over the coming months and try to get into a position where trolleys are unusual by the summer, which will give us some headroom going into next winter.<\/p>  <p>  This is not straightforward as there is no single solution to this.  Delayed discharges are a big part of the picture; hundreds of people in our hospitals could go home if circumstances were right, but this is not what it is all about.  Beaumont Hospital has as many delayed discharges as St. James's Hospital, but while St. James's Hospital rarely has people on trolleys for more than a few hours Beaumont Hospital always does.  Letterkenny General Hospital has no delayed discharges and has had people on trolleys for a period of time.  Cavan General Hospital has 15 or 17 delayed discharges but rarely has people on trolleys.  Many factors are at play and delayed discharges are just part of it.  Some of it is down to patient flow, management or any number of issues, and it is not simple.  One can solve a problem in one place in health but create another one in another area.  An element of this is happening at present because elective surgeries have been postponed, which adds to surgical waiting lists.  Elective surgery is always pulled back a bit in January, so it is not as bad as it may seem, but it certainly will create another problem down the line.  In health one is always fighting on all fronts, but I guarantee the committee we are all up for it.<\/p>  <p>  Through the task force we want to redevelop a partnership approach to addressing this problem involving the Department, the HSE, clinical programmes, key physicians and the unions representing management and nursing.  We also have a patient representative on the task force, Mr. Stephen McMahon, which is an important addition.<\/p>  <p>  I had two concerns going into this week.  One was the junior doctor changeover, which went well, and the other was influenza.  It is the case that influenza-like illness rates have risen from 15.5 per 100,000 to 29 per 100,000 this week.<\/p> <p> We are seeing an influenza outbreak and, obviously, the advice is what it always is, namely, people who are high risk should get vaccinated.  GPs are being asked to prescribe Tamiflu, the antiviral medicine, to those presenting with influenza like illnesses in high risk groups, and we are asking everyone to do what needs to be done to prevent the spread of influenza.  That includes covering one's mouth with a tissue when one coughs or sneezes, disposing of the dirty tissue at the earliest opportunity and cleaning one's hands because the illness is, of course, transmitted through contact and droplets.  At risk groups include people aged 65 years and older; people, including children, with chronic illness such as lung and heart disease, neurological disorders, diabetes and neurodevelopmental disorders; those with lowered immunity levels due to disease or treatment; all pregnant women, in respect of whom the vaccine can be given at any stage in pregnancy; those with morbid obesity, that is, a body mass index of greater than 40; residents of nursing homes, old people's homes and other long-stay facilities; and health care workers and others who care for those in at risk groups.

The pressures on emergency departments over the past two weeks are not new or unexpected.  As I have highlighted previously to this committee, the population over 65 years is growing by approximately 20,000 per year and the numbers of those aged over 80 years are increasing by 4% annually.  Due to reduced budgets over the past number of years, the development of the required capacity within our community services to deliver home help, home care packages, and short and long stay residential care has not kept pace with this demographic growth.  Furthermore, acute hospitals have experienced increased presentations and avoidable admissions, increased numbers of delayed discharges and unacceptable numbers of patients on trolleys in their emergency departments.<\/p>  <p>  The data inform us that the numbers of emergency presentations in 2014 are up 2% on 2013 and emergency admissions are up by 8% over the same period.  The main factor leading to the current emergency department pressures relates to higher numbers of delayed discharges in acute hospital beds when comparing this year to the same period last year.  On 6 January, 745 delayed discharges were reported across the acute hospital services.  This figure was approximately 150 more than at the same time last year and has led to a consequent increase in the numbers of patients on trolleys requiring admission, particularly in the first week of the year.  This was despite hospital and community investments in transitional care beds during the course of 2014.<\/p>  <p>  Winter planning is an embedded response within acute hospitals and community services.  In order to manage increased demands, hospitals have been required to be at a state of escalation since autumn 2014.  This is part of the normal planning in place to deal with the expected surge in demand in emergency departments whereby hospitals invoke escalation plans which include the opening of additional overflow areas, curtailing non-emergency surgery, providing additional diagnostics and working in an integrated way with their community service colleagues to strengthen discharge planning.  Hospitals have continued to take these steps since September 2014, as required, so that patients who need to be admitted to hospital are admitted to a bed at the earliest opportunity.  In preparation for the demands of the winter period, during the month of December the acute hospital system cancelled non-urgent elective activity to ensure maximum capacity to deal with emergency admissions.  Primary and social care services in particular escalated their plans to facilitate discharges through the provision of home care, aids and appliances, access to community hospital beds where available, etc.  In addition, the Minister for Health convened the emergency task force which supported the measures being undertaken by the hospital and community services to prepare for the anticipated additional demand for services during the key period post Christmas.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the increase in delayed discharges and the fact that sufficient funding has not been available for the past six years during the recessionary period, the Minister has managed to secure a total of &euro;25 million as part of the service plan for delayed discharge patients in 2015.  Preparatory work for its implementation commenced in November 2014 and additional resources were allocated for delayed discharges in December.  The full funding came on stream on 1 January 2015.<\/p>  <p>  As delayed discharge figures reached their highest level by the end of November 2014, an additional allocation of &euro;3 million was provided in December as an interim measure prior to the &euro;25 million coming on stream to enable the early release of the additional 300 fair deal approvals immediately.  This was in addition to the regular release of 700 places, bringing the overall allocation to 1,000 places for the full month of December 2014.  Also in December, 165 additional transitional care beds were funded and targeted at hospitals in the greater Dublin area to facilitate speedy discharges.<\/p>  <p>  Additional home supports were provided with a specific focus on supporting acute hospital discharge prior to the Christmas period.  During Christmas week, 120 home care packages were provided in total, with 87 related to patients in the acute hospitals.  The combined efforts of the above initiatives saw a net reduction of 109 delayed discharge patients with approximately 700 delayed discharges reported at the end of December 2014. <\/p>  <p>  The full &euro;25 million package is being implemented since January this year as follows.  An additional &euro;10 million for the nursing home support scheme will support in a full year the 300 extra places allocated in December 2014.  This has had the impact of reducing the placement list to 1,160 in the first week in January and reducing the funding delay for fair deal from 15 weeks to the current 11 weeks.  Short-stay residential care has been allocated &euro;8 million to provide an additional 115 short stay beds, of which 50 of have been earmarked for provision in private nursing homes for the greater Dublin area.  The remaining 65 beds will be opened in Mount Carmel on a phased basis commencing March or April 2015 as a dedicated community hospital for Dublin.  Home care packages were allocated &euro;5 million to provide 400 additional packages benefiting 600 discharges across targeted Dublin hospitals during the course of the year to facilitate patients to return to their own homes in the community.  Community intervention teams were allocated &euro;2 million to allow the service to expand its service levels in the greater Dublin region and deliver services to an additional 8,000 patient cases.  In addition, new services are being established in Kildare, Louth and Waterford, servicing the main hospitals in these regions and providing direct access to GPs and nursing homes, thereby facilitating patients who would otherwise have to attend hospital unnecessarily.  <\/p>  <p>  In response to the continuing pressures in our emergency departments, all of the focus of our efforts during the month of January has been to maximise the discharge of patients from our acute hospitals who have completed their acute treatment either to home with home care supports where required or to more appropriate residential care.  To achieve this we have sought to eliminate red tape as much as possible and during the month of January, as an exceptional measure, all patients who are clinically discharged but who require ongoing levels of residential care are being matched with suitable nursing home placements following clinical review.  This will see a potential movement of 250 patients who are currently in acute hospitals to other suitable facilities.<\/p>  <p>  While much of my previous commentary focused on delayed discharge as a factor, it is important to note that there are 28 emergency departments in Ireland and the challenges faced vary between each location.  For example, in Beaumont where there has been a persistent level of delayed discharges and a number of people on trolleys, there is a direct relationship with the shortage of residential capacity in north Dublin.  However, in Letterkenny, where over the weekend of the 3-5 January, 2015 there were over 31 people on trolleys, the problem was not related to delayed discharges but rather related to a particular spike in the number of unwell elderly presenting at the hospital.  Another example is St. Luke&rsquo;s in Kilkenny, which is a level three hospital with a very good reputation for integrated working across hospital and community and for maintaining low levels of delayed discharges and trolley waits.  On Monday, 5 January there were 22 patients on trolleys in that hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The current mainstream and integrated efforts at national level are enabling a cohesive and consistent response to cope with the demands.  The leadership role of clinical directors, consultants and nursing management in carrying out additional ward rounds and discharge planning is also proving effective in alleviating the pressures in emergency departments.  The role of primary care and social care in extending community intervention team coverage facilitates early discharge or hospital avoidance where possible and the use of public beds to decant patients from acute hospitals has contributed significantly in dealing with demand issues.<\/p> <p>Early release of nursing home support scheme funding arrangements in December, coupled with the provision of additional transitional care beds and additional home care packages allowed discharge to continue throughout the month of December and the crucial Christmas period.  At this point, nobody on the delayed discharge list is waiting for home care package funding.<\/p> <p> Collaboration across hospitals in terms of enabling bed access has also assisted in reducing delayed discharges.  Examples of this are the use of rehabilitation beds in Cappagh hospital by Connolly and Drogheda hospitals, the use of elective beds in Navan by Drogheda, and the optimisation of model 2 hospitals at Ennis, Nenagh, Bantry and Mallow, which contributes to alleviating waiting times for Limerick and the south west.  The ongoing escalation of matching patients, numbering 250, who are medically discharged with nursing home care placements is proving beneficial in yielding capacity.  There are recognised deficits in key service areas which support the discharge process, particularly of older people.<\/p> <p> The level of home help service provision has decreased significantly over the past number of years, from &euro;211 million to &euro;185 million.  Funding for home care packages has remained relatively static since 2008.  Public residential care beds are a key component of service provision and must be maintained at existing levels, despite impending issues with compliance on infrastructure.  Reliance on agency staff - medical and nursing - due to market conditions, together with associated challenges in terms of recruiting and retaining senior decision makers, is impacting on our ability to open additional capacity.<\/p> <p> The review of the nursing home support scheme currently being undertaken by the Department will need to suggest longer-term solutions to place the scheme on a sustainable footing, recognising the demand-led nature of the scheme and an aging population.  The development of the required capacity across primary and social care is essential to meet demographic growth in a predominantly elderly population.  The challenge for re-registration of public long-stay beds with HIQA is a significant issue to be dealt with over the coming months, as there is insufficient capital funding available to meet all the requirements.  There are over 30 large units providing in excess of 2,500 beds.  There is currently insufficient funding in the capital plan to bring this infrastructure to the required standard.<\/p> <p> I take this opportunity to acknowledge the discomfort and, in many cases, stress caused to patients and those who have experienced our accident and emergency departments over the past period and reassure them and the committee that we are doing everything possible to deal with the issue.  I also thank the staff, including nurses, doctors and others, in the service for their diligence, patience and hard work amid such difficult circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500019#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421323800,"counter":1006,"content":"<p>I will read to the committee from an e-mail I received some days ago on foot of the debate about overcrowding in our accident and emergency departments.  It states:<blockquote><br \/>My 76-year-old father was sent by our GP to an accident and emergency department in St. Vincent's Hospital on New Year's Eve.  He spent over 50 hours there on a trolley and we had to supply him with pillows and blankets.  He did not receive any hot food for the period endured.  There was bread and yoghurt for breakfast, a sandwich for lunch and another sandwich for tea every day.  Try to survive on that when you are well.  I sat on the floor by his trolley.  Barely able to breathe, he had to queue for the one available toilet and there were no washing facilities or privacy.  There were insufficient numbers of doctors and nurses as we continue to export our expensively trained Irish doctors and nurses to Australia.  Meanwhile, seriously ill people are scattered all over our inadequate emergency departments.<\/blockquote>The e-mail also highlights difficulties with parking, etc., but this is an indication of what is happening with our accident and emergency departments.  I should not need to tell Mr. O'Brien and the Minister about that, but I must reiterate it because that is unacceptable.  The accident and emergency task force is to deal with a potential impending crisis but, in effect, we knew for some time that this would happen.  The Minister was informed there would be difficulties when he took up his post and he was forewarned about this in November.  He was notified of cuts to the Fair Deal scheme and the difficulties in moving people from the acute hospital setting to step-down facilities, residential care and home care packages.  It is not Fianna F&aacute;il, me as Deputy Kelleher or any other Member that gave such a warning; it came from the HSE in its request for over &euro;100 million to deal with the delayed discharge element in our hospitals.  It is a critical matter.  We have spoken about other issues to be addressed, but the fundamental problem is that 650 to 800 people in our hospitals should not be there and do not want to be there.  They should be somewhere else.  If it is beyond our capability to shift people from an inappropriate setting to something more appropriate that will benefit them and others, I fear the worst.<br \/>I assume the task force relates to accident and emergency departments rather than being an &quot;emergency&quot; task force; if it is an emergency task force, it has not been very energetic in its responses.  I do not mean to criticise individuals but I would like to know how often it met to deal with the evident difficulties.  Had it planned to meet early in January?  Did it meet when we hit the magic number of 601 people on trolleys in accident and emergency departments?<br \/>I listened to a long lecture last night from the Minister, which was fine as we were in a political forum in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  We have now come to almost accept that 200 or 300 people lying around these departments is okay, but it is not.  Nobody should be lying around on trolleys and 76-year-old men should not be looking for sandwiches for sustenance.  That is not okay at all.  The number is one element, and as this went over the magic figure of 600 people have become outraged, leading to a response.  The response did not happen in December, when the event was being planned for; if we are honest, we know the response came after 601 people arrived in the accident and emergency departments.  It came on foot of headlines, and that is why numbers have decreased today.  As sure as night follows day, if 601 people were not in those hospital departments, we would not be having this discussion.  We would plod along if it was only the usual 300 or 400 people on trolleys.  There was no planned response whatever and instead there was an emergency action to try to reduce numbers.  Nevertheless, that demonstrates that when commitment, effort and minds come together, the number can be reduced without a problem.  If it is easy to get it down now, why could it not have been reduced three, four or six weeks ago?<br \/>Our level of acceptance of appalling standards for the sickest people is a problem.  We do not mind the worried people who are well waiting around, but the people who present at our accident and emergency departments, by and large, are not there for the craic.  They are certainly not there for food.  They have been sent or referred to the hospital because they are sick and need attention.  There are inappropriate and unacceptable standards now built into the system as the norm, but they are far from normal.  I am not trying to absolve the role of my political party over the years; there is almost a societal acceptance in this regard.  People are almost expected to lie on a trolley in an accident and emergency department for two or three days.  That is completely unacceptable.<br \/>It comes down to resourcing and priorities.  It is wrong to have 700 or 800 people in our hospitals who should not be there.  It makes no economic sense.  Some hospitals do not want sick patients when budgets run out, as sick patients cost money.  If hospitals come under pressure and their budgets are stopped, they cannot carry out procedures but they may keep beds full anyway.  This relates to the transfer policy for the Fair Deal nursing home scheme.<br \/>We know what the problem is: we cannot get people who should not be in hospitals out of them.  These people should be in step-down facilities, but there is a level of acceptance that 300 or 400 people will at any time be in accident and emergency departments.  This is where people must scrounge for pillows and a 76-year-old man must queue outside a single toilet in the morning hours.  His daughter had to lie on a corridor next to him for 50 hours.<\/p> <p>Then there is a response when there are 601 people waiting.  I assure Mr. O'Brien, the Minister, the committee and everybody else that if there were 547 or 552, there would not have been the same outrage.  However, when the number went over 600, suddenly people accepted that it is a major problem.  Whether it was 601 or 301 on Monday week last, it was still a problem for every person who was lying on a trolley and for those who were trying to provide them with care.<\/p> <p> I do not want to be pointing fingers at any individual.  This has been going on for years.  The Minister came in and lectured me last night for the first ten minutes of his speech about the historical aspect of it, but the norm now is 300 or 400, where we all are happy.  However, the number hit 601 and then the system clicked into gear.  My point is that, when it clicks into gear, the Minister can come in here and tell me that we have made significant progress.  Why could we not do that in November last when we all knew about it?  Why could we not do it the previous year, the three previous years, the previous 15 years?  Is it beyond our capability to deal with this in a planned, sustained manner and accept that it is an issue of resourcing as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500020#X00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421324400,"counter":1008,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kelleher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500021#Y00200","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1421324400,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>It was pointed out that some hospitals, while they have no delayed discharges, still have queues.  Of course they do, because there is a patient in every bed.  It is merely that these are not delayed discharges.  They are there for a reason but they are not considered delayed discharges.  The hospitals are at capacity.  They operate beyond capacity and it is no wonder these issues arise from time to time.  Let us accept it is a resourcing issue and a priority issue.<\/p>  <p>  Finally - this is not a criticism - the front-line staff have stated consistently that patient safety is being compromised and they stood outside the gate yesterday to highlight that.

The Minister referred to a trolley count of 244, but he failed to also mention that there were 72 further positions created on the wards, which creates an overcrowding situation, and these are not appropriate placements.  The total is 316 as of the commencement our meeting.<\/p>  <p>  This is not about trying to portray the Minister or the HSE in a negative light, as the Minister referred to in his opening remarks.  It is about people.  It is about patients in inappropriate circumstances, on trolleys and chairs, who are not at their best.  We must recognise that the situation is outrageous.<\/p>  <p>  On the figures provided by the INMO, I understand that, as happened under the tenure of the Minister's predecessor, these will now be officially accepted figures.  We used see a tug of war between one set of figures and another, almost on a daily basis.  I hope the Minister is not challenging what the INMO presents here as the factual position applying across each of these hospital sites.<\/p>  <p>  Whatever the Minister's view on the INMO, whatever his view on the voices that he will hear today, what about what Mr. Tony O'Brien stated here this morning?  In his presentation, Mr. O'Brien stated clearly that this was neither a new nor an unaccepted situation.  He is telling it exactly as it is.  He went on to state that due to reduced budgets over the past number of years, the required capacity, particularly in our community services, just simply is not there.  He also stated that there was insufficient capital funding available and that there was insufficient funding in the capital plan to bring the required infrastructure to the required standard.  Those are not merely messages for the committee.  Those are messages for all of us in political life, be it in government or in opposition.  It is critically important that Deputy Varadkar, as Minister, listen to and heed what Mr. O'Brien put on the record here this morning.  Mr. O'Brien is not defending the indefensible and he is not ignoring the problem; nor is the HSE.  The fact of the matter is they are strapped and they need, to repeat what has already been said, a re-evaluation of the resourcing.<\/p>  <p>  On the language used, it is clearly the case that there is great disappointment within the HSE at senior management level.  Mr. O'Brien stated that the Minister had managed to secure a total of &euro;25 million.  Perhaps Mr. O'Brien or any other representative here might shed light on it.  Is it not the case that &euro;106.5 million was properly and scientifically determined as the amount needed in order to avert the problem that has now presented?  Why is it that in this instance we are only looking at &euro;25 million, which quite clearly will not be able to address the problem as it must?<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister what immediate steps were agreed at the second meeting of the emergency department task force yesterday.  What immediate steps are now to be taken to ensure that there is the bed capacity and the required number of nursing staff?  It is important to emphasise the Minister cannot keep introducing beds while working with the current complement of nursing staff on the front line.  It just is not physically possible.  What steps are now to be taken to ensure that there is an immediate recruitment effort?  I refer not only to advertising for qualified nurses to return here from the neighbouring island and other settings, but to whether any consideration is being given to the significant number of former nursing staff who took early retirement options presented by the HSE and who live in the communities the length and breadth of the country, who are properly qualified, and who have the energy and wherewithal to step in at a moment's notice where an emergency presents.  Is any consideration given to looking at them as even an interim position pending an effective recruitment campaign?  I believe there is merit in examining that.  I know personally some of those who would willingly step forward.  If there are impediments or obstacles because of the circumstances of their departure under the offered early retirement packages, the Minister should overcome those problems, because the far greater problem is the need of those who, as we speak, are in inappropriate settings in the hospital emergency departments and on wards at hospital sites throughout the country.  Will the Minister outline the immediate steps that will be taken in terms of localised recruitment and how he will ensure the speedy movement towards recruitment for the 265 nursing posts currently marked as vacant?  Will he recognise that we cannot go forward with an increasingly elderly population with 5,000 fewer nurses than there were prior to 2008?<\/p> <p> Public residential care beds are a key component, as Mr. O'Brien stated.  He continued by saying that they must be retained at existing levels despite the impending issues with compliance and infrastructure.  I agree.  We all want to see the infrastructural needs addressed and the highest standards laid down by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, introduced, employed and sustained into the future.  However, we are continuing to reduce the public residential care bed capacity across the country.  My home county has only one such facility.  Due to the need to meet HIQA's determinations, welcome works have been undertaken, but with a reduced capacity.  This is not acceptable.  There is a total contradiction.  We will meet HIQA's requirements while blinkering ourselves to the facts that we have an ever-increasing ageing population and we will provide fewer beds.  It is long past time that the alarm bells were heard.  We need to act together.  I take no pleasure in taking a run at the Minister on any of these issues.  Far better would it be were I able to work with him and ensure that, together, we delivered a health system that was fit for purpose and of which we could be proud.  There is no room for pride in respect of our health services today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500021#Y00400","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421325000,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  Perhaps everyone knows the answer to my first question, but I could not find it.  Nine hours has been mentioned as the length of time over which someone in an emergency department should not remain on a trolley.  From where does this figure come?  In preparing for this meeting, I read the HSE's June 2012 report on the national emergency medicine programme.  It continually referred to a figure of six hours.  In the UK, the figure is four hours.  We are in a crisis, but we should be aiming for the best care.  On what basis have we determined that nine hours is okay and does the clock start when someone gets onto a bed or registers at the accident and emergency department?  Maybe everyone knows the answer, but it is not apparent to me.<\/p>  <p>  My colleagues have raised a number of issues around contributory factors and the interconnectedness of the health system, of which we are aware and which was highlighted in Mr. O'Brien's presentation, given the reduction in home help services and reliance on agency staff.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to residential care beds and community infrastructure.  The Minister raised the issue of delayed discharges.  Has he a further update on the implementation of the report prepared by the ESRI and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, for the Irish Heart Foundation, entitled, \"Towards Earlier Discharge, Better Outcomes, Lower Cost: Stroke Rehabilitation in Ireland\", with a view to taking a proactive approach?  The report showed how better outcomes could be achieved.  In the Seanad, the Minister committed to considering whether it could be piloted.  We should determine what can be done.<\/p>  <p>  Our previous session on Huntington's disease was compelling and many issues arose, one of which was that, as an unintended consequence of the situation in emergency departments, respite beds were not available.  Instead, they were being used to deal with this crisis.  Anyone who was present for the presentation on Huntington's disease - Senator Crown described it rightly as a cruel disease - would be appalled that respite care beds were not available because of this.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to address the issue of our ageing population, which Mr. O'Brien referred to, and nursing home care.  In the early hours of 20 December 2014, I was faced with the decision of whether to have my father transferred to hospital from a nursing home on the opinion of an out-of-hours doctor.  There is nothing a hospital can do for him.  We are sending people into emergency departments, which are not the right and fit places for them.  They go from one HSE service to another.  I feel about this personally because it happened in my own case, but I had to refuse the doctor's suggestion of a transfer repeatedly.  It was as if I was doing something against my father's health.  This is an issue for us.  The committee produced an excellent report on end-of-life care and made a number of good recommendations, for example, nurse prescribers, that could be implemented in nursing homes instead of relying on transferring people into emergency departments.  When we did that for my father in summer 2013, he spent 40 plus hours there.  He is high dependency and does not have a medical situation with which the hospital can support him.  He needs care, which is what he is getting now.  Thankfully, he survived the crisis and is still with us.<\/p>  <p>  Given the issue with end-of-life care, will the Minister revisit the recommendations of the committee's report?  He replied to the committee, but they are not being taken up properly.  We could save people from having to go through the trauma of presenting at emergency departments when doing so is not appropriate for their health care.  I have spoken of my personal case, but I know from friends that many people must face this decision.  Time and again they are told to send others to hospital.  The only pathway available is through an emergency department.  This is unacceptable.  A person goes from one HSE facility to another.

As they know, the Lourdes hospital in Drogheda in my constituency is one of those that the crisis has most affected.  I welcome the fact that the situation is improving and the number of patients waiting on hospital trolleys is decreasing.  I visited the accident and emergency department at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital on 7 January.  To be honest, the situation was terrible.  That said, I was hit by how the staff, particularly those on the front line, were working incredibly well.  I did not hear one patient complain about them.  They are performing brilliantly in difficult circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  We need sustainable and long-term solutions.  We in Louth have an immediate solution to the problem affecting Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  On 7 January, I also visited the Louth County Hospital in Dundalk with its new manager, Ms Louise O'Hare.  The hospital's accident and emergency department was closed in 2010 by the previous Government.  That decision was a mistake.  The problem facing us now in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is a testament to this.  I commend the Minister and Mr. O'Brien for facing problems head on and agree that we need real solutions to the overcrowding in the Lourdes hospital, for example, extending the opening hours of the minor injuries unit in Louth County Hospital, allowing ambulances to take patients directly to that unit, extending the supports available to home help systems and schemes and reinstating accident and emergency facilities in Louth County Hospital.  On my recent visit to that hospital, some 40 patients out of 60 were waiting for the fair deal scheme.  If we could accelerate that process, the situation would improve immediately.  I would also make 40 additional beds available there.<\/p>  <p>  Louth County Hospital was and is a brilliant facility, has fantastic potential and can be a sustainable solution to the overcrowding problem facing those of us in the north east.  Some 120 clinics are being held every week.  Will the Minister and Mr. O'Brien make me a commitment that full services, particularly accident and emergency services, will be reinstated in Louth County Hospital?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500022#Z00600","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1421325000,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>I will let Mr. O'Brien speak about the more operational areas, but I will make a few responses.  Deputy Kelleher suggested a few times that I was well capable of delivering a lecture.  He is quite good at it himself, so congratulations on that.<\/p> <p>One of the difficulties is that health care in Ireland is too politicised.  If there is a problem with a hospital in France, the people in the hospital are held accountable and if there is a problem with a trust in England, the trust is held accountable.  In Ireland it gets political very quickly and often it allows the people who are responsible to get away with not taking responsibility.  If we were to achieve anything in the next ten years - I do not expect it to happen in the next one or two years - it would be to de-politicise health a little and change the tone of the debate on health care.  Both the Government and the Opposition would benefit from that and, more importantly, patients and the public would benefit from a little less political anger and politicisation of health care.  Indeed, many of the things that should have been done in the past were not done for political reasons, because they were politically unpopular even though they were necessary changes.<\/p> <p> I agree with Deputy Kelleher on one point, that emergency department, ED, overcrowding in a number of hospitals has become normalised and almost acceptable for the last ten or 15 years.  However, it is not acceptable to me and I will continue to take a personal lead and give personal attention to it over the next few months.  Long after the parliamentary questions stop arriving, long after this committee has moved on to the latest issue in the news and long after the news media have moved on to other pressing issues, I will continue to have a focus on this and double down on it.  I am not promising I can fix it all, but I will give it the type of attention that no other Minister has given it in the past.<\/p> <p> I cannot account for why hot food and pillows were not provided in St. Vincent's.  Perhaps the local management can answer that.  I visited the hospital last week and it is running an excellent emergency department.  The use of technology by the consultants there is particularly impressive.  The hospital opened three five-bed overflow wards and since then the numbers have been under control.  I cannot tell why they were not opened earlier.  Perhaps it was a decision taken on the ground or it could not find nurses for it, but I cannot give the Deputy the detail on exactly what happens on any given day in 26 to 28 hospitals and I doubt that he would expect me to.<\/p> <p> The Deputy is correct that it is the emergency department task force, not an emergency task force.  It is established to deal with this issue in the medium term.  What happens every day is something different.  Every day, twice a day and, on one occasion, three times a day there is a conference call involving some of the senior directors who are with me here, the hospital group CEO, social care and so forth.  That is how the emergency response is co-ordinated.  It is not a meeting around a table, with everybody travelling to Dublin.  That is not how these things are done.  The CEO of the group hospital in Limerick must be in Limerick and the CEO in the west to be in Galway.  It is done through conference call, not as a round-table meeting with coffee, sandwiches and so forth.<\/p> <p> With regard to the request of the HSE, the Deputy knows how budgets work.  Every Department and agency puts forward its request and if one were to add up what every agency and Department requested, we would probably have to double the budget and people's taxes every year, which is not realistic.  The total request from the HSE was an additional &euro;1.4 billion, and that was to do everything we would all wish to do in health.  The committee members understand that every agency and Department cannot get everything they request.  In fact, no agency or Department ever gets everything it asks for in the budgetary round.  However, I was able to secure the first increase in the budget in seven years.  Under the previous Government the health budget was cut back by 20%.  Based on outturn, what was actually spent as opposed to what was estimated, the health spend has not been decreased at all under this Government and will increase slightly in 2015.  However, we were nowhere near being in a position to reverse the cutbacks that were made by the previous Government.<\/p> <p> In the meantime, demand has risen and I will not pretend otherwise.  That is the truth.  It is interesting that even though we spend &euro;1.5 billion less than was spent in 2008 to 2009, there is more surgery carried out, more outpatient clinics and more work is done.  In fact, the length of stay in hospital has decreased from nine days to 6.7, so there was a great deal of inefficiency there.  The health service has become much more efficient in the last number of years.<\/p> <p> With regard to the &euro;100 million, it was not for delayed discharges but for the fair deal scheme.  Most people who avail of the fair deal scheme are actually in the community, not in hospital.  The number for those in hospital would have been lower.  However, we certainly did not get everything we asked for and I will not pretend otherwise.<\/p> <p> Delayed discharges absolutely are a factor, but they are not the sole cause.  It is estimated that perhaps a quarter or a third of the number of people admitted into hospital do not need to be admitted.  Often that is due to the fact that the decision to admit can be made by more junior staff who are less risk averse than more senior staff.  I was in that position myself and I did it.  It is a problem in some hospitals where there is a difficulty recruiting senior staff.  Therefore, the threshold for admission is lower than it would be in a hospital that has more senior staff or in a hospital that has better access to diagnostics or to outpatients quite quickly.  There are many issues to be dealt with.  Emergency department overcrowding happens because ten things went wrong somewhere else and generally not because of what is happening in the emergency departments.  They simply get left with the mess, unfortunately.<\/p> <p> I do not wish to get bogged down in the figures as it does not really matter, but the SDU figures are calculated three times per day so they give us a different read from the nurses' union figures, which are only calculated once in the day.  The trolley watch figures are quite similar.  Ward watch is different.  That includes people who are on trolleys or extra beds in wards, often in other buildings and up to 1 km away.  I do not mind how one counts it.  With statistics there are many ways to count things, but I believe people should be accurate in describing what the figures mean.  When one uses the ward watch figures and talks about ED overcrowding, that is just incorrect because people counted in ward watch are not anywhere near the emergency department.  Also, when one makes comparisons one must compare like with like.  One cannot compare the 2 p.m. figure from the HSE numbers with the nurses' figure from 8 a.m.  I ask the Deputy to be accurate in what he describes and to compare like with like.  I do not care whose figures he uses as long as he uses that basic mathematical, scientific and statistical fact.  That is all I will say about statistics.  However, I agree with everyone that nobody should be on a trolley for a long period of time.  It does not really matter what the number is, it just helps us to control it in some way.<\/p> <p> I mentioned funding already.  There are competing priorities, such as housing, homelessness and children.  People should always use the resources they have efficiently first before they ask for more.  Frankly, it is not always the case that people do that in the public service.  It is very important that people use the resources they have efficiently and then demonstrate that they need more.  I have that responsibility as well and I am in a much stronger position when I go to the Economic Management Council, EMC, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to seek additional funding when I can demonstrate that money we have is used as efficiently as possible.  The health service has become a great deal more efficient in recent years.<\/p> <p> Senator van Turnhout mentioned the early support of discharge for stroke.  That is being done for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, and has worked really well.  We wish to do it for stroke too.  There are plans for a pilot scheme, but there is an initial investment and cost involved.  In addition, it might not be appropriate for every region and might work better in urban regions where outreach is easier than in rural areas.  All of that must be figured out.<\/p> <p> The Senator is 100% correct about controlling demand.  Demand for hospital services is increasing with our ageing population and we will always be running up the escalator, which is coming down fast towards us, unless we control demand.  That involves a number of matters.  It involves the Healthy Ireland philosophy, making our population's health better, dealing with smoking, obesity, inactivity and so forth, screening, prevention and expanding primary care services, which is very important.  With regard to nursing homes, there are approximately 1,000 nurse prescribers in Ireland at present.  There was none a couple of years ago.  That was achieved by the former Minister, Deputy Reilly.  We need more of them.  There are also community intervention teams, comprising nurses who go into homes and nursing homes to change the drips, give IVs and the like.  As Tony O'Brien mentioned, that is being expanded and there is a specific allocation in the service plan for 2015 to expand it further.  However, we are only getting started on this.  Perhaps it should have been done years ago, but I can only do my best with our current position.<\/p> <p> Another issue is advance health care directives.  That legislation will be brought to the D&aacute;il this year.  It will empower people to make decisions as to whether they want to end their life in more comfort at home or in the nursing home rather than having to go through an ED and die in the hospital, which is not necessarily right for everybody.  We wish to give people the power to make those decisions for themselves.<\/p> <p> We are in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the new capital programme.  There will be a new national development plan, NDP, which will run from 2016 to 2021 and we are involved in discussions on that.  Obviously, long-term care and community nursing home facilities are high on our request list for that.<\/p> <p> I believe I have covered most of the matters that I can cover in that regard.<\/p> <p>In regard to the immediate steps being taken arising out of the emergency department task force, what is important is that we keep doing what we are doing.  I will ask Mr. O'Brien to update the committee further on the campaign in regard to recruitment of nurses.  In regard to the doctors, the key issue appears to be salaries for consultants.  It has been difficult to fill a number of senior posts.  A second ballot on revised proposals will be held soon.  I hope that all things going to plan, we will in a matter of weeks have agreement with the IMO on a new consultant payscale, which will then allow us to commence recruitment of the 250 vacant consultant posts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500022#Z00700","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421326200,"counter":1020,"content":"<p>It was mentioned that the emergency department is often the only access point for sick older people.

An alternative access point is the day hospitals.  I previously worked in a day hospital which provided in-house services for the elderly.  The Smithfield unit has a dedicated frail elderly service.  There are proposals under the national clinical programmes to do something significant around streaming frail elderly services separate from the rest of the emergency department population.  Mr. O'Brien will elaborate on that issue later.<\/p>  <p>  On Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, on which Deputy Fitzpatrick made a very good contribution, that hospital is under a lot of pressure.  It now deals with as many presentations as St. James's Hospital.  It is a very busy hospital, which arises in part because of the changes made in Monaghan and Dundalk and a failure to provide it with adequate resourcing.  We need to help out that hospital.  Some of the suggestions made, including in relation to bed capacity, ambulance bypass and extension of the opening hours of the minor injuries unit, are valid.  I do not think, however, that we should start re-opening emergency departments that were closed.  Emergency medicine is not what it used to be.  Some 20 or 30 years ago, a person went to the emergency department and saw a doctor who could do anything from taking out one's gall bladder to treating a heart attack, but that is no longer the case.  To run a quality emergency department requires a critical mass of patients and access to many specialties.  There is much talk about patient safety.  It would not be in the interests of patient safety for us to reopen closed emergency departments.  If anything, we need to continue reconfiguring our services in order that everyone has access to a level of specialised care.  Doctors, nurses and midwives need to be seeing a critical mass of patients or they lose their skills.  This is evident the world over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500024#BB00300","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1421326200,"counter":1022,"content":"<p>Before Mr. O'Brien comes in, would the Minister comment on the emergency task force meeting yesterday, including what measures he was in agreement should be pursued in the immediacy?

In terms of what is happening in the immediacy, issues such as community intervention teams, CITs, community beds and speedier discharges are being addressed.  The role of the emergency department task force is more medium-term in terms of the development and oversight of a plan.  As the Deputy will be aware, we have had plans before.  This time, we need to ensure this plan is implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500024#BB00500","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421326200,"counter":1024,"content":"<p>Before I respond to the questions, my eagle-eared colleague has told me that I may have said that emergency department admissions are up by 8% instead of 1.8%.  If I did, I apologise.<\/p>  <p>  I will respond to the questions in the order they were asked.  On the real experience that Deputy Kelleher has reflected to us, we have to accept the reality of that.  None of us would pretend that at a time when excess numbers of people are waiting for very long periods on trolleys, that experience is anything other than a negative one.  There is no question of that.  However, I take issue with the suggestion that hospitals may be seeking to hold on to patients in order to manage their budgets in some way.  There is no way that statement can be supported or accepted.  If hospitals were doing that, it would be difficult to understand how they managed to spend &euro;268 million more than their budgets last year.  They are keen to ensure that patients are placed in the appropriate setting because the reality is that if a person is well, a hospital is not a good place for him or her to be.  The people who work in hospitals know this more than anybody else.<\/p>  <p>  On the trolley-INMO numbers in regard to trolley usage, the agreed definition used by the special delivery unit and the INMO is that these should include patients who are waiting for a bed.  It is only in the those circumstances that they are counted.  If a person is in the emergency department for assessment or treatment which is going to conclude within the emergency department or triage area, they do not show up in those numbers.  That is the reason these numbers are so significant.  While there may be odd minor variations between the hospital trolley use count and that of the INMO, it is an issue we do not get into an argument about.  We accept there can be small variations.  The overall headline figure is roughly the same.<\/p>  <p>  The key difference is that in April 2013, the INMO decided to introduce an additional measure.  On the website this is clearly identified as an additional and separate measure.  It is called \"Ward Watch\" as distinct from \"Trolley Watch\".  This means we are comparing trolley numbers now with trolley numbers in the past rather than ward numbers.  However, the INMO wishes to highlight both, for reasons which it has articulated clearly.  There may be variances in that.  It is an issue of bed use generally for other purposes as opposed to people in additional beds in wards.  This would, for example, include the use of beds dedicated under normal circumstances for day surgery or in elective wards.  These beds would tend to be counted in the ward watch figures.  We keep a clear distinction because for a patient on one of those wards as opposed to on hold in the emergency department, there is a very significant difference in both the quality of the experience and almost certainly in the quality of care.  The HSE and INMO are agreed that both should be reflected separately, although that distinction tends not to seep its way through to the public discourse.<\/p>  <p>  On the recruitment issue, there are as we speak discussions going on with some of the key stakeholders in this regard.  We are clear that the marketplace we need to target is the return of Irish-qualified nurses from the United Kingdom.  Britain has been very effective at tempting our qualified nurses away.  We are in discussions with the INMO and others about how we might best package a recruitment process to seek their return.  We do have one disadvantage in that our salary scales start more or less in the same place.  While I am not sure about this I think our salary scale increases by five or six points while the UK scale increases progressively to about 12 or 13 points.  We clearly need to ensure that there are opportunities for those who do return to progress in their careers.  This is exactly what we are looking at with the INMO.  It is hoped this will result very quickly in an active recruitment campaign of Irish nurses in Britain, many of whom I believe would prefer to come back to Ireland, particularly if they have not sown long-term roots, as many will not have done yet.  As part of our recovery, this is an area we need to tap into.  We will be seeking to recruit directly for particular hospitals because people will want to return to the areas from which they came and so on.  Local recruitment within that vehicle will be part of the exercise.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to my earlier use of the word \"managed\", members may be attaching a little too much significance to it.  I used it in the following sense.  The Minister managed to secure a budget for the health service this year of &euro;635 million more than it was last year.  In doing so, he exceeded my expectations.  He managed the process in that sense.  There is no negative connotation in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500024#BB00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1421326800,"counter":1025,"content":"<p>They are still friends so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500025#CC00100","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421326800,"counter":1026,"content":"<p>We are hoping to stay that way, particularly as we approach the next budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500025#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1421326800,"counter":1027,"content":"<p>It is great.

I do not wish to address the specific circumstances, which I understand are naturally personally upsetting.  The measures the Minister mentioned around CITs, nurse prescribing and so on are designed to support both end-of-life care if that is in a nursing home situation but also care more generally.  Clearly there is generally nothing to be gained from patients being moved from nursing homes to acute hospitals if the care they require can be provided in that particular setting.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Fitzpatrick knows, I have some local affinity with the Louth County Hospital.  Egress is the key issue for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  There are 15 beds being worked through to support egress from the hospital.  There are 24 private beds coming on stream at the end of this month, with our social care and hospital division working collaboratively with a private provider to skill up nurses for that nursing home given that it will be taking patients of slightly higher acuity than originally intended.<\/p>  <p>  Measures are under way to facilitate the repatriation back to Cavan of trauma patients who were referred in from Cavan but have ongoing medical needs.

I absolutely do not believe the emergency department should be restored there for many of the reasons the Minister has alluded to.

Clearly that team needs to be able to operate in better conditions than it currently does.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Deputy's support for the minor injuries unit.

A nurse who returned from the UK in early December and submitted an application has been advised that despite being due to start in a job on 1 January, the registration could not be completed until the end of January at the very earliest.  Can something be done to expedite that?  That is also an issue for people returning from abroad trying to register with the Medical Council.  I have come across cases of Irish graduates coming back from New Zealand and it taking eight to ten weeks to get Medical Council registration.  Appropriate representations should be made with them to expedite those registrations.<\/p>  <p>  How many junior doctor vacancies exist?  How many agency doctors will we need to employ in the coming six months?  What progress has been made on implementing the recommendations of the MacCraith report?  The use of six-month contracts is one of the reasons for so many Irish doctors disappearing out of the country.<\/p>  <p>  The witnesses have pointed to a slight increase in the budget for 2015.  Can we have a slight increase in the home care packages?  We really should have a substantial increase in that budget.  Some 20,000 people a year are coming in under the older than 65 age group.  That does not necessarily imply there will be an increase in people seeking those services but in recent years there has been a substantial increase in people seeking home care packages with no increase in budget.  Therefore we should give priority to it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500025#CC01800","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1421326800,"counter":1043,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for the presentation.  Every time the Minister has spoken in recent weeks he has been very careful to say that it is not always about money.  However, with the exception of one, all of the things he has done and that he has said have worked in recent weeks have required money.  The only thing I can find that does not require money is that section in Mr. O'Brien's speech on the leadership role of clinical directors, consultants, nurses and managers.<\/p>  <p>  That correlates with the Minister's appeal on RTE ten days ago asking nurses, emergency department doctors and surgeons to do extra rounds.  I am very worried if it is at that level on national media, that we are appealing to management and clinicians to do something that I believe - I might be naive - they should be doing week in and week out.  Will the Minister clarify it for me because I might be stupid?  Are we at the level where we are appealing at a ministerial level to our senior management teams in hospitals to do the things that they are being paid to do?  If that is the case, do we have an issue with our senior management teams in our 28 acute hospitals?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned that the emergency department task force is not an emergency task force.  What does he expect to get from it that is different from what we have expected from the special delivery unit in recent years?<\/p> <p>What has happened to the special delivery unit, SDU.  Is it gone or is it still there?  Does it do something that is different from what we will expect from the emergency department task force?  Are any of the people in the SDU now part of the emergency department task force?  That is just in recent weeks.  When we are setting budgets at the beginning, what is the correlation around fair deal, home care packages and community integration teams?  When we are spending &euro;300 million on this or &euro;975 million on that, what correlation is there for that budget versus the actual need and requirements of people who need to access that budget?  Is there any correlation?  Is it just because we have a finite budget that we can only allocate what we have to allocate?<\/p> <p> I am only being opportunistic.  The Minister said and accepted that Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is under pressure.  I publicly pay tribute to Margaret Swords and her team in Drogheda.  In my humble opinion, they do a stonking job given that there is a genuine lack of resources there.  The Minister said he was going to help her.

The first thing we need to establish and accept is that accident and emergency overcrowding is unacceptable in any circumstance.  That is only the beginning.  Having accepted that, we must take action to solve the problem permanently.  What we have been doing for years, what we have done in the past week and what we are doing again today is largely short-termism and firefighting.  There are little or no examples of addressing the situation on a long-term basis to solve the problem permanently.<\/p>  <p>  In his presentation, Mr. O'Brien indicated the difficulty with reduced budgets over recent years.  Of course, he is absolutely correct.  Nearly &euro;4 billion has been taken out of the budget, 11,000 staff have been lost, 2,000 beds have been taken out of the system, funding for home help hours has been reduced by about &euro;2 million, and fair deal has been reduced by about 50%.  All those cuts introduced by this Government and previous Governments have devastated the system.  This is what has happened.  Staff at all levels are working daily above and beyond the call of duty.  There is no capacity left in the system.  South Tipperary General Hospital, which is my local hospital, is running at about 120% capacity every day.  This is the case for other hospitals throughout the country.  The system is under ferocious pressure and there is little or no capacity left to deal with any surges or additional pressures.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said today and on a number of occasions that this is a long-standing problem and it has been a long-standing, chronic problem for years.  It has been addressed on numerous occasions by reports and investigations.  At one stage it was declared a national emergency.  The outcome is that we know the solution to this problem.  Every manager in every hospital throughout the country, every clinician and every nurse knows the solution to the problem.  We simply must address it on a long-term, permanent basis to ensure that accident and emergency overcrowding, which is absolutely horrific for patients and members of their families, is solved once and for all.<\/p>  <p>  We know exactly what needs to be done.  Measures like the use of medical assessment units, discharge allowances and the use of rapid access to outpatient department appointments are in place in most hospitals.  They are very worthwhile and essential and are very helpful but they will not solve the problem on their own.  We need other actions that have been in existence for years and that we have known for years will solve the problem.  We need community intervention teams.  I note that there is money in the budget and there is a proposal to extend those, but it will not be done for all hospitals.  We need them for every area with an emergency department.  We need closed beds to be opened and additional step-down beds for patients.  We need to restore fair deal to at least the situation we were in this time 12 months ago when it was at six weeks.  We need additional nursing, medical and support staff to deal with the problems we have.  Unless those measures are put in place, we will be dealing with this question next year, the year after and the year after that.<\/p>  <p>  Could Mr. O'Brien give us some more information on the final paragraph on page eight of his presentation?  It suggests that there are 2,500 long-stay public beds at risk in the coming 12 months in respect of standards.  I would like some confirmation that this matter will be dealt with, funding will be made available for it and they will continue to remain in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500026#DD00200","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1421327400,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>I will take Deputy Catherine Byrne followed by Deputy McLellan.

I thank the witnesses for coming in this morning.  I thoroughly agree with Deputy Regina Doherty that it is about money.  While it is also about management, it is certainly about money if one wants to implement something.  When the HSE is counting trolleys, does it also count chairs?  Are they part of the overall picture?  If somebody is sitting on a chair in a corridor, is the chair counted as well?<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to see that 65 beds will be opened in Mount Carmel and that there will be new short-stay residential beds.  I fought hard to get beds for local people in respect of the Hollybrook unit in Inchicore.  Hollybrook has been a step-down unit for St James's Hospital because of the transition for the new national children's hospital.  They were supposed to be 50 extra beds that were short-term but we still have not moved anybody over there and it is not possible to get anybody into it.<\/p>  <p>  It is very difficult to get someone into a home care package.  I have had significant problems locally even getting a local district nurse to take a call, which they refuse to do.  They will not even correspond with you.  When you finally get in touch with them through the person for whom you are trying to get the home care package, the person concerned is told they should not have contacted their public representative and that they should have gone to the nurse.  However, this can take a couple of weeks and things do not always work out as easily as that.<\/p>  <p>  Families need to step up to the mark.  Many families have shoved the responsibility of looking after older people onto other people.  It is very important that families take responsibility.  I am an advocate of home help services, which are brilliant, but asking somebody to come in for half an hour in the morning to get somebody out of bed, dress them and give them their breakfast is ludicrous.  It does not work.  When my mother was ill, it took two of us to get her into the shower because she would kill you if you took her into the shower.  It had nothing to do with her not wanting to be washed; it had to do with the dementia.  This, along with getting her breakfast and other things, meant that it was two hours before the two or three of us would manage her.  We need to look at the home help service because if there is any chance of making an impact in respect of people not having to stay in hospital, it involves looking at home care and how we facilitate elderly people to stay at home.  Even the basics of getting a nurse to go out and dress somebody's wound is very difficult.  I agree with Mr. O'Brien when he said that we have lost something like &euro;26 million in home help services.  This is sad because we should begin trying to resolve problems that end up in accident and emergency in the home.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have any questions other than the one about the trolleys.  Could Mr. O'Brien give us any insight into when Hollybrook will become the link for St James's Hospital in respect of using the beds for the purpose they were provided for?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500026#DD00400","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1421327400,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Mr. O'Brien and his officials.<\/p> <p>I will concentrate on an issue in the introduction to Mr. O'Brien's speech, in which he states:<blockquote><br \/>The population over 65 years is growing by approximately 20,000 per year and those over 80 years by 4% annually.  Due to reduced budgets over the past number of years, the development of the required capacity within our community services to deliver home helps, home care packages, short stay and long stay residential care has not kept pace with this demographic growth.<\/blockquote>With this growing population, if we kept the budget as it is, we would run into difficulties.  It is illogical even to contemplate a budget cut in this area.  Given that there are 20,000 more people over the age of 65 per year, how can we sustain the fair deal scheme?

I would like to know what resources are being made available to ensure it does not happen again.  I welcome the Minister's comment that long after this drops off the front pages of newspapers he will remain committed to dealing with it.  He will find that health is broad ranging and interconnected.  While we may talk about home care on one day and access to speech and language or occupational therapy another day, it is all interconnected in terms of how we keep people well and at home, away from the emergency departments.

The emergency department is often just the place where the flaws and shortcomings show up.  I accept her point.  I did not mean any disrespect in what I said earlier and I apologise if that is how it came across.<\/p>  <p>  Hospitals do not need delegated sanction from the director general of the health service or me to procure items such as pillows and blankets.  The hospital may have been so overwhelmed that it was unprepared at the time.  I hope it does not happen again and that they do not need to procure extra pillows.  We can both agree that is not the solution.  Deputy Catherine Byrne is correct about home help, home care and social care.  If my fairy godmother arrived tomorrow and gave me an extra &euro;50 million, I would give very little to the hospitals.  It would go to social care, fair deal and home care packages, which would free up hospitals.  In the 2015 budget, the fair deal scheme and home care packages were increased by &euro;10 million each.  Whether it is enough to meet rising demand will become apparent as the year goes on.  The fair deal is under review and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is due to receive the review in a matter of weeks.  We will deal with it when it arrives.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE TrolleyGAR counts people on chairs.  It counts anybody who is in an emergency department, who a doctor says needs to be admitted and who is waiting for a bed, whether on a chair or a trolley.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Regina Doherty asked about the things that do not cost money.  These include physicians doing two ward rounds per day and senior decision makers being present.  Given that senior decision makers are more experienced, they are more likely to discharge patients, can see them more quickly and are less likely to admit them.  This is very important.  Although postponing elective procedures does not cost money, they come back again to bite us.  Discharge planning does not cost money and we should plan for the discharge of patients from the day they are admitted.  The full capacity protocol, which is not agreed, does not cost money.  It is used in many other jurisdictions to move patients up the house so it becomes a problem for the whole system, not just the emergency department.  Encouraging people to use the minor injury units, such as in Dundalk, Smithfield and Cork rather than going to the big hospital does not cost money.  Hospital avoidance by referring people direct to diagnostics or outpatient departments, OPDs, does not cost money.  The Deputy is correct that many other measures cost money and that all these should be happening all the time.  However, when one is in a surge scenario it is worth making the point and asking everybody to redouble their efforts and do what they can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500027#EE00300","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421328000,"counter":1052,"content":"<p>The SDU still exists.  Its personnel are still in place and they work as part of the acute hospitals division.  There have been one or two personnel changes over the years, including me.  A previous member of the SDU, Mr. Jim O&rsquo;Sullivan, is a member of the emergency department task force.  Many of the measures the SDU developed from mid-2011 are still in place.  The critical difference is that they have been slightly overwhelmed, broadly speaking but not exclusively, by demographic impact.  This morning I was in an emergency department where the consultants on call told me something very interesting.  Having worked in the hospital at different times over 20 years they have found that the average age of a patient has increased by one year per year.  The demographic effect is real.  Hopefully, we will all age and be reasonably well as we do so.  As we do, our demands for health care will grow, whether for acute care or home care supports.  The economic recession has had an impact on the capacity of successive Governments to keep pace with demographic change in the country and there is no denying it.  This is the first budget in many years to seek to address it.  At the launch of the service plan, the Minister and I were both very clear that it is a start rather than the solution we need to get to for successive years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500027#EE00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421328000,"counter":1053,"content":"<p>Although we track junior doctors closely through each six-month cycle, one never knows exactly what the figures are until the day of change because people may withdraw their applications or move elsewhere.  We have had additional junior doctors in the past year because of our duty to comply with the emergency working time directive, EWTD.  Despite these difficulties, as of last Monday, the day of changeover, our outstanding vacancy rate was 170 out of a complement of almost 5,000 junior doctors.  This figure has been remarkably consistent over recent years.  It hardly changes and tends to be concentrated in the same specialties in the same hospitals.  Although we have had worries at times about keeping certain services going, we have managed to maintain front-line services even in the hospitals which are particularly challenged in terms of recruitment.<\/p>  <p>  The question on older people is interesting and is one about which we all need to be mindful.  One could argue that by the time a frail older person arrives at an emergency department, it is almost too late to consider alternatives.  Like other health care systems in the western world, we must consider alternative pathways for older people that are more sustainable, fairer, kinder and more appropriate to their needs.  Older people can present to day hospitals.  In Cork, where I work, geriatricians visit the community hospitals to avoid hospital referrals.<\/p> <p>In Blanchardstown, we made an innovative appointment where a geriatrician works half time in the community and half time in the hospital.  During her tenure, referrals from nursing homes have fallen by 20% to 30%, so simply by her crossing that interface and identifying elderly people, she has managed to avoid their referral to hospital and to treat them as day cases or in step-up beds in hospital.  It is a much more humane and kinder approach to people who do not want to be on hospital trolleys.  We must expand the idea of addressing the care of older people before they ever come to hospital, identify at risk cases, have case managers look at these people and work with hospitals to identify a menu of options other than referral to emergency departments, in particular in the Dublin area.  This takes time and it is a cultural change which requires a change of mindset among all those engaged in health care.  It is part of the initiative in which we are engaged.

As has been said, we had approval for an additional &euro;3 million so those 300 beds went in before Christmas.  The waiting time has been brought to 11 weeks, so it is currently 11 weeks and it is continuing at that.  That is an important part of that.  Of course, there is demographic growth and the waiting list.  The system works significantly better when, as Deputy Healy said, the waiting list is no more than four to six weeks.  It is important to say that as part of the escalation, 165 transitional care beds, in addition to the fair deal scheme, were put in place in December.  They made an important contribution also in reducing the number of delayed discharges overall in the time set out in the director general's opening statement.  Since then, a really important part has been the focus on transitional care over the past number of weeks.  We have worked closely with Nursing Homes Ireland in that regard and it has to be acknowledged that it has worked well with us on that.  We identified 250 beds from a survey we undertook with Nursing Homes Ireland and we are targeting those.  That has contributed significantly to our capacity to respond.<\/p>  <p>  The work under way between hospitals and community services, in particular social care, is in matching the capacity within the private nursing home sector with the dependency of older people, in particular those who are being discharged, and that is working well.  We have seen the reductions.  Some 192 have been discharged in the past week, so that is an important part of it.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the home care packages, it is important to confirm to the committee that has been available.  Throughout December, a significant focus was deployed to ensure home care packages and home care services were provided.  In the week before Christmas, more than 120 home care packages were provided, some 87 directly to the hospitals.  During December more than 296 home care packages were delivered to the hospitals as part of that initiative, or more than 550 when one takes the community and hospital together.  <\/p>  <p>  It is clear the initiative put in place in terms of the escalation between the hospital and the community has worked well throughout December.  There are usually 20 cases over the week where a bit of work has to be done between the hospital and the community to ensure the person gets home.

Interim registration was granted on the basis that, over time, full compliance would have to be achieved.  That date is mid-year.  Some of the stock to which I am referring is actually original work house stock in terms of footprint and in terms of the fabric of the external buildings.  The regulations are correct.  It is appropriate that we move away from essentially ward-type accommodation to more suitable accommodation &ndash; single and double en suite rooms and so on.  At present, we are not in a position to do what would be necessary in order to meet the requirements of compliance by mid-year.  However, there are processes in place and under way designed to address that issue but, at present, we do not have that funding in place.  That is what I was referring to there.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the registration of nurses and doctors returning from abroad, I think it may vary depending on whether the individuals continued to pay a retention fee.  Where they did not, the regulator will go through a process of verifying qualifications and so on.  That is not something in which we have a role but clearly it is important and we have seen recent incidences which have emphasised the importance of that checking process to ensure people are registered only on the basis of their strict entitlement to be registered.  There can be variability, depending on where people have been in the meantime, the availability of records and their ability to demonstrate their practice and professional compliance in the meantime.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to Hollybrook, the Deputy is right in that the facility has been used to facilitate the decant of what, I think, was called \"hospital seven\", which was a medium to long-term facility on the grounds of St. James's Hospital.  During the redevelopment there and at present, it has not been available for the originally intended purpose.  Against that, under the &euro;25 million programme to which I referred to earlier where Dublin has been prioritised, in particular because of access issues, St. James's Hospital has been prioritised with 15 short-stay beds and 40 packages, which are designed to specifically address the issue of patients in that hospital who would be from its hinterland and catchment area.  However, the Deputy is right the facility is not being used for the originally intended purpose.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the overall issue of budgeting, every western society which seeks to run a comprehensive health care system is facing the same issues as we are.  Some people use inflammatory language, such as demographic time bomb and so on.  There is a requirement for us to re-engineer our services in order to take account of the fact that an increasing proportion of us will be living longer.  Hopefully, we will all achieve that status.  Some of the things Dr. Colm Henry spoke about are necessary for the re-engineering of our pathways which take account of the fair deal scheme, home care, acute hospital systems and so on.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Doherty's question on budgeting, we seek, with our colleagues in the Department of Health, to reach an intelligent view of what the future requirements will be and then we have to take account of what we get and how we can apply that.  Those two things are not always the same.  That is the reality.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the cancellation of elective procedures, which was Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's point, at present, I do not have a figure which I can give him.  This is a real-time situation.  It will obviously be influenced by how long current pressures exist and what the weather, which it is being unkind to half the country, in particular today, does to us and, indeed, what the influenza-like illness index produces.  We are now in the 'flu season.  We have seen our first spike and are, therefore, on particular alert for a period of about eight weeks, which is what we would expect the 'flu season to be.<\/p>  <p>  An added complication is that the particular strain of 'flu, which has traversed the Atlantic, as it always does each year, is not the strain of 'flu predicted and, therefore, is not the strain of 'flu for which we have vaccinated our health workers and the general population.  There are particular risks in that area, which means this could continue for a little bit longer than we would like but all of our measures are designed to prepare us for that.  When we get to a point when we can recommence electives &ndash; this would be different in different hospitals and it will be calibrated - we will then be in a position to say, and we will do so publicly, what the impact of this has been on electives.<\/p> <p>At present, however, it is not really possible to reschedule.  We do not want to reschedule people into an early slot which is more than likely going to be cancelled.  That would not be good for them or for the system, but we will be open about it when we have the full details.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500028#FF01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421329200,"counter":1065,"content":"<p>What about the Lourdes hospital?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500029#GG00200","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421329200,"counter":1066,"content":"<p>In terms of what we are doing there, I gave some of the details to Deputy Fitzpatrick.  The Deputy is right to congratulate Margaret Swords who is now the group chief operating officer for the RCSI hospitals group that includes the Lourdes.  Some 15 beds are immediately being worked through for patients currently in the hospital, while 24 private beds are coming on stream at the end of the month.  The hospital and our social care division are working with a private provider because the acuity of the patients might not be what was originally envisaged by that provider, so a little bit of upskilling is required for their staff, which is being progressed.<\/p>  <p>  The repatriation of all the Cavan trauma patients who have ongoing medical needs has been agreed with the hospital.  There is a modular build in the hospital with provision for 20 beds which will be available at the end of February.  A recruitment campaign is under way and a community intervention team has been introduced and is working with the hospital now.  So all these measures are designed to address the stress.

As the Minister said, Drogheda has 55,000 attendances which is a significant factor.  That is designed to give immediate relief.  The other challenge is that they have been particularly affected by the shortage of long-stay beds.  Therefore, while the focus was primarily on Dublin, we included Drogheda as part of that immediate response.  There is a recognition that they are particularly challenged concerning medical agency, so we have tried to provide additional supports for them.  There has been a lot of discussion about the reliance on agency which, we accept, is not desirable.  At the same time we recognise there are a small number of places that need some flexibility.  We recognise they have particular challenges and are giving them additional support to allow them to operate safely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500029#GG00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1421329200,"counter":1068,"content":"<p>I now call Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and we will finish on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015011500029#GG00500","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1421329200,"counter":1069,"content":"<p>I accept, first of all, that the introduction of additional beds without the required nursing supports will not function.

I have heard the reply concerning a recruitment project that will concentrate on the neighbouring island to, hopefully, encourage the return of nurses who have left.  In the interim the situation maintains and could, as Mr. O'Brien has quite rightly pointed out, get just as bad as it was a week ago.  Is any consideration being given to localised recruitment on a temporary interim basis, including former nursing staff whatever the circumstances of their leaving service?  Is any consideration being given to that as an interim measure?
