We welcome the efforts of the committee to create a more efficient and transparent structure, to create savings and to help reduce costs on participants in this wonderful industry.  Our association is a 32-county, democratically elected body with approximately 6,250 breeders.  We represent at least 90% of all breeders in terms of annual foal production.  The thoroughbred industry is acknowledged as one of Ireland's great indigenous success stories, with an incredible amount of total added value in the country, generating direct employment of 17,000 people.  In the past, it was about 25,000 people.  The employment is based throughout rural communities and contributes approximately &euro;1 billion to the economy.  We are probably at the bottom of the production cycle and, if we can get a little more funding into our industry, we will be in a far better place to accommodate any increase in the industry that will come once the cycle returns.  Breeders contribute approximately &euro;1.25 million per annum through an annual foal levy.<\/p><p>  Irish horses, breeders, jockeys and stable staff excel throughout the world stage.  There is not a corner of the world without an Irish horseman or successful Irish horses.  In America, the Far East, the Middle East and Australia, Irish bred horses are the predominant prime product of the industry.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Bill, under heading 4.7(1), it is envisaged that three members of the board will be appointed by the Minister.<\/p> <p>We ask that one of these nominees would have a thorough knowledge of the industry itself and that the other two would have a working knowledge.  There are particular skill sets required for our industry and we ask that whoever is appointed would be fully cognisant of the industry's requirements.  Under point 3 on the explanatory note, while we understand the need to provide greater transparency, we contend that there may be occasions where a specialised chairman may be required to fulfil a specific function.  We believe some of the specifications in this regard are slightly too tightly drawn.  There are certain nuances within this industry for which one often needs to go outside and acquire an extra skill set to help.  This would allow greater flexibility in future when new statutory committees are established in subsequent heads.<br \/>As for the nominating body, we ask that we, the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association, ITBA, should be the nominating body for the breeders&rsquo; representative on the board of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI.  As I stated previously, we are democratically elected every two years and our chairman, also elected, spends a two-year term.  It probably is the most democratic farming organisation extant.  We are organised by region, having regard to the number of horses produced in each region, but all corners of the country are represented on our council in respect of both the flat and national hunt sectors.  While we probably will revert to the foal levy later, it is an important issue for us.  If the foal levy is to be totally accountable, it must be sold by the breeders themselves to our own members as to why they should contribute to it.  In addition, a number of minor, lesser bodies are being run by HRI, a particular one being Irish Thoroughbred Marketing, to which the breeders themselves contribute approximately &euro;400,000 per year.  Obviously, we are at the bottom level of our cycle at present but heretofore, we have been giving up to &euro;600,000 per year to Irish Thoroughbred Marketing.  It is a significant amount of money for the breeders of Ireland to be handing over to Horse Racing Ireland.  I ask, as of right, that we should have a position on the committees and boards of Irish Thoroughbred Marketing.  In addition, the foal levy committee is the committee of Horse Racing Ireland that is given the job of raising the aforementioned levy and spending it.  The least we could ask for in this regard is that we, of right, should have some seats on the foal levy committee.<br \/>With regard to other committees, under head 6 the ITBA believes the fixtures committee should have some independence from HRI and therefore should not be limited to HRI board members.  It should include members of the authority and other individuals from the industry.  This is an area which requires highly specialised expertise.  This committee must be fully responsive to the requirements of both the racing and breeding industries.  The ITBA also recommends that the existing programmes committee should remain.  Programming has a broader remit in terms of pattern - in other words, the quality of race and their timings -and its work has implications both nationally and internationally.  If it is subsumed into the fixtures committee, whose decisions can be overturned by the HRI board, there is no external oversight as has previously been in place.  It is important to maintain and enhance the international profile of our own race fixtures.  We also ask that the new industry services committee needs clear criteria regarding constituencies and methods of election.  Thus far, the specific people mentioned have been jockeys, qualified riders and persons employed in the horse racing industry.  I suggest the breeding industry also could be part of this committee, in particular with regard to welfare issues for our staff.<br \/>In respect of the foal levy, probably our greatest concern here today is that as currently drafted, British breeders will be allowed to register their Irish-born foals in Britain, which would result in a reduction of levy income of approximately &euro;170,000, which probably is 12% to 14% of the total levy.  We have suggested a rewording of the provision - and have some work in this regard from Weatherbys as well - to state &ldquo;The levy shall be paid by the owner of a thoroughbred foal born in the State in advance of registering the foal in a stud book in the State&rdquo;.  I cannot emphasise enough how important this is.  We have this levy in force and it took a lot of work between the breeders of this country and HRI to have an efficient and fair collection method from our members.  We do not need any slippage in this regard and if some foals are exempt, there would be leakages of registrations back to the English studbook from Irish breeders, who therefore may not pay the levy at all.  In addition, in a technical point, the section as currently worded states that Weatherbys may refuse to register a foal if the levy is not paid.  Again, we ask for much more robust wording in this regard, which states &quot;A person who maintains a studbook will not register a foal&quot;.  At present, this levy has a compliance level of 98.3% in respect of who pays it, which is very high and we do not want to lose out on that.<br \/>In respect of the racing regulatory authority, in order for the authority to maintain the functions of a truly independent regulator it must have access to all funds with regard to licensing.  Any other model has been shown to be flawed in any other sport.  Any compromise on the independence of the racing regulatory body, RBB, has serious implications for integrity, which is the cornerstone of Irish racing internationally.  As the proposed requirement in Section 11(1)(<i>d)<\/i>to consult with HRI before the RRB sets licensing charges is new, consequently it clearly is not in keeping with the requirements to have an independent regulatory body.  As previous Acts did not include point to points, we believe they should not be included at this time.  Point to points are a voluntary sporting activity akin to the GAA and are self-regulated.<br \/>On the funding of racing, despite the fact that our industry remains to the fore internationally, there are signs that it is in decline, with a reduction in numbers across the board.  The numbers of mares in Ireland have reduced substantially, by 40%, over the past five or six years.  As I noted earlier, we are at the bottom of the production cycle and now the number of horses in training has started to rise in our major market, we would like some pump-priming to happen here to try to help our racing and breeding industry.  The key to the future of the Irish racing and breeding industries is to put in place a secure funding mechanism and we are requesting this joint committee to call on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to lobby the Minister for Finance to restore the off-course tax to the 2006 levels of 2% in the forthcoming budget and to extend its coverage to currently untaxed forms of betting.<br \/>As the representative body for the largest number of constituents in the industry, we would appreciate it were the joint committee to give consideration to our submission for inclusion in its report to the House.  I thank members and look forward to their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Iceton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405429500,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Iceton and call on Mr. Noel Meade, chairman of the Irish Race Horse Trainers Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500004#D00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405429500,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am accompanied today by my chief executive, Mr. Michael Grassick, who is on my left and by my colleague, Mr. Dermot Weld.

I am accompanied by Mr. Ruby Walsh, a champion jockey, and Mr. Michael Kinane, a former champion jockey.  The submissions are already before the committee and I hope it has had the opportunity to consider them.<\/p><p>  First, I would adopt the position taken by my colleagues who have spoken already in welcoming the general scheme of the Bill and, more importantly, the vital necessity to deal with the adequate funding of the industry.  In that regard, the obvious point is that the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 needs to be addressed without delay.<\/p><p>  Our submission raised four particular issues with the committee which are reflective of the position of jockeys' association.  First, under head 4, on the HRI body corporate, the jockeys take the view that they are entitled to and should be given a position on the board as opposed to the sub-committee, being the industry services committee.  It is difficult to understand at this point in time why the jockeys, being to the forefront and the representatives of the industry, both abroad and to the public generally, are not in the position of having a board seat.  As I set out, it is important to differentiate the position of the jockeys from that of those working within the industry otherwise.  In particular, I would highlight that the jockeys, being self-employed, are entirely dependent on the prize money in racing.  Other staff members working within the industry are employed and covered by legislation to protect them in those circumstances.  My colleague, Mr. Walsh, would point out that three of his 16 professional years have been spent in injury and without earning.  While jockeys are not in a position to race ride, they have no protections other than those that are given to themselves.  Therefore, they must be in a position to represent themselves at the board by way of addressing those issues.  Funding, such as charitable funds and pensions funds, are all matters that they have put in place for themselves, but they must be protected.  From that point of view, I would ask the committee to consider their position in terms of a seat on the board itself.<\/p><p>  The second issue I would ask the committee to consider relates to the racing regulatory body, which I addressed in the submission.  The power of the racing regulatory body should be considered.  The power vested in the racing regulatory body with regard to disqualification and imposition of penalties is excessive insofar as it is ungoverned under the 1994 Act and there is no position under head 11 that such should be governed.  Effectively, the racing regulatory body will have unfettered power to disqualify or suspend persons licensed by the body for extended periods of time - a privilege or advantage which is given to that body over other similar bodies, such as the Medical Council and the Law Society.  It is incumbent on the proposed legislation to provide limits to that power that is already being vested in it.  We do not object to the power itself, but it must be controlled and appropriate amendments need to be incorporated into the proposed Bill.<\/p><p>  Dealing with the specific issue as set out at head 7, prize money, I would address the committee to section 27 which makes provision for the racing regulatory body to deal with the issue of charitable funds.  While it is welcome that the HRI has the authority under the proposed legislation to make directives with regard to prize money, the check or balance in relation to charitable funds exists and is given to the racing regulatory body.  The difficulty with it is that the jockeys' pension, which is specific to the jockeys, is not a charitable fund although they have other funds which they have put in place for themselves.  That is not a charitable fund and, therefore, it is within the power of the board of HRI to amend prize money contributions to the pension, if it so wishes, without recourse to the jockeys' association.  That is crucial because the pension, which presently works in terms of a sportsman's pension, is provided to these riders once they qualify at age 50.  The power to amend that is given exclusively to the HRI under the proposed Bill without any recourse to the jockeys' association.  I suggested an amended wording.  I think this is an oversight rather than anything else.  It can be readily addressed by virtue of the wording we considered and provided in the submission.<\/p><p>  Finally, there is the issue of the media rights.  The media rights, under the 1994 Act, as the committee will be aware, are given exclusively to the race courses with administration or distribution through Horse Racing Ireland.  That is inappropriate.  It is unreasonable that the jockeys' association and other industry bodies within the organisation do not have any entitlement under this or the previous legislation to any of the media rights money that is being generated.  That can be subject to challenge.  The proposed Bill presents the opportunity to address that issue and I would implore the committee to consider that.<\/p><p>  I am available to answer any of the committee's questions, as are my colleagues who can speak to the day-to-day relevant issues for jockeys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Coonan"},{"type":"speech","time":1405430100,"counter":16,"content":"<p>For the purposes of clarification, is it the membership of the media rights sub-committee to which Mr. Coonan refers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500005#E00400","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405430100,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500005#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Coonan"},{"type":"speech","time":1405430100,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I now call Ms Sharon Byrne, chairperson of the Irish Bookmakers Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500005#E00600","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405430100,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for allowing the Irish Bookmakers Association, IBA, to participate in this discussion concerning the heads of the Horse Racing Ireland Bill.  I am the chairperson of the Irish Bookmakers Association which represents 70% of the 992 shops in Ireland today.  I am accompanied by Mr. Mike O'Kane, who is business director with Ladbrokes.<\/p><p>  Irish betting shops are the main contributors to the fund paying over &euro;24 million in betting duty last year.  Bookmakers sponsor many meetings across the country and betting shops also pay approximately &euro;30 million in media rights for pictures from Irish racing.<\/p> <p>Betting shops, therefore, provide a significant level of support for Ireland&rsquo;s racing industry and are the primary source of funding for the racing body.  More than 6,000 people are directly employed in the industry in Ireland and the number of shops has fallen from 1,365 in 2008 to 992 today.  That has resulted in 1,600 job losses across the country.  An important figure is the turnover in betting shops which has dropped from &euro;3.6 billion in 2008 to &euro;2.4 billion today.  The main reasons for the decline in turnover include recessionary factors plus the increased availability of mobile and online operators which are untaxed.<\/p><p> The IBA believe the current taxation regime on betting shops is inequitable, punitive and requires modernisation and reform.  Betting shops are subject to a turnover tax which takes no account of our profitability.  Another interesting fact that merits serious consideration by everyone in this room is the fact that inside a betting shop 12% of turnover is on Irish horse racing.  For every euro that comes over the counter, 12% is on Irish racing.  Betting shops pay a betting duty of &euro;24 million plus another &euro;30 million for the pictures they display in their shops.<\/p><p> The final point I will make before I hand over to my colleague, Mr. Mike O&rsquo;Kane, is that we have been calling for several years for additional usage of the track at Dundalk.  It is the only all-weather track in Ireland and it only races, on average, one night a week throughout the winter.  We call for racing to take place there two to three nights per week throughout the winter which would give us additional revenue, increase the turnover tax we pay and give opportunities to trainers, owners and jockeys throughout the winter when we have a very small amount of racing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500005#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Sharon Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405430700,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman, and committee members.

I have a wide range of experience both in Ireland, the UK and Europe in terms of funding, media rights and the relationship between tax and regulation.  I wish to give a personal overview on some of the comments made.  I sit on the levy board and the bookmakers committee in the UK.  I am also a member of the media rights buying committee in the UK so I understand all the issues.<\/p><p>  The point must be made that the relationship between all parties present is symbiotic.  I hope the committee appreciates that is what is required.  The issue is how one ensures that all parties are successful and grow their share of revenue in the industry.  Bookmakers are a key player both in terms of the tax that is generated from the consumer and shops but also from media rights.  It was indicated that approximately &euro;30 million comes from media rights to Irish racing.

I would also like to see a greater involvement of the bookmaking industry within how the HRI and the industry are run.  We would recommend that because of the financial contribution from the industry that the HRI should consist of more than one bookmaker seat, preferably two seats.  At the moment there is one seat for on-course bookmakers.  The contribution of on-course bookmakers in media and tax payments is relatively small compared to the Irish retail sector.  Within the betting committee, at the moment it is recommended that there are five members but there is no clear indication of how that structure should be put into place other than a reference to on-course, exchange and retail.  Clearly, as the retail pays something like 85% of the revenues that go into Irish racing from bookmaking, the betting committee should reflect the contribution of the retail sector.<\/p><p>  I have the pleasure to sit on the betting patterns working group in the UK which is there to advise the levy board and the BHA how to maximise the revenue that comes from the racing product.  That committee quite clearly wants to protect the pattern and the quality within the UK racing product.  The same would apply in Ireland.  We believe we can contribute greatly to the fixture discussions because at the end of the day when the fixture programme is sold to the media buyers, whoever they happen to be, the media buyers will look at how that fulfils their need.  We have something to contribute both in terms of our experience but also our knowledge of what generates good volumes from a media perspective.<\/p><p>  The issue of the HRI controlling the media sales was addressed in our submission.  That must be examined again.  There needs to be an enlightened view about how media sales are transacted; who owns the rights and to whom they can sell.  Bundling of media sales in the way that happens at the moment through the HRI might in the long term work against Irish racing when the media buyers, who are the customers, come forward and decide what they want to buy in 2017 and 2018.<\/p><p>  Funding has been mentioned by other contributors but it was not in our submission.  I would be happy to let any member of this committee look at my performance from my Irish retail business in Ladbrokes in any year they wish to choose to decide whether they think the 1% or 2% turnover tax will necessarily generate additional revenue.  It would appear to, but from a Ladbrokes&rsquo; perspective it would decimate our retail sector and would not deliver the revenue people require.  This industry in the long term will depend on its ability to sell its rights, pictures and data rather than the tax model.  I offer the committee the opportunity to come and look at my numbers for any year it wishes to choose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500006#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike O'Kane"},{"type":"speech","time":1405430700,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I have a brief question on taxation.  I thank all witnesses for their excellent contributions and presentations.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il support much of what has been proposed by Mr. Iceton on the various amendments tabled.  I wish to focus on taxation.  It was rather interesting that Mr. O&rsquo;Kane finished his presentation talking about taxation by saying that a 1% or 2% betting tax would not generate revenue.  I recollect that when Charlie McCreevy was Minister for Finance in 2003 he introduced a betting tax of 8% which was rapidly reduced over the succeeding years down to 1%.  Perhaps Mr. O&rsquo;Kane could correct me on the sequence of events on the betting tax in this country.  When the late Brian Lenihan as Minister for Finance wanted to introduce an increase of 2% in 2008 or 2009 he was lobbied so efficiently by the betting industry that he left it alone.  We are left with the current situation.  That is why I am anxious for Mr. O&rsquo;Kane to focus on the betting tax or lack of it.<\/p><p>  Irrespective of what Mr. O&rsquo;Kane said &ndash; I would love to see the figures &ndash; the public perception is that the betting industry is getting away with blue murder and that it is coining it to an extraordinary extent.

Rural Ireland is dependent on the industry, especially in recessionary times with the impact of emigration and so forth.<\/p><p> Under head 4(7), in respect of the board member nominees, it is contended that all should have a working knowledge of the industry, with one having a thorough knowledge of the horse racing and breeding industries.

I am not a taxation specialist but I have the figures in front of me.  If we go back to 1998, the level of duty was 10%.  It was reduced to 5% in 2002 and in July 2006 it was reduced to 1%.  While it is hard to work out the industry norm, work that has been done for us indicates that the average rate of betting duty throughout the world is about 7.7%.  In Britain, our nearest neighbour, the basic level of duty is 2.5% plus an additional 1.5% for racing.  With regard to the level of taxation in this country going to 2%, about which bid makers seem to quibble, they are able to work with double that level of taxation sometimes in their own home country, and that slightly throws me to one side.<\/p><p>  Following on from Senator Mooney's question is the question of what we need to do with our money.  The basis of our business is prize money.  If the prize money is right, people will invest and if people invest, it will keep the jockeys and trainers in business and, ultimately, fellows like me who are breeders.  That is why we need more money coming into the industry.  It is a trickle-down effect in that prize money lifts all boats.<\/p><p>  Deputy Ferris asked about persons with knowledge being board nominees and perhaps one of them being nominated by the jockeys.  Specifically in regard to the Act, it states that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will have three ministerial appointees.  That is fine because obviously if the Department of Finance is investing a good deal of money in us, the least we can give back is transparency in respect of the money with some relevance and regard to the Oireachtas.  Our only request is that among those three people would be someone with either a working or a decent knowledge of the industry.  It is a difficult business; it is not like any other one.  We are very fortunate that the previous chairman of Horse Racing Ireland was Denis Brosnan, who was a very good breeder, understood the industry and was a very good businessman.  They are the sort of people we need, rather than somebody who is just good in business and sees this as just an ordinary business enterprise.  It is quite different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500007#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Iceton"},{"type":"speech","time":1405431300,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I call Mr. O'Dwyer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500007#G00600","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405431300,"counter":33,"content":"<p>We welcome the Betting (Amendment) Bill and that a good deal of work has been done.

Since the dates the Senator mentioned when the tax was 15% or whatever was the initial tax rate, the difference between then and now is that it was paid by the customer.  Today it is not paid by the customer.  The year 2006 marked the end of the tax being placed on the customer and it must now be paid by the bookmaker.  The other change that was made that year was that bookmakers were forbidden from passing it on to customers.  It is expressly written in the legislation that the bookmaker must pay it out of turnover.  The reason it was reducing every year was that Internet and telephone betting were being born.  They were starting to take the turnover from retail betting.  To allow retail betting compete with an online mobile world, the tax had to keep falling and it was taken off the customers.  That is the first point.<\/p><p>  The second point relates to the averages Mr. Iceton referred to across the world and across the water.  There is a serious difference there and the difference in those countries is that the tax is on profits.  In Ireland it is on turnover.  In an Irish betting shop, turnover tends to get higher when Ruby Walsh is riding a number of winners.  Our turnover gets higher, our customers win money so they have more money in their pockets, they place more bets, turnover gets higher, so they pay higher tax when they are losing money.  Our problem is the tax rate on Irish retail betting is on turnover and not on profits.  If any of the members would like to check back on any of our submissions for the years since the foundation of our association, they will note that we have been calling for a model such as that in the UK where the tax is on profits.  We would have no problem with paying tax on our profits.  It is the tax on turnover that is unfair, inequitable, penal and is unique in Europe.  In the other countries in Europe where it does apply, they are state-owned operations and they can set the margin of profit they make and that is how they pay it.<\/p><p>  The last point I would make relates to tax and how operators are able to pay 50% gross profit tax in the UK plus a 10% horse racing levy.  The reason they can do it in UK shops is that they have a different business model.  They have machines.  Some 60% of the revenue taken in British betting shops is by way of machines.  Those terrible things we hear called FOBTs in the UK generate 60% to 65% of their income.  We have a totally different business model in Irish shops where we still use a pen and paper and there are papers on the wall.  We have also been calling for online betting to be taxed because to date it is only the retail betting operators that have been contributing to the fund.  In every submission we have made, we have called for online operators to pay their share of tax.  The taxation model cannot work with online poker, online bingo and all those operators being let off scot free.  The only operators being taxed in this betting Bill are the sports books because turnover tax does not work in any of the other types of gambling, whereas if it were a profits tax, it would apply to them all in the morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500007#G00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Sharon Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1405431300,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Ms Byrne has made a fair contribution.

It is important to outline the process, which is the first time the committee has done this.  We have introduced a new reform in how we deal with legislation.  Normally, the Bill would be brought through the House and one would argue the toss over amendments on Committee Stage.  This is a pre-legislative stage in which all stakeholders, such as the witnesses, appear before the committee and tell us where there are potential nominees.  Mr. Andrew Coonan pointed out a number of them, as did the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association, ITBA, around the foal levy and a number of different issues.  This allows us to pass Bills more quickly.  If we can head off some of the potential problems at the start by feeding them back into the Department, we hope that when the detailed Bill comes before us some of the problems will be headed off.  That is what makes this process very useful.<\/p><p>  I am interested to hear from all the bodies appearing before us whether there are elements of foreign practice from which we could learn.  Are there things that other countries do in how they run their racing that we could do better here?  I am aware that not every country can be compared to Ireland.  In terms of funding streams and betting, I am conscious that a country such as France is not comparable as it does not have the same betting system as Ireland.  In the area of integrity and mergers, have other countries done something similar?  Are there pitfalls of which we need to be aware and from which we can learn?<\/p><p>  Perhaps Mr. Iceton would outline some details around the foal levy.  How much is the foal levy?

A point was made about board composition and the Minister's representatives having a thorough knowledge and some having a working knowledge.  It is absolutely key that any representative of HRI understands the industry.  As an industry, it can be a tight clique.  It is hard to get that balance with a person who has the required knowledge yet is perceived as objective and unbiased and not from a certain camp.  If we were to appoint somebody to the board who does not understand the basics of how the industry works and the importance of the industry to the country, it would be a waste of time.  I concur with the views of the witness.  It may be no harm to be more prescriptive than is provided for in the heads of the Bill.<\/p><p>  The witness mentioned that some of the committees having outside members is beneficial.  Some of the committees can have outside members.  It is important to clarify that.  I think Mr. Iceton was referring to the need for specialised chairpersons on occasion.  Whatever about the chairperson being specialised, the ability to bring in outside expertise is very important.  That is acknowledged particularly with regard to media rights and other areas.  I will return to media rights later because the jockeys raised a valid point.<\/p><p>  The fixtures committee is absolutely crucial.  I concur with some of the points made.  Perhaps I will touch on Ms Sharon Byrne's presentation later.  I agree that the bookmakers have an integral role to play.  In some ways there is much animosity in the industry and there can be much friction between the bookmakers' side and the other side, but it is in everyone's interest that we get an industry that works as well as possible.  I am aware of what happened in Punchestown a couple of years ago when Morgiana day had as a sponsor a big bookmaker that put a large amount of money into it, and it had its biggest crowd in a number of years.  The promotional expertise was brought in from the bookmaker's side.  There was a clash the following year with the open meeting in Cheltenham.  The bookmakers stood back from their sponsor because of that and everyone lost out.  The Punchestown crowd was much smaller.  It was an occasion on which the fixtures committee appeared to be acting a bit aloof.  There is great merit in making sure the fixtures committee and the programme committee take on board all the other sides, including foreign elements that may come in.  <\/p><p>  On the trainer side, I commiserate with Mr. Dermot Weld on Vintage Crop, a great servant of his and to the industry.  Reading through his submission, I noted that it focused very much on the funding element, which has been a key component.  While this is the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which deals with the structures around how the industry operates, the betting tax is a matter for the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and, in particular, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  The points made here have been noted and will feed into a larger debate.<\/p><p>  Mr. Andrew Coonan made a presentation on behalf of the jockeys.  Again, he referenced the funding issue.  The Betting (Amendment) Bill passed Report Stage last week.  I will get to that when I come to Ms Byrne's submission.  His point that the jockeys deserve a place on the committee is well founded.  The representatives of the Irish Stable Staff Association who appeared before the committee last week said likewise.  Is everyone happy that the industry as it was in 2001, when we set up the HRI legislation, still has a representative board?  Are we just arguing about who is represented and whether everybody is equally represented, or is there a sense that we need to get away from a representative board?  I am just throwing out that general question.  I take the point that jockeys need their own individual representation.  I am conscious that Mr. Ruby Walsh and Mr. Michael Kinane are present.  Not every jockey is lucky to be as skilled as those two individuals and to get the high-quality rides they have got down through the years.  I am particularly mindful of the jockey who is totally dependent on the money for riding out in the morning and if he gets a win, it is a bonus, as opposed to supplementing his income.  For the jockeys who are down the pecking order it is a tough life, because they have to make all the sacrifices and they get the same injuries as the witnesses.  It is tough going and the career span in the industry is limited.  It is an issue we need to be mindful of.  Without our high-quality jockeys representing us around the world, we would not have the name we have in the industry.<\/p><p>  Points were made about the regulatory body.  I asked earlier if there are lessons to be learned from abroad in respect of integrity and all the areas of the regulatory body.  The Bill is attempting to ensure the industry runs as smoothly and efficiently as possible and that we get good value for the money put in by the State.  At the same time we cannot allow any change to take place which, down the line, would damage our integrity.  Integrity is something one has and one can take it for granted, but when one loses it one does not get it back.  By the time one realises it is lost, it can be too late.  The points made in respect of integrity need to be borne in mind in any report we send back.<\/p><p>  The media rights in respect of the jockeys are well founded.  It is an extremely important committee.  In her presentation Ms Sharon Byrne pointed out that &euro;24 million of the fund comes from betting shops in Ireland and &euro;30 million goes to SIAS and all the others for the media rights.  There is as large a pot of money there.  While we could spend all our time talking about the betting tax, there is an equally important amount of money on the media rights side, which it would be wrong to ignore or not to give it the same level of attention.  I am conscious that most of what Ms Sharon Byrne said in regard to the bookmakers' industry was about betting shops.  She stated that the number of betting shops had decreased from more than 1,000 to 992 and that turnover had decreased significantly.  The elephant in the room is the fact that people have not stopped betting; they have just changed their mode of betting.  Their iPads and iPhones are the new means of doing that.  The Betting (Amendment) Bill, which extends the betting mode, passed Report Stage last week and hopefully will be enacted by the end of September.  That Bill will give us a much broader mechanism to take in tax, something which should have been done some time ago.  We can have a discussion when we have a proper system that measures equally everyone who lays a bet.  We can also have a debate on the rates.<\/p><p>  Is there any opposition to the point made about increasing the amount of racing at Dundalk?  Again, that comes back to the fixtures committee and media rights.  I expect it is in the interests of all the representatives to have racing.  We have many horses in the country but not as many as in the height of the boom.  Why has that not happened before now?  I have heard before that we should have racing more than one night per week in the winter.  If anybody has any views on that issue I would like to hear them.  <\/p><p>  The point made by Mr. Shane O'Dwyer that the industry never wanted to be dependant on State financing is a valid one.  The changes Senator Paschal Mooney discussed, particularly the reduction from 2% to 1% by Brian Cowen in 2006, have left the industry in a situation in which the State is supplementing it.<\/p> <p>The industry employs 17,000 people but has the potential to employ 25,000, the number it employed at its height.  It creates economic activity in areas where there is very little other economic activity.  When one is fighting for taxpayers' money one is competing with the hospitals, with schools and that is not the position that an industry of this size and calibre needs to be in.  We need to get to a position where between the media and the different elements, we have an appropriate funding stream for the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500008#H00600","speaker":"949","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405432500,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives from the four groups that are here today.

It is important that during our exchanges today we do not get bogged down by a debate on betting tax.  That is an issue for a different Bill completely.  Everybody thinks that the bookmakers are out to rob the punters, but we all love taking money off the bookmakers, whether the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan takes money off them in tax or we take our winnings, we do not care.  What we need to ensure is that when the Horse Racing Ireland (Amendment) Bill 2014 completes its passage through the different stages in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il that we have a better industry at the end of the process.  Our main focus is how the industry progresses.  We know how many people are employed in this important industry.  Whether a person breeds a horse, breaks or trains a horse, rides a horses, bets on a horse or works in a betting shop, it takes a great deal of money and care to get a horse to a racecourse.  It is important that we create the conditions to make the industry better.<\/p><p>  How we fund the industry is an issue for another day.  The Bill is all about getting a better industry.  The two main contentions that the four groups present today and the two groups last week relate to heads four and six.  Everybody is vying for a position on HRI and on its committees.  Do the representatives believe that the committee, as proposed in the Bill, is not large enough and that the number should be increased from 12 to 14 members?  As they said, it is about the expertise on the board.  I would love to see the jockeys and the stable staff on the board, as they have expertise at a different level from the trainers and owners.

Their presentations were succinct and they have set a standard for future presentations to the committee.  They must be complimented on the structure of their presentation because sometimes we are faced with long-winded presentations with neither head nor tail to them.<\/p><p>  I would like to see representatives of all the bodies we have met on the HRI committee.  The Indecon report recommended a reduction in the board size but have the representative groups given any thought to that recommendation?  We are faced with a Hobson's choice.  I think the points made by all witnesses must be taken note of, because we need to ensure that people with detailed knowledge of the industry are appointed as well as those who represent various facets of the industry.  The stable hands have a different representational value from jockeys, owners and everybody else.  It is important that they all come together so that the different niche interests are involved.  Perhaps we could make a recommendation on the level of representation on HRI.  Many of the suggestions that have been made on the membership and general function of the HRI are worthy of consideration.  I come from County Westmeath, which is horsey country and I have seen the significant drop in the level of activity of racing and breeding.  I am not surprised, as I used to be a horse owner.  Has anybody given any thought to the demands of HRI - from the time one gets up in the morning to the time one goes to bed at night, the HRI is looking for money from the horse owners?  I remember getting letters every morning, the wife was nearly going to set fire to some of the stuff that was coming in the post.  Apart from the recession and other expenses, why should the HRI charge for renewing the colours every year?  The colours do not change.  Is the HRI efficient?  It seems to be looking for money for everything.  In fairness, one can bargain with the trainers but one cannot bargain with HRI, because when it demands it gets the money.  I was certainly perplexed by the number of demands for various things from the HRI.<\/p><p>  I know that many small bookmakers are struggling, especially those on the main streets and in rural areas.  The industry has employment opportunities in every corner.<\/p><p>  I was particularly interested in the presentation made by the chief executive of the Irish Jockeys Association, Mr. Andrew Coonan.  I would like to see a proper appeals mechanism in place because some of the measures that can be imposed upon on jockeys, which is their livelihood, can be fairly draconian.  I was surprised at the point he made about seeking a specific right of appeal to the High Court to be set out.  That is almost taken for granted because one can go to the High Court by way of injunction or by judicial review.  As it is an administrative decision, one has a right of doing those things, they are costly and I know where he is coming from, not every jockey has a deep pocket and while one or two may be doing well, many are just struggling.  Did Mr. Coonan consider seeking a right of appeal to the Circuit Court because the Circuit Court has increased competence and increased jurisdiction and that would be a cheaper option?  It would involve lower costs than the High Court.  Mr. Coonan states that the racing regulatory body has everything set out and is a master of its own cause but is he looking for an independent appeals system, that would be chaired by an independent person, let it be a person with a legal background or from another walk of life who is competent to be a chairperson of the appeals body.  Is Mr. Coonan saying that there is no use in having a fight with the devil and having the court in hell?  He wants an independent process.  I would like Mr. Coonan to elaborate on that and set out who would chair the body.  Mr. Coonan is seeking the specific right to go to appeal to the High Court to ensure that justice is done between all the parties in the case.  I have no doubt it is an administrative decision and I would have seen such an impact on a person that he would have other rights.  I am interested in the reason that he advocates so strongly for this line.  Mr. Coonan is involved in much of the regulatory procedures as he represents the jockeys.

I see where the British Horseracing Authority in Britain is worried that not enough horses are being produced to have a full racing programme.  One only has to look at America to see what has happened in the past 12 years, where the funding mechanism was wrong and betting went all over the shop.  The number of races in America has reduced from 53,000 in a year to 37,000 last year.  The average number of runners for a race is now under seven, when one is looking for eight runners for an each way bet.<\/p> <p>If one is to have competitive racing, breeders must breed horses and must make some money if they are to so do in the first instance.<\/p><p> As for the foal levy about which Deputy Heydon asked me, at present it is approximately &euro;1.25 million.  The breeding industry is unique in that it is self-regulated and so for argument's sake, what pertains to the regulation and registration of horses internationally is a self-regulated industry.  We meet other bodies and for instance, Mr. Shane O'Dwyer and I were in Chile a couple of months ago.  We need funding to make sure of the rules on regulation and the control of the industry, as well as for events such as this meeting, while working on behalf of the industry.  We need some money from the foal levy and get approximately &euro;350,000 of that.  We give approximately &euro;400,000 per year into Irish Thoroughbred Marketing.  Members might consider that although we have an industry worth &euro;1 billion, we are spending little more than &euro;1 million to promote it worldwide.  Just to sidetrack, when Kerrygold rebranded Dairygold last year, which was the number one butter on the Irish market, it spent &euro;1.5 million in so doing.  Yet here we are with a prime industry and have &euro;1 million with which to promote horse racing throughout the world.  It is a pitiful amount of money.  However, of the &euro;1.1 million being put into Irish Thoroughbred Marketing, the breeders themselves are contributing &euro;400,000.  In addition, we are putting approximately &euro;800,000 into the Irish Equine Centre because the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for many reasons has pulled back from providing diagnostic services on behalf of the industry.  Obviously, our industry needs fast response times and we have an equine centre that probably is one of the greatest centres of veterinary excellence in the world.  For example, were I to send a blood sample to it this morning at 12 noon, a full biochemical report will come back to me by 3 p.m.  That is the purpose of the levy.  We are not afraid to put a lot of money into this business to look after ourselves and then we have the European Breeders' Fund, EBF, with which the standing farmers put a lot of money into prize money.<\/p><p> Third, Deputy Heydon and Senator O'Neill asked about representation.  Basically, we seek a position of right.  I have outlined how our association is completely democratically elected across the Thirty-two Counties within regions and so on.  Moreover, we are self-renewing every two years.  I would like the breeders' seat on the proposed body to be given to the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association.  We are the only representative body for the breeders and would like the person we put forward to be the person who is accepted.  I presume the same argument goes for my other colleagues sitting at the various tables in this committee room.<\/p><p> Deputy Penrose asked about money going into Horse Racing Ireland, HRI.  Were it properly funded, HRI would not need to be scalping the owners as often as it does.  Owners are paying 30% of the prize money and are paying a huge percentage of the administration of racing.  Ultimately, the owners basically are paying to put on the show and they need some amelioration on how they are being scalped along the way in respect of the costs of just having and training a horse.  As the Deputy observed, one at least has some say in what one pays the trainers but these add-on expenses are making it quite difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500009#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Iceton","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405433100,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I will get back to Deputy Heydon on a couple of issues he brought up.  He referred to the fixture in Punchestown that was sponsored by the bookmakers but which ran into opposition with the open meeting in Cheltenham and he wondered why it could not be changed.  While I am aware the bookmakers think it would be easy simply to race when they wanted to so do, the pattern must be taken into consideration, whether it be on the flat or over jumps.  For example, the jumping season's graded races probably start in October and every week thereafter throughout the entire season, a number of graded races are run.  They run one into another with the result that one will have the big meeting in Down Royal, which runs two weeks before the meeting in Fairyhouse and so on.  Consequently, if one changes one race, such as the John Durkan Memorial Chase or the Morgiana Hurdle race at the particular meeting to which the Deputy referred, by bringing them back or forward by one or two weeks, one would be running them into another race meeting and into another race.  This is where the problem with the fixtures comes in.  I have no doubt but that the fixtures require a complete overhaul.  It requires a blank sheet and to start it again but this cannot be done by stating it will be done in a particular way by next year.  Were someone to start the whole thing again with a blank sheet by moving whatever races needed to be moved and were we to move along bit by bit, it would take until 2020.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also raised a point on the size of the board.  The race horse trainers certainly have no problem with the board being as big as whatever.  I have been on the board for two terms, with just one year to go, and I do not believe the board's size ever caused a problem.  The board works very well and I would have thought that having everybody represented is what it is all about.  I cannot understand why it is proposed to make it smaller or what difference it would make.  The board meets every six weeks to give our opinions and the executives take whatever from that.  It is a good system that works well and I see no reason whatsoever for it to be made smaller.<\/p><p>  In respect of the other point about racing in Dundalk, at present the bookmakers fund winter racing in Dundalk, in conjunction with Dundalk, which works quite well.  Were the bookmakers prepared to do that again and to continue, I would say they could race every day of the week.  I do not know whether there would be enough horses available to do that but if the money to race in Dundalk is taken out of the general prize fund, it will decimate the prize fund for the regular racing.  One will reach a situation where there will be no money for anything.  At present, we are struggling and the prize fund is poor and what will then happen, which has happened in England, is that when racing at the all-weather tracks gets down to such a low level, it basically becomes crooked because people are not getting paid for racing and so they find other ways of doing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500010#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Meade"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405433100,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I thank members of the joint committee.  I wish to pick up a couple of comments from Senator O'Neill and Deputy Heydon.  To me, it all seems to come together at the relationship between the various parties.  We have discussed representation and committees not being used to exercise power but to get information and expertise to come together to the benefit of all, which is very important.  A question was asked on the use of expertise from elsewhere and while I would not wish to appear before the committee and hold up the United Kingdom as an example of the ultimate, I refer to one useful area within the United Kingdom's structure.  As members are aware, the Horserace Betting Levy Board brings in the funds and then, with the British Horseracing Authority, BHA, distributes them through various prize funds and fixtures committees.  It has a betting patterns working group on which I sit and is the only group of which I am aware that has bookmakers present.  It includes the racecourse companies, the Racecourse Association, the horsemen's representatives, the BHA and the Horserace Betting Levy Board.  That group comes together, shares a lot of the data on performance, betting rights and so forth and then makes recommendations that are fed into the levy board.  As for the proposed committees under discussion here, it would be useful to be able to get to the point at which one has that shared expertise whereby people are open and are able to provide data and think about how the quality of the product here might be expanded.  I would recommend that as an example of how it works better somewhere else.<\/p><p>  In respect of the fixture committee, one point that is clear is when it comes to the value of fixtures and when one seeks to monetise this value through media rights, Irish racing is not a sole seller in this regard as it competes with racing in the United Kingdom.  When, in my Ladbrokes capacity, I look to buy picture rights for horse racing here in Ireland, Belgium, Spain or the United Kingdom, I will look at a number of products.  One would be the cost per meeting to buy from the United Kingdom or Ireland but more importantly, how does it fit into the programme.  One piece of work carried out by the betting pattern working group concerned clashes between Irish racing and United Kingdom racing.  I accept fully the point made by Mr. Meade that one must protect the pattern.<\/p> <p>At the same time, when it comes to selling its product in 2016 or 2017 - whenever the media deal expires - Irish racing will, for all the right reasons, want to be in a position to say it has a product that stands up against the UK media product.  As a bookmaker, I will have to decide what I want to buy.  Work that can be done by the individuals here and in Horse Racing Ireland in the interim could put the industry in a position where it can maximise its media rights payments from the UK and elsewhere.  There may be some small adjustments to be made, such as having races at Dundalk on one additional evening per week, for example.  The funding figure at this time is &euro;30 million, but it will probably be something different in 2017 and 2018.  That is the way to commercialise the industry.<\/p><p> When it comes to media rights, it is important to remember that there is no right in terms of what one will get paid, and Irish racing has to compete with UK racing.  The industry in our neighbouring country is very concerned about whether UK bookmakers will buy Irish rather than UK.  It will be a very competitive market.  I would welcome the opportunity to participate in committees, either as a standing member or adviser, to offer what expertise I can to the bookmaking sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500010#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike O'Kane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405433700,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I will deal with the points raised by Deputies Heydon and Penrose.  On the question of whether there is a better way of doing this, I would answer in the negative by pointing out there is a worse way of doing it.  The board, as it currently exists, works quite well in so far as it is reflective, as Mr. Meade observed, of much of what is happening within the industry.  As to whether it might need to be expanded or more focused, my view is that it certainly should be more representative.  I have already raised that point with regard to jockeys.  An ability to take views from those participating in it is absolutely vital to the progression of any industry.  The existence of a regulatory board is appropriate at this point in time but should be developed further.  Senator O'Neill asked whether the board should be larger.  As I said, what is important, in my view, is that its composition should be reflective of those who are involved.  That will be of benefit to the industry itself.<br \/>Some of the points raised might be more relevant to the two men who are here today but perhaps less so to the guy who is riding one or two horses per week and is essentially subsisting.  Jockeys themselves have put in place a pension structure, for instance, under which money from the higher prize earners goes towards those who are less fortunate and who quite often find themselves in very difficult situations.  It is absolutely vital, as I see it, within the whole prize money structure, that jockeys would be able to continue to look after themselves and their colleagues.  I accept that their interests are sectional, but it is vital that they should have the ability to look after their own in that regard.  That is why representation on the board is crucial.<br \/>Deputy Penrose referred to charges and costs.  A 4% transaction charge is actually very high in terms of the cost to the owner, jockey and trainer.  That has to be addressed and an obvious way of doing it is by way of a betting amendment and an increase in the tax.  Greater prize money will lead to greater funding on a cascade effect.  That, in turn, should see a reduction in transactional charges and costs.  Certainly, that is what the board should be working towards.  It is a very obvious way of addressing the issue in a way that encourages owners into the industry and keeps them involved.<br \/>I do not have a problem with the racing regulatory board <i>per se<\/i>, but there must be checks and balances in place which ensure a strong and robust system and integrity within the industry.  That is absolutely vital because the betting industry depends on that integrity.  I am concerned that the proposed amendment does not address the fact that the racing regulatory body, the Turf Club, effectively has <i>carte blanche<\/i>in terms of penalties imposed.  There is no upper limit on the penalty to be imposed on a trainer, rider or any licensed person by the regulatory board.  We have an opportunity here to address this problem with the 1994 Act.  This issue has been raised in another forum and is currently <i>sub judice<\/i>.  That the legislation currently in place prescribes no upper limit for the racing regulatory board in terms of penalties it can impose and so on is not acceptable.  However, this can be readily addressed in the very same way as the parameters within which other semi-State bodies work are defined in legislation.<br \/>To clarify, I am not necessarily asking for an independent board or a new appeals system, but the right to redress should be limited in terms of cost and available to all who are subject to sanction.  I am calling for the Bill to limit the powers of the regulatory body in terms of the penalties it can impose, or at least set bounds to them.  The question of the automatic entitlement to address the High Court is, in fact, currently under consideration by way of a Supreme Court appeal.  Heretofore, the racing regulatory body was not regarded as amenable to judicial review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500011#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Coonan"},{"type":"speech","time":1405433700,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I will now take a final round of questions, beginning with Senator Mary Ann O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500011#L00300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1405433700,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I was struck by the comments in regard to head 6 in the submission by the Irish Bookmakers Association, because I would not have thought about bookmakers participating in the race fixtures committee.  We are not supposed to talk about money and funding today, but I would appreciate some commentary from Ms Byrne or Mr. O'Kane on this point.  An Irish racing fixture is worth an average of &euro;1.3 million in turnover.  However, if another fixture is taking place on the same day, it is only worth &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000.  The suggestion was made regarding separate days and it was noted that Mondays and Fridays are under-utilised as fixture days.  I am sorry to hear from Mr. O'Kane that profits are down.  As I understand it, three quarters of bookmakers' profits now come from online business, with revenue growing by 17% this year to &euro;745 million and profits up 5% to &euro;141 million.  Online is where it is at as opposed to traditional betting shops.<\/p><p>  My next question is for the racehorse trainers.<\/p> <p>I am keen to hear a little commentary from Mr. Weld, Mr. Mead or Mr. Grassick.  Although they did not mention it today their submission called for the licensing of a racehorse trainer to be included under the responsibility of Horse Racing Ireland and transferred to HRI from the regulatory authority.  I am keen for some commentary on the last line of the relevant paragraph which states:<blockquote><br \/>In particular, the existing criteria used in granting licences to both professional and restricted trainers does not at present require a structured training program therefore resulting in a reduction in proper standards, horsemanship and business acumen.<\/blockquote>Mr. Weld mentioned something very inspirational to me earlier and perhaps he could repeat it for the other members of the committee.  He said that the 29% cut in funding to the entire industry and HRI since 2008 has had a negative impact and that there are 3,000 fewer horses in training and 4,000 jobs have been lost.  Each of the deputations before the committee today as well as the owners association last week have brought home the point that this wonderful industry, in which we are best-in-class in the world, is slipping and slipping fast because of the lack of funding.  Will Mr. Weld repeat the story about the owners as people who produce jobs?  They are an IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland group.  This is foreign direct investment.  I was having a cup of tea with the trainers earlier.  Perhaps they could share their thoughts with the other members.  Most of the money coming in to this industry is from abroad rather than within the State.  Most of the owners are wealthy people from abroad who are creating employment and bringing in business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500011#L00400","speaker":"1169","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405434300,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank the deputations for their presentations.

I apologise for not being here earlier, I was at another committee.  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien touched on one question for the trainers.  In their presentation the trainers asked to be associated with HRI rather than the regulatory body.  Why is that the case, seeing as every other section within the industry is under the regulatory body?  Why should the trainers be excluded?<\/p><p>  Another question for the trainers is to do with fixtures.  There are approximately 350 fixtures per annum.  I do not know whether Mr. Meade is on the fixtures committee, he probably is.  Is that too many or is it sufficient, given the number of races with small numbers of horses running?  In this regard I highlight our flagship race, the Irish Derby.  This is no reflection on owners or trainers but it only had five runners this year.  That does not go down well for the future, particularly in the case of the flagship event.  I have seen this happen with pattern races.  Are there too many pattern races?  Could this have led to the problem that Deputy Heydon highlighted, that is, the fact that the open meeting clashed with the Punchestown meeting and that the bookmaking industry had put such an emphasis on the former?  It was a great meeting.  Children and everyone who represents the future, including punters, goers, jockeys and those in all parts of the industry, go to such meetings.  I am keen to hear a comment on that.<\/p><p>  In their submission the thoroughbred breeders asked for the removal of point-to-point racing from the regulation.  Why is that?  It is an integral part of racing.  Mr. Meade is aware that most of his owners buy horses from the point-to-point sector.  What if there is no regulation or integrity associated with that?  This is something we are trying to do on the greyhound side.  Coursing is not overseen by the regulatory body but we would like to see it brought on board because there is betting there as well.  We want to have some sort of integrity associated with it.  I am keen to hear the comments of the breeders.<\/p><p>  All four groups before the committee referred to funding.  They have probably honed in on the betting side of things.  There is no mention of the tote within this legislation.  It is not even mentioned in the betting committee.  Tote Ireland has been a loss-maker to the industry and has made no contribution to racing.  Are the deputations keen to see the tote directly involved in the betting committee or some scrutiny of it by the betting committee?  As I said earlier, it is adding no value to the racing industry.  There are other sides related to funding that should be considered.  The tote is one area, tax betting is another and sponsorship is a key area that we should consider.<\/p><p>  All the groups have mentioned media rights on several occasions.  Media rights will be a major part of the funding of the industry in future, particularly racing itself.  I would hate to see initiatives by racetracks whereby they sell their media rights.  In particular, I take on board Punchestown, which has several grade 1 races that its sells to the French market.  This allows betting to be done overseas.  It is vital to incentivise racetracks that have media rights and a product to sell their media rights to improve the entire sector.  I realise the jockey deputation might not agree with that.  They are probably the stars but the horses are stars as well.  There is potentially huge money on that side of things as well.<\/p><p>  The betting Bill is coming up.  Tax is paid by every punter who lays a bet one way or the other except on the tote.  There is no tax income to the racing industry from the tote.  If I lay a bet of &euro;20 with Ladbrokes then Ladbrokes pays the tax for me but if I put it on the tote no tax goes to the racing industry.  That should be considered as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500012#M00400","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1405434300,"counter":61,"content":"<p>That is the final array of questions and comments.

In the Irish classic this year we had possibly one of the best three year old colts which had raced in Europe this year.  People are inclined to run away from him, which is why some of the fields can be very small.  It is not altogether due to the fact that we have too many races.  Sometimes we do not have horses at the very top level.  We must have these races, but sometimes they are not as competitive as we would like.  It is unfortunate that this season has turned out to be so disappointing, but this will not happen every time.  It is about getting back into the pattern.  We must keep up with English and French racing patterns.  There is a need to reschedule some of the pattern races.

There has been no offer under the current regime.  My consideration is set out on the last page of my submission.  This point is not exclusive to jockeys, as trainers do not participate in the benefits; neither do the owners nor the stable staff.  The 1994 legislation is entirely inequitable.  It is open to challenge, but it has not yet been challenged.  The Bill presents an opportunity to address it and it needs to be addressed.  It can be done through the media rights committee.  For this reason, it is very important that it be considered.  It would be to the benefit of all to hear the views of Mr. Weld on the issues raised by Senator Mary Ann O'Brien on the input of foreign investment.  Hearing the views of someone very much at the coalface of dealing with domestic and international owners would be worthwhile.  The difficulty we have with funding which I will not rehash as all members are aware of it is fundamental to the success of the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500013#N01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Coonan"},{"type":"speech","time":1405434900,"counter":79,"content":"<p>In other countries do jockeys and others have a share, or is Mr. Coonan asking for something outrageously different?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500013#N01600","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405434900,"counter":80,"content":"<p>That is a very good question.

Not only is a particular new international owner helping me to employ more staff, he is so taken by his visits to horse racing in Ireland that he is moving his head offices which were located in Melbourne, Australia and London to Dublin.  He will employ between 250 and 300 people in his company offices.  He had never been to Ireland before last year and visited again recently.  He enjoyed the country and visit and because of horse racing will move his main offices and employ between 250 and 300 people.  This is a spin off and such things do happen.  I always try to get across the employment factor.  The horse racing industry is a 32 county rural employer and produces spin-offs in terms of further employment in other industries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500013#N01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Weld"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405434900,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I wish to clarify several technical points.  On the graph we included in the submission on the value of one or two meetings per day, the reason there appears to be a disconnect is simply in an Irish retail betting shop Irish racing competes with the UK product.  If there is one Irish meeting and three UK meetings on a particular day, it may get its fair share of airtime or customer attention, but if there is another meeting on the same day, the timings may well clash.  That is why an extra meeting would not necessarily double the value of the turnover generated.  Rather than having four meetings covered in a betting shop, there would be five to be covered, together with everything else going on.<\/p><p>  The tax model in Ireland means that it does not matter on what people bet because the tax applies to everything.  However, it makes a big difference in selling the rights abroad.  Wearing my UK hat, if I was looking to buy four fixtures today and I already had three UK fixtures, would I buy a second Irish fixture if the number of fixtures moved from four to five?  The fifth fixture, as indicated, would be of lesser value.<\/p><p>  The Irish fixtures programme should not be governed by what is happening throughout the world, but it must be mindful of the extent to which events can be monetised.  Of the &euro;30 million which goes to Irish racing from its media rights, only 10% of the value comes from Irish bookmakers.  A total of 90% of the &euro;30 million comes from UK-based organisations buying the pictures.  The danger in not being aware of this fact is that in 2017 or 2018 the UK retail sector might not want the extra fixtures, which would make a very big hole in the funding of Irish racing.<\/p><p>  A question was asked about another organisation which received three quarters of its profits online.  I am not sure which organisation this is because clearly it is not ours.  I wish we made three quarters of our profit online.<\/p> <p>None of the bookmakers that represent their numbers online indicate where that revenue comes from.  Much of the revenue from one of the bookmakers the committee may be thinking about comes from other jurisdictions where there may not be the same kind of retail environment.  Online numbers can be very complicated.<\/p><p> The Senator who has now left asked about the growth in the value of betting on football.  As our submission shows, retail betting in Ireland has declined and continues to decline.  Some of that has transferred to online but that does not make up the difference in the Irish market.  All of us in this industry, working together, have to decide that where there is a revenue stream from Irish online and retail businesses, we can take this product and sell it abroad.  The elephant in the room is how will media rights be discussed, advised and how will everyone buy into them when signing them in the future.<\/p><p> The number of runners per race is decided by several factors, for example, are they playing in Dublin, what is the horse population, what is the racing structure, how is that race made up, which horses qualify for that particular race, what else is going on and prize money.  The British Horseracing Authority, BHA, has the same problem in that the average number of runners per race appears to be falling.  In fact, the average is a false number.  Certain race types are suffering because the horse population in those classes is weak and there is probably too much of that particular type of race whereas the other types of race are constantly divided.  Subtle changes may help the race fixture programme, in terms of the number of runners per race not in that particular example, but in other areas.<\/p><p> Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, has full responsibility for media rights.  All I and others ask is that we are party to how those media rights are monetarised to ensure there is equitable sharing of those benefits through the industry.  I support the comments made by other members here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014071500013#N01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike O'Kane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405435500,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Deputy Lawlor asked why point-to-point racing should not be included in the Bill.  We contend that the sport has gone from strength to strength under the auspices of the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.  It is an amateur sport whose ethos is sporting endeavour and we see no reason that the State should interfere through HRI in what is a voluntary sporting organisation, akin to the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA.<\/p><p>  In response to the question on the Tote, it never ceases to amaze me how something run on the basis of the Tote can give so little back to the industry.  The returns are very poor.  Sometimes it is said that the pool here is too small.  I note in Chester, since the sale of the British Tote, the racecourse has installed its own Tote system, which is highly profitable and is putting large sums of money back into the racing there.<\/p><p>  It amazes me when I travel around the world how difficult it is to see Irish racing.  I was recently in Singapore on a Friday where they show French racing.  There is French national hunt racing on a Friday, which people would not naturally bet on, but on that day in Singapore more money was bet on the French national hunt than in the whole of France.  There were no Irish pictures.  Where are our media rights?  I subsequently spoke to somebody whose job it is to sell media rights and asked where are the bright sparks for our media rights in the future to which he replied \"Italy and Israel\".  We have a world class product here, administered and regulated to the highest standard, yet we cannot get the pictures out to other countries, to give them a product to bet on, of the highest world standard.

I am joined by Mr. Niall O'Donnellan, head of policy and investment services, and Mr. Tom Hayes, head of microenterprise and small business.  I propose to take the members through the key achievements of 2013 and initiatives under way for 2014.  Then my colleagues and I will respond to questions.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland's main objective is to grow jobs in Irish companies.  For companies to grow their employment, they need to grow their sales.  Export growth provides a sustainable growth route, and if companies want to win sales overseas, it will drive growth in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland works in partnership with its clients, providing a cohesive set of supports, both financial and non-financial, to help them start, grow, innovate and compete in global markets.  The ultimate goal is driving economic growth and employment creation.  I acknowledge, in particular, the support of our parent Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, in this context.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland client companies continue to generate increased jobs growth, recording the highest overall net rise in employment levels in the past decade, with 5,442 net new jobs at the end of 2013.  Moreover, they provide employment for 175,750 people, comprising 149,718 full-time and 26,032 part-time workers.  Irish-owned firms, in terms of payroll and purchases of materials and services produced in Ireland, accounted for &euro;20.28 billion in expenditure in the Irish economy in 2013.  As a result, the companies supported by Enterprise Ireland are supporting and sustaining more than 300,000 jobs directly and indirectly throughout the country.<\/p> <p> The outlook for new job creation in 2014 is positive, with employment growth returning to the economy and unemployment steadily declining month on month.  There remains a considerable task to create the jobs necessary for our economy, but the outlook for our companies and their job creation plans is at its most positive since the recession took hold.<\/p><p> In terms of driving export growth in our client companies, Enterprise Ireland understands that, in a small economy, exports sustain and create jobs.  With total exports exceeding &euro;17 billion in 2013, Enterprise Ireland's clients exported more than at any time in the history of the State.  Responding to evolving market opportunities for our clients, the Government approved the recruitment of 20 additional staff in high-growth markets.  In September, we announced the opening of two new offices, one in Istanbul, Turkey, and a second in Austin, Texas.  In tandem with the development of our network, the number of ministerially led trade missions co-ordinated by Enterprise Ireland has more than doubled in the past two years from eight in 2011 to 16 in 2012 and 18 in 2013, with an extensive programme designed to build on export growth in markets where Irish companies are strong and to open doors in new, high-growth markets.<\/p><p> A series of major trade missions have already been completed for 2014.  For example, earlier this year Enterprise Ireland organised a mission led by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, as part of a five-year strategy targeting &euro;1 billion in exports to the Gulf.  An important support for Enterprise Ireland is the embassy network across the globe.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Export Trade Council, on which Enterprise Ireland is represented, are key stakeholders in the national drive to increase trade.<\/p><p> During 2013, Enterprise Ireland continued working to increase the number of companies starting up, expanding, exporting and creating jobs.  In 2013, we approved support for 104 high-potential start-ups, HPSUs, the most in any single year.  Last year also saw a significant increase in female-led projects, with the highest ever level of new investments by Enterprise Ireland in start-ups led by female promoters.  Some 41 projects led by women won investments during the year, 14 of which were HPSUs, with the balance supported through the competitive start fund.<\/p><p> Community enterprise centres, CECs, provide a range of facilities that enable entrepreneurs to establish new businesses.  A total of 157 centres have been approved for financial support, of which 117 have been completed and are operational.  Some 9,300 jobs have been created by companies in CECs in the past decade.<\/p><p> Following on from the Government's decision to restructure the microenterprise and small business support system, the dissolution of the 35 county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, and the establishment of local enterprise offices, LEOs, formally took place in April of this year.  The LEOs are now operational across the country, enhancing the availability of supports to entrepreneurs and micro and small businesses.  Enterprise Ireland is working through its centre of excellence to support the LEOs and to ensure that the best available services and supports are available to anyone thinking of starting or expanding a business.<\/p><p> In May, we launched a new &euro;500,000 Enterprise Ireland competitive start fund targeted at stimulating new start-ups by graduates.  This fund will help start-up and early stage companies to get off the ground and launch new products and services in the international marketplace.  The fund will close for applications on Wednesday of next week.<\/p><p> As well as providing tailored support in creating and implementing plans, our capability and mentoring department has developed a number of flagship programmes focused on supporting leadership and management development and building international sales and marketing capabilities in Irish companies.  Some 240 executives from client companies participated in significant management development programmes, while 845 executives took part in short programmes, both exceeding targets for 2013.  In 2014, we have been developing our approach to peer-to-peer learning and reaching more companies with our learning initiatives.<\/p><p> Enterprise Ireland recognises that our clients must be competitive in order to succeed in international markets.  Enterprise Ireland's lean business offer encourages client companies to adopt lean principles and build the capabilities and capacities of their people.  A total of 143 lean projects were supported during 2013, comprising 80 LeanStarts, 43 LeanPlus assignments and 20 LeanTransform projects.  Clients of all sizes and sectors were involved in these programmes.  This has been a core business offer for Enterprise Ireland to help companies to address their competitiveness challenges.  To date in 2014, we have supported 47 companies.<\/p><p> Enterprise Ireland offers a range of financial supports to assist clients through all stages of the business cycle.  The nature and level of support offered will depend on each individual company's developmental needs and is assessed in consultation with the company's development adviser.  Through Enterprise Ireland, the State has invested heavily in stimulating and facilitating the availability of seed and venture capital to provide access to finance for small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  In 2013, the fourth seed and venture capital scheme, valued at &euro;175 million, was launched.  This scheme is aimed at providing additional funding for high-growth Irish companies with the potential to generate large amounts of additional export sales and grow jobs.  It targets an additional &euro;525 million in funding from the private sector, bringing the total to &euro;700 million.<\/p><p> Among the major developments in 2014, Lightstone Ventures partnered with Enterprise Ireland and the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, to establish a fund worth $172 million.  As a result, new funding will be available for the life sciences sector to support company development and job creation.<\/p><p> Enterprise Ireland's role in Ireland's research and technology landscape is centrally focused on empowering Irish companies to create high-value and innovative products for international markets.  The office of science, technology and innovation in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation plays a central role, co-ordinating research and development supports.  In total, 858 of Enterprise Ireland's clients were engaged in significant research and development projects of above &euro;100,000 spend in 2013.  Some 139 spent more than &euro;1 million.<\/p><p> In order to promote business innovation with the ultimate aim of creating jobs, Enterprise Ireland also works with the broader enterprise base, including multinationals and the research community.  The technology centre programme that Enterprise Ireland runs jointly with IDA Ireland brings consortia of indigenous firms and multinational companies together with academia to tackle problems.  In so doing, the centres represent the best of Irish indigenous and multinational companies' researchers working together to solve issues that are too big or costly to be solved by any one company working in isolation.<\/p><p> During the year, two new technology centres were approved, those being, the technology centre for data analytics, CeADAR, in UCD and the centre for pharmaceutical manufacturing based in Limerick.  These enhance manufacturing competitiveness and support the research and development mandate of the Irish sites within multinational corporations.  We also funded a second phase of Food for Health Ireland, FHI, which is helping to mine milk to identify novel ingredients.  This year has seen the launch of the new Horizon 2020 framework programme, which will represent a key source of research funding over the next seven years.<\/p><p> Enterprise Ireland continuously drives the commercial return on the State's investment by providing direct funding to researchers to commercialise their work.  Enterprise Ireland has taken the lead in driving the commercial return from research by building the technology transfer infrastructure within the universities, where dedicated technology transfer offices have been established.  Commercially relevant research centres have also been established in institutes of technology and campus incubation facilities have been put in place to support new technology companies.<\/p><p> May 2014 saw the launch of Knowledge Transfer Ireland, which is aimed at making it easier to commercialise ideas from State-funded research.  The purpose of this new resource is to make it easier to commercialise, and create viable businesses and jobs from, State-funded research from all third level institutes.  Knowledge Transfer Ireland is the first resource of its kind in Europe, operating as the State-funded central technology transfer office, which is located in Enterprise Ireland, and operating collaboratively by Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Universities Association.  The key service offered is a web portal that enables companies to identify experts, research centres and technology licensing opportunities to benefit their business.<\/p><p> Enterprise Ireland continues to be centrally involved in the Action Plan for Jobs, with a significant element of the plan falling to us for implementation.

Everyone in Enterprise Ireland works incredibly hard for Team Ireland here and abroad and I wish it continued success.<\/p><p>  I have specific and general questions.  To start with specifics, Ms Sinnamon stated that Enterprise Ireland received sanction to appoint 20 new staff in high-growth markets.  Where are those staff and are they fully in place?  How many were placed in China?<\/p><p>  The CECs and business development managers represent a good innovation.  How many of those positions have been filled and has Enterprise Ireland given consideration to sharing that role between a number of CECs?  I get the sense that some of the CECs are drifting and are not doing what they could be or fulfilling their potential because the people running them are doing too much else in their communities.  While the position of business development manager is welcome, would we get more bang for our buck if it was shared?<\/p><p>  Will Ms Sinnamon update us on the LEOs?  Mr. Hayes has been in and out to the committee and beaten around the issue often.  He has taken many bullets for the Enterprise Ireland team about the new role of LEOs.  Our concern, which remains light, is that the fantastic work being done by Enterprise Ireland is far removed from the CEBs.  A client going to a CEB would have thought a HPSU was a drug.  Clients want to expand their businesses and provide services in their communities without exporting.  Will Ms Sinnamon assure the committee that she is aware of this difference?  I pay tribute to the former Minister of State, Deputy Perry, for his work in rolling out the LEOs, but will Ms Sinnamon also assure us that the type of client I cited will still be at the heart of the LEO?  We all want people to export and we want technology, and some of us visited UCC's Tyndall National Institute to see some of the research to which Ms Sinnamon referred, but there are still people who just want to start a business.  Someone must have an interest in them.<\/p><p>  Last year, there was an issue with audit reports on Enterprise Ireland's programmes in the south east.

To give a bit of background, we had four schemes and have invested &euro;46 million or &euro;47 million in 117 centres that are now operational.  As the chief executive stated, they have created 9,000 jobs, with a little over 6,000 people in full-time employment in 1,200 companies.  A little over two years ago, we introduced a business manager development scheme.  Some 46 managers have been recruited for those centres - 37 in 2012 and nine in 2013.  Interestingly, the centres with business development managers employ on average approximately twice the number of people as centres without managers do.  We are reviewing the programme, which has concluded.  No funding is going into the CECs currently but, with our parent Department, we are trying to decide what the next phase for helping them should be.  They play a major role, particularly in rural areas of high unemployment where the incubation centres found in urban environments are not present.<\/p><p>  We reviewed 21 of the centres with business development managers.  In 2012, they had 354 companies.  In 2013, they had 427 companies.  In 2014, we forecast they will have almost 500 companies.  Likewise, those 21 centres have seen a significant increase in job numbers, from 1,685 in 2012 to 1,722 in 2013 and 1,847 so far in 2014.  Undoubtedly, there is a strong correlation between CECs having business development managers and the number of clients and jobs for which they account.  We are encouraged by these figures.  Financial constraints permitting, we hope to introduce a new scheme to help in areas that are not well serviced by infrastructural supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014071500005#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1405428300,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I suggest that Enterprise Ireland should engage with Leader companies.

One point we would make on a regular basis is that indigenous exports are the smaller relation as opposed to FDI exports.  On a policy level, from our perspective, there is a major need to redress that balance.  I wish Enterprise Ireland luck in that objective.<br \/>The budget of Enterprise Ireland has been falling over the past number of years.  Has the budget fallen due to a lack of demand from potential clients within the State or because of a decision made by a Minister that less will be allocated to its role?  In respect of regionalisation, I believe there is a big push within the IDA to really regionalise its objectives into the future, possibly because of a lack of emphasis in the past.  I am looking at the regional breakdown of Enterprise Ireland's figures.  The mid-east has 43% of the jobs and roughly 43% of the increase in jobs, but the mid-west has 7% of the jobs and 3% of the increase.  We also see that the west and the midlands have 7% of the jobs.  While the distribution by Enterprise Ireland is much better than that of the IDA, there is still a regional issue there.  The argument often made is that it is a push-pull experience - in other words, there is a difficulty if one does not have entrepreneurs in the region to pull the demand for Enterprise Ireland.  An organisation such as Enterprise Ireland would have objectives for better regionalisation, so there are things it can do to improve that.  Could Ms Sinnamon talk us through what Enterprise Ireland hopes to do on that in the next year?<br \/>I have been in discussion with a couple of local enterprise offices around the State.  I know Ms Sinnamon mentioned that Enterprise Ireland is rolling out training, but some LEOs have not received training and I believe they are identifying a problem both with themselves and their integration with the local authority and Enterprise Ireland.  <br \/>The BRIC countries remain a phenomenal challenge to us in respect of exports.  I know Ms Sinnamon has given the headline figures within the report, but could she talk about the trends within the figures regarding research and development?  In respect of North-South co-operation, we met with Science Foundation Ireland yesterday and one of the refreshing elements it mentioned was that it is working with Seagate in Derry and the Tyndall National Institute.  They are providing services to the North for free.  Could Ms Sinnamon talk about the level of North-South co-operation by enterprise agencies and about objectives into the future?<br \/>Is there anything Enterprise Ireland can do with regard to legacy debt?  A number of businesses have closed and a number of them are teetering on the brink of closure due to a millstone of legacy debt, although they are functional businesses.  There was a report in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>about &euro;27 million worth of support for firms that are connected with the board of Enterprise Ireland.  Confusingly, the report then went to state that &euro;271,000 was paid in financial supports to companies last year compared to &euro;3.1 million earlier.  Is Ms Sinnamon aware of that report?

I will start at the beginning in terms of indigenous exports being the smaller relation.  The fact is that exports from multinational companies are substantially higher than those from indigenous companies.  Having said that, we now have growth year on year and are now at the highest level in the history of the indigenous side.  It is worth looking at the impact on the economy of both.  Up until last year, the spend in the economy by both multinationals and Irish companies was about &euro;18 billion, so they have both have a similar impact at local level in terms of the overall spend on raw materials, wages and service purchased locally.  This year, our figures have gone from &euro;18 billion to &euro;20.28 billion.  I have not seen the IDA figure for last year but I would be surprised if it has kept pace.  The impact of the indigenous companies in the local economies in every town and village in Ireland is very often not recognised.  All people see is the headline export figure.  Obviously, the key focus and the rationale for our placing an additional 20 people in overseas markets is to increase the exports on which we will grow jobs, so that is something that is well made.<\/p><p>  Last year, we had a shortfall in terms of the budget that was actually drawn down.  That was for a couple of reasons.  One was that our own resource income was higher than had been projected and, therefore, we needed to draw down less money from the Exchequer than was projected.<\/p> <p>Second, there was money for seed and venture capital funds because of certain issues.  Once we approve it they then use our funding to try to raise funding in the international markets, so there were delays.  It is a timing issue which will catch up over the lifetime of the fund.  Last year we needed to draw down less only because of the own resource income and the seed and venture capital side.

We put huge effort into that area in the past two years.  Around 900 companies attended export awareness events, 300 of which have attended exporting exploration workshops.  These are two-day workshops which go through all the mechanics of how to export, with mentoring support, back-up support and advice and connections with our UK office.  We have invested a significant amount of money in those workshops in terms of internationalisation grants and feasibility research.  That is a cohort of indigenous companies for which exporting would not be the number one priority but we are trying to inspire them and encourage them to export.  These companies are spread all around the country.<\/p><p>  On the regionalisation issue, we have done much work in the midlands region in terms of outlining what is available, company profiles and the strengths and weaknesses of the region, working with colleges and local enterprise offices.  We are looking at the whole enterprise base and working with the IDA to see how we can work better together, rather than having a situation in which Enterprise Ireland does its piece and the IDA does its piece.  The results of this will be rolled out in each of the regions.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Calleary raised the issue of LEOs, which is a challenge.  We have already had a number of information days at which Enterprise Ireland and local authorities have outlined the range of services and supports to be provided to the staff of LEOs, and we have also had representatives from the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection to ensure a level of joined-up thinking.  This will ensure that when a person approaches a LEO, he or she can be directed elsewhere in the event that a LEO cannot assist directly.  Commencing this week, some 125 staff will be involved in change management.  There is a culture change for people who have worked all their lives in a local authority and those who would have been on the front line in enterprise.  We are rolling out a change management process commencing this week.<\/p><p>  We are obsessed by the customer, who is king.  Senator Feargal Quinn spoke at one of our information days about the customer and we all know the focus he puts on the customer.  Irrespective of the changes taking place, the focus on the customer is crucial.  The final aspect is that we must ensure the functional competencies of the staff are up to date and up to speed in terms of sectoral dynamics, understanding business propositions, business plans and being able to read the financial statements and accounts of a company, and understanding changing dynamics and technologies within sectors.  We are rolling out a suite of programmes to ensure the staff are in a position to connect with the client base that is operational within the LEOs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014071500007#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Hayes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405429500,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I covered the challenge for the BRIC countries and agree that it continues to be a challenge.

I am honoured to be asked by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to become chairman of PIAB.  I would like to give the committee some background information on my career to date and in particular my specific experience relevant to this position.<\/p><p>  I was born and raised in the west of Ireland and went to secondary school there.  I attended University College Dublin where I graduated with a first class honours degree in agricultural science.  I immediately completed a masters in business administration, MBA, in Trinity College Dublin and was one of the first agricultural graduates to secure an MBA.  That was a long time ago.<\/p><p>  I joined the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, after graduating for two years and thereafter went into private industry as marketing and sales director of Gateaux, which in those days was a large exporter of cakes to Marks and Spencer and other such shops.  When I was in my late 20s I was appointed chief executive officer, CEO, of Thorn Domestic Appliances and after that served as CEO of Toyota and Coal Distributors over the next decade. <\/p><p>  In 1993, I completed a management buy-out of Allegro Limited, which at the time was Ireland&rsquo;s largest distributor of grocery products.  The arrival of Tesco in the late 1990s and its central distribution model which sought to bypass the distributors had a serious impact on Allegro but I successfully managed a profitable exit for shareholders. <\/p><p>  For the past 15 years I have been operating as a private equity investor in a wide range of private companies.  I have done this on a hands-on basis, in other words, I have not just put in money but have been an executive chairman of these companies.  I have gained a lot of experience in doing that and have had quite a success with the investments.<\/p><p>  In addition to my own investments, since 1993 I have been a non-executive director of SIAC Limited, a private family company, and am currently chairman of the company, which was one of the largest construction companies in Ireland where it built most of the roads.  Unfortunately, the company got into serious problems in Poland, which is a long story and has been the subject of much publicity.  Effectively we were not paid.  We had no alternative but to go into administration which we have come through.  I guided the company through a successful exit from administration, albeit it is now a smaller company. <\/p><p>  I also served as a non-executive director of Hibernian Plc and, since 1998, of Aviva.  Hibernian Plc was quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange, ISEQ, and was Ireland&rsquo;s largest supplier of motor, household and public liability insurance.  It was acquired by Aviva, the sixth largest insurer in the world, which also acquired a health insurer in 2007.  Normally, in line with the regulator&rsquo;s terms, the period for such service is a maximum of nine years, but because there were problems I was asked several times to stay on and finally retired last December.  In addition to my non-executive directorships, I served at various times as chairman of the nomination committee, the audit committee in Aviva, and was for 15 years chairman of its pension trustees, which I resolved very satisfactorily for all involved before I retired, and in latter years I was chairman of the board of Aviva.<\/p><p>  I have a good, deep knowledge of the general insurance industry.  I am not an actuary but I understand the cut and thrust of the business and the different perspectives on it, depending which side of the fence one is on.  I would hope to be able to bring that type of experience to PIAB.  I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to speak and I welcome any questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014071500010#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Divilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1405431300,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I wish Mr. Divilly well because he brings a great deal of experience to this role and we look forward to working with him in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014071500010#K00600","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speech","time":1405431300,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I wish Mr. Divilly well.

TASC is an independent, progressive think-tank and our core focus is on the growth of economic inequality in Ireland in recent decades, which follows trends in the United States and the United Kingdom, as described by economists such as Professor Thomas Piketty who recently spoke at TASC&rsquo;s conference.  Economic inequality is bad for society, but it is also bad for economic growth and stability.  We recently analysed Ireland&rsquo;s tax system and how it interacted with the economy.  We present evidence that defending and, ultimately, growing our level of taxation is essential for economic recovery and to boost job creation, in addition to tackling inequality.<\/p><p>  Ireland is caught in a low-tax triangle; our tax and social insurance take is just three quarters of the European average.  Low taxes mean lower levels of public services and social transfers and everyone has a higher cost of living, with more out-of-pocket expenses for services that would be cheaper or free of charge in other countries.  As a result, many do not have enough money for essential goods and services, meaning less demand in the economy and calls for lower taxes.  However, this is a downward spiral.  In response to a parliamentary question the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, confirmed that &ldquo;Ireland does indeed have the lowest tax wedge of all EU members, for those on average wages.&rdquo;  To be clear, the actual combined tax and social insurance figure paid by people on average wages in Ireland is the lowest among EU members of the OECD, despite the nominally high marginal rate.  This is because of the much higher rate of tax credits and tax reliefs in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Recent calls for cuts to Ireland&rsquo;s higher rate of income tax are based on two false premises.  First, a cut to the 41% rate will not benefit those on middle incomes.  The Minister for Finance has confirmed that only 17% &ndash; the top one in six of income earners &ndash; pay anything at the higher rate of income tax. The vast majority would not receive any benefit from changes to the higher rate or bands.<\/p><p>  Second, tax cuts in a low-tax economy are not the best way to boost growth and job creation.  Drawing on recent research by the ESRI and the Central Bank, it is highly likely that tax cuts for the higher paid would lead to people paying down debt, not boosting the domestic economy through consumption or investment.<\/p><p>  In considering options for budget 2015, in addition to arguing for Ireland&rsquo;s tax base to be defended, we have circulated other tax-related policy briefs to members.  We outline TASC&rsquo;s analysis of the inequitable step effect in PRSI.  An employer must pay &euro;1,680 to give a one euro net pay increase to a worker.  We present the case that cutting VAT would benefit everyone rather than cutting higher income taxation.  We propose a third rate of income tax for high earners.  We have a detailed analysis of the cost of tax breaks in Ireland, which continue to be very high.  We recommend the best practice in Australia, where there is an annual report on all tax reliefs which can be scrutinised by the parliament.<\/p><p>  Tax cuts would lead to a decrease in public services, social transfers and public investment, which would have the net effect of shrinking the economy and worsening economic inequality.  Those on low incomes or reliant on welfare would gain nothing from tax cuts but would be worse affected by reduced income or service cuts.<\/p><p>  In a recent study the IMF pointed out that the economic growth multipliers from investment were higher than what would be achieved through income tax reductions.  To boost growth and job creation, we need public investment in infrastructure and human capital, which business groups and economists have suggested.  A virtuous cycle in the economy is possible, with public investment crowding in private investment.  However, to do this we need to strengthen the tax base.  This is to maintain public services and social transfers and fund new public investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071500003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nat O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405431000,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation.  Chambers Ireland is the representative body for chambers of commerce throughout the State.  Owing to the geographic spread of our membership, we have unique insights into the issues faced by businesses in all regions.  We recognise that signs of a partial economic recovery are evident in certain sectors, but we believe the budget will present an opportunity to focus on more broadly based economic growth.  The issues raised in our pre-budget submission can be grouped into two main themes: taxation and job creation; and taxation and local economic development.<\/p><p>  On taxation and job creation, our members represent businesses that create and sustain jobs in their local areas and we believe there are a number of adjustments to the tax system that would enable them to create more jobs across the country.  Taking on an employee is a big risk for a small business and businesses need to be incentivised to take that risk.  It is vital that the employer&rsquo;s rate of PRSI for class A staff be returned to 4.25% from the rate of 8.25% to which it was increased.  Capital gains tax should be reduced to 20% for genuine entrepreneurs to encourage them to invest their capital and create opportunities for growth and job creation.  The current level of CGT is a disincentive to potential entrepreneurs setting up a new business.  We need to give businesses certainty on the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector.  That certainty could give rise to additional jobs.<\/p><p>  Moves to support SMEs to improve their cash flow should be encouraged.  In particular, we would like to see the limit for cash accounting for VAT increased from &euro;2 million to &euro;2.5 million.<\/p> <p>Tax credits for research and development can also be of real benefit to business.  In our pre-budget submission, we outline a series of potential reforms.  We also believe that the employment and investment incentive and seed capital schemes need to be significantly enhanced or the finance put aside for them moved to something more productive.  We believe the marginal tax rate should be reduced to below 50% as it is an important part of bringing high value jobs to the country.  Another factor we raise is health insurance.  A large number of people in the country pay health insurance and those costs have been escalating very significantly through Government policies and general health costs.  We believe a focus on that is important.  Jobs and job creation will be crucial to achieving a sustainable economic recovery.  This budget is an opportunity for the Government to prove its commitment to the businesses that are central to that process.<\/p><p> I will now turn to local economic development.  The local authority landscape has fundamentally shifted.  We have always worked closely with local authorities and know what local government can to do to help.  The process of subsidiarity, which accompanied the recent reform of local government, has made some of our suggestions outside the control of central Government.  However, we believe Government must use its influence, particularly in respect of central funding, to ensure an effective local authority network that facilitates economic growth.  For example, the local property tax should be retained by local authorities to be spent on local issues.  Reductions in the cost of local government must lead to reductions in the cost of doing business.  Proposed reductions in the rate of local property tax by up to 15% must not convert into a corresponding increase in commercial rates.  We recommend targeted rates reduction in certain areas.  The funding model for municipal districts must not affect business through increased parking charges where there is an anomalous calculation that might encourage their increase.  <\/p><p> More specifically, there are a number of issues which can be directly addressed in the budget.  The 80% windfall tax on rezoned land is proving to be an impediment to building residential properties in certain areas.  A VAT anomaly whereby developers pay 13.5% VAT on residential property development costs but not on commercial development should be eliminated.  The Government must commit to a number of strategic infrastructure projects that will help drive economic growth in every region of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071500003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405431600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I call on Mr. Cribben to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071500004#C00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405431600,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee today.  I am here on behalf of the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland &ndash; a membership organisation which includes pubs, restaurants, hotels and independent off-licences as well as drinks suppliers throughout the country.  In my day job, I am chief executive of the Vintners Federation of Ireland representing pubs outside Dublin.  I am here as a representative of the 92,000 people throughout Ireland who depend on the drinks industry for our livelihood.  The simple fact is that excise increases in successive budgets have cost jobs, have made our tourist offering less competitive and have been used as a sneaky way to get more money out of struggling Irish consumers.<\/p><p>  There are some who believe that increasing taxation on alcohol can address misuse of the product.  This is not the case.  Additional taxes damage the industry and do nothing to address misuse.  I, and the 92,000 people we represent, want to see misuse of alcohol addressed and to this end, we have signed a pledge for the introduction of policy options to tackle misuse.  These options include addressing the widespread sale of alcohol at very low prices in a meaningful way, banning price-based advertising and also introducing a statutory code on alcohol merchandising.  Alcohol costs are 78% higher in this country than the European average so clearly pricing is not addressing the problem.<\/p><p>  However, pricing is creating a huge problem for the 92,000 workers we represent.  Excise increases in successive budgets have cost thousands of jobs, made our tourism offering less competitive and punished the hard-pressed Irish consumer.   Since 2007, over 1,000 pubs throughout Ireland have been forced to close.  These are pubs are not in Dublin city centre or Cork city centre.  They are in small villages around Ireland and as representatives of the constituencies which contain these villages, I know that members are all too aware of the serious challenges currently facing our rural communities.  It is no different in the pub trade.  While there is no one item that can be blamed for all of our ills, the fact that 80% of the increase in the cost of a pint in a pub since 2011 has been directly caused by taxation increases does not help.  <\/p><p>The impact is especially pronounced in rural communities where once the pub was a centrepiece of rural life.  Increasingly, we see the devastating effects of rural isolation &ndash; particularly amongst older men.  The huge tax rate on alcohol products in this country is leading to another unadvisable situation - a rise in the black market trade.  Seizures of counterfeit alcohol are steadily rising and a number of high-profile seizures this year show that the problem is only going in one direction.<\/p><p>  Ireland is one of the most expensive places in the world to buy alcohol products and this has been identified by tourists in F&aacute;ilte Ireland research to be one of their chief concerns about coming back to the country.  The tax take alone on a bottle of Jameson in Ireland is more than the total cost of the same bottle in the US. Excise on a pint in Ireland is six times more than it is in Portugal and ten times greater than it is in Spain so it is no wonder that tourists feel as they are being price-gouged when they visit Ireland.<\/p><p>  When the committee weigh up the arguments for and against excise tax, I hope that it will take into account the huge impact that it has on Irish jobs and Irish consumers.  In terms of tackling alcohol abuse, excise is a blunt instrument that unfairly impacts on small local businesses and does not deliver on reducing harmful patterns like binge drinking.  It is a sledge-hammer, not a scalpel.  The Drink Industry Group of Ireland stands ready to work with Government on policies that can deliver a difference on this important issue without costing jobs in communities that can ill afford to lose them.<\/p><p>  The 9% VAT rate has proved that tax measures can stimulate jobs through improving our image as a tourist destination.  At the same time as the Government boosted the hospitality sector with this policy, it saw fit to take with the other hand through levying further excise increases and putting pubs, restaurants and hotels under severe pressure.  A reduction in excise can have the same job-creating effect as the VAT cut did.  It is a boost to consumer confidence and more than that, it will help curb cross-Border activity, which is in real danger of taking off once again.  It will address one of the few negatives that tourists identify with Ireland.  I hope that the committee take these points under consideration as it looks to make a recommendation to the Minister and I am more than happy to answer any questions that members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071500004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Cribben"},{"type":"speech","time":1405431600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I call on Ms Mary Rose Burke to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071500004#C00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405431600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee.  IBEC represents businesses large and small, indigenous and multinational, right across the country.  IBEC recently launched a major campaign called \"An Ireland that works\", which sets out business priorities for the next stage of our recovery.  Those priorities have five key elements, which are based around reducing the tax burden, investing in the future, better Government and better regulation, extending Ireland's global reach and supporting enterprise and entrepreneurship.  Two of those elements form the main thrust of our budget submission, which is around taxing less and investing more.<\/p><p>  The latest growth figures from the economy show that a net adjustment of &euro;200 million will be sufficient on budget day to deliver the deficit targets.  This is significantly less than the mooted &euro;2 billion and will bring us comfortably under the 3% limit.  We have an opportunity to put some momentum behind the recovery we see in the economy.  Now is the time to draw under the period of painful austerity we have seen.  That was very necessary but the economy has now entered into a new phase.  We need to give consumers a break, put spending power into their pockets and kickstart a period of private commercial and public investment.  If we get this right, there is a potential to enjoy strong growth over the coming months and years and it will also deliver thousands of jobs across the country.  <\/p><p>  The budget must focus on reducing tax rates and stimulating investment in the economy.  I will look first at cutting income and consumer taxes.  With the economy doing well, there is an opportunity to give people back more of the money they earn.  Consumers deserve a break and putting more money back in people's pockets will stimulate the domestic economy and further job creation.  We have specific asks of the Government in respect of budget 2015.  Specifically, we would like it to increase the entry point into the higher marginal rate from &euro;32,800 to &euro;34,800; to reduce the marginal tax rate from a fully loaded 52% to 51%; and to address the anomalies in the universal social charge that mean that self-employed people are not treated in the same way as PAYE workers.  We are also asking that recent increases in excise on alcohol be reversed and would argue that the 9% VAT hospitality rate should be maintained.  We have seen that this has been very beneficial.  We would also request that the very unfair pensions levy be dropped, as was initially promised.  <\/p><p>  Along with that, we need to be cognisant of the tax environment for business.  We need to encourage investment by business and investment in infrastructure.  The capital gains tax regime needs to be completely overhauled to encourage companies to re-invest money in new projects and create new jobs.  The employment investment incentive scheme needs to be entirely re-branded and reformed to encourage people to know what it means about stimulating investment in Irish SMEs and Irish jobs.  <\/p><p>  We also need a period that involves taking advantage of the low interest rates that are available and a programme of public private partnerships to deliver on some key infrastructure projects.  We also need to be cognisant of our international tax offering.  We have become increasingly less attractive to mobile investment in recent years.  This is due to rising personal income taxes but is also due to some of the competitive offerings in other countries.<\/p> <p>This applies particularly to the UK, where the tax code has been realigned to attract foreign direct investment.  We must remain committed to the 12.5% rate of tax but we must examine other areas, particularly the tax regime relating to intellectual property.  We must bring greater certainty to the matter of tax credits for research and development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071500004#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405432200,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Burke and will ask some questions before the other committee members begin.

The Government has its office of procurement.  I believe we are at least 5% behind other EU countries in terms of contracts that are given to native businesses - businesses that are registered here in Ireland.  Between capital and current expenditure, the Government spends about &euro;13 billion.  That 5% represents &euro;650 million.  The Government is giving &euro;650 million of money to be spent in Ireland to contractors or businesses from outside the State.  There are some good reasons for that.  We all agree that schools should not be paying an inflated price for a sheet of photocopying paper if it can be got cheaper.<\/p><p>  What discussions have the various organisations had with the Department on what I would call customising the tender documents such that they would help Irish people?  One cannot just say, \"No non-Irish companies need apply.\"  However, the French are well able to customise their tendering approach to suit French businesses.  The Germans are expert at it.  With the Italians, I am sure nobody gets a look-in at all.  I would even go so far as to say that locally, Ireland is very good at doing this.  When it comes to road construction or maintenance in Cork or Kerry - no disrespect - if one is from outside those counties one should not be wasting one's time sending in a tender.  So procurement officers are well able, if they want, to gear their tenders to suit the market that is out there.  I am seriously depressed that we are handing &euro;650 million to those outside the country.  I am sure we could ensure that 80% of that stays in the country with proper imagination and without breaking the EU rules.  Other countries are better at it.

It is not just that the money is leaving Ireland; there is also the issue of small businesses around the country seeing relatively small contracts, such as printer contracts for local schools, going to a big central contract.

That fell to 10.73 litres in 2013, which is a reduction of just under 26% in the intervening period.  However, that probably only tells half of the story.  Another thing has happened in the last five or six years.  In 2006 and 2007, 60% of all alcohol sold in the country was sold in what is generally termed the on-trade, that is, pubs, restaurants, hotels and so forth, and 40% was sold in the off-trade.  Today, those figures are reversed.  It is now 60% in the off-trade and 40% in the on-trade.  When speaking about the off-trade one must be clear that it is not the independent off-trade but the headline grabbing advertisements we see in the Sunday Independent or the Irish Independent on Thursday and so forth.  Excise increases broaden the gap in price between the on-trade and the off-trade.  The excise remains the same on both, but the on-trade sells alcohol only, so it does not have other products over which to spread it, whereas the supermarket trade has 4,500 to 6,000 other products on which a cent here and a cent there can recoup what has been lost on the alcohol.  Take the example of what happened in the last two years.  In the weeks after the budget, the headline advertisements stated \"no excise increase here\".

It is only a matter of time before there will be no acceptable level of alcohol in the blood for drivers in the same way that smoking is not tolerated.  There was also a massive economic collapse in that period of time and people substantially changed their drinking habits with a move to off-licence sales, whether the big retailer or the local corner shop.

Not to give the impression that I am an international pub visitor, but there is a difference when one goes to France.

He is dead right.  The pub experience in Ireland is unique and gives our business model a particular type of branding and a particular advantage over other destination points.  Those in the retail trade have embraced significantly online technology and even though one can buy a mobile phone online, the research will show that most consumers want to go their phone shop to buy the product.  They like to feel it before they purchase.  Likewise, in recent weeks there was a big difference between sitting down and having a drink at home watching the World Cup and going out to the pub to watch it.  A concern Mr. Cribben and I would share is that there are many employed here in the drinks sector, not only at the pub end of it but in the manufacturing of alcohol.  Predominantly, we are a whiskey and beer manufacturing country but we have seen exponential growth in the consumption of wine which is not a domestically manufactured product.  Has Mr. Cribben any thoughts on how we can ensure that alcohol-producing sector is provided an incentive in the way that sector is in other jurisdictions?  I note the French have a particular bent towards providing incentives for the production of wine, and the consumption of wine reflects that in those areas.  Could we be doing something differently here, but in the way we market our pubs?  Visitors do not come here for the sunshine.  They come here for a unique Irish experience of which the pub is one part.  They do not come here to drink wine.  They come here to drink beer and whiskey.  How can we provide such an incentive?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071500009#H02300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405434600,"counter":376,"content":"<p>The number one attraction for tourists, as found in successive F&aacute;ilte Ireland surveys, is the experience of music and what they call \"craic\" in Irish pubs.

The Government has been discussing for too long the suite of measures required.  We have heard a lot of talk followed by more talk when we need action on pricing, segregation and price-based advertising.

Approximately 93% of our exports are by FDI companies, which leaves 7% by Irish companies.  We would like to see a more balanced economy and an increase in that figure.

I agree with Mr. Cribben that we have to put more money in people's pockets.  I have opposed the excise increases on alcohol and cigarettes because they are regressive, but, equally, when we are talking about tax relief, there is a big difference between giving tax to low and middle income earners who need extra spending power and to people at the very top end because even if they pay fewer taxes, they do not put the money back into the economy.

However, we have an important issue going on at the moment in that we do not have enough residential properties being built, particularly in the Dublin area.  That shortage is because we have not built much for the past seven years and for a few years before that we were building the type of property in which Irish people do not particularly want to live.<\/p><p>  If we want to get residential property built in the Dublin area, we need to start looking at repealing measures such as the 80% windfall tax introduced in 2009 which is actually preventing industrial sites around the Luas on the Naas Road, for example, being sold and converted to residential units.  We have still got the balance wrong on property.  I agree with some of the Deputy&rsquo;s sentiments but we need to get the balance right to ensure we are building the right residential units in the right areas.

If one goes back five or six years ago, we had a very narrow base where we were dependent on income tax and spending tax, be it VAT or stamp duty.  In the meantime, the base has been significantly widened.  It has been widened through the property tax, water tax and even on the commercial side in recent years water charges were introduced which did not exist in every county six or seven years ago.  One now has water tax in and water tax out.  That base has been considerably widened.  The key is in looking at each individual tax and seeing its net effect rather than the headline grabbing effect it might have.  The reduction in the VAT rate from 13%% to 9% within a specific area has been able to deliver jobs, which is good for the economy and for people.  It has been able to help towards the deliverance of a better tourism product which, again, is good for jobs and the Exchequer.

We are around this table arguing about whether it is the last &euro;200 million or &euro;2 billion or somewhere in between.

We have done that through a combination of tremendously hard work by a lot of people and the citizenship of this country got on with it, much to their collective credit.<\/p><p>  We have broadened the tax base.  We have increased many taxes that have been reduced in the good years.  In 1991 the top rate of tax was 54% and we got it down to 40% and now it has gone up to 52%.  We have brought in property tax and water charges.  The business community has supported the need to broaden the tax base and to take the pressure off.  We are at the point now where to keep things moving we can tweak the system a little.  We must recognise as well that we have done this at a time when some of our major markets were in disarray.  The euro was constantly in crisis and eurozone inflation is being kept below 2%.  Currently it is 0.5%.  The United States has been struggling and we have had major credit issues.

We should be much more open next time.  The last time we just gave the money away as it flooded in.  The next time we need to make proper structural change to suit the type of society we want to be.  That is a big statement.  I do not know exactly what type of society we want to be.  I do not think we ever want to be Scandinavian but we should make choices and do it when we have some breathing space.

In previous submissions we have looked at an equality-proof property tax.  We have looked at a water credit system to make water charges more equitable.  We are in favour of the tax changes as long as they are equality proofed.  We have looked in detail at Ireland&rsquo;s tax system.  EUROSTAT, the European statistical service, for example, produces a book every year called Tax Trends in the European Union, and there is a phenomenal amount of data in it.  In looking at that what we have seen is the biggest difference between Ireland&rsquo;s tax system, broadly speaking, is our level of social insurance.  Our social insurance levels are incredibly low compared to other European countries, in particular employers&rsquo; PRSI contributions are incredibly low.  That keeps down labour costs in Ireland.  It is part of the tax wage we discussed earlier, but one could double employers&rsquo; PRSI contributions and they would still be the lowest in the European Union.  There is a real difference.<\/p> <p>This means that people take a greater risk if they lose their jobs, as they immediately go to a welfare level and there is no income replacement.  In other countries, one is insured through social insurance payments and might get 80% of one's income per year upon losing one's job, then 60%, before dropping down to a subsistence level.  This allows people to find other jobs, keep making their mortgage repayments, etc.  Social insurance is the main gap.<\/p><p> The level of local taxation in Ireland is low and only 2% of all tax revenue is spent locally.  The European average is 10%, with 50% in some Nordic countries where people pay taxes locally and see services locally.  Irish local government has been eviscerated in terms of its finances.  The property tax may go some way towards addressing that, but we are yet to see the system settle or know how much property tax there is locally.<\/p><p> Consumption taxes are indirect and regressive because they affect people on lower incomes more.  We tend to have more of these taxes and fewer direct income taxes than other European countries.  There is an imbalance.  A part of the reason for this is not the rate of tax, as many countries have higher marginal tax rates at average earnings.  For example, it is 59.4% in Belgium, but people there pay higher actual amounts of tax because they have fewer tax credits and reliefs.  I have two pages of Revenue's statistics showing the items for which we give reliefs and expenditures.  This approach reduces the amount of income tax people pay.  Australia has a large book that allows its parliament to scrutinise whether reliefs are value for money and good for the economy.  Ireland has many tax breaks compared with other European countries, but they are not scrutinised and they can expand in the economy.  During the boom, they distorted investment decisions in hotels, property and so on.  There is plenty of scope for a structural examination of the detail of the tax system.<\/p><p> The European assessment of Ireland's finances was mentioned.  According to Europe, the fact that we charge no or low VAT on food and other large categories makes it poorly targeted.  In other words, many people are getting them VAT-free.  However, much of this benefit can be absorbed through higher prices.  Compared with many European countries where VAT is charged on food items, Ireland does not have cheaper food despite the fact we pay no VAT on it.  We need to examine the detail of the tax breaks and how we distribute consumption taxes.  There is scope for another tax commission if people have the appetite for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014071500014#N01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nat O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405438200,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Connor.

I also welcome the opportunity to respond to criticisms of the council in the aftermath of its decision.<\/p><p>  The event licensing procedure is set out in Part XVI of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and in planning and development regulations.  It is a statutory procedure which the city council is legally obliged to follow.  The legislation provides that the decision on any event licence application is an executive decision.  The decision falls to be made by me, as chief executive, or by an officer of the council to whom I have delegated the power to make the decision.<\/p><p>  In this particular case the decision to grant the event licence and the conditions to be imposed under the licence was made by Mr. Jim Keogan, executive manager in the council&rsquo;s planning department, to whom those powers have been delegated.  The assessment of the licence application was undertaken by Mr. John Downey, administrative officer in the planning department.  Both Mr. Keogan and Mr. Downey have very considerable experience of the event licensing system.<\/p> <p>As with all major planning applications, the officers concerned consulted me prior to the decision being made.<\/p><p> The legislation requires a local authority to have regard to the following criteria when making a decision on an event licence application; they are set out on page 2 of my statement.  It also gives us very general powers to impose conditions on any licence granted.  Without prejudice to the generality of these conditions, I have set out some of the particular issues to which the legislation refers.  In that context, we have the power to impose conditions in respect of the number of events permitted at a venue within a specified period not exceeding one year.  While the power to impose conditions is very general, the council, in determining an event licence application and imposing conditions, cannot restrict the number of future events at a particular venue.  The conditions must relate to the event or events covered by the licence application.  It should be noted that an event licence decision made under the Planning and Development Act cannot be amended or appealed.  It is not legally possible for the council to reopen the decision to grant a licence or to amend the conditions attaching to a licence granted once a decision has been made.<\/p><p> To the extent that this case has highlighted certain weaknesses in the event licensing procedure, it would be a matter for either the Oireachtas to amend the relevant legislation or the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to amend the relevant regulations to address these weaknesses.  The city council will be happy to contribute to any review of the event licensing system.<\/p><p> In section 3 of my statement I set out the application of the procedure in respect of the event licence application relating to the Garth Brooks application.  Said application was not submitted until 17 April 2014.  As part of the licence application, the applicant would have advertised publicly for submissions to be sent to the city council and there was a specified mandatory five week period for public consultation on these submissions.  The closing date for receipt of submissions was 21 May and a total of 384 submissions or observations were received.  These were detailed in nature and submitted by a wide spectrum of the public, including numerous residents - individuals and representative associations - and some businesses.  A copy of the submissions and observations, with sensitive information such as telephone numbers and e-mail addresses removed, was sent to the statutory agencies on 28 and 29 May for their information and consideration.  It was also circulated to the relevant Dublin City Council departments.  A copy of the submissions was also sent to the promoter and the venue management which were asked to consider the issues and concerns raised in the submissions and outline in detail any proposed mitigation measure they deemed appropriate to address them.  A reply was received on 20 June by Dublin City Council from the venue management and the promoter.<\/p><p> As part of the standard event licensing procedure and prior to a decision being made on the application, on 3 June, at Dublin City Council&rsquo;s request, a meeting was held with the promoter and venue management on the production-build-decommissioning of structures schedule that had been received.  Further meetings took place on 11, 16 and 24 June on updates on the application, the arrangements for the proposed concerts - if licensed - and in order that we might discuss issues raised in the submissions and observations received.  It was made clear at these meetings by Dublin City Council that no decision had been made on the application at the time and the applicant was advised that the council had serious concerns about the impact the proposed five consecutive shows would have on people living in the area.<\/p><p> Typically, it takes ten weeks to process an event licence application.  This includes the specified five week public consultation period, the time necessary to consider submissions received and undertake necessary consultations with various statutory agencies and the applicant.  The application for an outdoor event licence for the Garth Brooks concerts was received by Dublin City Council on Thursday, 17 April.  The decision to grant a licence, subject to conditions, was made on Thursday, 3 July, precisely ten weeks later.<\/p><p> Having assessed the application and having regard to the issues raised in the submissions and observations received, Dublin City Council approved three of the proposed concerts.  However, it considered that it would not be appropriate to grant a licence for the five consecutive concerts for which application had been made.  I will now outline its reasons for this decision.  In the first instance, the scale, magnitude and number of concerts, with an expected attendance of in excess of 80,000 people per night for five consecutive nights, three of them being week nights, would be unprecedented for Croke Park.  <\/p><p> The second reason was that three consecutive concerts had already taken place in Croke Park from 23 to 25 May 2014 and given that the stadium was located in a heavily populated residential area, a further five shows in a row was considered to be an over-intensification of use of the stadium for the holding of special events or concerts.  It would, in effect, be permitting an increase of 100% in the maximum number of concerts that had previously been held in Croke Park in any given year.  The previous maximum was four and the request in this instance was for five.  In addition to the three which had already taken place, this would have meant a total of eight concerts at the stadium this year.  <\/p><p> The third reason relates to the fact that the cumulative effect on residents and some businesses in the Croke Park and surrounding neighbourhoods of licensing five shows in a row - three of them on weekdays - would lead to an unacceptable level of disruption to their lives and livelihoods over an unprecedented and prolonged period caused by concert-related noise, access restrictions, traffic disruption, illegal parking and potential anti-social behaviour.  The city council would also have been concerned about the precedent that would be created if five consecutive concerts of this scale were to be licensed.<\/p><p> Having regard to the submissions received, approval was given for three events to be held on Friday, 25 July, Saturday, 26 July, and Sunday, 27 July, subject to conditions.  In granting an event licence allowing three consecutive Garth Brooks concerts in Croke Park, the council has approved a total six concerts for Croke Park so far in 2014.  In so doing it was cognisant of the fact that the maximum number of approved special events or concerts in any one year heretofore in Croke Park had been four.  It is worth noting that in the original grant of planning permission for the redevelopment of Croke Park in 1992 An Bord Plean&aacute;la determined that there should be a maximum of three special events or concerts per annum in Croke Park.<\/p><p> I am satisfied that the statutory event licensing procedure was applied correctly in this case by the city council and that the decision reached was appropriate, balanced and reasonable and had regard to all competing interests.  This is particularly the case in view of the relationship between Croke Park and neighbouring residents.  Nothing that has occurred since the decision was made has changed my opinion that it was appropriate, balanced and reasonable.  It is, of course, open to any individual or organisation that thinks otherwise to initiate judicial review proceedings and challenge the decision.  I should state, however, that such proceedings will be vigorously defended by the city council.<\/p><p> I would like to respond to a number of criticisms.  In the light of the decision of the promoter and Garth Brooks not to proceed with the three permitted concerts and given the importance of the concerts to Dublin's economy and the number of individuals who purchased tickets in good faith, there is a general and widely held view that the city council should amend its decision.  In refusing to do so it has been unduly inflexible.  As stated, an event licence decision made under the Planning and Development Act cannot be amended or appealed.  It is not legally possible for the council to reopen the decision to grant a licence or amend the conditions attaching to that licence.  Notwithstanding this, I am satisfied that the city council displayed considerable flexibility, both immediately prior to the decision on the licence being made and since it was announced, in an effort to ensure the Garth Brooks concerts would proceed.  I wish to provide three examples of that flexibility.<\/p><p> On the evening of Wednesday, 2 July , prior to a decision being made on the event licence application, I spoke to Mr. Jim Clarke of Aiken Promotions.  I wanted to advise him, as a matter of courtesy, of the imminent decision on the licence application.  In the course of that conversation I informed him that the likelihood was that only three concerts would be permitted.  Mr Clarke, having consulted Mr. Aiken and, I understand, Mr. Brooks, rang me back and advised that Garth Brooks would not perform three concerts.  I then offered to discuss with the decision maker in the planning department, Mr. Keogan, the possibility of permitting a fourth concert if Mr. Clarke could give me a guarantee that Garth Brooks would perform all four.  I gave no commitment to Mr. Clarke in this regard, other than stating I would raise the matter with the decision maker.  On the morning of Thursday, 3 July, before any conversation had taken place with the decision maker, Mr. Clarke rang me back to say that unless all five concerts were permitted, Garth Brooks would not come to Dublin at all.  I then withdrew my offer and the decision was made to grant the licence for three concerts.<\/p><p> I also met Mr. Peter Aiken of Aiken Promotions and a senior civil servant on Thursday, 10 July.  At that meeting a proposal was made by Mr. Aiken in respect of matinee performances designed to break the impasse.  Under the proposal, the city council would consider an updated event management plan to be submitted in accordance with the licence.  I should stress that it is a condition of the licence that the applicant submit an updated event management plan without changes required to facilitate the event going ahead.<\/p> <p>The proposal was that the three concerts would proceed on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  However, the Saturday and Sunday concerts would start earlier to facilitate separate matinee audiences on those days.  While there would still be only three concerts, there would, in effect, be five separate audiences.  This would have allowed everyone who bought a ticket to attend a concert in Croke Park on one of the three days.  I emphasise that this proposal was from Peter Aiken himself.  I agreed to consider a revised event management plan on this basis within the statutory framework.  Partly, I agreed to that as I was conscious of the disappointment of ticket holders who had purchased tickets in good faith for the cancelled events.  There was also a concern that disappointed ticket holders for the Monday and Tuesday events might turn up on the other days causing security and public safety concerns.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, it was communicated to us the next day that Garth Brooks was not prepared to move with that option.  Finally, as recently as yesterday, the city council offered to act as a co-promoter if Aiken Promotions decided to reschedule the two concerts for which permission was refused by the council to an alternative venue in the city council area requiring an events licence or indeed in Croke Park at a later date.  The advantage of the city council being a co-promoter is that it would have reduced the time period to process an event licence application to about five weeks.  In all three cases, while the city council demonstrated a capacity and willingness to be flexible, there was no budge from the other side.<\/p><p> Criticism has been levelled at the city council that we should have advised Aiken Promotions much earlier in the process that it would not be getting permission for five concerts.  The outdoor event licensing process is a statutory process.  The licensing application in respect of the Garth Brooks concert was submitted on 17 April and a final decision was made on 3 July.  The city council is satisfied that it would not have been appropriate to advise the applicant or anyone else of the decision it intended to make until it had fully processed the licence application.  Any other approach would expose the council to legal action on the basis that it had prejudiced the outcome of a statutory planning process.  The regulations for event licensing provide for consultations between the applicant and the local authority at the request of the applicant prior to the submission of an application.  When the applicant and local authority agree to enter into pre-application consultations on the submission of an application including the draft eventual plan for the management of the event, the authority may in such instances offer advice to the applicant regarding the proposal.  It is important to note that such consultations cannot prejudice the performance by a local authority of its functions nor can they be relied upon in the process of determining an application or in any legal proceedings.  It was open to the applicant to avail of the standard pre-planning consultations which afford the local authority protection if it indicates its likely decision.  However, the applicant did not avail of the facility in this instance.  No form of pre-application consultation took place.<\/p><p> There were a number of informal discussions with the promoter and his agents prior to the lodgement of the application on 7 April.  Dublin City Council and its officers have been consistent in informing the promoter and his agents that its main concerns were the impact of the proposed five consecutive concerts would have on the surrounding area and the precedent the granting of permission for five consecutive concerts would set.  Prior to the lodgement of the application for the proposed concerts, the matter was debated at the Dublin City Council meeting of 7 April and at an area meeting on 11 March.  The minutes of the meetings indicate that there was widespread concern among elected members at the proposal to have five concerts based on the impact on local residents.  There were numerous media reports of the concerns of local residents at the proposal for five consecutive concerts.  It is difficult for me to understand how, in the face of real evidence of disquiet among local residents, the promoters would have anticipated no difficulty in securing an event licence for the five concerts.<\/p><p> The next issues relates to any expectation the promoter might have had to be permitted five concerts by the local authority.  Since 1993 and pursuant to the granting of the planning permission for the redevelopment of Croke Park, a total of three special event concerts are permitted under the grant of permission.  Special event concerts may take place each year without having to obtain an event licence.  The highest number of special event concerts in Croke Park in any one year has been four and that was in 2009.  The average number of events per year since 2000, excluding years when there have been no special events or concerts, is three.  Since the statutory events licensing procedure was introduced by way of an amendment to the Planning and Development Act 2000, there have been a total of 26 special event concerts at Croke Part, 20 under the planning permission and six on foot of the outdoor event licensing procedure.  None of the applications has been refused.  However, the proposal to hold five consecutive concerts in addition to the three permitted under the planning permission would have resulted in an unprecedented total of eight concerts this year.  While Dublin City Council as the licensing authority has been supportive of special events and concerts at Croke Park to date, we have been consistent in ensuring that the number of special events concerts held in any one year has not exceeded the overall number permitted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la by more than one.  An additional concert would not be considered a significant breach of the original permission but it would be a major departure for the local authority to approve five concerts in any one year in addition to the three held under the planning permission, as was proposed.<\/p><p> The holding of special event concerts at Croke Park has often been controversial and the controversies have been well documented.  The U2 concerts in 2009 provided for three concerts over a four-day period and were highly controversial at the time.  The holding of five consecutive concerts was going to be controversial.  Any number in excess of one would have created a new precedent.  In the circumstances, Dublin City Council does not accept that the promoter could have had an expectation that all five concerts would have been permitted.<\/p><p> The next section of my statement deals with fraudulent or dubious representations.  We received 384 submissions or observations.  We acknowledged each one by post or e-mail depending on how it was submitted.  In response to those acknowledgements, we were advised by individuals in 11 instances that they had not made a submission.  Those 11 were taken out and not considered.   We advised the Garda on 12 June that we had concerns in regard to fraudulent submissions.  There has been an ongoing Garda investigation as a result.  The primary issue of concern in all of the submissions and observations was the level of disruption that would arise from the holding of five consecutive concerts.  In the report on the licence application, the decision-maker considered three reasons for only granting three of the five concerts.  The first related to the scale, magnitude and number of concerts with an expected attendance of 80,000 people per night over five consecutive nights, three of which would be week nights.  The second related to the fact that three concerts had already taken place in Croke Park this year between 23 and 25 May.  The report referred to the fact that this is a heavily populated residential area and that five shows in a row, following on from the three concerts already held this year, would be considered an overintensification of the use of the stadium.  The third reason related to the cumulative effect on residents and businesses in the area of holding five shows in a row which would lead to an unacceptable level of disruption to the lives and livelihoods of residents and local businesses.<\/p><p> In arriving at the first reason, the report considered the application lodged by the promoter.  In the case of the second reason, the report considered events that had previously been held at Croke Park.  In the case of the third reason, the report cited the necessity to avoid or minimise disruption to the neighbourhood in which the events would take place.  Accordingly, while it is disturbing that there is evidence that a significant number of submissions may be called into question, that does not interfere with the integrity of the decision.  There is no evidence that the local authority acted other than in good faith in managing the process.<\/p><p> Finally, there is a suggestion that the local authority ignored the benefits to the Dublin economy.  The local authority recognised fully the benefit of attracting such a substantial event to the Dublin economy.  However, economic benefits are not central or intrinsic to the decision-making process.  The three permitted concerts would have generated very significant economic benefits.<\/p><p> If the integrity of the planning system is to be maintained, it is important that the interests of no single individual or organisation, no matter how cherished a place he, she or it occupies in the hearts of the nation, are allowed to unduly influence the system.  The genuine concerns of local residents which were a factor in the local authority decision cannot and should not be disregarded notwithstanding the short-term commercial or economic arguments for doing so.  I am satisfied that the statutory events licensing procedure was applied correctly by the local authority and that the decision reached was appropriate, balanced and reasonable having regard to all competing interests.  This is especially the case given the relationship that exists between Croke Park and neighbouring residents.  Nothing that has occurred since the decision was made has changed my opinion that the decision was appropriate, balanced and reasonable.<\/p><p>I very much regret the decision of Garth Brooks and Aiken Promotions not to hold the three permitted concerts and to examine options proposed by the local authority on the two concerts which were not permitted.  That was their decision and they must accept its consequences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Owen Keegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405419000,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Before I hand over the to the members, I want to clarify a number of matters.<\/p> <p>I also wish to ask a few questions.  We received a letter on Friday from Dublin City Council asking about members of the committee who were also members of the GAA.  I want to point out clearly that I am a member of the GAA, have always been and probably will always be, but I had no hand, act or part in any decision or negotiations.  My main involvement during the years was as a team manager.  Anybody familiar with the GAA knows that team managers have very little influence in Croke Park.  I had tickets for the Garth Brooks concerts, but I paid for them.<\/p><p> Many members have indicated that they wish to speak.  I will take them in the order in which they indicated: Deputies Timmy Dooley, Paudie Coffey, Mary Lou McDonald, Helen McEntee, Mick Wallace, Patrick O'Donovan, Noel Harrington and Tom Fleming.  I ask members to limit their contributions to three minutes because there is huge interest in this issue and I want to ensure everybody will get in.<\/p><p> Why we have invited Dublin City Council officials to come before us is to establish the facts and chain of events involved, as Mr. Keegan has done, which led to the concerts being cancelled.  The situation was evolving in recent days and last night the concerts were cancelled.  Many issues must be teased out.  What consultation took place between the promoter and Croke Park in advance of arranging the initial three concerts?  Mr. Keegan has indicated that informal consultation took place and I would like him to outline what form it took.  Given that three One Direction concerts have already taken place this year, did consultation or discussions take place before tickets for the additional fourth and fifth Garth Brooks concerts were sold?  Will the officials clarify whether a verbal assurance was given by anybody in Dublin City Council at any stage that the five concerts could go ahead?  I clarified the issue of any possible conflict of interest I had and wish to ask whether any of the officials live beside Croke Park.  If so, do they believe this would be of help in making a decision or could it be a conflict of interest?  What, in the opinion of the officials, needs to be done to avoid this type of fiasco happening again?  If the five concerts were to go ahead, what would be the financial benefit for Dublin City Council?  I had a question on forged submissions, but it has been dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500004#C00200","speaker":"1073","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405419600,"counter":490,"content":"<p>On the issue of consultation, as the chief executive stated, while provision is made in the regulations to avail of a formal consultation process prior to the submission of a licence application, this option was not availed of in this instance.  Informal contact was made and a telephone call was made in mid-December 2013 to an officer of the city council from the venue manager indicating the possibility of two Garth Brooks concerts taking place in Croke Park in summer 2014.  Our response was that they would be subject to a licence because the intention was to use the One Direction concerts as the three permitted events.  Subsequent to this telephone call no other formal or informal contact took place until approximately 30 January.  At that stage the two shows indicated to us had been announced, the tickets sold and a third concert added.  There had been no informal or formal consultation prior to the sale of the tickets for the three concerts.  A telephone call was received on 31 January by an officer of the city council from the venue manager to state it was intended to proceed with a fourth and a fifth concert and that the tickets would go on sale on Tuesday, 4 February.  This was subsequently changed in so far as the tickets went on sale on Monday, 3 February.<\/p><p>  I understand from speaking to Mr. Keegan that he received a telephone call on the Sunday evening from Mr. Jim Clarke of Aiken Promotions stating it intended to proceed with the fourth and fifth concerts, with the sale of tickets on the Monday morning.  The chief executive thanked him for the courtesy of notifying him in advance but made no other formal statement.  As it transpired, on approximately 12 February the chief executive, the event co-ordinator and I had a meeting which had already been arranged with Aiken Promotions on an unrelated matter about an event elsewhere in the city; it was not to deal with this issue.  At the conclusion of the discussions on that issue, the matter of the concerts was raised.  A note or minute was not kept of what happened at the meeting, but what was clearly stated to the promoters was that it was a big ask and that we would be dealing with an unprecedented number of events, having regard to the fact that the highest number of events per year until then was four in 2009 and that there would be serious concerns in the city council as the licensing authority about the impact the five proposed consecutive concerts would have on livelihoods and the neighbourhoods in question.<\/p><p>  This is the sequence of events with regard to formal and informal contact.  Subsequent to this the issue was raised among members of the city council at area and city council level and there was widespread media coverage of the issue.  It would have been apparent to all that the proposal would be controversial and that serious issues would have to be addressed.  We received the application on 17 April.  This also clarifies the issue of the third, fourth and fifth concerts.  I am not aware of any verbal assurance given by any officer of the city council that five concerts would be licensed.  On the contrary, we always prefaced any remark by stating serious issues would be raised in processing any application that would involve five consecutive concerts.<\/p><p>  The Chairman raised the issue of a conflict of interest or bias.  I was born and bred in Clonliffe Gardens, which is in the shadow of Croke Park.  I spent 25 years of my life there and my family home is still there.  My son and his wife live there.  I do not think this altered my decision making and judgment on the proposed applications.  I did not hear it stated in 2009, when I was the relevant officer with delegated responsibility for signing off on the very controversial U2 concerts, about which public meetings were held which I attended.  I had to deal with issues raised by people with whom I had grown up.  I felt I had dealt with the issues in a fair and balanced manner, as I have in this instance.  I do not believe there is any bias or prejudice.  I no longer live there.  I own the property, in which my son and his wife, but I have not lived in the area for the past 35 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Keogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405419600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I am satisfied no verbal assurance or comfort was given by any officer of the city council to the promoters that they have get five concerts licensed.

There are several aspects to this debacle, into one of which we will not get today, although we will have to deal with it in the future, that is, how 400,000 tickets were sold for an event which had not yet been licensed.<\/p> <p>That probably reflects on the Oireachtas more than it does the council, but it is the main issue that needs to be resolved in due course.<\/p><p> To address a point raised by the Chairman, I do not take lightly the inference in Mr. Keegan's letter to committee members that my being a member of the GAA in east Clare would somehow impact negatively on the way I do my business in the Oireachtas.  It is objectionable that Mr. Keegan would raise an issue like that in a communication with the committee.  If he believes for one moment that my interest in this matter relates to the GAA, he is entirely wrong.  We had the GAA attend one of our meetings in recent weeks to address the issue of broadcasting and its deal with Sky.  Being members of the GAA does not make us conflicted when being critical of its actions where warranted and appropriate.<\/p><p> My concern in this matter relates to my role as Opposition spokesperson on transport and tourism, the impact on the hotel, restaurant and catering sector in this city, the potential loss of &euro;50 million in revenue, the 70,000 inbound tourists due to attend the event, the 400,000 ticket holders in this State and elsewhere and the ratepayers and property taxpayers who play an integral role in the life of this city and contribute to Dublin City Council's revenue.  These are the only issues motivating me.  I will not get into a debate on personalities, but if Mr. Keegan's belief is that our only motivation is to feather the GAA's nest, I would first refute that belief and then suggest that it raised more questions about his judgment than it does about mine.<\/p><p> Following on from the Chairman's comments about Mr. Keegan's interest in understanding what might conflict us, has Mr. Jim Keogan told Mr. Keegan that his family home is in the area and his son lives there?  Is that something that Mr. Keegan has only become aware of in recent days?<\/p><p> Mr. Keegan discussed the granting of a licence for three concerts.  He indicated that he had a conversation with someone working with the promoter and that a fourth concert had been on the table.  At the bottom of page 8 of his statement to us, he asserts that the council has been supportive of special events in Croke Park and has not allowed the number to exceed the overall number permitted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la by more than one.  He considers a breach of one event to be normal.  However, permitting the three concerts would have been a breach of three.  Had Mr. Keogan acted on Mr. Keegan's conversation with Aiken Promotions, the CEO would have been prepared to allow four concerts.  We have gone from one to four, yet Mr. Keegan claims that five would have been a major departure for the council.  It is difficult to comprehend how five would be a major departure when four would not.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding the origin of the suggestion, it is difficult to understand how Mr. Keegan can assert that 160,000 people in the curtilage of that zone on Saturday and Sunday evenings would not have amounted to a significant intensification of the property's use.  He was concerned that some percentage of those with tickets for the Monday and Tuesday shows might have congregated in the area, but he was prepared to accept all of the 160,000 congregating there.  I fail to see how this could have worked.<\/p><p> Mr. Keegan stated that a judicial review was an option but, on behalf of Dublin City Council, the ratepayers and property taxpayers of this city, he would spend more of their money to defend his original decision vigorously because he was so confident in it.  That is questionable.<\/p><p> Mr. Keegan expressed regret about this situation but took no personal responsibility for it.  He stated that three concerts were permitted, but that considering options for the remaining two was a decision for the promoter and the artist and they must accept the consequences.  Does he believe that he should accept some consequences on behalf of the ratepayers, property taxpayers, the tourism sector and Ireland's image as a destination for large-scale entertainment events at a time when, as he is aware, efforts are being made to win a rugby world cup event for this city?  Such events benefit the city's economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500005#D00500","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405420200,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I sent my letter because of the general view that this matter involved Aiken Promotions and Garth Brooks on one side and the city council on the other.

Given the importance of the concerts, I made the judgment to go the extra way and determine whether we could get them.  I did not give a commitment.  Rather, I offered to raise the matter with the decision maker, but no flexibility was forthcoming from the other side.  I can be rightly criticised for making that offer.  Looking back, I probably regret that I did, but I felt it was important to make an extra effort to get those concerts for Dublin.<\/p> <p>They were not prepared to take anything less.  It is difficult to deal with a choice of five concerts or none when presented with a very sensitive planning application.  I withdrew the offer, I did not have the conversation and I do not know what the outcome would have been.  Yes, I could be rightly criticised about showing flexibility.<\/p><p> The reference to judicial review is clear.  It has been suggested that we could allow the promoter to request a judicial review of the decision and not mount a defence on the basis that we accept we made the wrong decision.  However, I believe we made the right decision, as it was entirely appropriate to seek to balance all of the competing interests.  Some people think we should ignore the legitimate concerns of residents and that commercial interests should win out, but I do not agree.  My point is, anyone can judicially review our decision but we will defend such proceedings because we believe in the integrity of the process and that we made a fair and balanced decision.  We will not initiate proceedings.  We took account of all competing interests, including those of residents, as required under the event licensing process.<\/p><p> I was asked whether I accept some blame.  As I said in my statement, we are obliged to follow a legal process and we have applied it.  Perhaps, in hindsight, we might have suggested that the applicant engage in formal pre-application consultations, but the event developed very quickly.  Effectively, all tickets were sold by early February and the damage was done.  Had we told the promoter in early February that some of the concerts would not be allowed, what would have happened?  The tickets had been sold by that stage and I suspect people had made their accommodation arrangements.  We were in a difficult situation and I do not believe we would have prejudiced the statutory process.  Even if we had warned the promoter at that point he would have accused us of not giving him an opportunity and trying to deny Dublin the concerts.  He might also have said that he intended to work intensively with local residents in the intervening months to mediate on the issues raised.  It would be totally inappropriate for Dublin City Council to prejudge such efforts.  It is very difficult to say what would have happened had we told the promoter in early February that some of the concerts would not be allowed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500006#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Owen Keegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405420800,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Regarding the residents mentioned by Mr. Keegan, it is obvious that they changed their position significantly.

It is helpful that Mr. Keegan's statement is now on the public record and I thank the Chairman and the committee for allowing this.<\/p><p>  I must declare my interest in the GAA as I am a lifelong member and chairman of my local club, but I have no input in national decisions, especially those relating to concerts in Croke Park.  I will also declare that I am a fan of Garth Brooks and have attended his concerts previously, though I did not have tickets for this event.  This is a matter of serious concern, and reputational damage has occurred nationally and internationally.  We can all learn serious lessons.  I will not engage in the blame game and political opportunism, as they are unhelpful.  I was a member of a local authority for eight years and fully understand that there is a statutory process, as Mr. Keegan has outlined.  It is important that politicians and those in the know, such as representative bodies, promoters and businesspeople, were fully aware of the statutory process.  It has been shown that the statutory process is deficient when it comes to organising national events.  The licensing process needs to be reviewed, though that is work for another day.  Perhaps there should be definitive licensing for large national venues such as Croke Park, given the number of events in question.<\/p><p>  The statutory decision-making process has been outlined by Mr. Keegan, as have the criteria the council is obliged to consider.  These criteria include disruption caused to neighbourhoods and residents, the scale and magnitude of concerts and traffic and crowd management.  Mr. Keegan referred to the fact that three concerts by One Direction had already taken place at Croke Park this year.  I am confused by why any extra concerts were allowed.  Mr. Keegan has outlined that economic benefit is not a central consideration, but I believe it should be.  Many cities around Ireland and the world proactively pitch for such concerts.<\/p> <p>There is a conflict.  Given Mr. Keegan's defence, I do not understand how three concerts could be allowed.  Could he elaborate a little further on the decision?  Any reasonable person would consider that allowing the matin&eacute;es that were offered by the promoters would contribute to a greater intensification of the problem in terms of traffic and crowd management on the concert days.  Serious ramifications would have arisen for transport, crowd management and getting people in and out of the venue.  Given what Mr. Keegan said, I do not understand how he would have allowed that to happen yet not allow five concerts to go ahead.  Could he explain his position further?<\/p><p> Hindsight is a great thing.  I do not engage in the blame game.  Given the economic benefit that has been lost to Dublin city and the country, and given that as Deputy Dooley said, Mr. Keegan was willing to consider four events, would he not have allowed the five consecutive events on a one-off basis with the special condition that it would never happen again?  Was that not considered?  I would welcome a response to the question.<\/p><p> I was concerned today to hear Mr. Keogan has strong family connections and interests in the local area.  Given that, would Mr. Keegan not have allocated the decision making to another senior official within the local authority?  I do not say that with disrespect to Mr. Keogan.  He outlined how he arrived at his decision.  To avoid any accusation of a conflict of interest, would Mr. Keegan not have thought delegating the decision making power to another official in the local authority would have been more appropriate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500007#F01600","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405421400,"counter":518,"content":"<p>In regard to the points raised by Deputy Coffey, on the difference between zero concerts and five concerts, in the context of the venue itself &ndash; Croke Park &ndash; it is the beneficiary of permission granted in 1993 for three events under the terms of the permission.  The legislation which now governs event licensing for musical events or special events attracting in excess of 5,000 people specifically identified that where venues had a permission, they held it and it was open to any applicant, venue owner or promoter to apply separately for additional events.  Given the controversy that has surrounded special or musical events over the years in Croke Park, with the exception of 2009, the threshold has been of the order of three or four.<\/p><p>  Deputy Coffey is right that there has been exceptional interest in this concert and artist.  What has come out of all of this is that there is a huge popularity associated with him and also a huge economic benefit attached.  However, there are also legitimate considerations that we had to take on board in arriving at the decision.  In doing so, it was felt that it was reasonable, balanced and fair to have three concerts, having regard to all the competing interests.  We had regard to the fact that it was over the weekend, on a par with what happened with One Direction, and that in itself it would have a substantial benefit on the economy of the city.  It was felt that the cumulative effect of five consecutive concerts, which is unprecedented anywhere in the city, would have a very detrimental effect on the level of disruption that would arise to the surrounding area.  As a licensing authority we had to have regard to the impact, the precedent that would be set and the level of intensity.  We are talking about 82,000 people per night.  Committee members might say that venues such as Kilmainham had four or five musical events in a season, but the capacity there is 8,500.  There is a significant difference between a capacity of 8,000 and a capacity of 82,000 and the knock-on effect it would have on the surrounding area.<\/p><p>  In response to Deputy Coffey&rsquo;s question on why we allowed only three concerts, it was reasonable, balanced and fair.

The issue has dominated the media for the past two weeks and has received an unprecedented amount of attention for an issue of its kind.

By early January the contact was made and the second and third concerts were announced.  However, in the phone call of 31 January when Aiken Promotions announced that it wanted a fourth and fifth concert, did the council ask it to hold off on promoting or selling the tickets?  By February, all the tickets had been sold.  At any point, did the council tell Aiken it had serious reservations about the fourth and fifth concerts and not to go ahead?  If not, was it because the legislation was not there and the council could not legally ask Aiken to hold off?<\/p><p>  During the five weeks' public consultation process, what work, if any, was done by the council or Aiken to make people aware that there was a problem?  Surely, the crisis talks during the past two weeks should have been held during the five-week consultation process when the council knew there was going to be a problem.  During the past two or three weeks there have been at least four or five concerts in Marley Park.  I attended one last week and it was bedlam.

I refer the Deputy to section 240 of the Planning and Development Acts which provides:<blockquote><br \/>240.&mdash;(1) Subject to subsection (2), the holding of an event to which this Part applies and works directly or solely relating to the holding of such an event shall not be construed as &ldquo;development&rdquo; within the meaning of this Act.<br \/>(2) (a) Notwithstanding section 230 or 239 , the provisions of this Part shall not affect the validity of any planning permission granted under Part IV of the Act of 1963 for the holding of an event or events or for a funfair.<br \/>(b) Where a planning permission referred to in paragraph (a) has been granted for the holding of an event or events in respect of land, a licence under this Part shall be required for the holding of any additional event on the land concerned.<\/blockquote>The legislation is quite clear that it is quite within the rights of the venue owners or event promoters to lodge an application under the event licensing process for an event in addition to the three that were granted permission under the 1993 planning permission.  The Deputy referred to submissions and a licence being lodged for the three.  What he is actually referring to is the requirement under the same condition to submit compliance documentation.  It was the compliance documentation submitted that was adjudicated on by the planning department in relation to the three events.  That is separate to any additional event which is dealt with under the provisions of the legislation I have just outlined.<br \/>The Deputy asked about a precedent of three, four or five.  The maximum number of events in Croke Park to date was in 2009, in respect of which application I was the decision maker.  Nobody raised issues in relation to potential conflicts of interest or bias on the basis that I spent my first 25 years of life living in Ballybough.  The issue of a material breach was also raised.  There is no material breach <i>per se<\/i>in the condition.  There is a grant of permission.  What we are trying to emphasise is how we might be able to give consideration to the level of intensification and what would be the appropriate number.  It is a delicate balancing act.  It is very fair to say from this morning's discussions that it is a complex issue and there are a number of matters that arise.  Events are not the same development under the planning Acts.  There is a wording in the legislation that indicates for the purposes of interpretation of planning Acts, an event should not be classed as development.  Consequently, we do not assess an event having regard to the proper planning and development of an area and we do not assess it having regard to the development plan.  We assess it having regard to what is laid down in the provisions in five or six areas.  That is submissions received from an applicant, submissions received from statutory bodies, submissions received from the public, the consideration of same and what emerges out of that.  We are governed by a very different set of strictures.  What we were trying to achieve here was a reasonable balance between the competing interests, bearing in mind the impact on the city and on the surrounding area.  We felt that three was appropriate and is fair, reasonable and balanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Keogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405423800,"counter":606,"content":"<p>On Deputy O'Donovan's questions, most independent outside observers could have confidence in my capacity to provide leadership to the local authority on the basis that the statutory procedures were applied correctly in this case and the decision reached was appropriate, balanced and reasonable having regard to all competing interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500012#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Owen Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1405423800,"counter":607,"content":"<p>Mr. Keegan said that while there would still only be three concerts, there would be five separate audiences according to the submission which was made later and that this would have allowed everyone who bought a ticket to go to a concert on Friday, Saturday or Sunday.

Mr. Keegan used the phrase \"from the outside looking in\".  We are here to be informed as to how the local authority arrived at its decisions.  In respect of something as significant as this it seemed chaotic.  There were many twists and turns in the licence application from all sides.  It became a circus and it is helpful to get some clarity from at least the authority's point of view as to how it arrived at its decision.<\/p><p>  Listening to the approach that has been taken and noting the statutory requirements, I see that the local authority has been doing this for some time.  It deals with applications as they arise.  It is the same way.  It considers disruption, the views of residents and all the other issues which are taken into account.  It is difficult to understand why there is no over-riding blueprint.  I acknowledge that Mr. Keegan has said events are detached from development.  Why is there no plan whereby promoters, event management, the authority, councillors and residents can feed in and be part of an overall process?  It could be the same process to be reviewed, voted on by elected representatives thereby providing at least some indication in advance to stakeholders what the policy in Dublin city on events is.  If there are three concerts in one venue, one goes through one process.  If it goes over that, it is an entirely different process.  That is difficult to explain to people looking in at this one.  It is going back to a decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p>  In deliberating on and arriving at the decision, different consultations were cited.  Is there a planning team that makes recommendations in Dublin City Council comprising a broader, extended internal committee?  In this instance, I refer to Mr. Keogan.  Does Dublin City Council have a strategic policy committee for event management only?  If so, how often does it meet and has it made recommendations?  This is not the first big gig Dublin City Council has dealt with.  We had the 2009 one which Mr. Keegan said was controversial.  Has the council learned anything from that?  Could we move the process on in-house to provide more certainty in advance?<\/p> <p>There was a distinct lack of pre-decision consultation, whether it was informal or formal.  I do not see any evidence of minuted meetings.  Would Mr. Keegan not think it would be good practice to minute meetings, particularly when there are more than three or four stakeholders and all the residents?

A proposal for something similar to the Garth Brooks concerts in Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney, for instance, would be welcomed with open arms.  Any snags that might exist would be removed.

Many of them have different contractual arrangements in place with different venues around the city.

We have already said today that hindsight would suggest to us that we would be very much hoping that it would be mandatory that formal pre-application consultations with minutes taken would take place with promoters prior to any tickets going on sale.

He has developed a great relationship with the various bodies and agencies that oversee the process because the process is hugely important to the economy of the city.  However, it is only through Mr. Downey's dedication that we get very good results.

As a member of the GAA for many years, and one of the few members of this committee who has had the thrill of playing in Croke Park several times, fad&oacute;, fad&oacute;, I have had no conflict of interest whatsoever.  I accept Mr. Keegan&rsquo;s withdrawal and apology.<\/p><p>  Why does Mr. Keegan believe there was no need for a pre-consultation process?  How early were the promoters aware that the granting of a licence for the five concerts was not on the agenda?  Selling 400,000 tickets was a clear indication that there would need to be five concerts.  If the promoters were aware that three was the maximum number of concert licences to be granted, why did they go ahead and sell 240,000 extra tickets?<\/p><p>  Mr. Keegan indicated there were 384 objections to the concerts by residents.  Eleven of these indicated their submissions were not made by them.  I find it hard to believe that 384 people objected, whether individually or on behalf of others.  I know of a case where a person objected to a certain development in a certain county.  Twelve months later, his name was used for an objection and the fee for it was paid on his behalf.  Is there a fee for objections made to Dublin City Council?  I take exception to anyone telling a local authority what they will or will not accept.  I accept Mr. Keegan does not have the authority to verify the objectors.<\/p><p>  This has done our reputation as a welcoming nation major damage.  While I did not see it referred to on CNN, this fiasco has been highly damaging to our tourism reputation.  It is a major loss to the economy of our capital city.  Mr. Keegan has a role as city manager in promoting tourism and, in fairness, he is doing that.  The Government is encouraging international events to take place in this country such as American football games, rugby world cup matches and so on.  This decision is a major tourism and economic loss to our capital city and our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500014#N00200","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1405425000,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives from Dublin City Council.  This whole sequence of events going back to January has been a farce.  I note the media this morning stated Mr. Garth Brooks is now blaming the rules as the reason he is not coming to Ireland.  I know if he were driving across Interstate 40 in Oklahoma, doing 80 mph, and was pulled in by the cops, he would certainly appreciate the rules of the road over there.<\/p><p>  I smell a rat in all of this and the rat is money.  I cannot understand that when no licence was granted and no event management plan submitted, that tickets for a concert were still sold.  Walking up Grafton Street this morning, I know the ladies selling flowers there would not be allowed to do so if they did not have a permit.  Licences are usually granted while the process is going through.  I believe the contract of trust between the promoter and Dublin City Council or the trust between the promoter and Croke Park has been broken.  There seems to be some sort of a nod and a wink going on in this case.<\/p><p>  The rat in the room is the &euro;40 million in ticket sales alone that is now in someone&rsquo;s bank account.  That money becomes more valuable over the time it is being utilised in that account.  There is a contract between Mr. Brooks and the promoter, as well as one between the promoter and the GAA.  Yet, there is no contract with Dublin City Council in all of this.  Dublin City Council is now getting all the blame because the concerts will not take place.  If it had granted permission for five concerts and there was a major catastrophe during one of them, it would also have got the blame for granting the licence.  Does the blame fall with Mr. Brooks, Aiken Promotions or the GAA?  Somebody seems to be bullying Dublin City Council to give the five concerts, even after three concerts were held by One Direction.<\/p><p>  Where do we go from here?

I am very glad to be here.  Many of us have been involved in independent radio for most of the 25 years, which have gone by very fast.  I am particularly pleased to be joined by colleagues from around the country.  We are delighted to have this opportunity to come before the committee because we see that it has a very important role in the formulation of policy and has a particular understanding of the impact of our members' work throughout the country, which we appreciate that.<br \/>As the Chairman mentioned, it is a very important anniversary - 25 years.  In his public notice of the meeting, the Chairman referred to independent radio playing an indispensable role in public life.  We hope that the occasion of our 25th anniversary will be an opportunity for us to look back, as the Chairman indicated in his opening remarks, but also to look forward and to see what steps need to be taken to ensure that the successes of independent broadcasting can continue into the future.  We last addressed the committee in February 2013 and I feel a certain sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>because while we outlined many of the challenges and issues we face, we feel that the time since then has been characterised by an unfortunate lack of progress so there is a certain amount of frustration on behalf of our members and an impatience to proceed with the work of securing the future.  <br \/>We represent a diverse group of stations throughout the country - two national, four regional, one multi-city and 27 local radio stations.  We are an alternative voice and I think we have introduced an alternative view that is not just Dublin-centric, which is hugely important in the Irish media landscape.  The committee will see from our presentation that the media landscape in 1984 was a very simple place.  The turnover of Irish media was in the region of &pound;57 million.  Fast-forward to 2011, which is the last year for which we have figures available, and one will see that a revolution has taken place.  The media landscape in which we operate is hugely complex.  It is not longer just Irish media with a few isolated channels such as BBC1, BBC2 and Channel 4 coming in.  We are now in a globalised media marketplace.  <br \/>Over the past 25 years, independent radio has played a unique role in protecting and nurturing Ireland's unique identity and personality.  However, we have faced upheaval over the past number of years due to the economic downturn.  I want to be clear that the changes that have overtaken our industry are not just due to the recession and will not change when the economy, hopefully, recovers.  While listenership endures, and our members enjoy very strong listenership, the economic basis upon which we operate has changed.  In 1988, independent radio meant some pirate broadcasters who operated outside the regulatory framework and RTE.  Next week marks 25 years since the first voice on independent radio went live on 20 July on what is now FM104.  The man who spoke the first words in Irish on that day - we might have a prize - is in a photo contained in our presentation.  He is actually sitting beside me.  Mr. Scott Williams was the first voice on independent radio in Ireland under the current framework.  <br \/>Today we have RTE, as we did 25 years ago, but we also have a rich tapestry of independent stations.  Members can see them in our presentation.  We have been hugely successful.  We feel we have been successful because of the access to the airwaves we provide.  There are studios the length and breadth of the country because of the relevance of what we broadcast, because we respond to the needs and interests of our listeners, because we are flexible and nimble and adapt to the situations we face and, importantly, because we provide an important platform for local democracy and coverage of local issues, which I am sure is appreciated by the members of this committee and indeed the wider Oireachtas. <\/p> <p>They are some of the changes that have happened culturally over the last 25 years, but a revolution in listenership habits has taken place.  The next slide provides a very stark illustration of radio listenership.  The nosediving line in red is the listenership of RTE stations and the rapidly rising line shows listenership of independent stations, be they national, regional or local.  The market share, which is time spent listening to radio, again shows that independent radio has surpassed the national broadcaster.  Almost 70% of time spent listening to radio in this country is spent listening to independent stations.<\/p><p> While there has been a revolution in the listening habits of Irish audiences in the past 25 years, there has not been a revolution in how broadcasting is looked at, regulated or legislated for.  The pitch is still very sloped towards RTE.  It appears to us that RTE, with its dual funding and range of services, is undoubtedly a public service broadcaster in large elements of what it does, but stations such as 2FM cannot be described as public service.  That contributes to a situation in which we are on an unfair playing field and RTE can have its cake and eat it.  There is a certain amount of frustration among our members because we are repeatedly told what a great service we provide, but we have been particularly frustrated in recent months by the lack of progress.  The statements of support have not been backed up by practical means.  It appears to us that RTE continues to operate on a different playing field.  We are governed by a very stringent licensing regime but, unfortunately, the decision on whether to create new services for RTE lies very much within the ambit of RTE.  I mentioned 2FM already, but public money is also going to RTE Gold, Pulse and 2XM.  They are services which receive millions in public money but are not providing a public service.<\/p><p> There is a great need to act.  On the occasion of our 25th year in operation, we feel that the public service we provide cannot be taken for granted and is in danger of being slowly eroded.  The situation is being exacerbated by RTE's unlimited commercial mandate, which is damaging our members.  We question the appropriateness of some trading practices of RTE, which are effectively being undertaken with subsidy from public money.  It appears to us that all resources go to RTE.  While I have made critical remarks about RTE, I am not anti-RTE, nor are the independent broadcasters unduly critical of RTE.  The Government must act and the Legislature must act to ensure a win-win situation in public service broadcasting for the State broadcaster and for independent broadcasters.  We believe a win-win situation is possible.<\/p><p> I have outlined my frustration at what has happened the recent past.  In the past week we have seen the appointment of a new Minister, Deputy Alex White.  On behalf of the members of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, I wish him well and I welcome him to his job.  We are encouraged by the fact that he has worked as a broadcaster.  We hope he understands that public service broadcasting is not purely the preserve of RTE but is also provided by independent broadcasters.  We feel that he needs to hit the ground running and take action before the next general election.  His priorities should be to recognise the unique role of both local and independent radio and RTE and the contribution of everyone; to take practical action to ensure that the contribution we have made over the past 25 years has been protected and also that RTE can protect and focus on key elements; and to have the courage to introduce the reforms that are needed.<\/p><p> Our long-standing policies which we have outlined to the committee previously remain in place.  We remain consistently committed to these areas - namely, the recognition of our public service contribution; a fund to support independent broadcasters in the provision of public service broadcasting; the amendment of section 108 of the Act to define and limit the commercial mandate of RTE; and the funding of the BAI from the public service broadcasting charge or from the television licence.  We have developed a practical and workable model in relation to the public service fund which we believe can be introduced without undermining RTE.  In relation to the commercial mandate, we understand that Indecon consultants have undertaken a report, which is with the Minister.  The way RTE is regulated is an essential issue to address.<\/p><p> Radio faces a future of change.  We have made an enormous contribution over the years through coverage of local politics, local life, civic society and local sport and by providing a voice for people who would not dream of phoning a national station or who would not be considered by the national broadcaster.  We are very willing to change and we have worked flexibly to change our practices in recent years.  We want to protect our unique relationship with the Irish people.  We are all Irish-owned and we want to continue that way.  We want to remain universally flexible and accessible and we are willing to be regulated and to operate as responsible broadcasters.  We seek courageous, creative and determined political action to bring about positive change.<\/p><p> We hope we can work further with the committee to ensure that change for the better can be brought about in Irish broadcasting so that in 25 years' time somebody else can sit in this seat and look back over half a century of successful independent broadcasting in this country.  The jury is out on that at the moment.  We are at a fork in the road.  It is a case of a breakthrough or a breakdown.  We very much hope it is a breakthrough.  We look with hope to this committee because we know it is respected widely by the decision makers in the Department and by the Ministers.  We assure the committee that we will work unstintingly with the members, individually and collectively, to bring about positive change in the future.  I thank committee members for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500016#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Purcell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405426200,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Purcell.

I congratulate the members of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland on what they have achieved in the past 25 years.  It was a challenging time, and many fine radio stations, as mentioned by Mr. Purcell, have set up a service.  We can all name the ones in our own areas.  They have a proud record of broadcasting on political, sporting and civic life.  There is not a home they do not go into.  Given the starting base they had, they are to be congratulated on reaching the milestone of 25 years.  I say very well done to them, because much work has gone into all the radio stations to bring them to their current level.<\/p><p>  Mr. Purcell is correct in the points he made in his presentation.  We are at a crossroads and decision making is required.  I looked at the figures over the past two years in particular.  On the one side there is the national broadcaster, which receives significant funding from the licence fee, or broadcasting charge, as it will shortly become.  On the other side are the independent radio stations and other independent networks, including television, but we are focusing on radio today.  Independent radio stations have built themselves up on a commercial level.  They fought for their business and they provide what the market wants.  Difficult decisions were required in recent years when advertising revenues fell.  We could talk for hours about the benefit.<\/p> <p>I suppose the IBI has considered how licence revenue should be divvied up in the context of the new broadcasting legislation.  Will the delegates expand on section 108 of the 2009 Act which gives a commercial mandate to RTE?  The IBI is celebrating 25 years, which is to be marked at a reception later.  We need to think about the revenue from the licence fee and determine who is giving best value for money.  We have had many discussions with RTE.  There are large background teams associated with some programmes of the national broadcaster, but, where some independent programmes are concerned, there is only one broadcaster and perhaps a background team of one or two.  The independent broadcasters are providing the service with a skeleton staff.  Will the delegates outline their position on section 108 of the 2009 Act to empower us in deciding on our approach?<\/p><p> I congratulate the delegates on a massive job well done.

While we are silver of hair, we are gold of achievement.  I thank Deputy Michael Moynihan for congratulating us.<\/p><p>  I will make some introductory remarks before answering the question.  We are not anti-RTE, which has come across clearly to the committee.  We require RTE to be strong and vibrant because we are all part of one sector.  There are many initiatives that we conduct with it for the betterment of broadcasting in its many facets.  The real elephant in the room is non-indigenous broadcasters.  In 2011 there was &euro;879 million worth of television revenue in Ireland, of which a full 43% or &euro;382 million went to Sky Television.  Some &euro;225 million went to RTE.  At the heart of the point I am making is the fact that we are indigenous.  We are just one half of the indigenous equation in the country; RTE is the other half.  We very much share its views on that point.  We share views on many other points also.<\/p><p>  RTE is required under section 108 to maximise its commercial opportunities.  That is a statutory requirement.  We do not blame RTE for this as it operates under statute.  However, we believe it is now inappropriate.  RTE's report for 2013 is a long document and contained in it is a lot of fine detail.  I found it quite interesting to consider how the allocation of licence fee revenue was achieved.  RTE allocates public funding to individual services proportionate to the net cost of the service.  The net cost is the gross cost after deducting the contribution from commercial activities.  In other words, public funding fills a hole in the budget for a service.  We believe this is intrinsically wrong.  In other words, whatever is short is made up with public money.  When times were good &mdash; we hope they will be again at some time in our lives &mdash; RTE produced huge surpluses.  For what was the licence fee money being used?  One should make the analysis and think it through.<\/p><p>  Section 108 requires RTE to maximise its commercial mandate.  All broadcasting in Ireland is both commercial and public service in nature.  Why is it a public service?  In this regard, members will have heard the chairman's points.  They will agree with us that we provide a very valuable public service throughout the country.  We are also commercial.  When the Radio and Television Act 1988 was being introduced, the then Minister described the new sector as something that would be akin to public service broadcasting in private hands.  How right he was.  That is what we have achieved in 25 years.  This is the time to rebalance.<\/p><p>  We need a level playing pitch as we proceed.  When we started, the level was tilted in the State broadcaster's favour.  We have managed to bring the listenership over to the other side, but, unfortunately, the funding is still all going in the other direction.  We want a level playing pitch in order that the entire broadcasting sector, including RTE and independent broadcasters, can thrive, perhaps not as brothers but certainly as valuable colleagues.  We will always compete.<\/p><p>  Let me make a point on value and changing section 108.  Only last week the former Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, spoke about evasion in the order of 15% of licence fee revenue which is the equivalent of &euro;25 million to &euro;30 million.  He referred to \"valuable revenue lost to RTE.\"  I was horrified.  Why should RTE receive another &euro;25 million to &euro;30 million when it has just produced a small profit for the first time in seven years?  The &euro;25 million to &euro;30 million in additional funding is where there is an opportunity for legislators to rebalance.  It is from the additional money found that we believe action can be taken and moneys apportioned.<\/p><p>  With regard to the licence fee, when &euro;9.72 goes to An Post for the collection of the licence fee, somebody needs to ask why it is so expensive to make us all pay up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500018#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Scott Williams"},{"type":"speech","time":1405426800,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives of the independent broadcasters.  All of the members present are from rural areas, which is no coincidence because of the service offered outside Dublin, especially in rural counties.  I remarked on my local commercial station this morning that, prior to 1988, the only voices one heard on radio were Dublin voices.  Until that year, one would certainly not have heard backbench Members, nor would one have heard an Opposition Deputy, unless he was Leader of the Opposition.  With regard to public service, the case of the independent broadcasters has been well proved during the years by virtue of their listenership.<\/p><p>  Regarding State revenue, I have questioned IBI's main competitor at numerous meetings of the committee about its commitment, even to reporting the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have said here before that unless a person has a sleeping ailment, works at night, has a child that will not go to sleep or is being turfed out of a pub at an ungodly hour, he or she does not see the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas because RTE has decided to confine broadcasting them to insomniac's hour.  Without the commercial radio stations around the country, people would not know what we do here.  They would probably believe we did nothing.  From that perspective, the IBI has proved its service.<\/p><p>  With regard to section 108 and the opportunities the IBI envisages, the delegates' report states \"IBI proposes that the Broadcasting Act should be amended to remove the commercial mandate under Section 108 and replace it with a limit on the commercial reach of the state broadcaster\".  It also states, \"An examination should be undertaken to determine how efficiently the revenue from the Licence fee is utilised\".

Mr. Collins may discuss the fund to support public service broadcasting in more detail, but I can state that since the previous occasion on which we appeared before the committee, we developed a very detailed proposal for such a fund, which we presented to the previous Minister in February.  We did so in the aftermath of discussions with him over a number of months.  We took on board his reservations and those very understandable reservations voiced by those concerned with regard to the allocation of public money to private companies, and designed a fund to take account of these.

When we began to examine this matter, we decided not to consider the possibility of taking funding away from RTE because we were of the view that this would not, perhaps, be helpful.  We are of the view that the commercial mandate of RTE needs to be pegged back, both in terms of a more refined definition of what constitutes public service broadcasting and what it, as a State-owned public service broadcaster, should be doing.  As independent public service broadcasters, we were also of the view that some State funding should be provided to assist us in financing the element that we are mandated to broadcast under the 2009 Act.  The Act essentially states that any organisation that obtains a licence must broadcast 20% news and current affairs.  This means that all of the local and national stations have significant news, current affairs and sports coverage operations in place.  All of the local stations carried extensive local and European election debates during the recent campaign.  We provided 30 or 40 hours of coverage of local election counts with a staff of only 20 people.  One of the great difficulties we have encountered in the past four to five years relates to funding this element of our work.  Although we are not short of listeners, our funding model is broken.<\/p><p>  The only way we can maintain and grow the service into the future is by putting a fund in place to help us to support this element of our output.  We envisage that a new fund - separate from the sound and vision fund - would be set up and financed using 7% of the licence fee, which would amount to &euro;14 million or &euro;15 million.  We are of the view that the new household broadcasting charge will result in an upswing in revenues as a result of less evasion and fewer collection costs.  The previous Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, envisaged that the extent of this upswing would be of the order of &euro;25 million to &euro;30 million.  Under our proposals, approximately half of that amount would be invested in the new fund.  The process relating to that fund would be very straightforward.  The stations would apply to a central body, perhaps the BAI, for funding on a three-year annual budget basis.  The fund would be audited and would only be used to support specific programming commitments mandated under the Act, namely, news and current affairs, certain speech programming, local sports coverage and so on - in other words, the public service broadcasting element of what we do.  In addition, the fund would be independently audited.  We are quite happy to enter into very detailed commitments in the context of the plan we have put forward.  Under our proposals in this regard, each broadcaster would be obliged to put together a plan that would be very carefully measured via the use of key metrics, etc.  What we suggest in this regard would involve going into far greater detail than RTE is currently obliged to.<\/p><p>  We are of the view that this fund would not only guarantee the continuation of the very good work that local and national stations do in the independent sector into the future, it would also allow us to create jobs in communities throughout the country where, quite frankly, it has been extremely difficult for qualified people to obtain employment as a result of the pressures on local media.  It is our view that the proposed fund could be extremely positive for communities throughout the country and that it could help to guarantee the future of local radio stations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500019#EE00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Collins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405427400,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I referred earlier to the fact that ours is a very diverse organisation.

Such a fund would also allow us to enhance our services and provide coverage of greater depth.  As the Deputy pointed out, we sometimes operate on very scarce resources and with an extremely limited research capability.  The provision of a fund would enable us to provide more comprehensive coverage.  Failing the establishing of a fund, the appalling vista could be consolidation and regionalisation.  As Mr. Williams will attest later, there is a Heart radio station in every town in the UK.  The shows on these stations are syndicated from a base in London.  We are of the view that it would be appalling if such a model developed in Ireland.

However, it would be wrong of me if I did not state that the area in which I live would be so much the poorer without independent radio.  The loss of the independent radio would be massive to both public service and general broadcasting in every area throughout the country.  The fact that listenership figures are on the rise is evidence of that.<\/p><p>  Our guests' words did not exactly fall on deaf ears in 2013, because we proposed that a certain proportion of the licence fee should be set aside for local and community radio.  Unfortunately, our proposal was not accepted.  When the discussions relating to the introduction of the broadcasting charge began, we made the same proposal.  I do not know what is going to be contained in the Indecon report but I look forward to reading it.  I do not know whether it is intended that Indecon should put forward recommendations in respect of the mix of funding models that exist.  However, I am sure it will examine the public service content of independent radio.  I spoke to a number of backbenchers when we were drafting our proposal to assign some of the licence fee to local and community radio in order to discover what people think of this matter.  I received a fairly standard range of responses from those who would oppose such a development.<\/p> <p>There is the idea that money should not be taken from RTE because advertising revenue has gone south for it as much as for anybody else and it is struggling badly.  Interestingly, the second point was that these people are in it to make money and there is the question of whether we would subsidise newspapers if their revenue was declining.  There are people who do not understand that a big element of what local radio does is public service broadcasting in the truest sense of the term.  It caters for local areas.<\/p><p> When Mr. Collins argued that the funding model was broken, I take it he was referring to the reduction in advertising revenue, which has declined almost 50% since 2008.  In 2007 and 2008 a report was completed indicating a profit margin of 4%, on average, across stations.  What is the level now?  I am afraid it could be near zero.  There is something wrong with a situation in which the number of customers is increasing but income is going down.  That is illogical and we cannot get a complete picture from such a jigsaw.<\/p><p> The statement argued that there must be balance between RTE and independent broadcasters.  I would hate to think that we could not have a straight broadcasting service as we need it.  In general, RTE does a very good job.

It appeared to us that this came from the idea that if RTE cannot sell advertising, we will allow it to have less advertising and give it more money, while independent broadcasters will be forced to sell more advertising.  There is no market to sell more advertising and we cannot sell the ten minutes per hour we currently have.

Those of us of a certain vintage might remember that 2FM was set up as the State's antidote to pirate radio, the buccaneers of the airwaves, in the late 1970s, although all we did was give people what they wanted at the time.  That is another day's work, but it has led to the sector we have.  The brief of 2FM was to be a pop station for those aged between 15 and 34.  Approximately five years ago, on the day of a report from the JNLR giving listenership data for radio, we read a press release indicating that RTE was to change the focus of 2FM to those aged between 25 and 45.  We could not do this on any of our stations without approval from the BAI, but RTE could do that because it felt like it.  The station changed without reference to the BAI because it deals with the Minister.  It is a pop station and it receives &euro;4.49 from every licence fee.  Its ratings are low and it is not widely listened to.  It faces much competition in the pop radio business from both music stations such as mine in Dublin and those across the country, as well as the likes of Today FM.  It struggles to pull in a listenership.<\/p><p>  I mentioned earlier cost of service, revenue inwards and holes being filled with public money, and this is intrinsically linked to that.

It is worth recognising that we regularly have representatives of the IBI before us and they do exceptionally good work on behalf of the independent group of local radio stations.  It is nice to have them here to celebrate something.<\/p> <p>It is rather rare for members, as public representatives, to invite the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, to a reception.  As public representatives, they are normally invited to things and, consequently, it is probably in recognition of the work the IBI does that its members are guests of the joint committee on this occasion.  I am certainly delighted to participate in its celebration of 25 years service.  The stations with which I am most familiar do an exceptionally good job from my perspective.  This is not to take from the national broadcaster in any way, but over 25 years the local sector has established itself with an integral mix of news, current affairs and entertainment programmes.  I, for one, have never been able to differentiate where the public service remit of the national broadcaster ends and that of the independent sector begins.  As far as I am concerned, there is a continuum of public service provided by both entities, if one takes the IBI's members as one.  One need only consider the efforts made and the cost associated with the provision of sports coverage by the station with which I am most familiar, Clare FM.  Every event possible is covered, which costs a lot of money.  To me, that constitutes public service broadcasting at its best and the documentaries produced by local stations are what public service broadcasting is about.  There are podcasts available, as well as material that protects and retains cultural identity in certain areas around some national pastimes.  There are music and arts programmes all produced to a standard that is comparable with what one would receive from the national broadcaster.  This comes at a huge cost that is not and could not be reflected within the sector's commercial remit.<\/p><p> The IBI has a challenge it regularly makes of members about how it can get a piece of the broadcasting charge.  It is accepted and recognised that so doing would provide an additional flow of revenue.  The joint committee previously heard presentations that appeared to suggest RTE would need more of it, if it was to enhance what it did.  That is fine and I do not have a problem with it.  RTE will need more money if it is to grow and develop as it should as a national broadcaster.  However, I see no reason to believe the independent sector should not be entitled to its fair share of the charge in recognition of its work.  The IBI should continue with its work and highlight as much as possible what the local stations do on the ground to preserve and protect communities' identity, which would never be preserved otherwise but which are preserved for eternity because of the work these stations do.  This includes the development, recording and reporting of our sporting endeavours, as well as on news and current affairs which do not make it to the national headlines but which are so important to the listenership, often to a much greater extent than what emanates on a national level.  Like Mr. Purcell, I would be deeply concerned if, ultimately, one only received syndicated news and content, albeit through local affiliates.  Members know to where that ultimately would lead.  It would be a regressive step and see us going full circle over 25 years.  The point was to devolve effort to local entities and it would be both sad and regressive to see it go full circle.  As legislators, members have a significant role in this regard.  The IBI has recognised that it is the Minister's call to an extent and, undoubtedly, will be as robust in its presentation.  Certainly, however, as a member of the joint committee, I will use every opportunity to preserve and protect the work of the IBI and lobby as hard as I can to ensure it gets a slice of that pie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500020#FF01600","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405428600,"counter":667,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for their attendance.  I look forward to seeing the highlights of the meeting tonight on \"Oireachtas Report\", as I am sure it will be broadcast.  <\/p><p>  I agree with every member present on the value of independent broadcasters.  I can only speak from a County Kerry perspective on the job done in the county by Radio Kerry, a marvellous station that celebrated its 24th birthday last week.  Within half an hour in the morning, one can know who is dead, who has been born, whose First Holy Communion or birthday it is, as well as the price of cattle and everything else.  It is a fantastic service that is invaluable to communities throughout the county.  Moreover, this is not unique to County Kerry because while driving between County Kerry and Dublin twice a week, I get to tune in to all of the other local stations as I pass through the country and the quality and standard are just as high elsewhere and a huge service is being provided.<\/p><p>  I have one or two questions.  First, is there an estimate of how much advertising is lost by the independent sector because of competition from the subsidised State broadcaster?  Does the IBI have figures for an annual value in that regard?  I raised the issue of 2fm earlier this year when RTE appeared before the joint committee.  As for the public service value of \"the Golden Hour\", for example, while I do not wish to pick out anything in particular, questions must be asked about the amount being spent on something being provided by independent broadcasters.  I do not want this to be perceived as an RTE-bashing episode, as I certainly believe some of the service provided by that organisation is excellent for a small national broadcaster.  When one considers what RTE does in a global context, it does an excellent job, but that said, there must be fairness in this regard.  I also appreciate the prop being brought in because it makes things very simple and visualises matters.  I also agree that as a committee, members should work more towards achieving fairness in this area.<\/p><p>  I have one final question which may be somewhat outside the scope of this discussion.  Looking to the future and considering how far we have come in 25 years, do the delegates perceive local television to be an opportunity or a threat?  As broadcasters, is it something they could consider developing or could they consider moving into that area?  Alternatively, is it a completely different field in which they have no interest?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500021#GG00200","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405428600,"counter":668,"content":"<p>I thank members for the range of questions and positive remarks made about the service.  On the issue of sport and the coverage we provide, I was speaking to Mr. Tim Collins beforehand - Deputy Michael Colreavy will appreciate this point - who was wondering about the logistics of getting a commentator to Scandinavia to commentate on the Sligo Rovers game.  That is not something that will make money for Ocean FM.  It will cost a significant amount of money, but it is a service that will not be provided by any other broadcaster in the State.  I thank Deputy Timmy Dooley; we truly appreciate the reception aspect, as the turnout from our colleagues around the country shows.<\/p><p>  As for the resources in RTE and the resources that would be taken from that organisation, in its review of RTE's funding, Crowe Horwath found it had sufficient resources to deliver the level of service outlined in its five year plan.  The director general of RTE, Mr. Noel Curran, is on public record as stating the organisation only needs modest increases in funding to continue to provide the services it provides.  We argue that an increase of &euro;25 million to &euro;30 million in additional licence fee revenue or public service broadcasting fee revenue from a total pot of &euro;180 million would not be modest and that, consequently, RTE should not receive it all.  I refer to Deputy Michael Colreavy's point about some people asking why should one give money to independent broadcasters which, after all, were businesses.  I note ours are businesses that have undertaken something that is the equivalent of a public service obligation, inasmuch as we enter into contracts and state we will deliver a service.  Our point is that it is proving increasingly difficult to maintain the service.<\/p> <p>If the public wants the service, it would seem fair that if the market cannot support it, the public would.<\/p><p> A point we have not mentioned a great deal is the fact our sector employs approximately 1,500 people throughout the country.  In the south east, for example, there are KCLR in Carlow-Kilkenny, WLR, Tipp FM and South East Radio.  RTE employs a small regional staff in the area, based in Waterford, whereas we have operations in Kilkenny, Carlow, Wexford, Waterford and Clonmel.  We provide very significant employment.  On the basis of employment alone, we are worthy of support.<\/p><p> I will ask Scott Williams to address the question of how much revenue is lost to RTE shortly but first I will ask my colleague, Tim Collins, who has done a huge amount of work on the issue of the public service broadcasting fund, to address the issue of State aid.  It is something we have looked at extensively in respect of the scheme we put forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500021#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Purcell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405429200,"counter":670,"content":"<p>I will address the issue of local television because it is interesting.  Media are moving together and we are now content producers.  Many radio stations will produce content on video.  In fact, our station produces content for Irish television which is on the Sky platform.  We do reports every month for Sligo and Leitrim.  Our station and many other stations put video up on the web.  Local television will probably not be broadcast on any other platform aside from the web because it is so expensive to get onto the satellite platforms or any other platform.  However, it is certainly something of which many stations, both nationally and locally, will do more.  They will start to produce content on many different platforms to try to reach the maximum number of people.<\/p><p>  The state aid issue is somewhat ironic.  RTE and TG4 are both commercial entities so the Government must apply, under the state aid rules, to allow itself to give them licensing revenue.  The irony is that the same state rules are being used against us, so what is okay for RTE and TG4 is not okay for us.  We have taken the trouble to get a great deal of legal advice on this.  The advice from what are probably the best competition and EU lawyers in the city is quite clear.  They are of the firm view that there is no state aid bar to funding the public service content on local and national stations in the independent sector.  That is because we have a public service obligation under the 2009 Act.  We are obliged by that Act to produce a certain amount of public service content, so it is perfectly within the ambit of the treaties as they now stand for the State to apply to the European Commission for a scheme that is either state aid or a scheme that does not come within the definition of state aid.  There are a number of different ways we can do it.  Article 107.3.c of the treaty would allow the State to put together a scheme which would not fall foul of the state aid rules.  We can provide the committee with a copy of the legal advice we have, which is very clear on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500022#HH00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1405429200,"counter":671,"content":"<p>Where public bodies would broadcast notices through the broadcasters, if the broadcasters got public money on the one hand and got paid on the other, it would be a double payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500022#HH00300","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405429200,"counter":672,"content":"<p>We would be open to looking at such issues.

It is nice to know he is watching my back.  I compliment Mr. Tim Collins and Ocean FM on winning an international award recently for a documentary.  Two matters arise from the comments that have been made.  I believe this committee should support the view expressed by Tim Collins, that there are no barriers to providing state aid for public broadcasting obligations at local level.  The committee should support that and when the time comes, we should make a decision on it.<\/p><p>  Does the group collectively have a policy on the promotion of Irish artists?  I am not talking about what RTE interprets as Irish artists, which is anything that is close to U2.  Beyond that, it does not consider them.  There is an indigenous country and Irish music industry and a strong lobby for its promotion.  The fact that 400,000 people bought tickets for the Garth Brooks concerts surprised the Dublin 4 set.  It proves there is a huge market for that type of easy listening, country and Irish music.  I applaud those stations, many of which are represented here today, that have a policy of promoting Irish artists.  I will not single them out, but they know to whom I am referring.  I am talking about daytime promotion.  However, there appears to be a perception that not all local stations are subscribing to that and that some go some of the way and some do not.  That is the reason I ask if the group has a policy in that regard.<\/p><p>  The local radio set-up has maintained, enhanced and provided valuable entertainment and, importantly, employment for the Irish music industry.  Without it over the past 25 years, the industry would have died long ago.  There is no question about that.  I believe this is important now, particularly with a newer generation of country and Irish artists who have gone mainstream.  Nathan Carter is able to come to a Dublin city theatre and fill it, as can Derek Ryan.  Ten years ago that would not have happened.  That is primarily due to the guys and girls in local radio.  The network of Dublin stations does not necessarily promote it, but the stations have acknowledged it, at last.  Building on that, has there been any serious debate about it within the representative group and does it have any policy on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500022#HH00700","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405429200,"counter":676,"content":"<p>We do not have a policy on it but the reason so many country and Irish artists are promoted on local radio stations is that the stations reflect the interests of the people who are listening.  The Senator mentioned Nathan Carter.  I assume Midwest Radio was probably the first station in Ireland to broadcast Nathan Carter, long before the stations in Dublin ever heard of him.  That is because the listeners of the area are interested in that.  In addition, we do a great deal of work with the Irish Music Rights Organisation, IMRO, and the Irish Association of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, IASCA, on the promotion of Irish music.  The biggest problem we found with them is exactly as the Senator mentioned, that they tend to focus on musicians and Irish artists that are more mainstream as opposed to the country and Irish artists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500022#HH00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Lisa N&iacute; Choisdealbha"},{"type":"speech","time":1405429200,"counter":677,"content":"<p>They do not even focus on folk and traditional, apart altogether from country and Irish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014071500022#HH00900","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1405429200,"counter":678,"content":"<p>Then one sees Clare FM, which has an hour or probably more of traditional music every night.
