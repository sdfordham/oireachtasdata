In effect this means that certain categories of person will now acquire a statutory responsibility to report concerns of harm which meet or exceed a defined threshold to the Child and Family Agency. In addition, organisations which provide relevant services to children will, once the Bill is commenced, be required to undertake an assessment of risk in relation to the harm which may come to a child while availing of its services and to prepare a Child Safeguarding Statement which outlines the procedures which are in place to mitigate the identified risks. <\/p><p>The Government has no plans currently to carry out any further systemic historical reviews at this time.<\/p><p>If an allegation of historical abuse is made, the Child and Family Agency, under its statutory responsibility under section 3 of the Child Care Act, 1991, is required to investigate such allegations.

The applicant can continue in self-employment with their earnings from the business assessed to determine the level of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance that can be paid.<\/p><p>- The short-term enterprise allowance (STEA) gives support to a person who has lost their job and is in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment from the Department and wants to start their own business.

BTWEA provides for the retention of the value of the prior social protection payment on a reducing scale over two years, plus continued access to secondary benefits where the conditions for those are met.  In determining if a business proposal will be supported, issues of displacement of existing operators are considered.

There are currently approximately 70,000 rent supplement recipients, for which Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The Department recently published a review of the maximum rent limits, &ldquo;Maximum Rent Limit Analysis and Findings&rdquo; and it is available on www.welfare.ie. The review finds that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students. Between the rent supplement scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market. The State is therefore a very significant player in the sector which has a responsibility not alone to rent supplement recipients but also to the market as a whole, including all those in private accommodation. The review finds that increasing the rent limits would have several potentially negative effects, including providing an impetus for current rent supplement landlords to renegotiate their lease agreements to the new limits impacting on all existing recipients at significant cost to the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the review&rsquo;s findings, the Department will instead continue to allow for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework. Under this approach, each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances throughout the county, including those in the Meath area, are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents can be increased above prescribed limits if deemed appropriate. I am satisfied that this is the appropriate response at this time which has assisted in excess of 1,000 rent supplement recipients throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Department in conjunction with Threshold operates a Tenancy Sustainment Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply is most acute.  The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance.<\/p>  <p>  The review clearly points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting or seeking to rent at this time is the much reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation. The issue of supply is being addressed by Government through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy. Policy in relation to rent controls is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who is considering a number of policy options in relation to achieving greater rent certainty.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputies that I am keeping this matter under close review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided for rent supplement recipients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500051#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Rates","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500051#WRB02150"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[13916\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500051#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the cost of increasing the basic weekly social welfare rate of &euro;188 back to &euro;196.","asker":"1190","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":86,"content":"<p>It is understood that the Deputy is referring the cost of an &euro;8 per week increase in social welfare rates paid at a maximum personal weekly rate of &euro;188. <\/p><p>The &euro;188 per week rate applies to the following schemes:<\/p><p>- Jobseeker's Benefit &amp;amp; Allowance<\/p><p>- Farm Assist &amp;amp; Pre-Retirement Allowance<\/p><p>- Back to Education Allowance&amp;amp; Back to Work Allowance<\/p><p>- One Parent Family Payment, Widow\/er's\/Surviving Civil Partner (Non-Con) Pension &amp;amp; Deserted Wife's Allowance<\/p><p>- Disability Allowance &amp;amp; Illness Benefit<\/p><p>- Blind Pension &amp;amp; Incapacity Supplement<\/p><p>- Health &amp;amp; Safety Benefit &amp;amp; Injury Benefit<\/p><p>The cost of increasing these rates by &euro;8 to &euro;196 per week in 2016 is approximately &euro;256 million in 2016 and in a full year.

There are in the region of 50,000 families in receipt of FIS, an increase of 70 per cent since 2011. The average FIS payment per family is &euro;114 per week.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight (or 19 hours per week). The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them.

It provides employers with two levels of payment - &euro;7,500 or &euro;10,000 over two years provided the employment is maintained.  The rate of payment depends on the length of time the person is unemployed. The employment offered must be of a full-time nature of at least 30 hours per week over four days and must not displace existing employment.  Since July 2013, 18,940 jobseekers have confirmed their eligibility for JobsPlus, of which 4,424 are currently in employment.<\/p>  <p>  Employee pay rates are a matter for agreement between the employer and employee. Under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, employees are entitled to a minimum wage, currently &euro;8.65 per hour.  Employers recruiting under the JobsPlus initiative are required to comply with the Act and other statutory provisions in respect of pay and conditions.<\/p>  <p>  The Department collects data from employers in respect of expected pay levels at registration and this indicates that over 80% of employers at the time of recruitment intended to pay above the minimum pay rate.  This is considered reasonable given that starting pay rates will inevitably be lower than standard pay rates within an employment.  The Department has commenced structured monitoring of employers and also consults separately with employees on the operation of JobsPlus.  The Department also reserves the right to withdraw the wage subsidy from any employer who acts in manner inconsistent with the terms of JobsPlus or fails to meet the statutory requirements with respect to pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500052#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Operation","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500052#WRC01050"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[14034\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500052#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will introduce a new programme for those over sixty years of age who are\u00a0finishing their tenure on a community employment scheme, which will take their prospects of employment into consideration; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>The aim of CE is to enhance the employability and mobility of disadvantaged and unemployed persons by providing work experience and training opportunities for them within their communities.

A &ldquo;qualified adult&rdquo; is defined in the Act and is generally the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of a claimant who is wholly or mainly maintained by that person, subject to certain conditions.  As the State pension contributory is a PRSI based payment it is not means tested. However where a person wishes to claim for a qualified adult the income and assets of the qualified adult are assessed.

The weekly rate payable depends on the total weekly means of the person or couple.

The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  However, it is important to note that the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC.  The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied.  These require a person to enter insurable employment at least ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate (credited contributions do not satisfy this condition) and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their record.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has no plans to backdate this scheme prior to 1994 as it was previously estimated it may cost approximately &euro;160 million annually to backdate to 1953.  In any event, under the current rules, the costs of the scheme are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994.  Consequently, any decision to change the scheme would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  Work has commenced on replacing the current averaging approach used to assess entitlement to the SPC, with a total contributions approach.  As part of this work, the position of those who spent a number of years out of the labour force on home-caring duties will be carefully considered, particularly in the context of ensuring equality of outcomes for women and men.  It is expected that this approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as it is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  It is intended that changes would be announced well in advance of their introduction, to allow workers factor this into their retirement planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500054#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Fuel Scheme","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500054#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[14329\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500054#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if there are grants available from her Department for home heating solid fuel stoves or ranges; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>The Department provides assistance towards heating costs through the National Fuel Allowance Scheme each year.

Any person who engages in voluntary work may continue to be entitled to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit or Allowance provided that, in engaging in the voluntary work, the customer continues to satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work.<\/p>  <p>  Examples of voluntary work in which jobseekers may engage include:<\/p>  <p>  -  helping the sick, elderly or persons with a disability;<\/p>  <p>  -  assisting youth clubs, church groups, sports groups, cultural organisations, local resident associations.<\/p>  <p>  The groups involved may be nationally organised groups or local voluntary or community groups. The aim of the Voluntary Work Option is twofold, namely &ndash; to encourage voluntary organisations to involve jobseekers to the greatest extent possible in their existing activities by creating new opportunities for voluntary work and to inform jobseekers of their freedom to involve themselves in voluntary work and to encourage them to do so. In addition, the existing Community Employment Scheme offers the opportunity to unemployed persons to participate in paid employment in the social economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500055#WRF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Data","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500055#WRF00975"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[14490\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500055#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide, in tabular form and by county, the number of recipients of disability allowance granted and refused from 1 January 2014 to date in 2015; the average waiting time for decisions on appeals; the number of appeals referred for independent oral appeal; and the percentage of these approved and refused.","asker":"1050","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":211,"content":"<p>The following table relates to the number of disability allowance decisions that were awarded and disallowed from the start of January 2014 to the end of March 2015.

","asker":"1080","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":230,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 107 together.<\/p>  <p>  The jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes provide income support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative full-time employment.  The 2015 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;3.01 billion.    <\/p>  <p>  In line with other EU and OECD jurisdictions where such measures are common, reduced rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009. Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to recipients under 26 years of age. These measures are targeted measures aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency by incentivising them to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160. <\/p>  <p>  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.<\/p>  <p>  The reduced rates do not apply to a person aged under 25 where such persons were in the care of the Health Service Executive during the year prior to their 18th  birthday. There are no plans to extend this condition to any other group.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is actively engaging with Tusla and non-Government organisations in providing the necessary support to vulnerable young people leaving care who are experiencing homelessness or in insecure situations. These cases are managed on a case by case basis and the payment of deposits and rent in advance is considered. This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes who are at risk of, or who are homeless, or who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years. <\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall. For example the youth unemployment rate in Ireland as estimated by Eurostat was 21.6% in December 2014 as compared to 30.8% in December 2011. However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular.

There may also be a Gift Tax implication arising on the disposal of the entitlements but there is a tax-free threshold of &euro;225,000 available on disposals between a parent and a son or daughter.

Eleven companies or partnerships expressed interest in participating in the procurement process (of which five were Irish registered companies). Five companies were shortlisted to take part in the competitive dialogue stage (of which two were Irish registered companies). Four companies submitted provisional tenders (of which two were Irish registered companies) and two companies submitted final tenders (of which one was an Irish registered company). The successful bidder was CRIF S.p.A, an Italian company. It was a condition of the tender that any successful bidder would establish an Irish registered company. In February 2015 the Bank signed a contract with CRIF Ireland Limited, a wholly owned Irish subsidiary of the preferred bidder.<\/p>  <p>  The Bank has now commenced the design of the CCR solution and processes in conjunction with CRIF Ireland Ltd. The Bank continues to engage with representative industry groups to explain its approach and intends to publish a consultation paper in the near future. It is anticipated that 2015 will be spent in developing and testing the technical solutions with relevant stakeholders. The initial phase of the CCR will focus on lending to individuals and is expected to become operational by mid-2016. A later phase will address lending to incorporated entities and is tentatively scheduled to be operational by end-2017.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Credit Reporting Act 2013 sets out the range of personal information which may be held on the CCR, including Name, Date of Birth, Address and Personal Public Service Number (PPSN). The Bank will make regulations specifying the final personal information and credit information to be held on the CCR. The Bank notes that the extent and quality of personal information collected will have a significant impact on the capacity of the CCR to deliver complete and accurate credit reports. The Bank must consult with the Data Protection Commissioner on such regulations and also seek the consent of the Minister for Finance. In advance of such consultation on the regulations the Bank intends to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment to assist in finalising the personal information to be held. The Bank expects that a decision on the specific personal data (including PPSN) to be held on the CCR will be taken in Quarter 4 of 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The Bank will be registered with the Data Protection Commissioner as the data controller for the CCR.\u00a0 CRIF Ireland Ltd will be registered as a data processor and will process data in accordance with the instructions of the Bank.

The agreement between the Bank and CRIF Ireland Ltd contains robust provisions regarding the security and confidentiality of CCR information.

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions setting interest rates. It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review and\u00a0has been the subject of recent correspondence between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. The current position is that the Central Bank does not have new proposals for the additional regulation of interest rates.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. <\/p>  <p>  As I have stated in previous Parliamentary Questions, a former Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that in Ireland, as in most advanced economies,\u00a0it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants\u00a0when,\u00a0in fact, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. In this regard, there have been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may be entering a new and more competitive phase. <\/p>  <p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. Each institution determines the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors such as cost of funds and commercial considerations (such as competition, risk pricing and the impact on deposit rates).<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act) 2013\u00a0introduced changes to\u00a0Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which regulates fees and charges in order to attract new entrants to the Irish\u00a0banking sector. There is some evidence of\u00a0improvements in the\u00a0banking\u00a0sector with a number of institutions introducing new products and adapting their business model.\u00a0 In the last 12 months there have been a number of new entrants to the Irish mortgage market bringing additional and welcome competition to this sector.<\/p>  <p>  I should add that myself and the Governor of the Central Bank meet regularly, the latest of these meetings took place on 2 April. Among the items discussed was the issue of mortgage interest rates. The Governor provided an update on the ongoing work that he and his officials are carrying out on the issue of the standard variable rates charged by the lenders.<\/p>  <p>  We noted that the SVRs charged in Ireland are higher than other euro area countries and have not fallen in line with ECB wholesale rates. The Central Bank will continue to research why this is the case and will publish results shortly.

The relief is granted in respect of the profits of a new trade and chargeable gains on the disposal of any assets used for the purposes of the new trade. The relief is granted by reducing the corporation tax on profits relating to the trade to nil where the total amount of corporation tax payable by the company for an accounting period does not exceed &euro;40,000. Marginal relief is granted on a tapering basis where the total amount of corporation tax liability for the accounting period is between &euro;40,000 and &euro;60,000. No relief applies where corporation tax payable for an accounting period is &euro;60,000 or more. <\/p>  <p>  The relief was first introduced in 2009 and originally applied to certain companies commencing to trade in that year.\u00a0 This qualifying period has been extended in subsequent Finance Acts, and the relief is now available to qualifying companies commencing to trade up to and including 2015.\u00a0 As part of one of the early extensions of the relief, in Finance Act 2011, the basis on which relief is computed was changed to link the reduction in corporation tax to the amount of employers' PRSI paid in an accounting period, subject to a limit of &euro;5,000 per employee and an aggregate limit of &euro;40,000. The purpose of this change was to better target the relief at companies generating employment. The changes introduced in Finance Act 2011 apply to all qualifying companies for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. However, companies which set up and commenced a qualifying trade in 2009 or in 2010 were able to obtain relief on the previous (i.e. pre-Finance Act 2011) basis for profits earned in accounting periods commencing before 2011.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequent amendments have also extended the relief to provide that, where a start-up company does not have sufficient profits to claim the relief in a given year, any relief unclaimed in the first three years can be carried forward into future years for use against future corporation tax liabilities.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A review of the operation of this relief is taking place this year, to ensure that it meets the policy objectives of creating jobs and activity in Ireland and provides value for money for the Irish taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500060#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","counter":394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500060#WRL00550"},{"type":"question","counter":395,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[14421\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500060#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the tax shelters and tax exemptions, that allow the better-off to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, that have been eliminated or restricted since March 2011.

Since 2011, this effectively limits the rate at which individuals, with income in excess of &euro;125,000 per annum, can use a wide variety of tax reliefs and exemptions. This limit is graduated so that individuals with incomes in excess of &euro;400,000 per annum will pay a minimum effective rate of income tax of at least 30%, regardless of how many reliefs they have available. This is chargeable in addition to USC and PRSI.<\/p><p>The following measures have been included among the reliefs that are taken into account for the purposes of the application of the restriction. <\/p><p>- For the tax year 2014 onwards, subject to certain conditions, the wear and tear allowance for plant and machinery available to passive lessors (Section 16 Finance (No. 2) Act 2013).<\/p><p>- The Foreign Earnings Deduction (Section 12 Finance Act 2012).<\/p><p><b>Relief to individuals on loans applied to acquire an interest in partnerships<\/b><\/p><p>Relief to individuals on loans applied to acquire an interest in partnerships was abolished for new claimants from 15 October 2013 and reduced on a sliding scale for existing claimants with total cessation from 2017 onwards. This abolition does not include farm partnerships (Section 3 Finance (No. 2) Act 2013).<\/p><p><b>Donation of heritage property<\/b><\/p><p>Tax relief for the donation of heritage property was amended in Section 25 of Finance Act 2013 to lower the amount of the market value of the property that qualifies for relief from 80% to 50%.<\/p><p><b>Film Relief <\/b><\/p><p>Prior to 1 January 2015, an individual could, by virtue of section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, claim relief from taxation at his\/her marginal rate on amounts not exceeding &euro;50,000 invested in the production of qualifying films in any taxable period. <\/p><p>Section 24 of the Finance Act 2014 terminated this relief with effect from 1 January 2015.\u00a0 Support to the film industry is now provided in the form of a corporation tax credit which is payable directly to film production companies.<\/p><p><b>Income tax losses<\/b><\/p><p>Finance Act 2013 and Finance Act 2014 curtailed the relief which individuals could claim for certain 'trade' losses against their other income.\u00a0 <\/p><p>- Section 18 Finance Act 2013 amended section 381 TCA1997 to provide that individuals who are engaged in the trade of dealing in or developing land cannot claim loss relief against their other income if that loss arises from interest accrued but not yet paid or from the write down in land values where that land has not been sold. This restriction ensures that only losses which have actually been realised are available to reduce the tax liabilities of land developers.<\/p><p>- Section 11 Finance Act 2014 introduced two sections (381B and 381C) to the TCA 1997 to curtail the use of losses.Section 381B ensures that individuals can only claim limited loss relief against their other income if the loss arises from a trade which is not carried out in an active and commercial manner.Section 381C provides that where a loss arises from a tax-avoidance arrangement no loss relief is available against that individual's other income.These amendments prevent individuals from accessing tax reliefs in respect of losses arising from the carrying on of 'hobby' trades. And they also prevent the presentation of certain activities as trades for the purposes of reducing an individual's overall tax liability.<\/p><p><b>USC<\/b><\/p><p>From 1 January 2013 an income limit of &euro;60,000 was introduced for access to the exemption from the top rates of USC for medical card holders and individuals aged 70 years.<\/p><p><b>Foreign Service Relief<\/b><\/p><p>Foreign service relief in respect of termination lump sum payments was ceased in respect of payments made on or after 27 March 2013.<\/p><p><b>Top Slicing Relief<\/b><\/p><p>Top Slicing Relief in respect of termination lump-sums paid on or after 1 January 2013 was restricted to the first &euro;200,000 of the aggregate of all termination lump sums received.<\/p><p>Top Slicing Relief abolished entirely in respect of termination lump-sums paid on or after 1 January 2014.<\/p><p><b>Pensions<\/b><\/p><p>- The Standard Fund Threshold (SFT), which places a limit on the maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes, was reduced with effect from 1 January 2014, from &euro;2.3m to &euro;2m. \u00a0(Section 18 Finance (No. 2) Act 2013).<\/p><p>- A Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) which may apply instead of the SFT in certain circumstances was restricted, for new PFT applicants, to a maximum of &euro;2.3m where the capital value of an individual's pension rights on 1 January 2014 exceeded the reduced SFT of &euro;2m. (Section 18 Finance (No. 2) Act 2013).<\/p><p>- The valuation factor used for establishing the capital value of defined benefit pension rights at the point of retirement (and which accrue after 1 January 2014) for SFT\/PFT purposes was increased from a factor of 20 to a range of higher age related factors that vary with the individual's age at the point at which the pension benefits are drawn down. (Section 18 Finance (No. 2) Act 2013).<\/p><p>- Vested PRSAs (i.e. personal retirement savings accounts\u00a0in respect of which benefits have commenced) were brought within the imputed distribution regime with effect from the tax year 2012. Prior to 2012, the regime applied only to approved retirement funds (ARFs). Under the regime, both ARF and vested PRSA owners are treated as &quot;receiving an annual payment&quot; from their ARF and\/or vested PRSA calculated as a percentage of the assets held in the funds at the annual valuation date. The rate of the imputed distribution varies with the size of the fund and is chargeable to income tax under Schedule E. (Section 18 Finance Act 2012).<\/p><p>- The rate of imputed distribution applying to ARFs\/vested PRSAs with assets valued in excess of &euro;2m was increased from 5% to 6% with effect from the tax year 2012. (Section 18 Finance Act 2012).<\/p><p>- The rate of final liability tax applying to a post-death distribution from an ARF to a child (aged 21 or over) of the deceased ARF owner was increased from 20% to 30% with effect from 31 March 2012 (date of passing of Finance Act 2012). (Section 18 Finance Act 2012).<\/p><p><b>Property Relief Surcharge<\/b><\/p><p>Section 531AAE provides for an increase in the Universal Social Charge (USC) in respect of income of certain individuals. It potentially only applies to those whose gross income in the year is at least &euro;100,000 and then only to income which is sheltered by any of the property or area-based incentive reliefs in that year. This means any of the accelerated property capital allowances under any of the incentive schemes as well as the residential lessor relief commonly known as section 23-type relief. The 5% property relief surcharge is payable, in addition to any other USC which the person is obliged to pay on the income in question. <\/p><p><b>Cap on accelerated capital allowances<\/b><\/p><p>There have been many different property relief schemes over the years, each one tailored to address particular regional or sectoral needs, and their rules varied. Although these have all been brought to an end, capital allowances were still being claimed in respect of projects undertaken while the schemes were active. <\/p><p>Finance Act 2012 introduced a provision which meant that with effect from 1 January 2015, certain passive investors in accelerated capital allowance schemes would no longer be able to use any capital allowances beyond the tax life of the particular scheme where that tax life ends after 1 January 2015. Where the tax life of a scheme has ended before that date no carry forward of allowances into 2015 will be allowed. This lead-in period was intended to give individuals time to adjust to this change in advance. <\/p><p>This provision is restricted to\u00a0passive investors only. A person who is entitled to accelerated capital allowances and who is an active trader\u00a0will not be affected by this measure.\u00a0In addition, residential (Section 23) and owner-occupier reliefs are unaffected by these measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500060#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":397,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500060#WRL00750"},{"type":"question","counter":398,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[14423\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500060#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a report on his meeting with Governor Honohan on 2 April 2015, listing all issues discussed, decisions taken and commitments made.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":399,"content":"<p>As Minister for Finance, I meet with the\u00a0Governor of the Central Bank on a regular basis.\u00a0Our latest meeting took place on 2 April 2015.\u00a0The meeting covered a broad range of issues, among them\u00a0the issue of mortgage interest rates.

Sustainability of a split mortgage (of which there are various designs) will be assessed by the Central Bank inter alia with regard both to the affordability of the un-warehoused debt payment schedule and with regard to the treatment of the warehoused loan at maturity.

Where there is no such engagement then Revenue has no choice but to use its debt collection\/enforcement options, including charging interest on late payments as appropriate to protect the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, taking account of Revenue's overall balanced approach to charging interest on late payment of tax, which is both effective and reasonable, I have no plans to revise the rates currently applied at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500062#WRN01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Recruitment","counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500062#WRN01250"},{"type":"question","counter":479,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[14867\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500062#WRN01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there are impediments to temporary staff who are employed by outsourced companies on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners when they seek to apply for permanent jobs which are identical to the jobs they been performing on a temporary basis prior to the advertising of the new job.","asker":"1008","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":480,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no impediments to temporary staff who are employed by outsourced companies on behalf of Revenue in relation to applications for jobs in the Revenue Commissioners providing they meet the eligibility criteria of the respective competitions.<\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of permanent staff in Revenue is regulated by the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA), the statutory body responsible for public service recruitment.

The companies in question are ESB, EirGrid, Ervia, Bord na Mona, Irish Water and Coillte. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the reform, NewERA, in conjunction with the relevant Government Departments, has developed a Shareholder Expectations Framework which is intended to provide clarity and guidance for each of the companies in relation to the Government's strategic priorities, policy objectives, and financial performance and reporting requirements.  One of the key areas addressed as part of this shareholder expectations framework is dividend policy.

Dividends to the State arising from the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy are expected to be up to &euro;1bn, of which the\u00a0first &euro;150m was paid in 2014.

Of this total of &euro;19.6m, a total sum of &euro;1,144,800 was allocated to Galway County Council (GCC) for coastal protection repair works under the Government Decision.  The local authorities, including GCC, submitted to the Office of Public Works (OPW) programmes of coastal protection repair works setting out how they intended to spend their allocations.  The amount included in GCC's submission to the OPW in respect of coastal protection works at Lower Road Mainistir and Kilmurvey, Inis M&oacute;r was &euro;120,000 for repair works and &euro;720,000 for strengthening works. The OPW informed the Council that, in accordance with the terms of the Government Decision, the repair element only of the listed projects in its programme of works was approved for funding.<\/p>  <p>  The works to repair damaged coastal protection structures at Kilmurvey and Mainistir were completed in 2014 and the Council drew down &euro;111,392 from the OPW out of the amount of &euro;120,000 approved for this work.  To date the Council has drawn down &euro;907,099 of the total allocation of &euro;1,144,800 for storm damage repairs.  The balance of the allocation is available for draw down this year.  The OPW has informed the Council that some flexibility would be allowed as regards adjustment of the cost of individual projects and inclusion of a proportionate element of strengthening works, subject to the overall cost not exceeding the total allocation of &euro;1,144,800.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted also that GCC included a separate amount of &euro;100,000 in its initial submission to the D\/EC&amp;LG following the storms in respect of the cost of road repairs at Lower Road Mainistir and Kilmurvey.  The provision and drawdown of this funding is a matter between GCC and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW operates a Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  The Scheme's eligibility criteria, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, are published on the OPW website, www.opw.ie.  It is not available for repair of damaged infrastructure or for maintenance of existing flood defence or coastal protection assets.  A Local Authority may apply to the OPW for support under the scheme having regard to those eligibility criteria.  Application forms are available on OPW's website under Flood Risk Management and decisions are made having regard to the overall availability of funding for flood risk management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500063#WRO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1106"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Station Closures","counter":514,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500063#WRO00750"},{"type":"question","counter":515,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[14035\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500063#WRO00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position in relation to a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na barracks (details supplied) in County Sligo; and the Office of Public Works plans for same.

The dates in question are 15 May to 30 September, weather permitting.  These are virtually the same dates as in 2014 (16 May - 29 September), so there has been no curtailment of the length of the season.<\/p>  <p>  In previous years, there has been pressure from local interests to access the island earlier than Mid-May.  It has been advised on many occasions in the past in response to such demands that this is not possible due to the significant amount of work that needs to be done in the period immediately prior to the official opening.  During this period, the site needs to be prepared to receive visitors by the execution of significant Health and Safety preparations for the season carried out.  In particular, after the winter  the site has to be fully assessed, any hazards cleared from public areas and any necessary repairs carried out.  These vital preparatory works are essential in advance of opening the island to the public.<\/p>  <p>  It is undeniable that, in previous years certain Boatmen have ignored the published visitor season dates and landed visitors on the Island when it remains in an unsafe, unprepared condition and is without Guides who provide the trained emergency response including radios, defibrillator, oxygen, first aid etc.  In 2014 in particular, visitors were landed on the Island in early May in the middle of a particularly hazardous situation brought about by the severe winter storms.  At this time, there were active rockfalls in particular which made the site especially dangerous and enabling the presence of visitors including young children in this scenario, was, in the view of the Commissioners of Public Works, completely irresponsible.  This has prompted them to take direct enforcement action this year.<\/p>  <p>  In consultation with the relevant officials of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport the OPW has agreed to the insertion of the season dates in the relevant DTTAS Passenger Licence which is required for the carriage of passengers to Skellig Michael.  This will mean that any landings on the Island outside the relevant dates will constitute a breach of the Department's Licence Conditions.  Boatmen will however still be permitted to sail to Skellig Michael with visitors and circumnavigate the Island, as a considerable number frequently do, without any fear of breaching the conditions of their Licence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500063#WRO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1106"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Redeployment","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500063#WRO01550"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[14792\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500063#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to open up the public service and Civil Service so that public servants may transfer freely into the Civil Service, similar to the way civil servants may transfer freely into the public service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

They, inter alia, stipulate two types of occupation for the purposes of the employment permits system:<\/p><p>- The Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations Lists (HSEOL) sets out the lists of eligible occupations deemed to be critically important to growing Ireland&rsquo;s economy, are highly demanded and highly skilled, and are in significant shortage of supply in our labour market.  This list is an integral part of the <i>Critical Skills Employment Permit<\/i>which is designed to attract highly skilled people into the labour market with the aim of encouraging them to take up permanent residence in the State.<\/p><p>The Ineligible Categories of Employment List includes those occupations for which there is a clear surplus of adequately skilled Irish and EEA nationals in the wider labour force.<\/p><p>My Department has devised a process of reviewing and updating the HSEOL and Ineligible Categories of Employment List for employment permits bi-annually.  This review is predicated on a formalised and evidence-based process.  Such a process involves obtaining and considering advice from the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SMLRU - SOLAS).  It also involves input from relevant Government Departments, Agencies, and industry as necessary.<\/p><p>The EGFSN&rsquo;s <i>Annual Skills Bulletin<\/i>contributes principally to my Department&rsquo;s ongoing monitoring of the labour market.  This Bulletin draws on data on employment, vacancies, job announcements and immigration and other qualitative information held in the National Skills Database (in SOLAS), to identify imbalances in the Irish labour market at occupational level.<\/p><p>The inclusion of chiropractors on the Ineligible Categories of Employment List was informed by this formalised evidence-based process.  This periodic review process provides an opportunity to interested parties to make representations to me, as Minister, on the composition of the lists.  Accordingly, my Department is considering the matter as part of its current review of the lists which it is intended will be finalised in May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500064#WRP02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Site Visits","counter":581,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500064#WRP02588"},{"type":"question","counter":582,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[14540\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500064#WRP02600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of site visits by IDA Ireland client or prospective client companies, in tabular form and on a county basis, for the first three months of 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The trade union is seeking to engage with the company on these issues and the matter was referred by the union to the Labour Court under section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969 in October of last year.<\/p>  <p>  The company was not represented at the Labour Court hearing. In this regard, the Court found it regrettable that the company declined to participate in the investigation of the dispute or to put forward its position on the union's claims.<\/p>  <p>  In its recommendation of 14th November 2014, the Court reaffirmed earlier recommendations it had made by noting that the Company and the union were parties to a collective agreement signed in 1996 which provides a procedural framework within which industrial relations disputes and differences arising between the parties can be resolved by negotiation and dialogue. The Court pointed out that the dictates of good industrial relations practice requires parties to honour their collective agreements in both spirit and intent.<\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed that the company decided against attending the Labour Court hearing, contrary to good industrial relations practice in that regard. In my view, the experience and expertise of the Labour Court offers the most appropriate and effective avenue for resolving such issues.<\/p>  <p>  I would urge both parties to avail of the services of the State&rsquo;s industrial Relations machinery who remain available to assist the parties, in a flexible manner and without prejudice to positions of principle that may be held by any party. It is my opinion that engagement with the State's industrial relations machinery offers the best way whereby the parties involved in this dispute can hope to resolve their differences.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute.  However, I would like to see an early and fair settlement to this dispute.<\/p>  <p>  As regards representation rights, Cabinet approval was obtained at the end of 2014 to legislate for an improved framework for workers who are in dispute with their employer regarding their terms and conditions in situations where there are no arrangements with their employer to resolve the matters through collective bargaining.<\/p>  <p>  When enacted this legislation will mark the fulfilment of one of the most significant commitments in the Programme for Government which indicated that reform in this area was needed. In developing these proposals Minister Bruton and I have been keen to respect the positions articulated by stakeholders to develop proposals that sustain our voluntary system, but also ensure that workers have confidence that, where there is no collective bargaining, they have an effective system that ensures they can air grievances about remuneration, terms and conditions and have these determined based on those in similar companies and not be victimised for doing so.  I expect this legislation to be published during this D&aacute;il session and enacted as expeditiously as is possible thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500065#WRQ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1067"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":592,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500065#WRQ00650"},{"type":"question","counter":593,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[14815\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500065#WRQ00700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"to set out his plans to transpose the European Union directive on part-time work into Irish law ; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1030","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":594,"content":"<p>The Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 (the 2001 Act) implemented EU Council Directive 97\/81\/EC into Irish law.

The purpose of the Framework Agreement, which was annexed to the Directive, was to eliminate discrimination against part-time employees and to improve the quality of part-time work.  It also aimed to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of employers and employees.  Accordingly, the 2001 Act provides a wide degree of protection for part-time employees, including the general protection that a part-time employee shall not be treated in a less favourable manner in respect of his\/her conditions of employment than a full time employee.<\/p>  <p>  Further, Section 13(5) of the 2001 Act contained provisions in relation the preparation and publishing of a Code of Practice by the Labour Relations Commission in relation to the steps that could be taken by employers for the purposes of Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement. Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement provided that, as far as possible, an employer should give consideration to a request by workers to transfer from full-time work to part-time and vice-versa.  The Labour Relations Commission prepared this Code of Practice, based on the provisions in Section 13 of the 2001 Act, following consultation with the social partners.  It was deemed to be a Code of Practice and implemented, in 2006, by the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Access to Part-Time Working) (Declaration) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 8 of 2006).

Clearly a larger programme of supports would have incentivised more productive investments.

From a national perspective, <i>Food Harvest 2020<\/i>recognises the potential of the seafood sector, in particular aquaculture and seafood processing, to contribute to employment growth and aims to increase employment in the seafood sector from 11,000 to 14,000 by 2020. This potential is echoed in <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2015<\/i>.<\/p><p>On 27 March 2015, I announced plans for a new &euro;241 million development programme for the seafood sector for the period up to 2020, co-funded by the EU through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. I am inviting submissions on that draft Programme by 1 May 2015. The draft Seafood Development Programme 2014-2020 proposes investment of &euro;30 million in a number of measures specifically intended to support the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector. Those investment plans will be supported by a new National Strategic Plan for Aquaculture, which I will publish for public consultation shortly. Through that National Strategic Plan and targeted investment under the Seafood Development Programme I will be seeking to identify all of the issues affecting the sustainable growth of the sector and the policy actions and supporting investment needed to address those issues. Strategic Environmental Assessments will accompany both the National Strategic Plan and Seafood Development Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500065#WRQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Farant&oacute;ireachta","counter":614,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500065#WRQ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":615,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[13864\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500065#WRQ02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"c&eacute;n r&eacute;iteach fadt&eacute;armach a dh&eacute;anfar chun p&aacute;irce&aacute;il fheili&uacute;nach a chur ar f&aacute;il saor in aisce d&rsquo;oile&aacute;naigh i gcalafort Ros an Mh&iacute;l; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.

The return of Irish beef to the US market was the result of significant political, technical and diplomatic efforts by my Department, Bord Bia and Irish Embassy in Washington DC. It was a collaborative effort which has borne fruit, with Ireland being the first European country to regain access to the biggest beef market in the world. All of the major Irish beef exporters that accompanied me reported strong interest from US buyers and distributors, which are already leading to commercial deals being signed.<\/p>  <p>  I am also delighted to see that the first commercial shipments of Irish beef have landed in the US. Indeed the very first shipment was served at the annual Ireland-America Fund attended by the Taoiseach during his Saint Patrick&rsquo;s D   ay visit. This was a huge marketing opportunity to serve our beef to a hugely influential Irish-American network and one which we exploited to the full.<\/p>  <p>  Currently just 2% of Irish beef exports go outside the EU each year and further diversifying the available markets has been a key element of my strategy for the beef sector for some time. This is a key element in ensuring more sustainable returns to beef farmers and ensuring that an over-reliance on particular markets does not harm the long term prospects of the sector. The key objective for my Department is to provide market access so that industry operators can avail of market opportunities. I am very confident that the opening of the US market is a major step forward in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500068#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Safety Scheme","counter":717,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500068#WRT00800"},{"type":"question","counter":718,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[14357\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500068#WRT00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the farm safety campaigns that are planned with the Health and Safety Authority, in view of the fact that leading industry experts have expressed concern about the likely increase in farm accident numbers, given that milk production is forecast to increase by 50% by 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":719,"content":"<p>Farm Safety is a critical issue facing farming today and is something that I am seriously concerned about.

I would also like to stress that the Regulations were the subject of consultation with all of the farming organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The reasons for introducing the regulations were twofold. In the first instance, the old TB Order dated from 1989 and had been amended on a number of occasions in the interim. Therefore, it was necessary to codify, modernise and update, in legal terms, the legislation underpinning the TB Eradication Scheme. Secondly, following enactment of the Animal Health Welfare Act 2013, it has been necessary to replace various statutory instruments made under the statute which it has replaced (i.e. the Diseases of Animals Act 1966). The TB Order of 1989 was one of the statutory instruments which had to be replaced in this context. <\/p>  <p>  The Regulations provide a legal underpinning of a number of elements of the TB Programme which have been implemented administratively up to now. This is particularly the case in relation to the on-farm valuation compensation scheme which had been implemented on an administrative basis over the years but is now being put on a legal footing for the first time. The new Regulations also provide a legal basis for the existing &ldquo;farmer pay&rdquo; testing arrangements which have been agreed with the farming bodies for many years. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the new Regulations will not have any negative impact on general farm husbandry. The position is that the new regulations do not impose any new restrictions on the veterinary treatment of animals. As I explained in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 31 March, it is established practice that the test notification letter which my Department issues to farmers about 6 weeks in advance of the deadline to test advises the farmer to avoid giving routine treatments in advance of the test. The reason for this is to avoid (i) the risk of inadvertently interfering with the test result and (ii) treated animals having to be retained on farms to comply with the post-treatment withdrawal period, thereby prolonging the restriction period. This approach is in line with the key objectives of the Scheme, which are to have reactors removed from the farm as quickly as possible to minimise the restriction period and minimise risk of in-herd spread of the disease. <\/p>  <p>  I would, however, like to emphasise that a number of mechanisms are built into the arrangements to facilitate farmers in treating their animals. Firstly, farmers are permitted to carry out urgent treatments, including for animal welfare related reasons and this is made clear in the test notification letter. In addition, provision is made for farmers to bring forward the test date in order to facilitate their routine treatment schedules. Provision is also made to address circumstances where a farmer finds it necessary to postpone a test because of particular circumstances. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500068#WRT03700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Data Programme","counter":747,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500068#WRT03800"},{"type":"question","counter":748,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[14437\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500068#WRT03900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when the beef genomics scheme will be initiated; in view of the importance of a thriving suckler cow herd, if he will consider increasing the subsidy per cow to &euro;200 as an incentive and viability measure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":749,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, I place great importance on the Irish suckler herd and its place in the agri-food industry, which in turn is of vital importance to Ireland&rsquo;s economy.

The actions currently being considered for the Programme include recording a range of data relating to performance criteria and animal events, taking tissue (DNA) samples from selected animals and sending onwards for laboratory testing, completing an on-farm Carbon Navigator, and selecting high quality replacement bulls and heifers over the six years of the BDGP contract.<\/p><p>All Rural Development Plans are subject to European Commission approval, following a detailed period of analysis, scrutiny and discussion. I can assure the Deputy that the scheme will be rolled out very shortly, with application forms issuing to all eligible farmers. This scheme is not a subsidy, but rather a developmental scheme under the Rural Development Programme. It is not permissible to arbitrarily increase the payment or, under EU or WTO rule, to provide financial incentives to encourage production, as suggested by the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500068#WRT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Industry","counter":750,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500068#WRT04100"},{"type":"question","counter":751,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[14438\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500068#WRT04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the current status of the beef forum; when the forum will be at its full implementation level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":752,"content":"<p>At February&rsquo;s Roundtable meeting, there was a consensus that good progress was being made in delivering on the outcomes agreed at previous meetings, accompanied by a strong commitment from all participants to continue this work.

However, the rules governing the imposition of a superlevy were set by binding regulations agreed at EU level and despite numerous proposals from Ireland and other like minded countries for action at EU level to mitigate the impact of the super levy, primarily via utilisation of an adjustment to the butterfat coefficient, it became clear as 2014 progressed and 2015 arrived that there was no realistic prospect of any movement on the super-levy.

The aim of the Review Group is to agree standards and delivery targets for the schemes and services provided by the Department to all its clients including farmers.  In terms of the simplification, the Commissioner, Hogan, recently announced that his focus would in the first instance be on the Direct Payment Schemes. \u00a0This is an approach which I fully support and will be working closely with the Commissioner and his officials in this regard. Any simplification of schemes as a result of this initiative would of course be reflected in the Farmers Charter.<\/p>  <p>  Irish farmers draw down roughly &euro;1.2bn per annum in direct payments under the CAP. As you will be aware the EU Regulations governing the various schemes require Member States to carry out a certain level of inspections to ensure that farmers meet their obligations in terms of qualifying for direct payments. I am very mindful that farmer payments are crucially important and that is why there is already a robust appeals mechanism in place in my Department whereby a farmer who is not satisfied with any decision affecting his\/her payment m a   y seek an internal review. Should the farmer not be satisfied with the outcome of this review he\/she\u00a0may refer the matter to the Agriculture Appeals Office, which is an independent agency established to provide a free impartial service to farmers who are unhappy with decisions regarding their entitlements under certain schemes. The Agriculture Appeals Office operates under the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 and the Agriculture Appeals Regulations 2002. \u00a0Farmers can also appeal any decision affecting their payment entitlement to the Ombudsman. The above process including details of how to seek a review\/appeal, contact details, etc. will be outlined in detail in the new Farmers Charter. <\/p>  <p>  While negotiations on the new Farmers&rsquo; Charter are at an advanced stage there are a number of areas that require further discussion.

In this regard, my Department will be writing to herdowners in the coming weeks informing them of the risks posed to them by the presence of PI animals on the farms of neighbouring farmers who retain PI animals for more than seven weeks of the initial BVD test.

The new offences also implement the recommendation from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that it is necessary to take these steps to tackle the trafficking and wider exploitation of persons through prostitution.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill is a complex piece of legislation which addresses a number of sensitive issues.  The Bill is priority legislation and is currently being drafted, with a view to publication in this parliamentary session.<\/p>  <p>  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the existing legislative provisions addressing the trafficking of persons for the purpose of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 prohibits trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  Any person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, and at the discretion of the court, to a fine.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years and \/ or a fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500075#WRAA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":1011,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500075#WRAA00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1012,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[14542\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500075#WRAA00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding an application for citizenship or naturalisation in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1013,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that the application has entered the final stage of processing and I intend to grant citizenship.<\/p>  <p>  The person concerned will be invited in due course to attend the next citizenship ceremony at which he will make a declaration of fidelity to the Irish Nation and loyalty to the State and receive his certificate of naturalisation.<\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The Group drew attention to the requirement that payment must be made in such cases as part of the transaction, e.g. on-line shopping, and not later on delivery of the product. The Group noted that sales of intoxicating liquor which had been ordered by telephone or otherwise and which were paid for on delivery were illegal transactions and recommended that the Garda&iacute; should target such delivery services with a view to prosecuting the offending licensees. Any information concerning transactions of this nature which are contrary to the provisions of the Licensing Acts should, therefore, be brought to the attention of the Garda&iacute; for investigation and possible prosecution.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, under section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (as amended), it is an offence for a licensee to sell or deliver, or to permit any other person to sell or deliver, alcohol to any person for consumption off his or her premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission.<\/p>  <p>  The Government Legislation Programme provides for future publication of the Sale of Alcohol Bill.

In line with the 2013 policy, the fostering allowance follows the child and is therefore deducted from the main carer and paid to the foster carers providing the respite care.  In circumstances where respite from home is being provided by foster carers an allowance will be paid to them from Tusla's fostering budget.<\/p>  <p>  Fostering care allowances are provided in order to allow foster carers meet all of the child&rsquo;s daily living needs, e.g. food, clothing, school uniform, school books, extra-curricular activities, school trips, pocket money (depending on the age of the child), and treats such as toys, games or holidays. The Tusla Alternative Care Practice Handbook notes that the allowance  \"is not a wage or salary for the carers\".  The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week per child up to 12 years of age, and   &euro;352 per week per child over 12 years of age. The foster care allowance is tax exempt.<\/p>  <p>  Respite care is defined in the National Standards for Foster Care as &lsquo;short term care provided to a child in order to support the child, his or her parent(s) or foster carers by providing a break for the child and his or her primary caregivers&rsquo;.  It is acknowledged that respite care can play an invaluable role in supporting children to remain at home, and during placement breakdown.  Where a child is in care, the issue of respite periods would be considered in the context of the best interests of the child.  Respite care would not feature in all placements, and would normally be included as part of the child's care plan if it is to be availed of during the placement.  Where planned respite care is for a period of less than a week, then a pro-rata payment is made based on the foster care allowance for a full week. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500078#WRDD04300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"After-School Support Services","counter":1139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500078#WRDD04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1140,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[14866\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500078#WRDD04500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the total number of children and households availing of the after-school child care scheme.","asker":"1028","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1141,"qnumday":417,"qnumall":"[14870\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500078#WRDD04600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of child care providers participating in the after-school child care ccheme, by county.","asker":"1028","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1142,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 416 and 417 together.<\/p><p>The total number of children and the number of parents availing of the After-School Childcare (ASCC) programme and the number of child care providers participating in the programme, as requested by the Deputy, are shown on the table.<\/p><p>After-School Childcare (ASCC) programme figures as at 9 April 2015.<table><tr><th>CCC<\/th><th>No of Children<\/th><th>No of Parents<\/th><th>No of Services with ASCC Contract.<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>33<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>44<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>23<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork County<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>75<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>46<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>90<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>21<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>70<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>97<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>61<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>31<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick <\/td><td>11<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>27<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>40<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>38<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>43<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>64<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary North<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>31<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary South<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>23<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>21<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>33<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>49<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Figure<\/td><td>267<\/td><td>202<\/td><td>1217<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500078#WRDD04700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Standards","counter":1143,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500078#WRDD04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1144,"qnumday":418,"qnumall":"[13933\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500078#WRDD04900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the provisions made to ensure that children in residential care, including in secure units, are receiving the education to which they are entitled;

In 2012, expenditure on the schemes amounted to &euro;39.7m.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of a complex area to do with the impact youth service provision has in young people&rsquo;s lives.  Overall, the review found that the youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people, and should be considered for on-going public funding. <\/p><p>The review makes a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. It recommends that the three schemes be replaced with a single, targeted, evidence-based and outcomes focussed scheme designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people and their communities. It sets out guidance as to how services may be developed to better meet the needs of young people in the target cohort and how demographic information and CSO data about local areas should be part of the programme design. <\/p><p>My Department has now commenced a detailed consultation process with the youth sector and providers of youth services about the review's findings and recommendations. The consultation includes regional meetings in Cork, Sligo and Dublin City and County over the next month. All local services are being invited to participate, including youth projects funded under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund and the coordinators of the Drugs Task Forces in the relevant areas.  My Department is committed to working collaboratively with the youth sector interests in the development and implementation of the new programme over the next two years.<\/p><p>I intend that the reforms recommended in the review will be progressed in the context of the new National Youth Strategy, which is nearing completion.

This programme provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families.

These services include medical\/forensic examination; child protection; Garda investigation; assessment; therapy and court process. <\/p><p>The agencies involved in this process are Tusla, the HSE, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group, the Probation Service and CARI. The model is informed by the recommendations of the Ferns Report 2005 and the National Review of Sexual Abuse Services for Children and Young People, June 2011 (HSE\/Mott McDonald). <\/p><p>All agencies are committed to the implementation of the model with a number of initiatives currently underway.  For example, the HSE is establishing a new medical\/forensic examination facility for the greater Dublin area; specialist sexual abuse services are being developed within the context of the development of the national paediatric hospital and Tusla is employing four additional staff at Principal Social Worker grade to support the implementation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500079#WREE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Funding","counter":1189,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500079#WREE02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1190,"qnumday":434,"qnumall":"[14747\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500079#WREE02900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his plans to address the situation whereby child care service providers receive capitation for 38 weeks, but their staff are entitled to be paid for 41 weeks; if he is aware of the impact this shortfall has on the finances of these providers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1191,"content":"<p>In the region of &euro;170 million is provided annually by my Department to support the provision of a free pre-school year under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.93m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has notified youth organisations and projects of their 2015 allocations in respect of their youth services.  As in recent years, national organisations along with the grant administering agencies that administer youth funding, on behalf of my Department, were invited where it was appropriate, to submit proposals to my Department for the reconfiguration of the funding allocations notified to them across projects and funding schemes to better meet local needs.  A small number of requests for reconfiguration have been received by my Department in 2015.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department maintains close contact with the youth services throughout the country, and works closely with Education and Training boards in this regard. Youth Officers of the Education and Training Boards engage with local services, on behalf of my Department. They provide support and advice in matters to do with the application and reporting processes for funding and the implementation of quality standards in services for young people. <\/p>  <p>  I and my Department regularly receive representations from youth services on a range of issues, including financial provision. I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet regularly, with youth organisations and groups. In January and February, officials of my Department met with the representatives of some 30 national and major regional youth organisations to discuss recent and upcoming developments and to hear their plans for the services in 2015. My aim is to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.<\/p>  <p>  Ongoing engagement and dialogue with the voluntary youth sector organisations and with young people themselves are priorities in the formulation of policies and provision of services to support young people&rsquo;s development and learning. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is developing a new National Youth Strategy.  Based on Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures - the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 - 2020, it will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24. It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support.<\/p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy is being developed in close consultation with statutory youth interests and the voluntary youth organisations and services that work with young people. A National Youth Strategy Task Group, convened by my Department, is overseeing its development. This Task Group comprises representatives of Government Departments, relevant agencies, business, academia and youth interests. A comprehensive consultation with youth stakeholders and young people on the priorities for the youth strategy has recently concluded. My Department is working to finalise the new National Youth Strategy by early Summer. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500080#WRFF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bullying of Children","counter":1200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500080#WRFF00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1201,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[14902\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500080#WRFF00500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the degree to which his Department monitors the extent of bullying taking place outside work or school and cyber bullying; if any particular issues have arisen which may alert authorities to the existence of particular trends of bullying; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1202,"content":"<p>I share concerns about bullying and its consequences. We know from the Growing Up in Ireland survey that is commissioned by my Department that a total of 40% of nine-year-olds reported being victims of bullying in the past year, and boys and girls experienced similar rates of victimisation. Prevalence rates based on information provided by the child&rsquo;s mother were substantially lower than rates based on children&rsquo;s reports, with 23% of the mothers of nine year- olds reporting that their child had been victimised in the previous year. Many mothers were unaware of their children&rsquo;s experiences of bullying. For the children who did report victimisation in the previous year, only 39% of their mothers appeared to have been aware that their child had been the victim of bullying.<\/p>  <p>  Experiences of victimisation were upsetting to the majority of children. Almost 90% of children reported that the bullying had caused them upset. Girls were more likely than boys to report feeling very upset as a result of the bullying. <\/p>  <p>  Some 13% of children reported having bullied another in the previous year. Similar proportions of boys and girls reported bullying another. Children who had been  bullied most commonly engaged in bullying through exclusion, followed by verbal bullying and physical bullying.  Boys were more likely to engage in physical and verbal bullying, while girls were more likely to engage in bullying through exclusion.  These patterns also clearly reflect what children reported in terms of victimisation.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Ireland Report 2010 has found that over 24% of 10 to 17 year olds have reported being bullied.

These include figures showing the number of referrals which are disaggregated by welfare concerns and abuse concerns. The most recent validated figures for referrals to hand are up to the third quarter of 2014.  Tusla has stated that, subject to validation, the total of referrals for 2014 shows that there were 43,126 reports of child protection and welfare concerns received by Tusla.  <\/p>  <p>  Not all referrals will result in a need for a social work service or in a child being received into care and approximately 50% can be expected to proceed from preliminary enquiry to the initial assessment stage. The most recent figures for welfare concerns and abuse concerns at the end of third quarter of 2014, showed 14,112 abuse concern referrals and 18,575 welfare concern referrals (to the end of September 2014).  The referrals of a child abuse concern were reported as:  Physical (19%), Emotional (34%), Sexual (17%) and Neglect (30%).  Of these referrals, 55% of abuse concerns and 42% of welfare concerns went forward to the initial assessment stage.  Tusla reported that of the referrals received in the third quarter of 2014, 94% of referrals received a preliminary enquiry and 49% of initial assessments were completed by the end of the quarter.  Assesments can be complex and dynamic, and some consideration needs to be given to the end of quarter figures so that they adequately reflect the work that has been achieved in each case.  <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has provided my Department with monthly figures of the number of children in care for all of 2014.  At the close of 2014, the number of children in care was reported as 6,463 children, of whom 93% were in a foster care setting.  The number of children in care represents 23% of the total of 27,651 open cases reported by Tusla at the end of the year.  Of the total number of open cases at the end of 2014, 19,300 had an allocated social worker and 8,351 were waiting to be allocated a social worker.  The number of cases waiting to be allocated a social worker is an issue that is being addressed by Tusla.  This figure has reduced by over 14% over the full year of 2014.  <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has responsibilities to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection, with regard to the principle that, where possible, it is in the best interests of the child to be brought up in their own family.  Tusla does not have statutory responsibilities for services which may be availed of by children and families in the normal course of events.  Responsibility for policy in relation to the treatment and support for young people with mental health problems, and those requiring medical care as a result of self-harm, rests with the Department of Health.  In relation to homelessness, I informed the House earlier today on how Tusla is engaging on the issue.  The statutory responsibility for the accommodation needs where the family is homeless, and the children are in the care of their parents, is with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Where there are reasonable grounds for concern for a child's welfare and protection, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, should always be informed.  This has been Tusla's responsibility since its establishment in January 2014.  My Department receives regular reports on the number of referrals and the outcomes that result.  In addition to the rigorous governance arrangements with Tusla, my Department also reviews the findings of a number of independent bodies, including the Health Information and Quality Authority inspection reports, reports on child deaths and serious incidents from the independently chaired National Review Panel and also reports from the Ombudsman for Children.  My Department also maintains contact with the non-governmental bodies on issues within the sector, including, for example, the Children's Rights Alliance, and the Irish Foster Care Association.  This is in addition to the day to day monitoring of children who may be at risk or children in care that is carried out by Tusla as part of its responsibilities under the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, and the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500080#WRFF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Juvenile Offenders","counter":1212,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500080#WRFF01375"},{"type":"question","counter":1213,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[14907\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500080#WRFF01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the total number of places of detention currently available to cater for juvenile offenders; the extent of rehabilitative or counselling services available to such offenders while in detention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1214,"content":"<p>The 3 children detention schools, all located at Oberstown, Lusk, Co.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.  There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations.  My Department has notified youth organisations and projects, including Kildare Youth Service, of their 2015 allocations in respect of their youth services. An allocation of &euro;488,200 has been allocated for the projects and services under Kildare Youth Services, which operates under Youth Work Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As in recent years, national organisations along with the grant administering agencies that administer youth funding, on behalf of my Department, were invited where it was appropriate, to submit proposals to my Department for the reconfiguration of the funding allocations notified to them across projects and funding schemes to better meet local needs.  No submission was received in respect of proposals for the youth services in County Kildare. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the challenges that the budgetary constraints raise for the youth services throughout the country.

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and debilitating.<\/p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis is is a notifiable infectious disease, the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form, Lyme neuroborreliosis. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects and collates surveillance data on the condition. 20 cases of of the condition have been provisionally notified in 2014. This number is likely to fall following validation.<\/p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations. Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful examination of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk evaluation. Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques). Testing for Lyme Disease is undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland. In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient. If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Public Health England Porton Down facility which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities. This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test. Because of the general availability of initial screening for Lyme disease in Ireland and the provision of a confirmatory testing service in the UK, there is no need for Irish citizens to travel abroad for testing.<\/p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee. The aim of this Sub-Committee is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland. These strategies will be published in a Final Report. In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency and an Environmental Health Officer. A representative from the Patients' Association is also being sought. The Terms of Reference of the Sub-Committee are:<\/p>  <p>  -  To raise awareness in Ireland of Lyme Borreliosis amongst clinicians and the general public;<\/p>  <p>  -  To identify and highlight best international practice in raising awareness about Lyme Borreliosis for the General Public;<\/p>  <p>  -  To develop policies of primary prevention of Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland based on best international evidence;<\/p>  <p>  -  To explore ways in which to improve surveillance of neuroborreliosis in Ireland;<\/p>  <p>  -  To develop straegies to raise awareness among the public particularly in areas of higher tick populations;<\/p>  <p>  -  To produce a Final Report covering all the above areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Sub-Committee will hold its inaugural meeting on May 6.<\/p>  <p>  Each year the HPSC holds a Lyme Awareness Week.  This involves raising awareness for clinicians and the general public as to the risks of infected biting ticks, protection against tick bites and identifying the disease.  Much use is made of the media to broadcast these messages in addition to the extensive material provided on the HPSC website.  This years Lyme Awareness Week takes place from April 27- May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500082#WRHH00900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Investigations","counter":1275,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500082#WRHH00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1276,"qnumday":465,"qnumall":"[13968\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500082#WRHH01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the second investigation into the tragic loss of a baby (details supplied), and other cases of concern that have taken place in the maternity unit at Cavan General Hospital; when he expects to receive the report; if he will recommit to publish this report on receipt; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This is achieved by putting systems and policies in place to make the school a safe and supportive environment.  <\/p><p>The research evidence also suggests that the aims of suicide prevention in school-aged groups is best met by engaging in programmes which serve to enhance the factors which protect against suicide (e.g. problem solving, good coping skills, communication skills, self-esteem etc) and reduce the risk factors associated with suicide (e.g. depression, anxiety, poor social networks, low self-esteem etc).  The work of schools should be around building resilience so that young people have the skills to deal with adversity when they encounter it.  The Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum taught in post-primary schools has become a vital way to achieve this.  Emotional health is set within the context of the SPHE programme.  <\/p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE are currently finalising a new National Strategic Framework to Reduce Suicide for the period 2015 &ndash; 2020.  The Framework, which is expected to be completed shortly, will seek to broaden the response to suicide risk across the health sector, agencies and Government departments.  In this regard the Department of Health and the National Office for Suicide Prevention are working closely with the Department of Education and Skills to identify actions and outcomes around suicide prevention for the school sector, to be included in the new Framework.<\/p><p>Having regard to the above, I do not intend to provide funding for suicide prevention courses in post primary schools.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500083#WRJJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HIQA Investigations","counter":1312,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500083#WRJJ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":1313,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[14044\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500083#WRJJ00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Information and Quality Authority automatically carry out investigations into care centres, when information emerges that employees have been found guilty of abuse of clients of the care centre, despite having been exonerated in an internal inquiry; and the steps the authority can take in relation to that matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":1314,"qnumday":508,"qnumall":"[14219\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500083#WRJJ01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is satisfied with the manner in which the Health Information and Quality Authority is conducting inquiries into cases of alleged abuse in care homes.

Encouraging more people to join the market at younger ages helps spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, helping to support affordable premiums for all. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of LCR is one of a suite of measures which I announced in November 2014 to address the rising health insurance premiums and stabilise the private health insurance market in the interests of consumers.  Other measures introduced include a reduction in stamp duty, a reduction in the Health Insurance Authority levy and the introduction of 'Young Adult' rates of premium from 1 May 2015, based on a sliding scale of maximum chargeable rates up to age 26.  Young adult rates will ensure the phasing-in of full adult rates and ease the effect of the dramatic price increase experienced when student rates no longer apply.  The package of measures I announced in November also includes key recommendations set out in the two Pat McLoughlin reports on Private Health Insurance costs and builds on Budget 2015 which included a freeze on hospital bed charges and no decrease in the relievable amount for tax relief purposes.  Taken together, these measures are intended to help control premium inflation and to create a sustainable market where health insurance is affordable for as many people as possible.<\/p>  <p>  There are a broad range of plans available in the health insurance market, providing varying levels of cover from basic to comprehensive level.  This facilitates consumer choice when purchasing health insurance and consumers should actively seek out plans which offer the most suitable level of cover, and which provide the greatest value for money, for their individual needs.  I would encourage individuals to carefully review their private health insurance requirements when taking out, or renewing, a health insurance contract.  Many customers can make savings on their health insurance premiums by reviewing the level of cover required to meet their needs.

The HSE remains committed to working with all voluntary disability service providers to ensure that all of the resources available for specialist disability services, including respite services, are used in the most efficient and effective manner possible.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Social Care Operational Plan for 2015 aims to provide 190,000 overnight stays in centre-based respite services to almost 5,300 people.

","asker":"1192","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1419,"content":"<p>Counselling is provided across the health service, by both the HSE and the voluntary sector including primary care, social care and within mental health.  This type of service can be provided by a range of trained health professionals and delivered to meet a clinical need at either primary or secondary care level.<\/p>  <p>  The Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) service is a national service funded from the Programme for Government investment in Mental Health, to increase the access to counselling and psychotherapy and supplementing existing services provided by Primary Care.  Since 2012, &euro;7.5 million has been provided to develop the CIPC service.  The service provides short term counselling for adults with non-complex psychological problems aged 18 years and over and who hold a valid medical card.  Every effort is made to see people as quickly as possible, however there are a number of people waiting extended periods many of whom will have specific requirements, for example can only attend on a specific day or time or may wish to be seen in a particular area.  In some areas, there is a particular difficulty accessing accommodation in which to see clients, which in turn impacts on waiting times.  This is an issue in some of the smaller rural areas and one that the HSE is working to resolve.<\/p>  <p>  Within the specialist secondary care mental health service counselling and psychotherapy is provided within community mental health teams when service users are clinically assessed as requiring this intervention and is provided by a health professional on the team.  Counselling is also provided by a range of voluntary organisations across the health service and HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention funds voluntary organisations such as Pieta House and Console to provide support across a range of needs.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of a quality counselling service across both primary and secondary care will be developed further, as resources permit.  In the first instance however, the HSE Mental Health Division must ensure that the funding currently allocated to CIPC is being used to best effect, to deliver the best outcomes.  In this regard, I note the commitment in the HSE National Service Plan for 2015 to &ldquo;Reviewing and improving access to psychotherapy and psychotherapeutic interventions in conjunction with the Primary Care Division&rdquo; as a first step to further consolidate and direct counselling services generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500085#WRLL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1420,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500085#WRLL02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1421,"qnumday":514,"qnumall":"[14229\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500085#WRLL03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of hospitals where Ketogenic treatment is available; the waiting lists for such treatment at such hospitals; the number of patients who have received such treatment at such hospitals over the past three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1422,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The HSE introduced an embargo on recruitment in 2007, and this was followed by the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public sector in 2008. Notwithstanding that the HSE has had the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to deliver front-line services. This is reflected in the current recruitment campaign where the HSE is actively recruiting to fill consultant, NCHD and nursing posts.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in budget 2015 that he intends to delegate greater autonomy to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels.

As at the end of January 2015, of the 416 approved posts in 2012, approximately 96% (401.5) are now filled.  Of the 477 posts approved in 2013, 84% (403) are filled.  The remainder of the vacant posts are at various stages of recruitment, with some difficulties in identifying some outstanding candidates, primarily for geographic and qualification reasons.

Progress also includes the establishment of the HSE Mental Health Division which delivers on a key recommendation of <i>Vision<\/i>, the development of child and adolescent services, shorter episodes of in-patient care, the adoption of a recovery approach in the delivery of services and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery.<\/p><p>Implementation of <i>Vision<\/i>is ongoing.

The additional &euro;35 million provided for mental health in Budget 2015 will be directed towards the continued prioritised development and reconfiguration of General Adult teams, including Psychiatry of Later Life, and Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health teams.  This will be delivered through further recruitment and investment in agencies and services in order to achieve a consistent service provision across all areas.  In addition, the funding will also permit urgent specialist needs to be addressed, including psychiatric intensive care, forensic mental health, mental health intellectual disability care, and psychiatric liaison services.

These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the <i>Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy<\/i>, 2012.  The General Scheme of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill was approved by Government on the 3 February 2015.  The Scheme includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, health labelling on products that contain alcohol, restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol and the regulation of sports sponsorship.  As part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the measures are being debated in detail by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  The hearings commenced on the 10 March and are due to conclude next week.<\/p><p>The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will make it illegal to sell or advertise for sale alcohol at a price below a set minimum price.  Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) sets a minimum price per gram of alcohol.  The minimum price of an alcohol product would be based on the number of grams of alcohol in the product.  MUP is a targeted measure, aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner, and designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  MUP is able to target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the minimum price is determined by and is directly proportional to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink.<\/p><p>The University of Sheffield study reported that the alcohol products most affected by this policy are those that are currently being sold very cheaply, often below cost prices, in the off-trade, i.e. supermarkets and off-licences.  On the other hand, the study found that a ban on below-cost selling (implemented as a ban on selling alcohol for below the cost of duty and Value Added Tax) would have a negligible impact on alcohol consumption or related harms.<\/p><p>The Public (Health) Alcohol Bill will also make it illegal to market or advertise alcohol in a manner that is appealing to children.  It provides for the making of regulations regarding the marketing and advertising of alcohol and includes provisions, inter alia, for restrictions on broadcast marketing and advertising, cinema advertising, outdoor advertising, print media and the regulation of sponsorship by alcohol companies.  The existing <i>Code of Practice for Sponsorships by Drinks Companies <\/i>will be put on a legal footing with statutory powers and penalties.  The provisions in relation to marketing and advertising will be reviewed after three years to gauge their effectiveness.<\/p><p>The Department of Health is continuing to work on the preparation of the legislation.  It is expected that the Bill will be published during this session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500089#WRPP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Autism Support Services","counter":1564,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500089#WRPP01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1565,"qnumday":564,"qnumall":"[14442\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500089#WRPP01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of Health Service Executive regional specialist autism spectrum disorder teams; the location of each team; the areas they cover; if he will provide a list of the clinical and administrative staff typically employed by the executive for each team; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"978","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1566,"content":"<p>As this question concerns detailed operational matters, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct response to the Deputy.

The Strategy is accompanied by a National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme co-funded by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies.  It includes the provision of intensive home care packages, an information campaign and resources for GPs, who are most often the first port of call for people worried about dementia.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy acknowledges that while current health and social policy is focussed on caring for people with dementia in their own homes, there will come a time for many when home care may no longer be feasible or appropriate and when long-term residential care will be the best option.  This can particularly arise when 24-hour care is needed or when the person with dementia is living alone.  There is clearly a case for dementia-specific facilities as dementia is sometimes accompanied by behavioural and psychological symptoms such as agitation, aggression, disinhibition, wandering and sleep disturbance and these can occur at any stage of the illness.  These behaviours can pose significant challenges for staff and other patients and can be dangerous and distressing for the person with dementia, and a specialist facility is sometimes necessary. <\/p>  <p>  The Nursing Home Support Scheme is a system of financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care.

A continuum of more efficient care might serve to reduce the number of people requiring nursing home care and limit the projected increase in the cost of the Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The draft Review requires further analysis and this is ongoing at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500090#WRQQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":1601,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500090#WRQQ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1602,"qnumday":578,"qnumall":"[14529\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500090#WRQQ00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to address the issue of cover\u00a0replacements\u00a0for home helpers taking holidays; if the Health Service Executive will be provided with a budget to cover this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1603,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on the matter.

There are currently 63 teams in place, which are being reconfigured and expanded, in line with the key priorities in the HSE National Service Plan 2015, and supported from the additional investment for Mental Health Services put in place since 2012.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE waiting list for CAMHS, at February 2015, indicates an overall figure of approximately 3,000 children, of which some 400 are waiting in excess of 12 months.  A significant number of children are seen in accordance with targets agreed in the HSE Service Plan for this year.  A significant proportion of children on the waiting list are waiting less than three months to be seen.  In January 2015, 74 % of children referred were offered an appointment and seen within three months, against the national target of 72%.<\/p>  <p>  It is unacceptable for a child or adolescent to wait longer than 12 months to be seen by a CAMHS team.  Direct engagement takes place between the HSE Mental Health Division and all Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) on a monthly basis in relation to their performance against agreed performance metrics, including children waiting over one year to be seen.  As part of the National CAMHS Service Improvement Project, detailed work has already commenced with CHOs both to review issues affecting performance, and to prepare for the implementation of Standard Operating Procedures for CAMHS.<\/p>  <p>  A targeted approach to addressing child\/adolescents on the CAMHS waiting list within the Mental Health Division has also been initiated.  All  CAMHS Teams have been requested to review lists of children and revert with the contributory factors identified to include detailed action plans agreed to address the lists for each team. <\/p>  <p>  CAMHS teams rate the number of complex cases, the number of emergency cases, and the lack of other services in an area as factors having the greatest impact on capacity to respond to demand.  This can in turn lead to less discharges, increased numbers on waiting lists, and longer waiting times for routine assessments.  Successive CAMHS reports over a number of years have referred to the many factors that can affect the capacity of a team to respond to the demands placed on it, including referral numbers, administrative\/skills mix back-up supports, collaboration with other services such as primary care, TUSLA or school services, and emergency or complex cases arising at particular times.<\/p>  <p>  The collaborative measures referred to by the Deputy are the operational responsibility of front-line agencies delivering children's services.  This includes CAMHS working with at-risk children accessing mental health services, and who are also known to TUSLA and the juvenile justice system. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is currently working in partnership with TUSLA, and co-sponsoring research with  NUI Maynooth which is aimed at developing innovative research, building capacity and promoting interagency integration, with a view to developing family-focused mental health services.  A CAMHS Community Forensic Team is being developed in 2015 to work with at-risk children accessing mental health services who are known to TUSLA and the juvenile justice systems.  This Team will be a precursor to the new 10 bed CAMHS Forensic Inpatient facility being developed as part of the new National Forensic Mental Health Hospital in Portrane, due for completion in 2018.  The Team will operate at a national level, liaising with TUSLA and supporting CAMHS nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is actively engaged with the HSE in relation to monitoring and enhancing all aspects of CAMHS provision over the remainder of this year, as part of the Department's oversight role on the HSE National Service Plan 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500092#WRSS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Applications","counter":1673,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500092#WRSS00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1674,"qnumday":604,"qnumall":"[14663\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500092#WRSS00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite an application for a new hearing aid in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1675,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The protective role of breastfeeding extends beyond childhood and is important in the prevention of obesity and chronic diseases in adulthood, including hypertension and diabetes.<\/p><p>A key goal of the Strategic Action Plan is that all families have the knowledge, skills and support to make and carry out informed infant feeding decisions, particularly those least likely to breastfeed.<\/p><p>To achieve this the HSE has a National Breastfeeding Co-ordinator and a multi-disciplinary National Breastfeeding Strategy Implementation Committee oversees the implementation of breastfeeding strategy and initiatives.  The National Breastfeeding Strategy Implementation Committee have helped facilitate initiatives such as, evidence based breastfeeding policies implemented across the HSE; improvements in breastfeeding education and training; development of breastfeeding education resources; development of guidelines on supporting and protecting breastfeeding in public places; and the protection of breastfeeding through changes in maternity protection legislation and workplace initiatives.<\/p><p>Staff within HSE maternity and paediatric services and primary care are committed to the promotion, support and protection of breastfeeding.  The HSE Infant Feeding Policy for Maternity and Neonatal Services is based on the <i>Baby Friendly 10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding<\/i>and is the policy of all 19 maternity units.  All 19 maternity units participate in the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative and there are 8 designated Baby Friendly Hospitals.  Breastfeeding is promoted to all expectant mothers in the antenatal period at maternity hospitals and in primary care.  Mothers are offered support to breastfeed following birth.  Care is provided by public health nurses in the community following discharge from maternity hospital and individualised care plans are developed for mothers.  Over 200 breastfeeding support groups are provided by the HSE and HSE funded voluntary breastfeeding organisations around the country. <\/p><p>The HSE launched the first phase of its national breastfeeding campaign <b>&lsquo;<\/b><i>Every Breastfeed Baby Makes a Difference&rsquo;<\/i>and promotes an annual National Breastfeeding Week.<\/p><p>The HSE website is the primary route for providing information, advice and support to women thinking about breastfeeding and those who are breastfeeding.

It forms part of the HSE Healthy Pregnancy Pack which is distributed widely through maternity hospitals and GPs and over 80,000 are distributed annually.  <\/p><p>A recent review of the Breastfeeding Strategic Action Plan has highlighted supports being implemented.  These include policies to guide good practice and monitoring within HSE maternity services; enhancements in training for public health nurses and midwives; the expansion of appropriately trained community-led peer support programmes; the development of media messages to promote breastfeeding; and the development readily available information including the national breastfeeding website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500092#WRSS01900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Assisted Human Reproduction","counter":1691,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500092#WRSS01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1692,"qnumday":610,"qnumall":"[13289\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500092#WRSS02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the constitutional protections currently in place for in vitro embryonic human life; the proposals in place to alter such protections; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I wish to clarify that LCR relates solely to the current health insurance market, in which context the purchase of health insurance is optional, and the measure should not be misinterpreted as a form of compulsory insurance.<\/p>  <p>  LCR is being introduced to encourage people to take out private health insurance at a younger age.  Encouraging more people to join the market at younger ages helps spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, helping to support affordable premiums for all.  The regulations provide for a grace period up until 30 April 2015, during which time as many people as want to can take out health insurance without incurring loadings.  From 1 May 2015, late entry loadings will be applied to those who join the private health insurance market at age 35 or over, set at 2% per year for each year over the age of 34, up to a maximum loading of 70% at age 69 and over.  If an individual is resident in the State during the grace period, but chooses to wait and to take out health insurance at a date later than 30 April 2015, then the individual may incur a loading on their premium (depending on the specific circumstances regarding age and periods of previous health insurance cover).  Individuals are therefore encouraged to join the market at younger ages, and in doing so, will help spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, helping to support affordable premiums for all. <\/p>  <p>  There are exemptions available for people who previously had health insurance but cancelled it.  A credited period can apply for any periods of inpatient cover when a full adult premium is paid in respect of anyone, including spouses and dependant students.  In addition, a credited period (in total not exceeding 3 years) is also available for individuals who previously had health insurance but relinquished cover since 1 January 2008 due to unemployment.

The urgent need to address these issues was stressed, particularly for 999\/112 call-taking and ambulance dispatch, as well as overall clinical governance.  Following discussions, the HSE and Dublin City Council agreed in principle that all 999\/112 ambulance calls for the Dublin region, and the tasking and dispatching of DFB and NAS ambulances, will be from a single centre, the new National Emergency Operations Centre in Tallaght.

More than 200,000 people have lost their lives, and there are now over 12 million people in need of life-saving support within Syria.  Due to the violence and the lack of access to aid, 3.8 million people have left Syria for neighbouring countries.<\/p>  <p>  I am very concerned by reports of the suffering of the remaining population of the Yarmouk camp on the outskirts of Damascus.  I condemn the attack on the camp by ISIS and the use of so-call barrel-bombs against the camp by regime forces.  I call on all parties to cease armed activity in this camp, which is home to thousands of already-displaced Palestinians.  There are approximately 18,000 civilians remaining in Yarmouk camp, 3,500 of them children.  Most of the 200,000 people who used to live there have fled in the last three years, largely due to the prolonged siege of the camp by Assad regime forces.  Ireland calls on all parties to provide unhindered humanitarian access to those in need, both in Yarmouk and elsewhere in Syria.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most difficult features of the Syria conflict is that many of those who are most in need are beyond the reach of humanitarian aid, or are able to receive it only sporadically.  Insecurity and bureaucratic restrictions have hampered aid delivery both in areas controlled by the Syrian Government and in opposition-held areas.  The deliberate targeting of humanitarian workers by ISIS makes it particularly difficult to reach those in areas it controls.  Ireland has consistently advocated for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access and respect by all parties for International Humanitarian Law.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is one of the most generous international contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis and has provided over &euro;32 million in humanitarian support to Syria since 2011, through UN partners and NGOs.  At the UN Pledging Conference for Syria, which took place in Kuwait on 31 March, Ireland announced a pledge of &euro;12 million for 2015.  This is in addition to our core funding to many of the organisations which are responding to the crisis, including UN agencies and the Red Cross.  In addition, several members of Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps have served with UN agencies working on the Syria response.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister of State Sherlock specifically raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about Yarmouk with the Commissioner General of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) when they met on 31 March at Syria Pledging Conference.  The lack of consistent access to the camp for UNRWA in recent months was already a serious matter of humanitarian concern, even before the current attack.  Irish Aid provides core funding of &euro;4 million to UNRWA annually, with &euro;1m of this earmarked for UNRWA&rsquo;s activities in Lebanon.  In 2014, in recognition of the impact of the Syria refugee crisis, Ireland provided an additional &euro;1 million to UNRWA for its emergency work in Lebanon.<\/p>  <p>  While the immediate imperative is to respond to the escalating humanitarian needs on the ground, humanitarian assistance will not provide a lasting solution to this crisis.  Ultimately, what the people of Syria need is an end to the conflict and the prospect of a peaceful future.  It is therefore vital that we persevere with international efforts to find a sustainable political solution to the crisis in Syria and the wider region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500096#WRWW01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diaspora Policy","counter":1849,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500096#WRWW01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1850,"qnumday":667,"qnumall":"[14951\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500096#WRWW01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has held discussions with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport following his decision to cancel the proposed plan to create a national diaspora centre here; the way this decision will affect the diaspora policy, as outlined in the Global Irish document; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In taking this decision, I have been guided by the advice of the NCSE Working Group report, which recommended sufficient time be allowed for consultation before the new model is implemented.  Through consultations, there was a broad welcome for the proposed new model from Parents, disability groups, schools and stakeholders. However, there has not been sufficient time to address all of the concerns which have been raised in advance of the 2015 school year.<\/p><p>  In the context of the recent announcement that the proposed new model for allocating resource teachers to schools will not now be introduced from September 2015, I agreed to review the particular position in relation to educational provision for children with Down syndrome in mainstream schools.

Some confusion may have arisen on this point and I would like to take the opportunity to clarify matters for the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  In the first instance it is important to explain the historical context in which the current patronage system has evolved and the arrangements whereby there is associated school property ownership by religious patrons.<\/p>  <p>  The historical and societal development of primary education provision in Ireland has resulted in the current school patronage system which is of a predominantly denominational nature. For many years, religious orders and local parishes were centrally involved in establishing and running schools in Ireland, leading to the majority of primary schools being under religious patronage. <\/p>  <p>  There are in excess of 3,000 primary schools. Many of these are long-established and pre-date the foundation of the State. Most of our schools were founded on the initiative of a local patron, generally one of the main established churches (Catholic or Church of Ireland).  Historically, the patron provided the site for the school and also contributed to the cost of building and running schools. The vast majority of primary schools are thus privately owned i.e. the site\/building is owned by the relevant school patron.<\/p>  <p>  Where state monies were provided to facilitate building works to school property owned by a third party, a legal mechanism had to be put in place in order to protect the State's interest. This was known as a Charging Lease or Declaration of Trust.  These leases protect the Minister's capital investment in the school property and require that the property be used as a school for a set period. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to clarify and to point out that there is no planned change to the status of primary schools. The ethos of a school is determined by the Patron. A Board of Management manages the school on behalf of the Patron. Section 15 (2) (b) of the Education Act, 1998 makes it clear that one of the duties of the Board of Management is to uphold the ethos of the school and to be accountable to the patron for doing so.  That applies to any school (denominational or multi-denominational). <\/p>  <p>  The arrangements referred to, in terms of agreement to put in place a Deed of Variation, which provide for a variation on the original terms of Charging Leases or Declarations of Trust, date back to the 1990s. As a result of negotiations in the late 1990s on the reconstitution of Boards of Management, an agreement was reached whereby patrons agreed to cede representatives on the Boards of Management in lieu of the Department agreeing to insert a Deed of Variation into the existing property lease. The objective of this Deed of Variation is to provide security for the denominational ethos of a school in cases where a patron or trustee owns the property. Discussions have taken place with the relevant patron bodies over the years to obtain a mutually acceptable solution which meets this objective and these discussions are ongoing. <\/p>  <p>  Irish schools are catering for a significantly more diverse population nowadays than the population that they traditionally served. Many schools have made significant efforts to welcome this more diverse population. There has been a positive contribution by patrons, school management and teachers to welcoming pupils including those from different cultural and belief backgrounds.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to admission policies, irrespective of property or Charging Lease arrangements, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. <\/p>  <p>  The Equality legislation provides that any primary or post primary school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students. The legislation also provides that such a school can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school. <\/p>  <p>  The objective of the recently published Education (Admission to Schools) Bill is to provide an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500099#WRZZ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":1970,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500099#WRZZ02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1971,"qnumday":707,"qnumall":"[14314\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500099#WRZZ02500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress to date in design work for the provision of a new school in the case of a school (details supplied) in Dublin 1; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1972,"content":"<p>A major building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of Architectural Planning, Stage 1 (Preliminary Design).

Some confusion may have arisen on this point and I would like to take the opportunity to clarify matters for the Deputy. <\/p>  <p>  In the first instance it is important to explain the historical context in which the current patronage system has evolved and the arrangements whereby there is associated school property ownership by religious patrons. The historical and societal development of primary education provision in Ireland has resulted in the current school patronage system which is of a predominantly denominational nature. For many years, religious orders and local parishes were centrally involved in establishing and running schools in Ireland, leading to the majority of primary schools being under religious patronage.<\/p>  <p>  There are in excess of 3,000 primary schools. Many of these are long-established and pre-date the foundation of the State. Most of our schools were founded on the initiative of a local patron, generally one of the main established churches (Catholic or Church of Ireland).  Historically, the patron provided the site for the school and also contributed to the cost of building and running schools. The vast majority of primary schools are thus privately owned i.e. the site\/building is owned by the relevant school patron.<\/p>  <p>  Where state monies were provided to facilitate building works to school property owned by a third party, a legal mechanism had to be put in place in order to protect the State's interest. This was known as a Charging Lease or Declaration of Trust.  These leases protect the Minister's capital investment in the school property and require that the property be used as a school for a set period.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to clarify and to point out that there is no planned change to the status of primary schools. The ethos of a school is determined by the Patron. A Board of Management manages the school on behalf of the Patron. Section 15 (2) (b) of the Education Act, 1998 makes it clear that one of the duties of the Board of Management is to uphold the ethos of the school and to be accountable to the patron for doing so.  That applies to any school (denominational or multi-denominational).<\/p>  <p>  The arrangements referred to, in terms of agreement to put in place a Deed of Variation, which provide for a variation on the original terms of Charging Leases or Declarations of Trust, date back to the 1990s. As a result of negotiations in the late 1990s on the reconstitution of Boards of Management, an agreement was reached whereby patrons agreed to cede representatives on the Boards of Management in lieu of the Department agreeing to insert a Deed of Variation into the existing property lease. The objective of this Deed of Variation is to provide security for the denominational ethos of a school in cases where a patron or trustee owns the property. Discussions have taken place with the relevant patron bodies over the years to obtain a mutually acceptable solution which meets this objective and these discussions are ongoing. <\/p>  <p>  Irish schools are catering for a significantly more diverse population nowadays than the population that they traditionally served. Many schools have made significant efforts to welcome this more diverse population. There has been a positive contribution by patrons, school management and teachers to welcoming pupils including those from different cultural and belief backgrounds.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to admission policies, irrespective of property or Charging Lease arrangements, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.<\/p>  <p>  The Equality legislation provides that any primary or post primary school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students. The legislation also provides that such a school can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of the recently published Education (Admission to Schools) Bill is to provide an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500100#WRAAA03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Universal Support Ireland Administration","counter":2023,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500100#WRAAA03800"},{"type":"question","counter":2024,"qnumday":725,"qnumall":"[14763\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500100#WRAAA03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Mayo was initially informed that the person would receive the special rate of student grant, only to have this offer withdrawn one month later; her views on the fairness of this matter; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":2025,"content":"<p>As part of a comprehensive customer service and communications strategy provided by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI), to ensure that all necessary avenues are open to applicants to receive the information they need, a dedicated email and phone line service is provided by SUSI for Oireachtas members.

Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs and the Department does not stipulate how secretarial services are to be obtained.  Where a school uses the grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged.  These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, a forum was established under the Towards 2016 Agreement involving my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, IMPACT and SIPTU to examine the factual position in schools regarding the terms and conditions of employment of secretaries (and caretakers) employed using grant funding.  However, it was not possible to progress the forum's agenda beyond the initial fact finding survey, due to the State's budgetary and financial position.  It was agreed that the forum would consider appropriate measures in relation to the rates of pay of school secretaries and caretakers in the event that a review of the Public Service Agreements recommended changes to the benefit of those public servants earning &euro;35,000 or less per annum.  This is currently the priority for the Forum and discussions are ongoing.  Secretaries employed by schools using grant funding are not regarded as public servants except for the purposes of the pay reduction under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No.2) Act 2009, due to the definition of \"public servant\" used in that Act.

Some confusion may have arisen on this point and I would like to take the opportunity to clarify matters for the Deputy.<\/p><p>In the first instance it is important to explain the historical context in which the current patronage system has evolved and the arrangements whereby there is associated school property ownership by religious patrons.  The historical and societal development of primary education provision in Ireland has resulted in the current school patronage system which is of a predominantly denominational nature.  For many years, religious orders and local parishes were centrally involved in establishing and running schools in Ireland, leading to the majority of primary schools being under religious patronage.<\/p><p>There are in excess of 3,000 primary schools.  Many of these are long-established and pre-date the foundation of the State.  Most of our schools were founded on the initiative of a local patron, generally one of the main established churches (Catholic or Church of Ireland).  Historically, the patron provided the site for the school and also contributed to the cost of building and running schools.  The vast majority of primary schools are thus privately owned i.e. the site\/building is owned by the relevant school patron.<\/p><p>Where state monies were provided to facilitate building works to school property owned by a third party, a legal mechanism had to be put in place in order to protect the State's interest.  This was known as a Charging Lease or Declaration of Trust.  These leases protect the Minister's capital investment in the school property and require that the property be used as a school for a set period.  <\/p><p>It is important to clarify and to point out that there is no planned change to the status of primary schools.  The ethos of a school is determined by the Patron.  A Board of Management manages the school on behalf of the Patron.  Section 15 (2) (b) of the Education Act, 1998 makes it clear that one of the duties of the Board of Management is to uphold the ethos of the school and to be accountable to the patron for doing so.  That applies to any school (denominational or multi-denominational).<\/p><p>The arrangements referred to, in terms of agreement to put in place a Deed of Variation, which provide for a variation on the original terms of Charging Leases or Declarations of Trust, date back to the 1990s.  As a result of negotiations in the late 1990s on the reconstitution of Boards of Management, an agreement was reached whereby patrons agreed to cede representatives on the Boards of Management in lieu of the Department agreeing to insert a Deed of Variation into the existing property lease.  The objective of this Deed of Variation is to provide security for the denominational ethos of a school in cases where a patron or trustee owns the property.  Discussions have taken place with the relevant patron bodies over the years to obtain a mutually acceptable solution which meets this objective and these discussions are ongoing.<\/p><p>Irish schools are catering for a significantly more diverse population nowadays than the population that they traditionally served.  Many schools have made significant efforts to welcome this more diverse population.  There has been a positive contribution by patrons, school management and teachers to welcoming pupils including those from different cultural and belief backgrounds.<\/p><p>With regard to admission policies, irrespective of property or Charging Lease arrangements, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.<\/p><p>The Equality legislation provides that any primary or post primary school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.  The legislation also provides that such a school can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.<\/p><p>The objective of the recently published Education (Admission to Schools) Bill is to provide an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent.<\/p><p>The Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation.  However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500101#WRBBB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":2066,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500101#WRBBB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":2067,"qnumday":739,"qnumall":"[14886\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500101#WRBBB03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the report on researching the policies and practices in other jurisdictions such as Wales and the Catalan region in Spain, that are comparable socio-lingusitically to Gaeltacht areas, as identified in the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010 to 2030.","asker":"1110","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":2068,"content":"<p>The Department of Education and Skills commenced a review of Gaeltacht education in 2014, as part of the Department's commitment to the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010 - 2030 and to the implementation of the Gaeltacht Act 2012.<\/p>  <p>  Four reports, including the one referred to in your question which considers the international perspective, were commissioned to inform the review.

The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.

The review is designed to rationalise the funding of these organisations to ensure efficiency in the use of public money and avoidance of duplication, while providing appropriate support to organisations working in the sector.

However, the Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) review published by my Department last year concluded that the system is not functioning as intended, with a lack of basic information, poor structure, poor environmental outcomes in the form of large stockpiles of waste tyres and somewhere between 24% - 50% of waste tyres unaccounted for. The report also identified significant non-compliance among those with responsibilities under the current Waste Tyre Regulations.  To address these deficiencies, I recently announced a Producer Responsibility Scheme for tyres which will comprise the following main features:<\/p><p>-A single compliance scheme for end-of-life tyres to be operated by Repak,<\/p><p>-The ending of the option for producers to &ldquo;self-comply&rdquo; under the Regulations,<\/p><p>-Formalisation of the existing recycling charge into a visible environmental management charge,<\/p><p>-The level of this visible environmental charge would be set by my Department and reviewed in two years,<\/p><p>-As part of the detailed design of the scheme, consideration by my Department, in consultation with the tyres and waste industry, as to whether the funding model is predicated upon a front-loaded or back-loaded model,<\/p><p>-A full audit and registration and reporting component (&lsquo;black box&rsquo;) with a role for the WEEE Register Society, and<\/p><p>-An underpinning of the new regime, including enforcement and compliance measures, by a robust legislative base, including fixed penalty notices for certain breaches. <\/p><p>After almost a year of discussions with representatives of all sectors of the tyre industry in Ireland, I believe that my decision to introduce a full producer responsibility initiative in this waste stream is the appropriate response to the very serious problems which were identified in the sector by the PRI Review on Tyres and Waste Tyres.  The problems identified require an overhaul of existing structures, but I consider that this can be achieved without distorting the tyres market in Ireland, without encouraging customers to buy tyres outside of the jurisdiction and without widespread job losses.  Furthermore, moving to a single producer responsibility scheme for tyres should not increase the cost of disposal of used tyres, nor should it lead to an increase in the level of illegal dumping of tyres. Indeed, under the new arrangements, I expect to see a reduction in the current level of illegal dumping and in the costs borne by local authorities for the remediation of stockpiles of illegally dumped tyres. <\/p><p>My Department is continuing to work with the tyre sector to agree on the precise details of how the Tyres PRI will work. In order to bring additional focus to this work and the concerns which industry have raised, the Tyres Working Group, the industry stakeholder group working with my Department, recently decided to establish five sub-groups to examine and develop an approach and solutions on certain key issues. These five sub-groups are as follows;<\/p><p>-distance sellers and treatment of information,<\/p><p>-registration and reporting of producers,<\/p><p>-transitional arrangements,<\/p><p>-the financial model, and<\/p><p>-enforcement.<\/p><p>These sub-groups held their first meeting earlier this month and a number of further meetings have been arranged during April.  The sub-groups will submit proposals for consideration by the main Tyres Working Group at its next meeting in May.

The recent <i>Building Regulations (Part E Amendment) Regulations 2014<\/i>and the accompanying <i>Technical Guidance Document E - Sound<\/i>(2014), which come into effect on 1 July 2015, establish new performance standards to improve the overall sound insulation performance of dwellings and introduce a completion testing regime on a proportion of all new dwellings in a development to ensure these new minimum standards are achieved in practice . Furthermore, specific measures have been introduced to mitigate the build-up of reverberant sound in the common access areas in apartment blocks, which will also contribute to improved occupant comfort .<\/p><p>Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations sets out the minimum statutory requirements in relation to the thermal performance of buildings. The current <i>Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2011<\/i>and the accompanying <i>Technical Guidance Document L &ndash; Conservation of Fuel and Energy &ndash; Dwellings<\/i>(2011), which came into effect on 1 December 2011, introduced a 60% aggregate improvement (relative to 2005 standards) in both the energy and carbon performance of new dwellings (including apartments) and marked an important step on the road to nearly zero energy buildings which is required by 31 December 2020 under Directive 2010\/31\/EU on the energy performance of buildings. Part L requires that space and water heating systems should be energy efficient, with efficient heat sources and effective controls . More specifically, the regulations require that oil or gas fired boilers achieve a seasonal efficiency of 90% while the guidance provided in respect of biomass boilers is that the seasonal efficiency should be not less than 77%. It is envisaged that further thermal efficiency improvements will be introduced under Part L to meet our obligations under Directive 2010\/31\/EU in advance of the end 2020 deadline.<\/p><p>My Department has produced design guidelines in the form of <i>Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities<\/i>(2007)for the use of all involved in the provision of housing, including architects, urban designers, engineers, planners, quantity surveyors, developers, practitioners and housing authorities.  These guidelines identify the principles and criteria that are important in the design of housing in order to facilitate the delivery of better homes, better neighbourhoods and better urban spaces.  Appropriate guidance is already provided on space requirements and room sizes in both dwellings and apartments to facilitate the provision of good quality living environments for occupants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500105#WRFFF04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Lending","counter":2244,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500106#WRGGG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2245,"qnumday":797,"qnumall":"[14538\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041500106#WRGGG00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"in relation to the new limits for mortgages for residential dwelling units, if he will outline the limits for new mortgages for first-time buyers and for those trading up; if he will indicate the rationale for two categories; the exceptions which are allowed for those who previously had a mortgage, but wish to be classified as a first-time buyer; if owner occupiers who purchased homes at a location (details supplied) in Dublin 13 and lost their savings and-or deposits in that development have been refused the classification of the first-time buyer, as regards higher mortgages; in view of the difficulties experienced in this case, if he will instruct that previous owners of homes at the location be treated as first-time buyers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This is in line with Government policy to ensure that local government is well positioned to support the effective and efficient delivery of local and rural development. In this context, &euro;220 million of the overall programme complement for the 2014-2020 period has been allocated based on administrative or county boundaries to 28 sub-regional areas. <\/p><p>It should be noted that LEADER funding for the 2007-2013 programming period was not allocated on the basis of county boundaries but to individual Local Action Groups on completion of the Local Development Strategy process. In addition, the allocations were amended in 2012, following a change to the EU co-financing rate arising from the financial crisis. This resulted in a decrease in the overall programme allocation. <\/p><p>Both Carlow and Kilkenny were each serviced by a single Local Development Company for the LEADER elements of the RDP 2007-2013. The table below details the allocations, original and revised, to both companies for that programme period. The table also sets out the allocation for each county for the 2014-2020 programme period.

Each county was given a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to ensure that each received a viable level of funding. However, Cork County was allocated &euro;6 million as a minimum in order to ensure a viable allocation to each of the three administrative districts within the county, as the overall population outside of the city is almost twice that of any other county. <\/p><p>While a specific cost benefit analysis was not conducted, the methodology used to calculate the allocations was designed to ensure that the available funding was weighted towards the most rural populations and those experiencing most rural disadvantage. Using this methodology, which I am satisfied is fair and consistent, each county was allocated a proportionate share of the funding available through the LEADER elements of the RDP 2014-2020.<\/p><p>As the value of the LEADER element of 2014-2020 Programme is less than the LEADER element of the 2007-2013 Programme, the allocations made on a county basis under the new Programme, including the allocation for Carlow and Kilkenny, have inevitably reduced.

The 2004 Act provides that rents may not be greater than the open market rate and may only be reviewed upward or downward once a year unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review.  Tenants must be given 28 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) where they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent.  These provisions have effect notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a lease or tenancy agreement. The PRTB, as an independent statutory body, will adjudicate each dispute on its own facts and merits, and may grant redress and give specific direction as appropriate on foot of a determination.  In May 2013, the PRTB launched a national rent index available at .  Compiled by the ESRI and based on the PRTB&rsquo;s own register of over 300,000 tenancies, this valuable source of information indicates the actual rents being paid for rented properties throughout the State.  The rent index is updated quarterly and shows the percentage change in rents over the previous quarter and over the previous twelve months.<\/p><p>Section 86(1) of the 2004 Act provides that pending the determination of a dispute that has been referred to the Board, the rent payable under the tenancy continues to be payable and, if the dispute relates to the amount of rent payable, no increase in the amount of the rent may be made.  This does not apply if, where awaiting the outcome of the dispute case, the parties agree to payment of the rent being suspended or if they agree to an increase in the amount of the rent being made. Subject to section 86(2), section 86(1) also provides that a termination of the tenancy concerned may not be effected pending the determination of a dispute. <\/p><p>Security of tenure under the 2004 Act is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles.  Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period.  This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.  Landlords and tenants may not contract out of any of the provisions of Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act and no lease, tenancy agreement, contract or other agreement may operate to vary or modify the provisions of Part 4 of the Act.  <\/p><p>A landlord may not serve a notice of termination except in very clearly defined circumstances set out in the Act, such as a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations in relation to the tenancy.  Notice periods for the termination of a tenancy by the landlord vary depending on the duration of the tenancy but periods of up to 112 days are provided for under section 66 of the Act.  Where there is a dispute regarding the appropriate period of notice to be given in respect of a tenancy or the validity of a notice of termination, or where the tenant does not comply with the notice of termination, the dispute may be referred to the PRTB for resolution.<\/p><p>According to the PRTB Annual Report for 2013, adjudication processing times were an average of 7 months in 2013 compared to 12 months in 2012.For 2014, I understand adjudications were taking an average of 5 to 6 months to process.

The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is statutorily responsible for all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and\/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002. I have no statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.<\/p>  <p>  The CER, in 2006, approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network. In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be met as a prerequisite. The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs. This is designed to obviate against uneconomic projects which would increase costs for all gas consumers. The policy framework allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 2006 network connections policy, which included a review of the feasibility of connecting towns to the natural gas network in Galway\/Mayo, the CER made the decision to allow the network to be extended to eleven of these towns, including Athenry. Prior to the roll out of gas to each town, a detailed analysis of the loads within the town and the revenues associated with them is carried out. There is also a requirement to secure a certain level of customers prior to the development commencing. The gas network has been extended to eight of these towns.

In pursuit of these objects, which include the need to establish and maintain non-linear or &lsquo;online&rsquo; audio-visual services, the broadcasters are charged, inter-alia, with ensuring that programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of Ireland and &ldquo;have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular the Irish language&rdquo;. RT&Eacute; and TG4 publish detailed commitments on an annual basis setting out how they intend to meet their public service obligations and objects as set out in the Act. The extent to which the commitments entered into by the two public service broadcasters have been met is reviewed annually by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), which provides an iterative approach that is sufficiently flexible to ensure that the changing needs of Irish society continue to be addressed.  RT&Eacute; is also obliged to make specific amounts available each year for the commissioning of television and radio programmes from the independent production sector. Section 116(8) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 fixes the formula for determining the minimum amount to be paid into the Independent Programme Account each year by RT&Eacute;. While considerable cost reduction measures have forced RT&Eacute; to reduce its expenditure on commissioned programmes in recent years, the value of programmes from the independent sector commissioned by RT&Eacute; remains significant with over &euro;39 million spent in 2014. <\/p>  <p>  Section 118(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 outlines the objects of TG4 and section 118(3) provides that TG4 shall ensure that its programme schedules are primarily in the Irish language. In addition, section 120 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides that RT&Eacute; shall provide to TG4 programme material in the Irish language that will be the equivalent of one hour of daily programming throughout the calendar year. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to radio and television services other than those provided by the national public service broadcasters, these are matters for the BAI, which is an independent statutory body. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, section 25 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides that the BAI and its statutory committees, in performing their functions, shall endeavour to ensure that the number and categories of broadcasting services made available in the State best serve the needs of the Irish people bearing in mind their languages and traditions and their cultural diversity. The Contract Awards Committee makes arrangements to invite, consider and recommend to the Authority proposals for the provision of broadcasting services additional to the existing broadcasting services provided. <\/p>  <p>  Commitments in relation to broadcast content on commercial and community broadcast services are the subject of contractual negotiations between the BAI and the relevant broadcasters. In submitting their licensing applications to the BAI, such broadcasters put forward commitments in regard to how they will deal with a range of broadcast issues including any public service commitments and, where appropriate, more specific commitments. If they are successful in their licence applications, these commitments form part of the terms and conditions of the relevant broadcaster's actual licence.

As the Deputy will appreciate, accommodation and staffing are amongst the most significant cost components of public sector bodies and it is incumbent on all agencies to achieve economy and efficiency. In this context, the Board of IFI continues to engage in a strategic rationalisation of its Dublin based accommodation into one location.    On its establishment, IFI had accommodation at three locations in Swords including leasing a headquarters building (this included IFI&rsquo;s research and development operations), a laboratory and a warehouse. In addition IFI had premises in Glasnevin and Blackrock.

These rates were subsequently increased in 2004, following agreement with the farming organisations under the Partnership talks. In May 2010, the then Government announced the closure of the voluntary bog purchase scheme to new applicants. My Department is continuing to process applications in respect of special areas of conservation received before this date.  Over &euro;1 million has been paid to 56 individuals in respect of plots or turbary rights in Cloonmoylan Bog special area of conservation purchased by my Department. Table 1 below shows aggregate details of the total amount paid by the year in which the transaction took place. It is not considered appropriate to provide details of individual payments having regard to data protection requirements.<\/p><p>In May 2010, an interim compensation payment scheme was established. This provided interim funding to those who had been cutting turf on raised bog special areas of conservation nominated for designation between 1997 and 1999. 4 applicants from Cloonmoylan Bog each received a payment of &euro;1,000 in respect of 2010 during that year under this scheme. 2 further applicants from Cloonmoylan Bog each received a payment of &euro;1,000 in 2011 under this scheme in respect of 2010.<\/p><p>This scheme was replaced by the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, established in 2011. The qualifying criteria for the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, administered by my Department, are that: <\/p><p>-  The claimant must have a legal interest in one of the raised bog special areas of conservation &ndash; ownership or turbary right;<\/p><p>-  The claimant must have been the owner or entitled to exercise turbary rights on the land in question on 25 May 2010;<\/p><p>-  The turbary on the site must not be exhausted;<\/p><p>-  The claimant must have been cutting turf on the land in question during the relevant five year period; and<\/p><p>-  No turf cutting or associated activity is ongoing on the property.<\/p><p>The cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme has applied to Cloonmoylan Bog special area of conservation since 2011 and 94 applications under the scheme for this site had been received and acknowledged by my Department up to the end of 2014. A total of 276 payments and 5 turf deliveries have been made in respect of the applications received. In addition, 51 once-off incentive payments of &euro;500 have been made to applicants who have signed and returned legal agreements under the scheme to my Department. <\/p><p>This equates to some 74 individual applicants having received payments and 2 individuals having received turf deliveries under the scheme thus far. <\/p><p>Table 2 below shows the number of applications received in respect of Cloonmoylan Bog broken down by year. Table 3 below shows the number of payments and turf deliveries made in respect of Cloonmoylan Bog broken down by year.<\/p><p>In five cases relating to Cloonmoylan Bog special area of conservation, compensation has been made available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to the land owner\/turbary right holder and to one other who had been cutting turf on the same bog plot. Aggregate details of the amounts paid and turf delivered in tonnes in respect of year 1 (2011), year 2 (2012), year 3 (2013) and year 4 (2014) of the scheme are set out in Table 4 below.<\/p><p>I am advised that, at this stage, one applicant from this site has been informed by my Department that he does not fulfil the qualifying criteria of the scheme. In this case the area in respect of which the applicant had applied for compensation was not within the designated site. While it may be anticipated that there will be further instances where applicants will be informed that they do not fulfil the qualifying criteria, current priority is being given to providing compensation to those who clearly appear to fulfil the criteria on the basis of the information they have provided.
