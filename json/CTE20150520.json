Can I firstly say that I and my colleague here on my right, John McDonnell, welcome this opportunity on behalf of PwC to meet with the committee this morning and to assist you in your work.  Chairman, in your letter to me of 6 May you allocated a time period for me to read my opening statement.  I don't anticipate that I will require all of that time but I would nonetheless like to make some opening remarks.<\/p> <p>  Chairman, in your introductory remarks you outlined a brief biography of my career and I won't repeat this.  However, I would like to make some comments around my role and function as senior partner of PwC.  My main role is to act as the CEO of the firm on behalf of the partners.  This is a role I've held since 1 July 2007, as you've mentioned, and from which I will step down on 30 June next.  We currently have 95 partners in the Republic of Ireland firm, over 2,000 staff and revenue in the Republic of Ireland of &euro;230 million for the year ended 31 December 2014.  In terms of clients, my principal role is to ensure we have appropriate systems in place to make sure that we deploy suitably experienced and senior partners to carry out specific client assignments.  On the risk and quality side, the senior partner has a very key role to ensure we have effective client acceptance and retention controls in place and also that there is adequate support in place for partners dealing with higher risk situations and making critical professional judgments.<\/p> <p>  PwC Ireland is a member of the PwC global network and in that context the senior partner's role is to ensure that new practices and procedures-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1432076400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Sorry, Mr. Murphy, if I could just slightly disrupt you, I think you may have a box on the speaker there that's actually-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#C00900","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432076400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Oh, I'm sorry.

I responded to you on 27 March and I think it's appropriate that I read out a paragraph from that letter as follows:<blockquote>Further to your letter of 12 March ... directing me to attend before the Joint Committee, I would like to point out to the Joint Committee that I have not practiced as an auditor since my appointment as Senior Partner on 1 July 2007 and, furthermore, prior to that date, I acted [almost entirely] on non-financial services entities.  Accordingly, as I have never been an auditor to a bank, I request that I be granted the option of being accompanied by one of my financial services partners so that I can fully respond to the key themes and lines of inquiry when I attend before the Joint Committee on 20 May.<\/blockquote><\/p><p>Chairman the firm appreciates your consent to this and accordingly I'm accompanied by John McDonnell this morning and I will shortly pass over to him to permit him to make his opening remarks.<\/p><p> As requested Chairman, I submitted my written statement on behalf of the firm on 22 April.  The statement addresses the five key themes which I was directed by the committee to cover.  In summary, these themes are: integrity of financial reporting, appropriateness of property-related lending strategies and risk appetite, the liquidity versus solvency debate, the adequacy of the assessment and communication of both solvency and liquidity risks in banking situations, institutions and sectors and capital structure and loss absorption capacity.  Chairman, I'm happy that if you wish, that this statement can be taken as read.  However I think it's appropriate that I read the short conclusion included in the statement.  Our conclusion is that audits in the period from the start of the financial crisis were clearly challenging due to the inherent uncertainty facing the Irish and global economies and the particular issues faced by Irish banks.  The loan loss provisions were clearly a material estimate in the overall set of financial statements on which we expressed an opinion.  We stand over the quality of the audits of the financial statements of Bank of Ireland and the robustness of the audit opinions issued on the respective reporting dates.<\/p><p> Chairman, my colleague John McDonnell and I would be happy to answer questions from the committee and to explain to the committee how we arrived at this conclusion and why we believe this conclusion was appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#C01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432076400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Thank you very much Mr. Murphy ... sorry -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#D00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432076400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I'm just almost there, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1432076400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Sure yes, take your time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#D00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432076400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>We would also be happy to explore with the committee how bank accounting and bank auditing could be enhanced so as to help avoid a similar financial crisis recurring.  Before I conclude, Chairman, could I say that in relation to Bank of Ireland, that it has been and continues to be a significant client of the Irish firm of PwC.  We were joint auditors to Bank of Ireland along with Deloitte of London up to 1990 and since then have been the sole auditors.  We believe we had, and continue to have, a very strong working relationship with the executives, the audit committee and the court of the bank and provided appropriate challenge and support to the bank in an unprecedented period of turmoil starting in the middle of the last decade.  Can I also say Chairman that, in accordance with the new rules currently being introduced on mandatory auditor rotation, we will step down as the bank's auditors no later than the required date of 2020.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion Chairman, our objective today is to assist the committee as best we can.

Good morning Chairman and members of the committee of inquiry.  Like Ronan, I welcome the opportunity on behalf of PwC to meet with the committee this morning and to assist you in your work.  I am here today in my capacity as lead audit partner on Bank of Ireland from 2010 to date.  Whilst not directly involved in the Bank of Ireland audits from 2001 to 2009, I am familiar with the audit procedures adopted by PwC in the audits of banks in the period in question and like Ronan, I will do my best to answer the committee's questions.<\/p> <p>  Chairman, I submitted my written statement on 6 May 2015.  I'm happy to take the statement as read but I would like to make a few introductory remarks on two aspects.  A, the role of audit, what it is and what it is not and B, the impact of prevailing accounting standards in recognising risks.  So moving to the role of the audit, there is and has been a lot of discussion about the role of an audit, including what it is, what people think it is and what they might like it to be.  So I think it's important at the outset to set out what the role of an audit is, where it begins and ends, and what it is not.  In doing this I'm drawing from the requirements of company law in Ireland and auditing standards.  The objective of an audit of financial statements is to enable the auditor to express an opinion whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework, that's IFRS in the case of Irish banks for 2005.  Although an auditor's opinion enhances the credibility of financial statements, the user cannot assume that the audit opinion is an assurance as to the future viability of the entity nor the efficiency or effectiveness with which management has conducted the affairs of the entity.<\/p><p>In other words, the primary purpose of an audit is to provide independent assurance to the shareholders that the directors have prepared the financial statements properly in accordance with the rules of IFRS.  An audit does not exist to provide comment or opinion on a company's business model.  That is not the purpose of an audit, nor is there any means for an auditor to express such views in the audit opinion.  The prescribed format and somewhat binary nature of an audit opinion does not allow for commentary on an entity's business model.  In fact, the content and set of financial ... the content of a set of financial statements is prescribed by the accounting and regulatory framework.  There is nothing in this framework which allows an auditor an avenue to express a view in the financial statements on a company's business model.  In the context of regulatory returns, there is no requirement for auditors to audit or review, and nor did we audit or review, any regulatory turn of the bank, be it solvency, liquidity or otherwise.<br\/><br\/>I move on to the second item - impact of prevailing accounting standards and recognising risks.  The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, the performance and changes in financial position of an entity.  Accounting standards set the rules for the preparation of financial statements and, as I said, IFRS are the accounting standards that applied to listed entities in Ireland, including the banks, from 2005 or March 2006 in the context of Bank of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Financial statements portray the effects of past transactions or events.  They're not intended to provide all the information that users need to make economic decisions.  The aim of accounting standards is to faithfully represent past transactions or events in financial statements.  Matters such as stability, capital adequacy and future prospects are outside the remit of accounting standards.  The requirement to focus on past transactions and events means that IFRS prohibits the recognition of future events.  By way of example:<blockquote>1) There is a general rule in IAS 39, which deals with accounting for financial instruments and impairment, that losses expected as a result of future events, no matter how likely, are not recognised as impairment on loans and receivables - this is called the incurred loss approach.<\/blockquote>By way of example, the date a borrower became unemployed would be an impairment trigger in many retail books.  What I mean by an impairment trigger is the first point at which impairment is allowed to be recognised.  But banks cannot take into account an ... expected increase in unemployment in the following year, say 2016, in their year-end, say 2015, assessment of impairment, no matter how likely, because this unemployment has not yet happened.  There is a ... second example.  There's a general rule in IAS 37 and that deals with provisions contingent liabilities and contingent assets, that provisions cannot be recognised for future operating losses.  And my third example deals with events after the balance sheet period, IAS 10, and this standard does not allow an entity to recognise the financial impact of events that arise after the balance sheet date concerning conditions which did not exist at the balance sheet date.<br\/><br\/>IFRS set the rules which had to be applied in financial statements of Irish banks during the financial crisis.  The financial crisis tested some of these rules and found some of them wanting.  Changes have now been made but, nonetheless, they were the prevailing rules.  Therefore, they were required to be applied.  The accounting rules of the time did not allow for the recognition of future events or risks.  There have been changes since the crisis to accounting auditing and corporate governance standards.  We've engaged heavily in the process and welcome the opportunity to engage further with the various stakeholders in the overall debate on improving financial reporting.  Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432076400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. McDonnell, and thank you again, Mr. Murphy.

And what we've seen is, we have seen a development - for an example, Senator - we've seen a development in the audit report, whereas the audit report previously would have been a two-page report, now it's about a six-page report.  Previously we would've just, effectively, said what our responsibility is and what our opinion was; now we will specify how we, how we determined the focus of our audit, so, in other words, what entities were in scope and what were not in scope, what was the materiality that we would have applied to our audit, and what were the key areas of audit focus, so, in other words, the significant risk and, clearly, impairment would have been one of them, and what tests we undertook to audit those areas of focus, and then how that brought us to our opinion.  So it's much more discursive around the opinion, and the second part of the change was that management through ... the directors, through the auspices of the audit committee, would outline what they considered were the significant issues that they took into account in the context of the finalisation of the financial statements, and how they interacted with the auditors in that regard.

The first is that there was always going to be a difference between what NAMA paid for the loans and what the banks carry the loans at because they're calculated in two very different ways.  Second point I'd make is that the 43% discount is a haircut against the amount that was lent.  It is not a haircut against the carrying value in Bank of Ireland because the carrying value in Bank of Ireland would've included impairment provisions.  Impairment provisions, as I indicated, are accounted for in accordance with the incurred loss model.  And that means that you need, first off, an impairment indicator, so you need to have objective evidence of impairment.  When you have objective evidence of impairment, you can book an impairment loss.  Secondly, how you book an impairment loss is you take the expected cash flows from the loan, not taking into account future impairment indicators, and you discount them at the interest rate implicit in the loan.

They're calculated very differently.<\/p> <p>  And lastly, under IAS 39, the bank were not allowed to account for these loans at fair value, so they couldn't write them down to fair value and they could only book the additional loss when the loans were transferred to NAMA.

A set of financial statements ... the bank enter into transactions, those transactions have an impact on the balance sheet, we give an opinion as to whether those transactions have been properly accounted for.

It's accepted that it was not our role at that point in time to give an opinion on the business model of the bank.  That's the role of management.  And very importantly here, our role as auditors are governed by the independence rules, and the independence rules say that we cannot get involved in management activities.  So, we're not ... we can't get involved in the setting of the bank's business strategy.  We can't get involved in the determination of whether it's right or wrong.

We have to be very, very careful that we don't cross that line or we cease to be independent.

The bank had no ability to impact that at all.  NAMA just paid them what they paid them.  That amount was a close to a fair value-type calculation.  The nominal value is before provisions so that's not the carrying value at Bank of Ireland at the time that it was transferred, it's the amount that was actually lent and Bank of Ireland would have determined the carrying value of that, taking into account that loan balance and appropriate impairment provision, calculated in accordance with the incurred loss approach.  And, as I said, Chairman, as part of our audit work, we would have focused very heavily in on the audit of impairment and we were satisfied to give a clean audit opinion at that point in time.  So, we had no issue in terms of the calculation of the carrying amount of the loans at the balance sheet date prior to when they were sold to NAMA and, as I said, the bank couldn't influence the amount that NAMA paid because that was set by legislation.  They're two very different calculations.  They will always be different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#P02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1432076400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>But, can you provide any explanation to the committee this morning as to why the NAMA high cut, rather than NAMA haircut, was so high, Mr. McDonnell?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#P02300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432076400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Yes, because the NAMA haircut was a close to a current fair value for the loan and given the very depressed state of property prices, fair values were always going to be lower than in an incurred loss value.  And, as I said earlier on, Chairman, the bank had no ability to fair-value its loans in its financial statements.  It was required to account for them at amortised cost, which is basically what you lent less your incurred loss impairment.  The two numbers are calculated differently and because we were at, as we now know, the bottom of the cycle, fair value was always going to be below the amortised cost amounts, so it was always going to be different.  And, as I said, Bank of Ireland were critically aware of that and that's why they disclosed in the financial statements 31 December 2009 that they were going to make substantial losses on the disposal of loans to NAMA and they also would have, I believe, explained why those losses could not be recorded in accounting standards until the loans actually transferred to NAMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#P02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1432076400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Okay, so can I just check for the record so Mr. McDonnell, were PwC aware of the fair value of these loans when signing off on the account?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#P02500","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432076400,"counter":208,"content":"<p>We would not have audited the fair value of those loans because the bank were not allowed ... the bank had accounted for these as loans in receivables, they were not allowed to fair-value them.

Just before I move on to the next member, if I can just ... one of our lines of inquiry is the integrity of financial reporting, Mr. McDonnell and Mr. Murphy. In around 2005, most banks adopted the IAS 39 in relation to the calculation of the provision of bad debts.  Within the industry, was there any discussion or opinion about this standard and particular in regard to the adoption of the standard as to how it would relate to profit and loss in accounts and the provision for bad debt?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#Y02700","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432076400,"counter":426,"content":"<p>There was considerable discussion around, even prior to that, if you just look at who the ISB are, the ISB are an independent objective standard setter, that's why people apply their rules because they're independent and objective.  When the ISB set IAS 39, they would have a very long consultation period and as part of that consultation period, they would have got a lot of comments back from users of the financial statements around what was right or wrong.  Sorry, what they believed was appropriate or not appropriate ... sorry, that's the right way to say it ... and they would have taken that into account and then they made their deliberation.  And it's important to understand where the ISB are coming from with this.  They were concerned at that point in time because a lot of market participants were concerned that people were making what was called \"big bath provisions\" or as Deputy Levitt in the SEC \"cookie jar provisions\".  There was concern that people were making provisions when times were good and then they were releasing those provisions when times were bad and smoothing their profits to ensure that they had an appropriate trend.  That was the concern ... so that was at the forepoint of the ISB's mind.  So the ISB's intention on IAS 39, would be that it was pro-cyclical, their intention was that when there was a significant downturn, you would have greater losses than in benign times.  That was the intention to meet that obligation.  So clearly, when financial institutions and people were moving from old-gap ... what we called old Irish gapped (IFRS), there was a lot of debate about what would IAS 39 mean in the context of provisions.<\/p><p>And it would generally mean that provisions would be lower.  There was some debate about the appropriateness or not ... the appropriateness or not of that, but it kind of all became a little bit irrelevant because, when the EU adopted IAS 39, it had to be applied.  So, once personal views as to whether it was right ... once personal views as to whether you felt it was the most appropriate standard became not of a consequence, it was the standard, it was the rules and, therefore, you needed to apply ... apply those rules.  And that's what financial institutions and, indeed, other financial institutions did.

Good afternoon.  My name is Paul Smith.  I joined Ernst and Young in 1973, specialising in tax, and became a partner in 1982.  I was based in the firm's Irish tax desk in New York between 1994 and 1996, before returning to Ireland.  I was managing partner from 2000 until 2009, when I retired from the firm.<\/p> <p>  I hope my remarks today can assist the committee with its inquiry.  I will briefly outline my role and responsibilities as managing partner before and during the banking crisis.  I will explain how we undertook our audits of EBS, the role auditors played generally, and my reflections on lessons learned from the banking crisis.<\/p> <p>  As I outline in my written evidence, I was responsible for the strategy, management and leadership of the firm, working with my colleagues in the firm's management committee.  I was also responsible for dealing with specific issues referred to me as managing partner, from time to time.  An important part of my role was to represent the partnership externally, and within the EY network internationally.<\/p> <p>  EY Ireland has several divisions and practice areas, covering various professional disciplines and sectors.  One of these is our financial services group, and the partners in this group carried out the audits of banks and other financial institutions.  The partners and staff of this group were specialists, highly experienced and conferred regularly.  They had available to them the depth of resources and expertise, both in Ireland and internationally, that were required to operate to the highest professional standards when providing services to large and complex financial institutions.  The partner in charge of the financial services group kept me and my colleagues in the management committee up to date on significant developments in the sector and on matters relating to individual clients, where necessary.<\/p> <p>  While I was not involved in the planning and execution of individual audits, I understood the fundamental principles underpinning the firm's approach.  Significant issues would be referred to me if they required my attention.  The management committee and I engaged particularly closely with the financial services group as the banking crisis unfolded.  We knew that our colleagues were responding to the challenging environment, increasing the extent of their audit work, and that significant additional resources were allocated.<\/p> <p>  While I was aware of the increasing challenges facing Irish banks, no issues were referred to me as managing partner at any time with respect to our audit of EBS.  Nor, as far as I am aware, did we ever receive any complaint from EBS.  I appreciate that the committee may have questions about our audit.  As I am not an auditor, and as no issues were referred to me with respect to the audits, I propose that my colleague, Dargan Fitzgerald, should appear alongside me, and the committee has invited him to do so.  He was the audit partner of EBS for 2007 and 2008.  Dargan is EY's audit compliance principal, and an audit partner specialising in the audit of financial institutions, and is better placed to answer detailed questions on the EBS audits, and on audit procedure generally, than I am.  I have read the evidence Dargan has supplied to the committee, and I agree with it to the extent of my own expertise.<\/p><p>I have also discussed this opening statement with Dargan and my former colleagues in EY Ireland.<\/p><p> While I don't claim to be an auditing expert or to have reviewed the EBS audit files, I am confident that the EY audit team properly performed its responsibilities as statutory auditors of the financial statements of EBS.  I believe that EY undertook its duties as statutory auditor professionally and diligently, in accordance with international auditing standards.  The audit opinion on the EBS financial statements reflected the applicable statutory requirements.  In accordance with normal practice, the audit team also reported in greater detail to the audit committee and to the board of EBS, drawing their attention to any management and control issues identified during the course of the audit.  Finally, the audit team also communicated with the Financial Regulator as required.<\/p><p> Our audit reports offered all stakeholders reasonable assurance about the state of EBS at a particular point in time.  In particular, the financial statements presented by the directors were true and fair.  The presentation complied with accounting standards.  It is worth noting that our audit opinions have not been subsequently challenged.  EBS has not restated its accounts for 2007 or 2008.  Statutory audits are not designed to provide advice on future business models, or commercial decision-making.  Neither is it the auditor's role to advise on risks to the business, particularly business risks, which are market wide and not confined to a single entity or job review.  During ... dealing with these risks, it is the responsibility of the management, their advisers and regulators.  It is inappropriate for auditors to advise on these questions.  To do so would compromise their independence.  It is fundamental that auditors do not audit their own advice.<\/p><p> But I do understand why people ask why auditors didn't warn the banks of the risks of their decisions.  The first thing to say is that it is now clear that the combined risks were underestimated by all stakeholders at the crucial time, that is, the period leading up to the peak of the boom.  Second, it is important to view this question in the light of the statutory role of an auditor and the parameters and limitations of that role.  The focus of auditors was on the risk that previous years' financial statements had been materially misstated.  Therefore, at the start of an audit, we're looking back at the decisions that have already been made and the income and expenditure of the company of the year that has passed.  Third, it was the responsibility of each bank's board, under the supervision of the prudential regulator, to run its business and to determine its commercial strategy and its appetite for risk.  If we had issues about a particular commercial strategy, then our role would be to ensure that those charged with the governance of the client were aware of those issues and that the impact of the financial statements at the year end was correctly reflected.<\/p><p> In terms of our role at the time, however, the auditor's primary function was to carry out a statutory audit of the company's financial statements and to express an independent opinion on them.  I believe that the statutory audit does play an important role.  It provides an independent, professional opinion, based on an audit conducted in accordance with international auditing standards.  It records the auditor's opinion as to whether the financial statements conform to international accounting standards and whether they provide a true and fair view of the company's position and results over a particular period.  Financial statements are inherently historic, reflecting the position up to the previous year end.  Of necessity, decisions by a company and the regulator are based on more current, but non-audited information, such as the company's own management information, the books and records which the company is legally required to keep and the detailed returns supplied by the company to the Financial Regulator.<\/p><p> It is important for me to acknowledge that the banking crisis has had devastating consequences for individuals and families all over Ireland.  The effects have been humbling for anyone involved in financial services, and I understand the loss and the anger of people who have suffered.  Everyone connected to the financial services industry at the time has reflected on their own role in the crisis and how the regulatory environment can be improved.  It is important that this reflection happens and EY and the audit firms generally are no exception to that.  As I have explained, auditors perform the role required of them, but that is no cause for complacency.  We believe that many users of financial statements generally understood the purpose and limitations of an audit, but we accept that many observers expected more from the audit process than a statutory audit was actually designed to deliver.<\/p><p> Since the crisis, EY Ireland, our international colleagues and various authorities have considered how audit can be made more useful.  Changes have been made in several areas and Dargan will refer to these in his opening statement.  But more can be done.  I'd like to use my remaining few minutes to suggest areas where some changes could be made in the future to improve the usefulness of audit.  I understand that auditors are now better able to communicate to the regulator.  This communication with the regulator, in my opinion, should be in both directions.  Specifically, the regulator should be permitted and encouraged to exchange information with auditors.  That is my first recommendation.<\/p><p> I am sure my colleagues will continue to support strengthening the role of audit committees and internal audit functions within companies.  I understand that progress has been made on this point, but that it's a continual process, and Dargan can answer questions on that subject.  And that is my second recommendation.  My third and final recommendation is based on discussions I have had with former colleagues since being invited to appear before this committee.  Insurance companies are required to provide detailed information to regulators in their regulatory returns and to ask an external auditor to provide an opinion on those returns.  It seems logical to me that banks and other financial institutions could be subject to the same requirements.  Their returns could be independently audited as well.  That would improve the transparency of the system and increase regulators' confidence in the information that financial institutions provide.  It would also ensure ... it would also serve to ensure that auditors were aware of current trends in the Financial Regulator.  That is my third recommendation.<\/p><p> So, to sum up, I believe that EY performed its statutory duties, in accordance with auditing standards, and carried out high quality audits on the EBS financial statements and that those financial statements provided transparency and reasonable assurance to investors, regulators and policy makers in respect of the company's financial performance during the period covered by the financial statements.  I understand the distress and anger of people who have suffered as a result of the banking crisis and I've reflected on the causes of the crisis.

Good afternoon.  My name is Dargan Fitzgerald, I am an audit partner, specialising in the audit of financial institutions, and EY Ireland's audit compliance partner.  I was the audit partner for EBS for the years ending 31 December 2007 and 2008.  I am happy to endorse the comments made by Paul and I would like to add some detail regarding our audit of EBS.<\/p> <p>  Paul has addressed a long-standing question on the role of audit and the apparent misapprehension that it was the role of auditors to advise on banks' prospective commercial lending strategies, strategies which proved extremely successful for some banks for some years, but which ultimately left the banks exposed in the global recession.  As Paul mentioned, auditors do not advise on the business models which our clients adopt.  We do not advise clients on the wisdom or prudence of their commercial decisions.  Stakeholders do not and should not look to audits to provide commentary on business risks.  Auditor independence is a fundamental principle and we could not provide an independent audit while simultaneously advising management. <\/p> <p>  When considering the impact of the banking crisis on EBS and the commercial strategies it adopted, the turning point as identified by various investigations into the crisis appears to have been the board's decision in 2005 to follow the example of its competitors by increasing its exposure to development property lending.  While the board of EBS has since described that commercial strategy as, I quote, \"a mistake\", I have no reason to doubt that it was adopted in good faith by the EBS board at that time.  I know that the board was satisfied that such a commercial strategy was in the best interests of EBS.  As far as I am aware, the Financial Regulator did not raise an objection at the time.  EY Ireland was not consulted on the decision to adopt this strategy.  Our firm had no role in the EBS decision to adopt that commercial strategy in 2005.  On the contrary, as statutory auditors, it was important that we were independent of this commercial decision making.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, if, during our audit work, we became aware of control weaknesses or of issues which gave rise to a significant risk of misstatement of the financial statements, then we would draw these matters to the attention of those charged with governance.  There were various issues that we identified and raised with management over the years, as can be seen from the core documents which are before the committee.<\/p><p> However, future commercial decision making and its associated risks and financial consequences were matters for the board.  It was the auditors' role to express our view as to whether the financial statements fairly presented the institution&rsquo;s financial performance for the particular period.  In our opinion, the EBS financial statements did so.  For example, the 2008 annual report presented by the directors, which accompanied the financial statements, acknowledged the unsuccessful commercial strategy and the resulting losses and impairment provisions as at 31 December 2008.  The 2008 annual report, presented by the directors, also disclosed that those provisions and losses were likely to increase in subsequent periods.<\/p><p> Now with hindsight, the banks&rsquo; business models and lending practices have attracted universal criticism.  I agree that, in the light of what transpired from 2008 onwards, many of the banks&rsquo; earlier commercial decisions have proven extremely damaging.  The exposure of individual institutions in Ireland and elsewhere became increasingly obvious as the credit crisis developed.  By the time Lehman Brothers collapsed, it was evident that the banks were in serious difficulty.  By that time, far less development lending was taking place in Ireland in any event.  The board of EBS had taken the decision to stop development property lending by April 2008.  However, by then the damage had been done before the frailties of the system had been laid bare when global liquidity abruptly dried up.<\/p><p> The need for foresight on the part of those responsible was greatest at the time at which the banks embarked on development lending at what, with hindsight, we now know was the height of the boom.  I cannot say that the auditing profession foresaw these developments any more than any other stakeholders did.  However, unlike the directors and the prudential regulator, our primary responsibility was to provide an opinion on the past year&rsquo;s financial statements and to consider the risk that those historic financial statements were misstated.  A statutory audit is not designed to anticipate future trading risk.  That would be akin to a corporate finance role, a very different function.  The auditors did not make any assessment prior to the 2008 audit that EBS&rsquo;s business strategy left them unacceptably exposed in the event of a future financial crisis, nor, as I have outlined, was it the auditors&rsquo; responsibility to do so.  We were aware, as auditors, that EBS had changed its commercial strategy, increasing its development lending.  This was following a strategy which was widely viewed as being successfully pursued by other Irish banks.  Our approach to the audit of the last year&rsquo;s financial statements reflected our understanding of the strategy being pursued.  It was not our role as auditor to advise on the mix of commercial and residential lending which EBS should adopt in the future.  Nevertheless, if the auditors had been concerned about the wisdom of EBS increasing its development property lending, what could or should they have done?  Disagreement with the bank&rsquo;s commercial decisions would not have been a basis to resign or to qualify the previous years&rsquo; financial statements, unless, for example, those financial statements were misstated or there were corporate governance issues which had led the auditors to doubt the integrity of management.  Furthermore, the auditors were constrained by client confidentiality and could only have divulged confidential information to the Financial Regulator in limited circumstances, such as where there had been a regulatory breach.  None of these three scenarios had occurred in the case of EBS.  Accordingly, the auditors&rsquo; only option would have been to ensure that the directors were fully aware of management&rsquo;s actions.  In this case, as is clear from their annual reports, the directors of EBS were aware of and had endorsed the increase in development lending.<\/p><p> I agree with Paul that we carried out high-quality audits of EBS&rsquo;s financial statements throughout the period.  In preparing for the session, I discussed the changes that have taken place since the financial crisis with Paul and also the changes that could happen in future.  I will briefly outline the changes that have been implemented already.<\/p><p> First, dialogue with regulators is an important consideration.  At the time, auditors did not have an open channel of communication with the Financial Regulator.  Bound by client confidentiality, auditors were limited in the information they could divulge, except in exceptional circumstances such as a suspected regulatory contravention.  I should be clear that, as audit partner, I had no particular concerns or no particular information in respect of EBS which I felt should be divulged to the Financial Regulator.  That said, the desirability of a more open and two-way dialogue with prudential regulators is a clear lesson from the crisis.  Progress has indeed been made on this point.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s auditor protocol provides a framework for auditors to raise issues about financial institutions with the prudential regulator, now the Central Bank of Ireland.  This is welcome and consideration should be given to placing this on a formal basis and to enabling communication in both directions.  The Financial Regulator, who has greater market-wide visibility, may well be able to inform the auditor's approach to the audit, ensuring that the auditor can take account of the regulator&rsquo;s concerns during their audit work.<\/p><p> The second area where progress has been made is on accounting standards.  Accounting standards provide a common international approach to the presentation of financial statements, just as auditing standards promote consistency in approaches to audit.  Changes have been made to accounting standards to allow financial institutions to report unexpected losses in their loan book, as well as reporting actual incurred losses.  The need for this change was recognised internationally in the wake of the banking crisis.  The standard setters have worked hard to engage with all stakeholders following the crisis, including EY, and I welcome this change.<\/p><p> Thirdly, I support strengthening the role of audit committees.  I believe that audit committees should be strong, dedicated and fully engaged in carrying out their functions.  They are there to represent shareholders and to challenge management.  Strong audit committees ensure financial reporting is scrutinised and challenged.  Again, this is an area where progress has been made but more could be done.<\/p><p> Finally, and perhaps most significantly, changes have been made in prudential regulation and in capital requirements for banks through Basel III and other regulatory initiatives.  The committee will be well aware of the scope of these changes and of their impact.  Prudential regulation and international capital requirements, the responsibilities of the board, especially non-executive directors and management, all play their own roles.  However, it is important to emphasise that audit forms only one part of the wider system of assurance available to stakeholders.  It is important that audit, as part of this system of assurance, continually improves and becomes more useful to all stakeholders.  Therefore, as we look to the future, I&rsquo;m happy to endorse Paul Smith&rsquo;s three recommendations.<\/p><p> That concludes my statement and I welcome any questions the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#JJ00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432076400,"counter":665,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Fitzgerald, and I also thank you for your earlier contribution, Mr. Smith.

It also rests on tests we have carried out during our audit of the systems and processes that lead to the booking and recording of the loans. And, in that context, when we come to the year end or balance sheet part of our audit, as it's called, we also examine the loan files and review further documentation and obtain appropriate explanations from management in relation to the status of the loan as of the balance sheet date.  And, in doing that work, we also review any property valuations that have been carried out.  Sometimes these are formally required by the bank and they are third-party valuations from external valuers.  In some cases, they're values derived internally from either analysis of cash flows or updating of previous valuations.  In any of the work we carried out, generally, I must say, the work was very satisfactory.  We had few, if any, occasions where we were unable to obtain a satisfactory explanations for management for the decisions they had taken in relation to any valuation for impairments on loans and that's ... given the fact that the market at the time was showing the beginnings of considerable uncertainty in relation to the values of collateral in cases where loans were already stressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#LL00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1432076400,"counter":675,"content":"<p>Okay, thank you.

So, a couple of comments.  First of all ... and I'm familiar with the references that you give gave in those two documents, thank you.  First of all, I just need to distinguish between the role of the Financial Regulator in issuing such letters and our role as external auditors and you'll appreciate that the Financial Regulator's role as a supervisor is based on its detailed programme of work which has a very different scope and aim compared with the ambit and role of the external auditor.  So, I would say, firstly, as a general comment to the committee, that one may not be comparing like with like in asking for external auditor comment on such things.  We have a very clearly defined role in relation to what we do with such regulatory correspondence when we ask for it and, of course, come across it.  This is governed by one of the auditing standards - compliance with laws and regulations.  And we are required to understand the content of such reports and then assess how they impact our ... our audit.  And, as I mentioned in some of my previous comments, our audit is ... the possible effect on our audit is in relation to the risk of misstatement of the reported balance sheet or income statement amounts.  So, I just want to make the point that such comments by the Financial Regulator do not directly impact or correspond with or feed into external auditor assessment other than they may ... they may inform our risk assessment as to where we should focus our effort of our audit.  So you-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#LL01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1432076400,"counter":681,"content":"<p>I know, Mr. Fitzgerald, that you're the fourth cohort of auditors that have come before the inquiry and all have been extremely insistent on emphasising the narrowness, perhaps, if I put it like that, or the narrow parameters of the audit role.

The Financial Regulator may be more concerned with aspects of adherence to procedures and they may be more concerned with aspects of documentation of procedures, whereas the external auditor's role is, as I mentioned, to assess whether any of the items highlighted by the regulator do, and I must say it is in a background way ... whether they affect the risk assessment of the auditor in carrying out the auditor's tests.<\/p><p>So that is not to say that if there was something that alarmed the auditor, it should not be taken into account.  If it had a pervasive effect on financial reporting, it had absolutely would be taken into account.  I think it's important in relation to the items you've highlighted to understand that as when we, as auditors, take samples of loan files, we do look for characteristics relating to both the administration and the credit approval of the loan and we carry out tests of the underlying data.  Exceptions to policies may be relevant, although sometimes those exceptions just show that there's been a particular activity level in a particular sector.  They may not indicate that anything is wrong with the financial reporting; they're more internally procedural.  So, in summary, my answer, Deputy, is we take it into account or we may take it into account but we don't necessarily actually retest it or factor it directly into our work.

So, the two years that I was involved in, I think I mentioned previously that, the team was considerably larger in the 2008 year than in the 2007 year.

I should also mention that in 2008 the ... because of our general understanding of the presence of risk within the financial system, we made a designation of the audit which we call \"close monitoring\", which means we heighten its risk in terms of our register of the risk of the potential misstatement in relation to the audit.  So I was assisted by what's called an independent partner, who acts as a sounding board and a peer reviewer of any key decisions that I make.  There are other partners involved in the team, such as a tax partner and an information technology partner, and then, as you can imagine, the balance of the team of some 40, from memory in 2008, is made up of directors, managers, senior managers and core staff, coming from those various disciplines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#UU00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1432076400,"counter":824,"content":"<p>Thank you.

So, as auditing standards require, that's auditing standard 260, reporting to those charged with governance, as I previously mentioned, where we come across an issue or an improvement point that needs to be brought to the attention of management of the audit committee, our management letter typically contains it and it typically contains it in the sort of format that one sees there.  So the topic, in other words, what, sort of, part of the financial reporting is involved, the observation, what we found, and then the risk and the comment that you quoted from the two comments under the heading, \"Risk\", their purpose is to illustrate - we sometimes call them \"what could go wrong\", they illustrate, if you like, the worst case, if this control point is not acted on, of what could happen.  So, where we write appropriately, \"As a consequence, monthly management finance reports may be inaccurate\", just to highlight that those would not necessarily mean that there would be pervasive error in management accounts but that arising from, and in the context of euro bank account reconciliations, there might be misreporting.  The key point is that is highlighting the risk of what might go wrong and then our recommendation and the response of management ... we highlight in our recommendation what we feel should be done to, if you like, fix the problem and then management under the column \"EBS response\" identifies how they intend to resolve the issue, assuming they agree with it.

I kind of feel it's that person's opinion, and, you know, they're absolutely entitled to have that.  I do know that the role of professional scepticism has come into some particular focus since the financial crisis and, in the context of the work of this committee and of similar work groups across the world reacting to the financial crisis, there has been a very explicit move to increase both the exercise of scepticism, which has always been an important and, you might say, necessary attitude of mind of external auditors and of auditing firms, but to improve both the rigour of challenge to management and management's judgment.  And in that context, I would mention a project in the external auditing world called clarified ISAs, international standards on auditing.  They were, after the financial crisis, updated to improve the level of specificity of some of their required audit procedures, and some of those related to exactly that point - scepticism.

But the three recommendations were, one: that there would be more effective two-way communication between the regulator and the audit firms.  I think I would have to refer to Dargan on this in terms on what the technicalities are around that because there's obviously a framework, a legislative framework around that.  And since it involves issues of client confidentiality or at least, potential client confidentiality issues, I could see how some legislation might be required there.  The second was in the strengthening the role of audit committees and the role of internal audit.  I think that's not really a legislative matter.  I suppose legislators will always want to participate but I think that that's more an internal matter, probably falling more within the codes of governance for companies generally.  The third is around the audit of the returns that are made by financial institutions other than insurance companies and these are the quarterly returns to the Financial Regulator.

Perhaps for the more significant loan collateral values and in other cases, they were proving difficult to obtain and management made its own estimates and we evaluated the estimates that management had made.

I think you'd have to refer to the specific accounting policy which is absolutely in compliance with the standard for valuing the loans in the books of the society and because of the different types of loans, it can be a little bit more complicated than the outline description.  There are two stages to assessing the value for reporting in the financial statements.  One is whether there is objective evidence of impairment, that is, typically, if there is evidence of, in simple terms, stress and strain in the borrower's repayment of the loans.  That absolutely depends on whether the borrower is up to date in those payments or not in similar analysis.  And then, as a second stage, if there is objective evidence of impairment, the institution - the bank or building society - will typically carry out a discounted cash-flow analysis.  That fulfils the requirements of the standard.  The discounted cash-flow analysis will produce a value, which will be the value that would be booked if, but only if, there is the first factor present ... the objective evidence of impairment.  And in that way, and using the principle of incurred losses, which simply means that only losses which have actually occurred up to the balance sheet date, are to be recognised, then the resulting provision and write-down that you referred to is incorporated in the financial statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052000002#DDD00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dargan Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1432076400,"counter":923,"content":"<p>Okay.

So, he goes on to say that Mr. McGovern raised various things like the reliance on a few numbers of very key people is a risk - he was talking about in the institution - that there is imprecision in figures and that people are being forced into taking actions which are, in turn, imprecise and slightly unfocused.  In respect of control breakdowns in the year, he said that there would appear to be fewer than in previous years, which he took as being a positive outcome from some changes and actions which had been taken.  He said that there were, and I quote, \"a couple of fraud instances and behavioural instances\" which caused him concern.  So ... and then he goes on to say, \"I asked [him about the] focus on commercial lending [as a fit in] the ethos of the society as a retail financial services provider\", and he said \"this is a business line that they feel they can make return commensurate with their risk and for which they have skills and opportunities to capitalize on\".
