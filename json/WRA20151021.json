It remains the aim of my Department to achieve a bilateral agreement, but I do not believe this will be possible to finalise it in the short term because of a number of difficult issues outstanding. <\/p>  <p>  I recently met with the Russian Irish Adoption Group.  I am conscious that members of the Group have adopted Russian children in the past, prior to the current arrangements, and many seek to adopt another child from Russia.  The Russian Irish Adoption Group gave a powerful presentation of the sensitivities involved.  I am of the view that it is essential to give clear, frank information about the likely time scale potentially involved in trying to secure an agreement with the Russian Federation, in order to allow fully informed decision making.  I advised the Group of the current position regarding the bilateral and I outlined to them the issues that still remain despite our continuing efforts.  <\/p>  <p>  The Adoption Act 2010 provides for adoption of children into Ireland from countries that have signed and ratified the Hague Convention and from countries where a bilateral agreement on adoption is in place.  The Hague Convention is a landmark in regard to inter-country adoption and provides an international architecture that prioritises the best interests of children. <\/p>  <p>  While it has signed the Convention, the Russian Federation has not ratified the treaty.  This has prevented recent adoptions from Russia into Ireland.  We have been trying to reach a bilateral agreement with the Russian Federation on inter-country adoption for a number of years.  Significant issues remain in the way of an agreement.  For example the Irish Constitution is very clear on the integrity of the family unit and the Russian requirement for post placement reports on adopted children poses a difficulty in this regard.  Other practical issues include the accreditation of adoption mediation agencies to facilitate inter country adoption between Ireland and Russia, the issue of fees to be charged by agencies for facilitating adoptions, and matters relating to re-adoption in cases where an earlier placement has broken down.  We will continue to pursue the matter and the try to resolve the difficulties arising.  <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime I will seek to progress very important improvements in the Irish adoption services, including the draft legislation for Adoption Information and Tracing which is currently undergoing pre legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  This is an important piece of legislation affecting all adoptions past and future.  We are also working on the Adoption (Amendment) Bill which incorporates amendments required to the Adoption Act 2010 arising from recent referendums including the Children's Referendum.

The transition to independent adulthood can be challenging for many young people and a key factor in achieving success is ensuring that assessment, preparation and planning for leaving care begins in the years prior to leaving care and continues as part of the care planning process.  This work is based on collaboration with the young person, their carers and partner agencies to generate an aftercare plan that is specific to the individual young person's needs.<\/p>  <p>  In 2012, an implementation plan was developed by Tusla setting out a work plan in order to ensure full compliance with their Leaving and Aftercare Policy.  New practices have been introduced, for example the establishment of local steering groups, the development of dedicated aftercare teams, and the standardised aftercare allowance.<\/p>  <p>  Each care leaver, as part of their leaving and aftercare planning, will have an Individual Financial Support Plan.  This will form part of an assessment of need which takes account of all sources of financial support from all Government Departments and statutory Agencies.  Tusla has introduced a Standardised National Aftercare Allowance of &euro;300 for all care leavers engaged in training and education.  The introduction of this allowance has meant that young people who remain in their foster care placement and young people who live independently and in training, education or employment are now receiving the same financial support from Tusla.  Many young people in independent living have benefited from an increase in their allowance as a result of this measure.  <\/p>  <p>  The system of aftercare supports provided to the young person will be based on their assessed needs.  Advice, guidance, support and signposting are key elements of the supports available to care leavers.

The CCLRP publishes reports of child care cases for the public and all relevant stake-holders, collects and analyses data from the proceedings, publishes reports on the nature and outcomes of the child care proceedings and seeks to promote a public debate on the issues raised through seminars and conferences.

In Ballydowd Special Care Unit, single separation means the removal of a child to a separate locked room for as short a period as possible during times of challenging behaviour which poses a significant risk to themselves or others. <\/p>  <p>  The inspection report indicated that decisions to initiate single separation generally complied with national guidance and that children's Guardians ad Litem and social workers were informed when they took place.

Net investments (after disposals) of just\u00a0over &euro;61 billion and estimated debt servicing costs associated with the investments of almost &euro;9 billion were offset by net income totalling just over &euro;10 billion from the investments, liability guarantee schemes and associated dividends from the Central Bank.  \u00a0Included in this cost are capital injections that were made under Ministerial direction by the NPRF Commission amounting to &euro;20.7 billion which were funded from the NPRF's own resources and did not require borrowing, lowering the overall impact on general government debt.  The overall level of General Government Debt at the end of 2014 is stated to be some &euro;203 billion in chapter 2 of the 2014 Report.<\/p>  <p>  In chapter 3, the C&amp;AG notes that interest on the national debt, together with interest payments on promissory notes, for the period 2009 to 2014 was around &euro;31.7 billion.  The &euro;8.7 billion estimated cost of servicing the debt associated with investments to end-2014 (including the imputed debt service costs of the NPRF investments) represents almost 28% of this.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in late 2010, Ireland entered an EU - IMF programme of financial support which provided &euro;67.5 billion of loans over the years 2011 to 2013, subject to conditionality being met.  Of this amount, &euro;22.5 billion was provided by the IMF, &euro;22.5 billion was provided by the EFSM, &euro;17.7 billion was provided by the EFSF with the remaining &euro;4.8 billion coming from three bilateral lenders - the UK, Sweden and Denmark.  The initial terms for these loans were a 7&frac12; year average maturity (7.3 years for the IMF loan) at an average interest rate estimated in 2010 to be 5.8%. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has achieved significant improvements in the terms of our EU-IMF programme loans since they were initially agreed in 2010. <\/p>  <p>  In 2011, we reached agreement to reduce the cost of our loans from the EFSF, the EFSM and the bilateral lenders.  It is estimated that these interest rate reductions are worth around 9 billion euro over the initially envisaged 7 &frac12; year term.<\/p>  <p>  These interest rate reductions, and more recently the early repayment of a large portion - of some 18.3 billion euro - of our IMF loans, mean that we have negotiated real cash savings of over 10 billion euro.<\/p>  <p>  Also in 2011, the average maturity of our EFSM and the EFSF loans was extended to 12.5 and 15 years respectively, and a further extension of up to 7 years was agreed in 2013.  This has smoothed our redemption profile, improving long-term debt sustainability, and has had a positive effect on the cost of Exchequer borrowing. <\/p>  <p>  The extension of maturities and the subsequent replacement of the Promissory Notes issued to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) with a series of longer term Government bonds reduce the State's borrowing requirement by over 40 billion euro over the next decade, thus significantly improving the viability of the State's finances.<\/p>  <p>  On 8 December 2014, the ESM Board of Governors approved the creation of the Direct Recapitalisation Instrument (DRI) in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM Treaty.  The operational framework for the DRI, approved on the same date, includes a specific provision in relation to the retroactive application of the instrument.  The guideline states that the potential application of the instrument for this purpose should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.  This provided an option of alleviating the burden of some of our bank related debt. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, unlike back in 2012, the ESM is no longer the only option open to us to recover the money provided to recapitalise our banks.  Investors are now willing to support Irish banks again and the market value of our investments has improved accordingly.  My overall objective in relation to the State's investment in the banks is to maximise the return to the Irish taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100072#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information","counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100072#WRE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":148,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[36748\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100072#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of freedom of information requests, in tabular form, received by his Department in 2015 to date; the number of these where the period of consideration was completed within four weeks of the receipt of the request; was extended by up to four weeks because the necessary resources to complete the request within the original time frame were not available.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":149,"content":"<p>As of 16th October, 2015 the number of freedom of information requests received by my Department was\u00a0354.

The Committee held its first discussion on the Report on 13 July 2015.  At this meeting the Committee agreed that my Department should prepare a report for the Cabinet Committee, in conjunction with relevant Departments, on the legal, financial and practical implications of the Report's recommendations.  I wrote to all relevant Ministers seeking their views on the Report's recommendations, asking them to identify any impacts and issues that may arise and timescales for implementation.  My Department is currently analysing the responses, received and will prepare a report for the Cabinet Committee. This will be submitted in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has decided to bring forward as a major priority the International Protection Bill which will provide for the introduction of a single applications procedure for international protection.  This reform will simplify and streamline the existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion.

My Department will shortly commence work in the detailed allocations for local youth services and projects and every effort is being made to notify local projects of their allocation for 2016 in the coming weeks. An additional &euro;2.25m in capital allocation has also been provided in Budget 2016.

Cyberbullying is just one aspect of bullying, but one given the rapid expansion of access to technology by young people has come much more sharply into focus.<\/p>  <p>   It is important for parents to recognise that they need to talk to children about bullying whether it is through social media or not.  Data gathered from nine year old children as part of Growing Up in Ireland, the National Longitudinal Survey commissioned by my Department, showed that based on responses from their mothers, 24% of them thought that children had been victims of bullying in the past year. This represents a significantly lower proportion than that reported by children themselves, which was reported at 40%, suggesting either that many parents are unaware that their child has experienced bullying in the previous year, or that they may have different perspectives about what constitutes bullying.<\/p>  <p>  Schools are strengthening collaboration and interaction with youth services who engage with young people outside of the school setting, and promote the active participation by pupils in youth focused services within their local communities.

Aspects of accommodation, education, employment, poverty, discrimination, lifestyle and access and utilisation of services were cited as key sociodeterminants in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  Healthy Ireland is the National  Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing. A key goal of this framework is to reduce health inequalities. This is particularly relevant in relation to the health outcomes for the Traveller community as it seeks to address the social determinants of health and wellbeing. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also represented on cross government structures such as the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which was established earlier this year following a review of existing Traveller and Roma consultation structures by the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100084#WRR01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Counselling Services","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100084#WRR01400"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[36702\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100084#WRR01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures he will take to ensure that counselling and psychotherapy services are accessible and affordable to all who need to avail of them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1195","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>Counselling is provided across the health service, by both the HSE and the voluntary sector including primary care, social care and within mental health.

The Act also set out the new statutory financial governance arrangements for the Health Service Executive. <\/p><p>In 2014, prior to disestablishment, the HSE Vote reported expenditure on a gross basis; that is, expenditure funded by both exchequer monies and other income (patient income etc).  Following disestablishment, the HSE Vote no longer exists.  Exchequer grants to the HSE are now shown as part of the Department of Health Vote.  This is in line with conventions applying to the many statutory bodies that do not have their own Vote.  <\/p><p>The disestablishment of the HSE's Vote resulted in<b><\/b>&euro;1.043 billion of receipts - previously reported as Appropriations-in-Aid (A-in-A) in the HSE Vote - being offset against the Gross Vote requirement for the Executive for 2015.  The impact, when we compare 2014 (Vote 38 &amp;amp; 39 combined) to 2015 (Vote 39 incorporating HSE grant), is that both gross expenditure and A-in-A are  reduced by &euro;1.043 billion.

The level of expenditure 'approved' is net of any other income.<\/p><p>Under the Act the Director-General of the Health Service Executive is an accountable person, with responsibilities to ensure that the Executive operates within its financial limits, reports to the Department if the Executive is likely to breech those limits and is accountable to the C&amp;amp;AG and PAC for the financial management of the Executive.<\/p><p>The following table sets out the actual receipts recorded as Appropriations-in-Aid to Vote 39 prior to the disestablishment of the Vote on 1 January 2015, as reported in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) for the years 2011 to 2014.<table><tr><th><\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Description<\/td><td>&euro;'000<\/td><td>&euro;'000<\/td><td>&euro;'000<\/td><td>&euro;'000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Statutory Charges in Public Hospitals, Long Stay Charges and Charges for Maintenance in Private and Semi-Private Accommodation in Public Hospitals<\/td><td>376,000<\/td><td>455,016<\/td><td>401,546<\/td><td>385,946<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Superannuation<\/td><td>199,986<\/td><td>199,986<\/td><td>181,086<\/td><td>172,586<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Miscellaneous Receipts<\/td><td>151,800<\/td><td>127,759<\/td><td>115,759<\/td><td>116,159<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>PCRS Rebate receipts<\/td><td><\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>27,000<\/td><td>35,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Receipts from Pension-related Deduction on Public Service Remuneration<\/td><td>337,156<\/td><td>337,156<\/td><td>343,156<\/td><td>333,017<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>1,064,942<\/td><td>1,144,917<\/td><td>1,068,547<\/td><td>1,042,708<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100085#WRS01200","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Lottery Funding Applications","counter":352,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100086#WRT00200"},{"type":"question","counter":353,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[36733\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100086#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an application under the national lottery scheme by a person (details supplied) in County Donegal; when he expects to announce the list of successful organisations which will receive funding in 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":354,"content":"<p>My Department administers a National Lottery Discretionary Fund from which once-off grants are paid to community and voluntary organisations providing a range of health related services.

Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians.<\/p>  <p>  I have been shocked by the reports of the brutal killings by ISIS and its affiliates.

Ireland reiterated its commitment to defending the right to freedom of religion or belief during a UN Security Council debate on the victims of attacks and abuses on ethnic or religious grounds in the Middle East, on 27 March 2015.  I personally highlighted the alarming rise in attacks on Christians when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 1 October 2015 and the UN Human Rights Council at its 28th  session on 4 March 2015.  I also raised it during my meetings with the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, in September 2014 and May 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Later this month at the 3rd Committee at the United Nations General Assembly Ireland will present a statement specifically addressing the importance of freedom of religion or belief at an Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Professor Heiner Bielefeldt. Ireland is active in the negotiation of the EU led draft resolution on Freedom of Religion or Belief in the 3rd Committee.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected. They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  On 20 July 2015, the EU Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) adopted the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019. The Action Plan forms part of the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy which was adopted by the FAC in June 2012.  Its purpose is to improve the effectiveness and consistency of the EU&rsquo;s policy and commits the EU to promoting human rights in all areas of its external action. Responsibility for the implementation of the Action Plan is shared between the EEAS, European Commission and EU Member States.<\/p>  <p>  Within the EU, Ireland pressed for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief to be included in the Action Plan, and this is now reflected as a stand-alone point with the following actions:<\/p>  <p>  - Ensure that freedom of religion or belief remains high on the agenda of relations with third countries, as well as in multilateral fora, in close cooperation with relevant stakeholders; promote the exchange of best practices, and deepen awareness on the various components of freedom of religion or belief at Headquarters, EU delegations and Member State embassies.<\/p>  <p>  - Encourage and support relevant partner countries and other stakeholders&rsquo; initiatives on freedom of religion or belief in particular those aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to religious minorities, enabling them to manifest their religion or belief without fear of violence, discrimination, political pressure, censorship or persecution.<\/p>  <p>  - Promote inter-cultural and inter-religious dialogue and the role of religious and other leaders in ensuring freedom of religion or belief.<\/p>  <p>  Together with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief, the Action Plan will strengthen the EU&rsquo;s co-ordinated response to persecution based on religion or belief throughout the world.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will also continue to raise the issue of the persecution of Christians, through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all citizens and minorities, irrespective of their religion or belief.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to actively support freedom of religion or belief across our foreign policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100089#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Migration Crisis","counter":407,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100089#WRW00750"},{"type":"question","counter":408,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[36763\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100089#WRW00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the outcome of discussions at the recent European Union Foreign Affairs Council in relation to the terrible plight of refugees fleeing the Middle East and North Africa; the progress to date in developing an adequate and comprehensive response programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":409,"content":"<p>The scale of the migration challenge facing the EU is an enormous one requiring a comprehensive and coherent response. The political and economic circumstances behind the displacement of millions of people must be addressed, if the flow of migrants is to be managed. The conflict in Syria (which is the biggest driver behind this year&rsquo;s migrant flows) has led to the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis. More than 12 million Syrians have been displaced from their homes, of whom over 4 million are refugees in neighbouring countries. More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed since the conflict began. Many thousands more have been displaced from other conflict zones including the Horn of Africa, South Sudan and Afghanistan.<\/p>  <p>  Last week&rsquo;s Foreign Affairs Council confirmed the EU&rsquo;s commitment to mobilise all appropriate instruments and policies to support efforts to address the root causes of migratory flows, including political instability, poor socio-economic development and poor governance. The Council expressed its support for diplomatic efforts by the United Nations to find solutions to the conflicts in Syria and Libya, major drivers behind the mass displacements of people.<\/p>  <p>  The Council emphasised that cooperation with third countries must be a key element of EU efforts to address the migration crisis. To this end the EU is working with Turkey on an Action Plan to better address the migration challenges we both face. <\/p>  <p>  As part of its efforts to develop a comprehensive migration strategy, the EU recently organised two high level conferences. Earlier this month a conference focusing on migration flows into the EU through the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans route took place in Luxembourg. It issued a Declaration endorsing a five-pronged approach to addressing the migration challenge. Next month, an international summit focussing on migration will be held in Valletta. EU and African Heads of State and Government are being invited. <\/p>  <p>  At their meeting earlier this month EU Foreign Ministers called on the international community to provide greater support to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food Programme (WFP) and other programmes and agencies assisting refugees. EU leaders have already agreed, at the 23 September European Council, to provide &euro;1 billion in funding to the UNHCR and the WFP.<\/p>  <p>  The EU and its Member States collectively are leading the international response to the refugee crisis. Since 2012, more than &euro;4.2 billion have been mobilised for assistance to Syrians in their country and to refugees who have fled. Ireland will provide &euro;12 million in support of the Syrian people in 2015, bringing our total funding since 2012 for this crisis to &euro;41 million. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this financial support Ireland is also supporting the humanitarian search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean. The L.&Eacute;. Samuel Beckett recently replaced the L.&Eacute;. Niamh and has already helped to rescue over 530 people.

This is to be an ongoing annual commitment to secure a long term increase in the supply of housing for affordable rental, which is expected to work on the basis of tenants paying the majority of the rental cost from their own resources, with the State helping to meet the shortfall.<\/p><p>It is intended that the scheme would be made available to employed households on low to moderate incomes, as well as being a possible support option for some households who qualify for social housing support. An affordable rental scheme targeted at these households has the potential to meet their housing need using an intermediary, State-funded, level of support to allow them to remain in a secure and stable private rented sector. A State policy intervention - such as a subsidy - would be applied to bridge the gap between what people can afford, and what the housing market charges. Such a scheme would also facilitate and incentivise private investment into this sector. I expect that the details of the pilot scheme, including the locations to be targeted, will be announced when the scheme has been finalised by my Department in early 2016.<\/p><p>Affordable Rental is a separate scheme to the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). The implementation of the HAP scheme is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020<\/i>. To be eligible for HAP, a person must first apply for and be approved for social housing support by their local authority. Under the scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, payments are made electronically directly to the landlord on behalf of the tenant, and the tenancy agreement is between the HAP recipient and the private landlord. The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 deems HAP to be an appropriate form of social housing support and the HAP recipient pays a differential rent to the Local Authority.<\/p><p>The first phase of the statutory pilot for the HAP scheme commenced in September 2014 and has been introduced incrementally to 13 local authority areas to date. Dublin City Council is also implementing the HAP pilot scheme for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all four Dublin local authorities. There are now over 4,300 households being supported by HAP across the pilot local authority areas operating the scheme.<\/p><p>Affordable Rental is different to previous affordable housing schemes where the focus was on the purchase by individuals of the relevant housing units.  The Government&rsquo;s 2011 Housing Policy Statement announced that all affordable housing schemes were being stood down in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. A full independent review of the operation of Part V was completed, and a range of legislative changes were incorporated into the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, which was commenced on 1 September 2015.<\/p><p>The principal objectives of the 2015 amendments are to: <\/p><p>-  maximise the opportunity for the delivery of social housing units;<\/p><p>-  secure the principle of integrated mixed tenure developments; <\/p><p>-  address weaknesses in aspects of the existing legislation identified in a number of court judgements; and<\/p><p>-  enhance the economic viability of developments.<\/p><p>Section 31 of the Act of 2015 amends section 94 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 by changing to 10%, the percentage of land that must be provided for social and affordable housing in a housing development. With regard to the provision of affordable housing, local authorities have been advised by my Department that in the context of the current acute need, social housing should be the priority for local authorities in the first instance. Local authorities should seek agreement to fulfil Part V obligations in the form of the direct transfer of completed social housing units, where possible. Furthermore, where capital funding is available, local authorities should aim to enter Part V agreements for the acquisition of social housing units by the local authority, or an approved housing body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100093#WRAA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":470,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100093#WRAA00650"},{"type":"question","counter":471,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[36716\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100093#WRAA00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if the housing aid for older persons scheme and the housing adaptation grant for people with disabilities exclude works to address problems with an existing registered septic tank; if he is aware that such persons cannot avail of the existing septic tank grant unless they are randomly selected by the Environmental Protection Agency inspection programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":472,"content":"<p>Arising from the Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013, a grants scheme is available to assist with the cost of remediation of septic tanks and domestic waste water treatment systems which are deemed to require repair or upgrading, following inspection under the EPA&rsquo;s National Inspection Plan and the subsequent issue of an Advisory Notice by the local authority.
