We begin today with session 1 public hearing and discussion with Mary O'Dea, Central Bank-Financial Regulator.  In doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the 31st public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today we continue our hearings with senior officials from the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Regulator, who had key roles in the crisis period.<\/p><p>At this morning's session, we will hear from Ms Mary O'Dea.  Mary O'Dea joined the Central Bank in 1987.  She was the Financial Regulator's consumer director from 2003 through to July 2011 and sat on the board during this period.  In February 2009 to January 2010, she was acting chief executive of the Financial Regulator, having stepped in when Patrick Neary retired.  She is currently senior advisor to the executive director of Ireland at the World Bank.  Ms O'Dea, you are very welcome before the inquiry this morning.<\/p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.<\/p><p>In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The bank inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers that can be lawfully given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with on a summary or aggregate basis only, such that individual institutions will not be identified.<\/p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.<\/p><p>The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are now before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence to the inquiry.

Thank you, members of the committee.  The committee has asked me attend today to give evidence covering the period when I was acting chief executive of the Financial Regulator.  I was appointed acting chief executive in January of 2009 for a period of about three months initially.  This appointment was extended a number of times until the newly-appointed chief executive took up his position in January 2010.  At the time of my appointment, I held a statutory office of consumer director, a role I continued to hold throughout my year as acting CEO.<\/p><p>As consumer director I was responsible in law for consumer information and consumer protection codes.<\/p><p> My period as acting chief executive of the Financial Regulator started on 12 January 2009 and ended on 4 January 2010.  It was a crisis period on a number of fronts, including bank funding and liquidity, bank governance, investigation of legacy issues and putting a system in place to manage the bank guarantee scheme.  At the time, the organisation itself was also in crisis with uncertainty around the restructuring of the Central Bank and the regulator and its governance.  The financial crisis continued throughout 2009, internationally as well as domestically.  Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised in January and the Government announced capital injections for AIB and Bank of Ireland.  In April, the Government decided to set up the asset management company, NAMA, which would take larger non-performing loans from the balance sheets of the banks.  Confidence in the regulatory system was at an all-time low.  The system of supervision and regulation that had been in place internationally and in Ireland had proved to be inadequate.  At the same time, significant new responsibilities had been assigned to the regulator associated with the bank guarantee.  In addition, our investigations were producing new information on serious governance matters at certain banks.  As acting chief executive, I, along with my supervisory team, took the following actions with the full support of my board.  From the end of January, we significantly increased the volume and frequency of periodic reporting by each bank in the areas of profitability, impairment provisioning, regulatory capital, liquidity, lending and governance.  This information formed the basis of a comprehensive quarterly report to the Minister.  We introduced a more intrusive level of supervision requiring active and frequent engagement with domestic banks.  Officers of the regulator attended meetings of the boards and relevant committees, such as the credit committee, of these banks to assess at first hand if governance practices were working and to send a strong signal to the banks that the regulatory regime was different and that our expectations were different.  We monitored the strength and weaknesses of banks' governance systems and challenged banks where we felt that their processes were weak.  A report on governance issues was also included in the quarterly report to the Minister.<\/p><p> I set up an interim management structure to help address the fundamental issues we faced in banking supervision.  In January '09, I also advised the board that these arrangements were appropriate on an interim basis but that they were not a lasting solution.  A more permanent organisation structure, of course, could only be adopted when there was certainty as to the new regulatory structure, including its governance.  It was clear that the level of intensification required for banking supervision could only be achieved with the addition of significant extra resources.  We increased resources in the interim to manage the crisis more effectively, recruiting an additional 20 staff, including specialist staff where there was a deficiency, such as credit and liquidity analysts.  By the end of 2009 there was over 75 staff in banking supervision, 35 of whom were dealing with domestic banks.  We also set up a special investigations unit with around 25 to 30 seconded staff at various times and initiated a number of investigations into some specific events which had unfolded in 2008.  Part of these investigations were reported to the Garda at an early stage, while others continued throughout 2009 with a view to exercising the regulator's own administrative sanctions powers in respect of any regulatory breaches involved.  We took care to ensure that the use of the regulator's enforcement powers did not jeopardise any action on the part of the garda&iacute;.  As some of these matters are now subject to legal proceedings, I cannot, therefore, comment further.<\/p><p> To summarise for the committee, during my period as acting chief executive the new approach to regulating the guaranteed banks included a significant increase in information reporting requirements, more regular on-site presence at each bank, periodic attendance at board and committee meetings, greater review and scrutiny of management information, more frequent meetings with key officers, requirements for and reviews of business plans and challenging and monitoring of key variables affecting these plans, heightened focus on governance structures and processes and the introduction of a code of conduct on mortgage arrears and a statutory code of conduct for business lending.  We engaged with and challenged the banks regarding various revisions of their business models throughout 2009, as we considered how best to maintain a viable banking system.  In addition, the sensitivities of their profits, capital and funding to various assumptions were challenged to ensure that the plan was robust.  In meetings with senior credit executives, we consistently challenged the banks to make more realistic assumptions of the position of their loan portfolios.<\/p><p> During 2009, our focus was on crisis management, as we assessed the scale of potential problems.  Early in the year, our governance concerns were directed at the institutions in most difficulty.<\/p><p>We set out these concerns in our quarterly reports to the Minister.  For example, in June 2009 there were three banks who were seeking a new CEO, two who were seeking new chair, two seeking heads of finance and two without risk officers.   For new appointments we applied a fit and proper test.  This involved gathering information about a proposed person's qualifications, experience and personal history.  Aside from the boards of the banks, in 2009 it was clear that the expertise of staff in the lending areas was focused on sales and not on arrears management where there was a pressing need for expertise.  Furthermore, preparations for the transfer of loans to NAMA tied up the credit resources as this process was lengthy and complex.  During 2009 we used our supervisory powers extensively.  Seconded inspectors were appointed to carry out special investigations into possible breaches of law or regulatory provisions.  Over 70 separate engagements were held with banks at the level of acting CEO, ten administrative sanctions enforcement actions were concluded in that year, and fines which were ... ranged from &euro;7,500 to &euro;2.7 million were imposed with one disqualification direction.<\/p><p>  During 2009 the integrity of financial reporting gained heightened significance and in that year we fined one bank &euro;600,000 for breaches of regulatory reporting.  I believe it's fair to say that the supervisory teams were in constant dialogue with the banks during this time, probing the extent of their liquidity and solvency problems and addressing the emerging issues appropriately.   In March of '09 to ensure that our staff would feel comfortable heightening their concerns where there might be areas of disagreement, I circulated a written procedure to staff relating to the escalation of significant issues.  In June of that year, the Government announced the new regulatory structure and asked the chairman of the regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank to work together as much as possible in advance of implementing this new legislation.  In any event, this was necessary since almost all issues relating to banking at this stage had some sort of financial stability angle.  During 2009 there was one IMF Article IV mission to Dublin, which reported in June, and referred briefly to regulatory and supervisory initiatives that were already in train.  The main focus of the report was of managing the fiscal situation and the establishment of NAMA and a special resolution mechanism.  It also noted that Ireland needed to be guided by evolving European Union guidelines.   <\/p><p>  During my year as acting CEO in '09, the quality and effectiveness of policies and regulations both from a European and an international perspective had already been declared insufficient and reforms were well under way.  For example, in February of that year, the de Laroisi&eacute;re Group published its report.  The EU Commission had sought the report in '08 to advise on the future of European regulation and banking.  It formed the basis for many of the subsequent changes to European regulation and supervision.  Certain specific findings of the report are worth recalling, and I'll mention two quotes from the report, the first of which I misquoted slightly in my written statement.  It says that both by banks and supervisors there was \"a misunderstanding of the interaction between credit and liquidity\", and this led to \"an overestimation of the ability of financial firms as a whole to manage their risks and a corresponding underestimation of the capital they should hold\".  Having learned from the international crisis, the regulatory model in Europe is now much more intrusive and challenging with the associated significant additional staffing in place.  The Single Supervisory Mechanism has now changed the nature of banking regulation much more fundamentally in Ireland and elsewhere.  Ireland, as part of Europe, will benefit from the changes in the European structure such as the single resolution mechanism, which allows for banks participating in the banking union to be resolved appropriately if the needs arises in an efficient and centralised way.  And, most importantly, there is now a clearly defined mechanism for dealing with these issues, which will be very much recognised by the financial markets.<\/p><p>  The banking crisis resulted in an enormous cost for Ireland and for Irish people.  The Financial Regulator and the Central Bank did not take sufficiently strong action at an early stage in the build-up of the property bubble, which might have mitigated the worst effects.  In the environment of the time, I have no doubt that had the regulator taken stronger action to restrict lending, this would likely have been unpopular, could have been questioned and criticised, and pressure could have been brought to bear to reverse such action.  So, one lesson from the crisis is that the regulator, now the Central Bank, needs to be supported in making difficult decisions because for a regulatory system to be effective it will include taking preventative action at a time when this action is likely to be unpopular.  <\/p><p>  Ireland has now moved from a principles-based approach to an intrusive and challenging approach to regulation, and this is appropriate given the lessons we've learned from the crisis.<\/p><p>But we must be realistic in our assessment of what changes the regulatory and supervisory system can achieve.  For example, in the US, which has a much more rules based approach, there was also spectacular failures of banks and insurance companies.  There, many changes have now been adopted through new legislation and the conversation is not so much about more intrusive regulation but about stronger enforcement action, stronger consumer protection and changes to the culture of banks.  There is no perfect formula for a regulatory system that would prevent financial crises and, indeed, no regulator can operate a zero failure regime.  However, in working towards a better system, transparency and recognition of risk is, in my view, one of the most fundamental pillars of appropriate supervision.  The relationship between risk and return rarely changes, so that a careful examination of the relevant profit centres of any financial institution is a key part of identifying where the risk is.  It could be derivatives trading, commercial lending, credit card insurance but if the relative profit seems high, the likelihood is that there's an unknown or unrecognised risk for which the bank is being rewarded.  The bank's board, first and foremost, and then the regulator should follow the money, especially seemingly easy money, to probe these risks, both at an individual bank level and at a system level, paying particular attention to the most extreme scenarios.  Today, we are unlikely to know the genesis of the next crisis, so we need to have a system which can react quickly to changing circumstances, including domestic, European and international circumstances.  And finally, we also need to be confident to bring issues to the international arena where we see fractures in the system that are best addressed by regulators collectively.<\/p><p> Thank you, Chairman and committee.

We'd had no best practice to follow in relation to the super ... the supervision of the consumer issues.  If you recall, it was issues of consumer failing around National Irish Bank and around DIRT issues that led to the set up of the consumer area.  And if I may tell you how I think it worked better on the consumer area, we were able to build into the consumer protection code specific principles, such as you must act in the best interest of your consumer and we were able to codify that.  So when we wanted to take an enforcement action in relation to a consumer protection issue, we could look at not just the particular rule that may have been breached but also the principle - for example, acting in the best interest of the consumer - that was also breached.  So I think codifying those principles on a principles-based regulation on the consumer side, actually worked extremely well.  On the prudential side, of course, much more depended on very complex supervisory models and it was a completely different system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061000002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary O'Dea"},{"type":"speech","time":1433890800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>A few notes just as you were coming to the end of your opening comments there where you stated that the bank's board should follow the money and large profits would signify greater risk.

And at that stage, precisely what we did do was look very closely at credit risk.  So we looked at areas where we thought that there was problems, the build up of credit was one.  And seeing that, we built into our consumer protection code the concept of suitability in lending which didn't exist anywhere at the time.  And that included affordability, so we introduced the concept of affordability.  We also banned pre-approved credit cards.  Prior to that, 42,000 customers a month were getting some ... a letter in their door saying you have been pre-approved for extra credit.  We banned those completely.  We also introduced requirements in respect of consumer protection loans so that if you consolidated, you know, your car loan and holiday loan and all of that into one, the provider was then obliged to tell you precisely how much extra this cost.  So we introduced that requirement and we issued a number of warnings in relation to credit.  You recall in 2006 when the SSIAs matured, a lot of people were getting large sums of money then.  We were the only people who said \"please use your money to pay down debt\" and pointed out to consumers that this might be a good idea rather than use it for a different type of investment product.<\/p> <p>  So in my role as consumer director, I believe that's a principle that I followed a lot.  Having said that, I would also say that reflecting back now and listening to all of the various groups internationally saying what went wrong in the crisis, I do think that sometimes we make matters much more complex than they need to be.  And that's why I was thinking to myself that we can boil it down to be a lot more simple.

You're very welcome, Ms O'Dea.  Can I start by asking, prior to 2008 the regulator had proposed a number of initiatives to impose more explicit requirements on banks; such as directors compliance statements, corporate governance guidelines and fit and proper requirements.  What was your view of these initiatives, and can you describe the circumstances in which the board chose not to implement the original proposals for these initiatives?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061000002#N00900","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433890800,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Yes, thank you.  I have looked back over those - the various initiatives that came in.  To be honest, most of the issues that came to the board ... as I said, I was there at my statutory capacity as consumer director and I would have looked at them from ... through that lens.  With the benefit of hindsight, they should have been brought in earlier.  I think probably in a couple of cases the issue was over complicated, so for example if I take the case of directors compliance statement, there was a similar provision being brought in in company law, and there was a lot of toing and froing as to whether or not the provision that the regulator was bringing in was cutting across that, or was not in line with that.  And I think the issue was actually, now that I look back at it, made much more complicated than it needed to be.  I think it was also impacted by the, the statutory role ... that had been built in in relation to the growth of financial services where the regulator didn't want to introduce something that was uncompetitive.  So I think that also affected things, but as I look back at those, they should have been brought in earlier.  And actually, I contrasted with later in 2009, when we took a different approach in relation to directors loans and related party loans, were we knew their was a provision coming in under company law and nevertheless we moved ahead quickly and brought in the provision as the regulator.  And that was more onerous than the one in company law, but we still felt that was appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061000002#N01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary O'Dea"},{"type":"speech","time":1433890800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Ms O'Dea, did principles-led regulation die on the night of the bank guarantee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061000002#N01100","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433890800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I think principles-led, or principles-based regulation was clearly inadequate.

So we were extremely worried about it and we were constantly ... we ... you know, we got a phone call to say, there was a photograph of a bank, you know, with two people standing outside, we'd immediately be on to say \"Please rectify the situation\".

As regards the first theme of inquiry, I'm not close enough to the Irish experience of the previous decade to provide this knowledgeable committee with special insight.  That said, I'm well aware of the severe economic hardship brought about by the crisis.  Many Irish households and Irish firms still suffer from it today.  Hence all parties, including the Central Bank, must continue to do their utmost to prevent a replay of the banking crisis and to protect the financial stability of the country.  I'll share with you what I know of the reforms put in place here after the crisis and before I joined and I'll present the further European reforms that I have replaced them with in the past year and a half.<\/p> <p>  In October 2013, as I came into office, two independent, large-scale exercises were in train to assess the effectiveness of the domestic framework that had been designed and put in place by my predecessor, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, between 2010 and 2013.  The first exercise was a balance sheet assessment of the three remaining covered banks, conducted as part of the 2013 financial measures programme.  It concluded with a view that the covered banks were mostly in financial working order and required only moderate strengthening of their provisions, which they did bring into their year-end accounts, in the main.<\/p> <p>  The second large-scale exercise was the IMF review of Ireland's observance of the Basel core principles for effective banking supervision.<\/p><p>The IMF found that since the crisis has begun the Central Bank had taken substantive steps to rebuild its functions in financial regulation and supervision, including changes in the institutional setting, changes of senior staff, and increases in the quantity, albeit from a very low base, and the calibre of supervisory staff.  The IMF acknowledged the design and implementation of a proactive and intensive approach to banking supervision, the expansion of prudential requirements and improvement in enforcement powers.  Overall, the IMF ascribed to the Central Bank as of 2013 a satisfactory level of compliance with the aforementioned Basel core principles for effective banking supervision.<br\/><br\/>Taken together, these two reviews gave me sufficient assurance that Irish banks, and Irish banking supervision, albeit not without further progress, had been put on a more solid footing and that I could direct our 2014 efforts to moving towards the entry into force of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.  This entailed two major lines of work.  The first line of work was internal and organisational - I will describe its outcome later.  The second line of work was a comprehensive assessment.  Under the leadership of the ECB, we conducted, like all the other national supervisory authorities of the eurozone, an asset quality review and a stress test of the top 120 eurozone banking groups.  The results were published in the comprehensive assessment report of the ECB in October 2014.  The ECB found that around one out of five eurozone banking groups was in need of recapitalisation.  Out of the top four Irish banks, only Permanent TSB was found to need supplementary capital to fully withstand an adverse stress test.  PTSB subsequently raised the required capital in May of this year.<br\/><br\/>Let me now change tack and describe the overhaul of the banking regulatory framework.  Domestically, between 2010 and 2013, the Oireachtas and the Central Bank introduced several pieces of legislation, codes and regulations which much strengthened the requirements weighing on commercial banks and the hand of the Central Bank in supervising them and enforcing against their breaches.  These new requirements were additional to the prevailing European capital requirement directive.  Internationally, between 2010 and 2013, three large initiatives unfolded that are directly relevant to matters of the inquiry. <br\/><br\/>First, in 2010, the EU adopted the European system of financial supervision, comprising the European Systemic Risk Board and the three European supervisory authorities, including the European Banking Authority.  The ESRB is tasked with micro-prudential oversight in Europe, while the European Banking Authority is in charge of banking supervisory convergence and drafting secondary legislation.  Also in 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision addressed the inadequacies of its second agreement and replaced it by the third agreement of Basel III.  The third agreement formed a basis of the new prudential banking regulatory framework in Europe, adapted under the Irish Presidency of the EU and enshrined in the fourth capital requirement directive, CRD IV, and the capital requirement regulation, CRR.  They have been in force from 1 January 2014.<br\/><br\/>Finally in 2012, the EU Heads of State and Government decided on the banking union, which also started to come into force in 2014 as far as the Single Supervisory Mechanism is concerned.  The changes have been profound.  I will try to give you a flavour of the depth and breadth of this new, multifaceted regime starting with CRD IV and CRR.  Both the quantity and quality of capital that banks are required to hold are now much increased, whereas up to the end of 2013 banks could operate with as little as 2% of capital.  They need now at least 4.5% of a more tightly defined equity.  Furthermore, the new regulatory framework introduces the possibility for macro-prudential authorities to impose several additional capital requirements, known as buffers, to all banks in their jurisdiction.  The Central Bank has been designated as the macro-prudential authority for this purpose in March 2014.<br\/><br\/>From 1 January 2016, as agreed throughout Europe, all banks will also have to begin building one of these buffers, the capital conservation buffer, for an additional 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.  Liquidity requirements were domestic until then.  They are now harmonised at a much tighter level under the liquidity coverage ratio of the CRR.  The existing Central Bank liquidity requirements, which were introduced in January 2007, are being replaced by this LCR, which will be fully binding in 2018.  The CRR also introduced a net stabled funding obligation, and a leverage ratio requirement which caps banks assets to no more than 33 times Tier 1 capital.<br\/><br\/>Finally, the quality and granularity of banks&rsquo; regulatory reporting have also been significantly enhanced from January 2014 by the CRR, and subsequent guidelines and standards of the European Banking Authority covering financial reporting, credit risk, operational risk, own funds and capital adequacy ratios.  The transformation of the regulatory framework for banks, from what it was up to the end of 2013 to what it is becoming, does not stop at prudential supervisory requirements.  Lessons were also learned about the way to resolve the difficulties of banks that are failing or likely to fail.  This has entailed another change in regulatory framework through the adaption of the bank recovery and resolution directive, BRRD, and enactment of the Single Resolution Mechanism.  The BRRD and the Single Resolution Mechanism aim to create a predictable framework for resolving banks that fail in the future.  BRRD provides a toolkit for resolving banks, such as a bailing-in of unsecured liabilities in lieu of the bailing out of the banks by taxpayers.  The Central Bank has been designated as a national resolution authority, and is already working with the banks to double up resolution plans in line with BRRD requirements.  For larger eurozone banks, including our own, resolution decisions will be made from January of next year, by the single resolution board in Brussels<b>.  <\/b>It will avail of the new propounded resolution funds in the eurozone, which are to be gradually mutualised.<br\/><br\/>Let me now turn to the transformation of the supervision of eurozone banks from 2014.  As I mentioned earlier, in 2012, EU Heads of State and Government agreed to transfer the responsibility for supervising banks to the European level, with the establishment of the SSM.  Eurozone banks have come under the supervision of the ECB since 4 November 2014.  The ECB directly supervises the largest European banks, including Bank of Ireland, AIB, Permanent TSB, and Ulster Bank, with our assistance and that of other national supervisors.  We supervise the smaller banks, under the oversight of the ECB.<br\/><br\/>The revamped banking supervisory framework that was put in place at the Central Bank by Matthew Elderfield has mostly been superseded by the SSM.  Our domestic supervisory engagement cycle, our approval procedures, our internal supervisory guidance, enshrined in PRISM, were effective from 2011 to October 2014.  They have now been replaced by the prescriptions of the SSM supervisory manual, which are guided by a similar, if not more tough, intrusive and sceptical ethos.<br\/><br\/>Daily supervision of the larger banks is conducted by joint supervisory teams, mostly made of central bank staff, but always headed by an ECB co-ordinator based in Frankfurt.  These co-ordinators propose draft decisions, during consultation with us, to the supervisory board of the ECB where I sit.  When approved, these draft decisions are submitted to the governing council and finally signed by the President of the ECB.<br\/><br\/>In the Central Bank, banking supervision was re-organised and further strengthened in the course of 2014.  Approved headcount in banking supervision was brought up to 140, and the actual headcount has increased to 124.  We have thus reduced, albeit partially, the numerical gap with eurozone standards.  Instead of two generalist divisions, we now have three: one is dedicated to ongoing supervision; one to specialist expertise; and a wholly new third division carries out on-site inspections year-round.  This structure aligns the Central Bank with the organisational requirements of the SSM and further enhances our supervision.<\/p><p> Let me conclude by restating a few key messages.  In our country, the institutional arrangement of financial regulation, the engagement framework and practice of prudential banking supervision were overhauled during the tenure of Matthew Elderfield in the wake of our domestic banking crisis.  As of 2013, much repair had been achieved.  On the European stage, the lessons of the global banking crisis resulted in an overhaul of regulation, supervision and resolution that has started unfolding at the end of 2013.  While the EFSF was put in place in 2011, CRD IV, CRR and BRRD come gradually into force from 2014 up to the end of the decade.  The SSM is operational since November 2014 and the SRB will assume its functions in January 2016.  These new European regulations and institutional arrangements have, in the main, superseded the domestic response of 2010-2013 to our national banking crisis and they are designed to address the challenges of public banking oversight and resolution at a European level, in the area of national decision making that prevailed until 2013.

We don't have ... there is no credit unions so the small loans are also part of the business model of the banks.  Then, I guess, the structure of the economy is such that there is more industry to finance, so there is more industry financing.  Aircraft leasing, aircraft financing and shipping is also done within the banks and not outside of the banks.

There are wider risks in the financial system and they are being addressed through a great many regulations, such as securities financing, CSDR, SFDR and all of these regulations that will unfold.  There is something quite important I think that is outside of my remit but it is very important, is the accounting part.  We are still working with accounts that are based on incurred losses, not expected losses.  For an insurance supervisor this is astonishing and they will have to wait until the end of the decade to move to expected losses in the accounts of banks.  This is really bad.  Another thing which I think is really problematic is the tax advantage which is given to debt financing, so we are just encouraging a debt finance economy instead of an equity finance economy.

If I may take it ... the committee through my opening statement.  Thank you.  Ireland&rsquo;s banking and economic crash should never have happened, should never have been allowed to happen, with all the consequences of huge increases in unemployment, rising emigration, enormous debt, suicides, etc., that we have seen. As well as addressing the aspects that I have been asked to deal with by the joint committee, I would like to talk about our experiences from my perspective as the head of the economics function in the Central Bank from 2005 until 2009.<\/p> <p>   In his report on the crisis, Professor Honohan described what happened here as a world-beating property bubble.  As early as around the turn of the millennium, the head of the IMF Article 4 mission to Ireland, James Morsink ... I remember him saying to us that a country could not prosper on the basis of selling property to one another at increasingly elevated prices - an obvious truism.  The huge excesses here are well known, but I think that it is worth recalling some examples.  As Donal Donovan and Antoin Murphy have noted in their book on the crash, the size of Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet in 2007 was six times what it was in 2001.  The former chief executive of Bank of Ireland himself has stated that it took Bank of Ireland 200 years to grow its balance sheet to &euro;100 billion; it took only four further years for the second &euro;100 billion to be added on to reach &euro;200 billion.  And, of course, Bank of Ireland was the most conservative of all the Irish banks.  A further example of the absurd mania at its height was the fact that a small site in Ballsbridge was acquired for &euro;174 million at the height of the crisis -at the height of the boom, I should say - and purchased not so long ago for &euro;22 million, that&rsquo;s a fall of 87% ... you know, an indication of the huge excesses that we experienced.<\/p> <p>  If I can turn to the independence of the Central Bank, as you know, the Central Bank&rsquo;s independence is established in law, essentially as a result of the EU treaties and the ECB statute.  There's a reason why central banks are legally independent - so that they can take tough, unpopular decisions when required, without regard to populist government priorities.  This applies, in particular, to monetary policy issues.  However, it has to be asked how independent the Central Bank was on other matters.  Patrick Honohan, in his report, stated that the authorities displayed undue deference to the banks.  In my view, this applied equally to the authorities&rsquo; relationship with Government.  Was the Central Bank going to act independently, and to possibly take unpopular decisions, if the Governor was always appointed by the Minister, with whom he had worked intimately for many years prior to his appointment, and with the Secretary General of the Department of Finance always serving on the board of the bank?  Further, the boards of the Central Bank and regulator were also heavily weighted with political supporters of Government.  In practice, it was my experience that any concerns or issues raised by staff for airing in the public arena were invariably watered down so as not to reflect adversely on matters of concern to Government.  That was an undesirable state of affairs.  While vested interests can be cheerleaders for asset prices, the authorities have a duty to be unflinching, straight and upfront on these matters.<\/p> <p>  I think it would be useful for me to reflect on the governance arrangements in the Central Bank.  The decision-making entities in the bank in my time were the board and the Governor.  The staff provided reports and advice to the board and Governor through the director general and deputy director general - what we economists would call the \"kitchen cabinet\", if you like.  Now, some time ago, Dr. T. K. Whitaker, perhaps Ireland&rsquo;s most eminent public servant, regretted the passing of the stage where public servants gave their advice and opinions objectively without reference to political or populist issues, or to anticipate what might be welcomed by the Minister.  In the Central Bank, it was difficult to get views through that might impinge on vested interests.  For example, as land and property prices escalated to bizarre and absurd levels, I had written, in a low key way for the bank&rsquo;s bulletin ... comment in its quarterly bulletin, that there was a need to consider the issue of rezoning more land for building in order to increase housing supply .  That&rsquo;s also an issue of course of continuing relevance at present.  I saw Colm McCarthy writing in the newspaper last Sunday about that.  But that was blocked from reaching a higher level in the bank in the light, in my view, of political and property interests on the bank&rsquo;s board.  Of course, as the demand mania for property took off against the background of restrictive zoning which limited the supply of housing, the inevitable result was huge property price inflation.<\/p> <p>  I think I should also say a few words about the relationship between the Central Bank and IFSRA &ndash; the Financial Regulatory Authority - at least from the perspective of the economics function in the bank.  While, at the operational level, the bank interacted with the banks through market operations - in the wholesale payment system target, for example - there was little or no contact after 2003, when the new regulator was set up, on major policy matters.  As far as I could see, contact with banks was primarily effected through IFSRA.  This was such that at a certain point, I think towards the mid-noughties, the Governor began to arrange high- level meetings with the main banks at occasional intervals to discuss ... discuss the big issues.  I would have attended quite a lot of these.  Further, in the bank, we had no knowledge of the large exposures of the banks to individual developers.  Such data were rigorously concealed from my level in the bank.  Of course, we were aware that banks&rsquo; aggregate lending was increasing enormously and was concentrated in the property sector.  I had a discussion with one of the consultants that was brought into IFSRA after the crash.  I mentioned to him the name of one large developer, he, in turn, asked me how much I thought that ... that developer might have outstanding in borrowings.  I suggested &euro;1 billion; he said I could triple it.  That, and newspaper reports that 15 borrowers from Anglo Irish Bank had borrowings in excess of &euro;750 million each, together with the disclosure at your inquiry here that 20 developers had total borrowings of between &euro;21 billion and &euro;22 billion, were news to me.<\/p> <p>  It's sometimes said that nobody seemed to know that a property boom or bubble was developing.  That's ... that is completely incorrect in my view.  You will recall, for example, that, in his evidence to your committee here, Peter Nyberg - himself the author of a report on the collapse - asserted that it was obvious that a property-lending mania was afoot.  At the decision-making levels in the bank, either people were unaware of what was happening, despite the clear evidence, or they were aware and chose to do nothing.  Either way, it all seems quite incomprehensible to me.<\/p> <p>  While the bank, in its public utterances, presented a low-key assessment of what was happening, that is not to say that it was not fully aware of the major excesses.<\/p><p> While the bank in its public utterances presented a low-key assessment of what was happening, that is not to say it was not fully aware of the major excesses.  The annual financial stability reports reviewed comprehensively what was happening and Patrick Honohan&rsquo;s report acknowledged that the three major excesses were well recognised in the FSRs, the Financial Stability Reports: there was the huge increase in bank lending, the concentration of this lending in the property sector, and the very large reliance on the ... by the banks on potentially volatile wholesale funding.  The main body of the stability reports set out extensively how almost all indicators were pointing massively in the wrong direction.  By contrast, the overall assessment and tone which reflected the views of the two boards tended to be reassuring &ndash; talking of a soft landing, and so on.  In fact, I should say that one member of the board did have grave doubts, to the effect that I can recollect his words still ringing in my ear, \"It was all a house of cards and would all end in tears\".  However, his views appear not to have had any impact on policy-making in the bank.  Notwithstanding that director&rsquo;s views, it was probably necessary, in any event, to present such a rather hopeful overall assessment in public since the Central Bank could hardly conclude that the banks were about to collapse.  However, whatever the published assessment, the authorities should have been working assiduously behind the scenes to curb the huge excesses and reckless lending of the banks &ndash; egregious risk-taking, as Patrick Honohan has termed it recently in his speech.<\/p><p> I don't want to go right through the whole thing, but I point out on page six of my opening statement there that, as another confirmation of us being aware of the problems emerging, the governor and his letters to this minister pre-budget frequently flagged the very high increase in the bank lending and the property prices and by implication, the natures of something above that.  So it wasn't as if we were unaware of these things.  In fact, you may recollect, the government itself, through the department of the environment had around ... I think it was 1999 ... requested three reports from the economist, Peter Bacon, to assess what could be done to alleviate rising property prices.<\/p><p> Around that time, a memo was sent from the economics function of the bank to the then governor, recommending that bank lending to the property sector needed to be reined in.  For many years in the past, some of you may recollect the Central Bank had actually imposed credit ceilings on banks in the interest of prudence.  The response to the note, which was sent up to the governor, was that he would have to consider bringing this proposal to the board, which is fair enough.  However, at the top of the note were the words, evidently added subsequent to the first comment, \"That is out of the question\".  I have a copy of that memo as well.<\/p><p> Other specific responses given to me in reply to my pleas to rein in the banks were, verbatim: \"The Central Bank is not going to disadvantage the Irish banking sector\", and \"The Central Bank is not going to collapse the construction sector\", when, you know, construction sector really took off and we were completing 90,000 houses, or close to that, in 2006.  On another occasion, when bank lending to the property sector was increasing at the astronomical rate of 65% year on year, I urged a very senior member of the Financial Regulator staff, that bank lending to the property sector needed to be curtailed.  The response that I was given was that the lending was secured on property &ndash; that's true in almost all other property-related banking crashes that proved to be worthless when property prices crashed from unsustainable levels.  I, personally, was also specifically prevented from bringing forward to the bank&rsquo;s financial stability committee, data on house price levels across Europe that showed the extraordinary heights prices had reached here relative to elsewhere.  In fact, prices here were higher than anywhere else in Europe, any capital city, Amsterdam, Brussels, etc, except for central London.  And of course, central London is a special case where you've got Arab sheikhs and Russian oligarchs and so on, buying properties.  So, the net result was that the powers-that-be preferred to adopt an ostrich-like approach to the massive problem.  I offer a few more examples there of the extent to which people were not willing to recognise the problem that was emerging at the top of page 8.<\/p><p> If I may go on ... in fact, in addition to the red flags in the stability reports, which Patrick Honohan recognised in his report, a financial expert has also reviewed the annual reports of the Central Bank over the years in the journal studies of spring 2009 and he has come to the same conclusion that the authorities were well aware of the dangerous situation that was developing, but decided to do nothing.  In fact, what Peter Nyberg, who interviewed me ... the author of the Banking report ... he kept asking me \"Why did nobody do anything?\" ... several times \"Why did nobody do anything?\"  And I am afraid that the answer has to be that the authorities simply did not wish to do anything.  And actually, Peter Nyberg also asked me why I did not publish a newspaper article on the bubble.  I said to him that that would have been highly unorthodox - it would be like a civil servant, you know, writing an article in the newspaper, criticising the minister of financial policy ... it just wouldn't be on ... in any event, I don't think it would've had an effect at a time when the Taoiseach was saying that anyone who was questioning the sustainability of what was happening should go and commit suicide.  And in fact, you should recollect in the event when Morgan Kelly ... Professor Morgan Kelly wrote about the probability of a crash, he was derided - he was literally shouted down at an economics conference where he was presenting his paper on the property market.  So, you know, people didn't want to know.<\/p><p> In fact, one also has to ask whether there was any appreciation in the commercial banks that things were getting out of hand.  On the face of it, it would seem that certain divisions of the banks &ndash; maybe the capital markets divisions - were in fact well aware that we were experiencing a property bubble.  You have to ask, \"Why else would the two main banks have decided to sell off their headquarters buildings and major landmark branches at colossal prices at the height of the bubble?\"  Was it the case that their lending colleagues in the banks were, at the same time, even financing, in whole or in part, the acquisition of these premises?  And from the Central Bank side, you know, one has to ask, \"How did the Central Bank see the erosion of the banks&rsquo; deposit base being halted as the Central Bank pumped increasingly vast amounts of liquidity into the banks to prop them up?\"  In fact, you may be aware of the fact that the total ... the maximum amount ... or at its peak rather, the amount of liquidity pumped out into the banks was &euro;140 billion, you know, with the ... both from the Central Bank and the ECB.  I mean, once you spell that out, that's &euro;140,000 million - there are 12 digits in that.  So, you can well understand why the ECB was jumping up and down when the accommodation provided to Irish banks was at ... was at that massive level.<\/p><p> Now, if may I turn to a few words about the role of economists in the Central Bank.  During the critical period 2000 to 2007 when the property mania was at its height, none amongst the top 3 executives in the bank was an economist &ndash; not that economists are the fount of all wisdom, I would have to admit.  This would have been less of an issue if there was a willingness to listen to the views of economists, I would admit.  You may recollect the Canadian expert, Rob Wright, saying to you here that he noted the relatively small number of economists employed in the department of finance, having 7% of staff being economists compared with 60% in Canada&rsquo;s department of finance.  This aversion to economists really carried over to the Central Bank, I would admit, and was part of the problem.<\/p><p> In addition, the Financial Regulator employed very few economists.  A member of top management in the bank put it to me on one occasion, that the bank wants economists and other specialists to be \"on tap but not on top\".  So, economists were in a sort of cul-de-sac.  And this rather recalls the episode in the early 1920s when the governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, said to the chief economist, \"You are not here to tell us what to do, but to explain to us why we have done it\".<\/p><p> However, it is the norm now in almost all central banks for economists to occupy the great majority of the top decision-making positions for the obvious reason that central banks are primarily concerned with issues in the area of macro-economics, monetary policy and financial economics.  On the other hand, in Ireland, the top positions in both the bank and Financial Regulator were filled traditionally by administrators and accountants.  Accountants by their work and training are concerned with detail, but do they always see the bigger picture?  The clean bill of health given by external auditors to all the banks right up to and even beyond the crash would suggest otherwise.  In fact, you may recollect, I checked it out there on the website, the Anglo-Irish bank profits in November 2008 were declared to be &euro;784 million and that was post the Lehman's problem in September 2008.  It would seem to me that accountants tend take a more backward-looking perspective on a balance sheet ... I mean, that's maybe what they're expected to do ... whereas examining a balance sheet from an economics perspective would entail a more forward-looking consideration.  Perhaps, in the wake of the crash, now, it could be argued that the type of appointments within the Central Bank structure, has lurched too far in the other direction, with economists predominating at the top of the bank and regulatory function.  In my view, there should be a diversity of skills and backgrounds at the highest level of the bank and Financial Regulator.<\/p><p> Having said that, it is quite extraordinary that, at the highest level, there seemed to be a blindness to the fact that there had been a whole series of recent property-related banking crashes - we had them in Japan, Finland, Sweden, the savings and loan sector in the US, Norway, the Lawson mini-boom in the UK 1989, 1990.  Of course, the sub-prime crisis in the US itself and the related securitisation of mortgage assets that led to massive losses for many international banks was also a property-related phenomenon.  And one shouldn't forget that in the years leading up to the crash, the Bank for International Settlements, the BIS, of which Ireland, through the Central Bank, is a shareholder, had also been warning consistently for some time about the runaway evolution of asset prices with wholly inadequate attention being paid to risk.<\/p><p>Despite all of that, there seemed to be little interest in such experiences elsewhere, with the implicit belief that they had little relevance for Ireland.  In my view, this was a manifestation of a closed mind and an unwillingness to learn.  While economists were well aware of these banking debacles, their relevance to Ireland did not seem to register at a level where it should have done.  The view seemed to be, as the clich&eacute; has it, that the time ... this time is different, or we are experiencing a new paradigm.  <br\/><br\/>Now, some people suggest that it was the collapse of Lehman's that brought down the Irish banks.  Now that event didn't help clearly, as Lehman's failure did greatly affect liquidity flows, interbank lending, etc.  However, as the UCC economist, Seamus Coffey, noted in a radio interview some time ago:<blockquote>Ireland's crash derived from developments between 2002 and 2007.  Our problem was a pre-existing property bubble, before Lehman's hit.<\/blockquote>And related to the fact of the enormous increase in bank lending, Irish banks of course were significantly dependent on borrowing from the wholesale markets, which were greatly affected by the Lehman's event.  Countries that had no such bubble, small countries like Belgium, the Netherlands, and Finland, they experienced some problems associated with the failure of Lehman's, but nothing on the scale of Ireland's banking crash and collapse.  Our problem was a banking insolvency one.  As Professor Honohan's report put it, the source of our problems was homegrown.  Those who suggest that Lehman's brought us down are almost wholly wrong, and are merely seeking an external scapegoat, not the first time this would have happened in Ireland, in my view.  <br\/><br\/>It was also suggested that, being in the eurozone, we were the victims of huge capital inflows to Ireland.  This again is a fairly thin argument.  Ireland participated in a quasi-monetary union with the UK from 1825 to 1979, when we joined the EMS.  We have plenty of experience of living in a monetary union.  We also joined the euro with our eyes open.  If monetary conditions were not particularly optimal from Ireland's point of view, the corollary was that other policies should be used to deliver the appropriate economic conditions.  This would have meant,<i>inter alia<\/i>, restrictive fiscal policy as well as a tightening of bank regulation.  However, this would have run counter to the naive populist policies of the then Government.  <br\/><br\/>In summary, it was crystal clear from about the turn of the millennium, and even before, Ireland was experiencing a major property bubble; &quot;a world beating one&quot;, in Professor Honohan's words.  It is not credible that those who ought to have been aware of what was happening were in the dark.  One can only surmise that, as Professor Alan Ahearne has said here to your committee, too many people were benefitting from the boom time for prudence avoidance ... prudent avoidance measures to have been taken.  Such necessary measures would not have been popular, but that should not weigh with those whose duty it was to ensure the country did not experience the catastrophe that we so painfully and unnecessarily suffered.  <br\/><br\/>Now I know, Chairman, that you want to derive some lessons from the crisis too, so I've jotted down a couple of points there, but I will leave it to yourselves, you know, to take those on board as you see fit.

Michael McDowell, sometime in or around early September 2006, made a comment about it, the housing market was slowing down anyway but the speculation over stamp duty certainly had an immediate impact upon it, and the ... there was a slowdown in purchase as well.  There was an assessment that the housing ... that the housing sector and construction sector was 24% of the Irish economy, twice of what it should have actually been, there was a whole load of information there with regard to loan-to-values, 100% mortgages, and, as was borne out later, that there was a structural deficit as well that was going to be faced because a lot of taxes were based upon consumption, and if consumption dropped, as we saw with the entry to the bailout programme, there was a shortfall of &euro;30 billion.

I think the OECD, this chap van den Noord and somebody else did a special article.  They made the point that if ... People were talking about fundamentals in relation to the property market here.  But when you think of it, the fundamentals would have been things like peoples' incomes and population and so on.  That is fair enough.  That drives the demand for housing, but that should not drive the price of housing.  If the demand for televisions goes up, for example, you don't expect the price of televisions to go through the roof.  In the case of housing, a house can't be produced as quickly as a television set.  That is where the zoning issue comes in, because housing has to be somewhat elastic in supply.  If it is not, you have got a big price increase when demand increases.<\/p> <p>  The OECD analysis, I think it was van den Noord and somebody else who wrote the article, I will glance at it again, they pointed out that if you look at the demand for housing and the fundamentals, if in the estimation period for your demand function, if the determining factors are actually themselves influenced by the boom, you are explaining boom prices in terms of boom explanatory factors, but that is not correct.  So they went back, because you are explaining boom in terms of booms which is circular.<\/p><p>They went back and said if you abstract from the boom period and you look at the econometric analysis up to, whatever it was, 1998, and you extrapolate further on from that, then, they said, the overvaluation is 50% and I wouldn't disagree with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061000002#VVV01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433890800,"counter":1439,"content":"<p>How did they come to the conclusion of soft ... like, I accept what you're saying about their underlying analysis but their final diagnosis-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061000002#WWW00200","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433890800,"counter":1440,"content":"<p>Well that ... yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061000002#WWW00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1433890800,"counter":1441,"content":"<p>-----was contrasting to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061000002#WWW00400","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433890800,"counter":1442,"content":"<p>Yes, well that's where the puzzle arises because just as the IMF ... if you look at the detailed ... the annex, annex 1, where the technocrats would be doing this sophisticated exercise.

Can we ask Mr. O'Connell to provide such a memo?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061000002#BBBB00800","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1433890800,"counter":1570,"content":"<p>Yes, we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061000002#BBBB00900","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1433890800,"counter":1571,"content":"<p>Okay, can we get that for-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061000002#BBBB01000","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433890800,"counter":1572,"content":"<p>Sorry, I've been asked for it already, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061000002#BBBB01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1433890800,"counter":1573,"content":"<p>So thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061000002#BBBB01200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1433890800,"counter":1574,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061000002#BBBB01300","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1433890800,"counter":1575,"content":"<p>Okay.

There's a footnote, I think, where ... that specifically relates to yourself in terms of further information, if it's required.  It would indicate at that time that there was still time to take action to cool down house prices.  You referred earlier to the Bacon report, okay, the measures were in place, they were then removed, but the graph hadn't, and evidence earlier to this committee would show that the graph increased significantly 2003 onwards.  But in 2003, there was still time.  So can I ask you what action did you take, if any, regarding to the findings of this report, and if no actions were actually taken, and what I mean by specific actions is that you go in and you put a tight position on something, what actions, if any, were taken?

The second line, which not many people have focused on, is the institutional shareholders who had their funds at stake, investment management funds and so on - life companies.  They had large shareholdings in the banks.  I mean, why did they not rein in the banks?  And then behind that, you had the authorities - the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  So, they all had their part to play.
