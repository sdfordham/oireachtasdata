This Commission proposal has yet to go through the wide ranging and extensive EU procedures before any part of it becomes a reality.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the Plan is to explore how EU policies and instruments can ensure that the EU&rsquo;s industrial and skills base will be able to deliver required defence capabilities in view of current and future security challenges.  As part of this Plan, the Commission has proposed the creation of a European Defence Fund.  In addition, the Plan aims to offer supports to SMEs, start-ups and other suppliers to the defence industry.  There are also proposals in the Plan to increase transparency in relation to Defence procurement under the existing EU Procurement Directives.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Defence Fund is to promote research and innovation and contribute to the strengthening of the European defence technology and industrial base, and to further stimulate the development of key defence capabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach attended the European Council meeting in Bratislava on 15 December last, where a number of issues including economic and social development, migration, security, Russia and Ukraine, and the situation in Syria were on the agenda.  Specifically, in relation to the European Defence Action Plan, the European Council welcomed the Commission&rsquo;s proposals as its contribution to developing European security and defence policy.  The Council stressed the importance of fully involving Member States in the proposals that will be brought forward.  In addition, the Commission was invited to make proposals in the first semester of 2017 for the establishment of a European Defence Fund. <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan proposes that the European Investment Bank may have a role to play in relation to financing certain parts of the European defence supply.  The Action Plan notes that the EIB group may already finance investments in research and development by European companies where civilian and dual use technologies are concerned with a view to subsequent commercialisation in civilian applications.  The Commission&rsquo;s Communication also noted that any expansion in the EIB&rsquo;s current activities in the area could take place within the limitations of the Treaties and subject to the agreement of the EIB&rsquo;s Governing Bodies.   <\/p>  <p>  The most recent European Council in December, invited the European Investment Bank to examine steps with a view to supporting investments in defence research and development activities.  I expect that the EIB will now take forward this examination. <\/p>  <p>  For certain member States in the EU, defence is a significant contributor to their economies, representing an EU industry of &euro;100 billion with 1.5 million direct and indirect employees.  Ireland does not have an issue with funding of defence research.  As I have stated previously to the House, for Ireland to have a well-equipped and capability driven defence forces we must support the funding of defence research.  And as we are all aware, Ireland may not have a defence industry but this does not stop Ireland tapping into this funding through our well established dual-use companies and technologies.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the proposals in the Action Plan fully acknowledge and reaffirm that Defence remains a Member State prerogative.

The Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 provides for the investigation of military administrative grievances separately to those of the general public service.  While parallel structures exist for military personnel, they are dealt with in no less favourable way, having regard to their unique duties, than their civilian counterparts.

No loading is applied to an insured person if, on 1 May 2015, the person had a continuous period of cover in an in-patient indemnity health insurance scheme prior to that date.  The primary purpose of introducing Lifetime Community Rating is to encourage people to purchase private health insurance at a younger age.<\/p>  <p>  The regulation governing the Lifetime Community Rating loadings applies equally to all citizens of the State irrespective of the nature of any health care provided by their employer.  It is a matter, therefore, for each citizen to decide whether they wish to take out private health insurance in order to avoid additional loadings for taking out insurance after the age of 34. <\/p>  <p>  Commissioned Officers are currently provided with private health care by the State, i.e., they can be referred by the Defence Forces for private\/semi-private treatment in civilian hospitals or private consultants&rsquo; rooms, where it is deemed necessary. <\/p>  <p>  Meetings have been held between officials of my Department and the Department of Health on 30 April 2015 and 8 January 2016 to discuss the position of Defence Forces personnel with regard to the Lifetime Community Rating regulations.

Air transport for these patients is currently provided in three ways: Air Corps fixed-wing and rotor-wing aircraft; Irish Coast Guard rotor-wing aircraft; and private air ambulance providers.<\/p>  <p>  As one of the components of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps contributes to all roles assigned by Government including responsibilities relating to the provision of Aid to the Civil Power and maritime security tasks.  Like other elements of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps also undertakes other roles in accordance with agreed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).   <\/p>  <p>  In this context, the Department of Defence has an SLA with the Department of Health and the HSE for the Air Corps to use its fleet of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to transport patients and medical teams between hospitals within Ireland and abroad, on an as available basis.  In accordance with the SLA, this availability is dependent upon the availability of suitable aircraft, the availability of flying crews and the suitability of weather conditions.  The terms of the SLA do not provide for the Air Corps to deliver a dedicated, 24\/7 transport service. <\/p>  <p>  This approach was maintained in the White Paper on Defence (2015) which stated that the Air Corps will continue to provide an emergency inter-hospital transfer service in support of the HSE on an as available basis.  This means that fixed or rotary wing aircraft are not required to be on standby for this purpose.  However, if such aircraft and personnel are available when requested for a mission, they can be deployed.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that the level of availability of Air Corps aircraft for inter-hospital transfer tasks has reduced.  This is largely because the Air Corp has experienced retirements of highly experienced personnel which is outstripping the recruitment and training of replacement personnel.  This has led to a shortage of experienced pilots which has reduced the number of available flying crews.  Due to these crew shortages, aircraft availability for the inter-hospital air ambulance service is reduced. <\/p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to address the H.R. challenges for the Defence Forces.  In the case of the Air Corps, there are 28 cadets, in 3 classes, undergoing the various stages of the Air Corps cadetship to become pilots.  In addition, targeted recruitment will continue in 2017.

No. 383 of 2016, I commenced those provisions of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 as necessary to get the new Authority up and running, particularly in terms of its membership and appointment.  On 29 September 2016, I signed the Order appointing 1 October 2016 as the official &ldquo;establishment day&rdquo; of the Regulatory Authority as provided under section 7 of the 2015 Act - S.I. No. 507 of 2016 refers.  In conjunction with these initial steps the nomination, approval and appointment procedures for the members of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority set out in Part 2 of the 2015 Act were also completed.  This has included the required resolutions approving such appointment having been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  Dr. Don Thornhill has also been appointed as Chairperson of the Regulatory Authority in accordance with the Act. <\/p>  <p>  The Authority, which has eleven members including a lay majority and lay-Chairperson, held its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016 and has been meeting monthly since then with its most recent meeting having taken place on 19 January 2017.  Initial office accommodation has been provided for the Authority by my Department along with the secondment of an officer at Assistant Principal level in support of its start-up phase.  Funding support of &euro;1 million has also been provided to the new Authority by my Department in December on a strictly recoupable basis as the new Authority will be self-funding by levy.  In the building up of capacity and resources to become fully operational, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has recently appointed a person to fulfil the duties of its Chief Executive on a solely interim basis to drive the initial start-up phase.  At the same time this will enable the Authority to prepare the way for the public recruitment of a full-time Chief Executive in the coming months having had the opportunity to more clearly identify its existing and future management needs and capacities in real time. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the commencement of Part 2 of the 2015 Act, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the Honourable Society of the King's Inns have furnished the Legal Services Regulatory Authority with copies of their professional codes as required within one month of the Authority's establishment under section 23(6)(a).  On 5 December 2016, under S.I. No. 630 of 2016, I also commenced sections 118 to 120 of the 2015 Act.  These provisions set statutory delivery deadlines for the completion of public consultations and reports by the new Regulatory Authority on the specified matters concerned.  These relate to Legal Partnerships, Multi-Disciplinary Practices and certain restrictions on barristers in relation to direct access on contentious matters and the holding of clients' monies.  The working focus right now is on the managed roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions in tandem with the phased commencement during the year of the various remaining Parts and provisions of the 2015 Act. <\/p>  <p>  The current focus includes the phased commencement of respective sections or Parts of the 2015 Act such as those dealing with the introduction of a more transparent legal cost regime, the establishment of a Roll of Practising Barristers and the separate introduction under the Act of Pre-Action Protocols.  It also includes the transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator which is a substantial structural reform of an office of the High Court and for which I have also introduced and commenced additional supporting measures under the Courts Bill which was enacted on 28 December 2016.  Following these steps the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced. <\/p>  <p>  These are substantial tasks involving detailed preparation for which I know the new Authority, with the direct engagement of its interim Chief Executive, is actively building up its working resources in the short term.  My Department and the new Regulatory Authority will, therefore, continue to liaise closely to ensure that we can successfully coordinate the identification of necessary steps and commencement, from my side as Minister, and delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various provisions concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500082#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Judgments","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500082#WRD01800"},{"type":"question","counter":120,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[7504\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500082#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons who received custodial sentences for the non-payment of fines broken down by period of sentence, for example, less than one week, more than one week and less than one month, one to three months and other, for each of the years 2013, 2014 and 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1269","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":121,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service has provided the following information:<table><tr><th>Warrant Overall Length Grp<\/th><th>Year 2013<\/th><th>Year 2014<\/th><th>Year 2015<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Less than 1 week <\/td><td>3,568<\/td><td>3,856<\/td><td>4,230<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1 week to less than a month<\/td><td>3,959<\/td><td>4,570<\/td><td>5,211<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1 month to less than 3 months<\/td><td>413<\/td><td>395<\/td><td>306<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3 months to less than 6 months<\/td><td>180<\/td><td>157<\/td><td>134<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6 months to less than 12 months<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12 months to less than 24 months<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>8,121<\/td><td>8,979<\/td><td>9,883<\/td><\/tr><\/table>For all fines imposed up to 10th January, 2016, the Judge, in fixing the fine, also fixed the period of time to be spent in prison if the fine wasn't paid.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that with effect from 11 January, 2016 the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 was commenced with the new system for the payment and recovery of fines being implemented on that date.

Such training is based on national experiences as well as best practice approaches developed internationally by agencies such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO).  The training includes interviewing skills techniques which encompass awareness of the needs of vulnerable groups such as children and victims of torture and of other types of degrading treatment.  Training on cultural awareness as well as the effect of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other psychological issues is also provided.  Caseworkers are also trained to deal sensitively with applicants from different cultural backgrounds in the assessment of their applications including when conducting interviews.  It is also the policy to ensure that each individual international protection applicant is treated with courtesy and professionalism at all times. <\/p>  <p>  Training is provided by in-house trainers and, from time to time, by outside experts such as the UNHCR, Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and the Centre for the Care of  Survivors of Torture (SPIRASI).<\/p>  <p>  Members of the Office for the Promotion and Integration Office (OPMI), Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), and the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) have received anti-racism and diversity training.  In addition, senior members of staff within the relocation side of the IRPP have received child protection training from Tusla (the Child and Family Agency) and training in dealing with unaccompanied minors and victims of human trafficking through the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  It is also worth noting that in advance of any refugees being resettled or relocated, staff of the IRPP carry out research into the ethnic and cultural aspects of the new communities before they arrive and also consult with the new refugees on aspects of their culture which might differ from our norms in order to prepare the receiving community for their arrival.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has also developed a suite of training programmes for persons working with refugees which includes modules dealing with persons experiencing trauma  and sexual violence.

Prior to the implementation of this policy in 2015, a number of two-day training programmes were delivered to centre staff by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre in conjunction with Women's Aid.

This is in the context of passenger numbers at Dublin Airport reaching record levels last year with almost 28 million passengers using the airport.  On the rare occasions that passengers may experience delays this can be for a variety of reasons including congestion arising in the terminal building due to the number of passengers disembarking from flights at peak daily periods, delayed flights due to weather conditions, or other factors including the conducting of enhanced checks on passengers or current building works in one of the immigration areas which has reduced the space available. The Irish immigration authorities have an excellent relationship with the DAA and work closely together to address queue management issues where they arise. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the protection of our borders is a matter of the utmost priority and that checks undertaken on passengers must be thorough and appropriate.  Issues may arise that require further processing and checks of individual passengers but every reasonable effort is made to minimise the impact on travellers.  In this context, and in line with developments in other EU Member States, my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to progress a broad series of initiatives to strengthen border security.  For example, since November 2016 an automated connection to INTERPOL&rsquo;s Lost and Stolen Travel Documents database was rolled out to all international airports and seaports.  In the first eight weeks of operating systematic checks against this Database over 700,000 documents were searched, with a number of people having been refused entry to Ireland on the basis of an alert on the system having been triggered.  This has not had any significant impact on immigration processing times. <\/p>  <p>  Later this year the Irish immigration authorities will begin to process Advance Passenger Information on flights into the State from outside the EU and preparations are also under way to implement the EU Directive on Passenger Name Records (PNR).  These systems will provide further protection for our borders against crime, terrorism and illegal immigration threats.  In addition, I expect to be in a position to award a contract for the provision of automatic border control (ABC) gates in the next few months and to begin installation at Dublin airport later in the year.  This facility will be available for EU nationals with e-passports to effectively self-immigrate through the airport.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) will this year take on the front line checks in Terminal 2 at Dublin airport (they already carry out this function in Terminal 1 and the Transit area of Terminal 2) which will release further Garda&iacute; for core policing duties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500083#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Resources","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500083#WRE01950"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[7739\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500083#WRE02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she is considering additional resources to allow garda&iacute; to issue summonses to cyclists found to break road laws; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":164,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed by the Commissioner that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.  This accelerated recruitment is complemented by substantial investment in resources that will support the delivery of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 which sets key strategic objectives for Roads Policing and will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s road policing plans over the next 5 years. <\/p>  <p>  The 2017 Garda Policing Plan has indicated a commitment to increase the number of personnel dedicated to traffic duties by 10% to reflect the increasing numbers of personnel across the entire organisation.  Given that there was no recruitment for a period of five years it will take some time before there are fully trained officers available to replace the number of personnel that have retired across the entire organisation, including traffic.  However, the Commissioner has confirmed that the personnel requirements of the Garda Traffic Corps is currently being assessed to identifying the most vulnerable areas in regard to serious traffic collisions and the level of compliance to Road Traffic Legislation.  Combined with this data I am informed that the Assistant Commissioner, Roads Policing and Major Event\/Emergency Management is currently assessing the capacity of Divisions and Districts to identify and target areas where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could accelerate the deployment of personnel to traffic in 2017.  The filling of the vacancies identified will be conducted on a structured basis and will be further enhanced with the recently renewed recruitment campaigns to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  Road traffic legislation is, of course, also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.  As roads policing is the duty of every Garda member, this duty is not reserved for Garda members of the Traffic Corps.

I am committed to ensuring that we have in place the most effective possible mechanism for the investigation of complaints.  GSOC has been operating for 10 years now, and I believe it is time to examine fundamentally the legislative provisions relating to the manner in which complaints are made to and dealt with by GSOC.  Accordingly, it is my intention to seek Government approval to prepare Heads of a Bill to amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to enable GSOC to carry out its functions more effectively and efficiently and help continue to ensure proper accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in providing a service to the public.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Inspectorate performs a very valuable service in seeking to ensure that the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is maintained.  The Garda Inspectorate report 'Changing Policing in Ireland', published in December 2015, is a comprehensive report into all aspects of the administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Last July the Government approved my proposals for a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which combines the Government&rsquo;s response to the report of the Garda Inspectorate and the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government to increase the visibility, effectiveness and responsiveness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In this regard it sets out an overall vision of a Garda workforce of 21,000 comprising 15,000 Garda&iacute;, 2,000 Reserves and 4,000 civilians to be to be achieved incrementally over five years in tandem with the delivery of reforms.  The delivery of this overall vision is supported by the provision in Budget 2017 for the recruitment of 800 trainee Garda&iacute;, up to 500 additional civilian staff and 300 Reserves.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published in June 2016, is the vehicle for the implementation of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s wide range of recommendations aimed at her organisation.  I have asked the Policing Authority to monitor implementation of these agreed recommendations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to report to me on progress on a quarterly basis. <\/p>  <p>  I believe the new Code of Ethics, prepared by the Policing Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conjunction with a range of stakeholders, is an important milestone.  I also welcome the commitments in the Policing Plan 2017 to embed this Code into the day to day thinking and actions of the organisation. <\/p>  <p>  Both I and the Government are committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to provide a modern, efficient and accountable policing service and I have every confidence that the new structures which have been put in place are a significant contribution to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500084#WRF02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[7055\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500084#WRF02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will report on the Government's plans for the referendum committed to in the programme for Government on Article 41.2.1 of the Constitution.","asker":"1224","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>The Programme for a Partnership Government, published in May 2016, states that we will hold a referendum on Article 41.2.1 of the Constitution regarding a &ldquo;woman&rsquo;s life within the home&rdquo;.

By law, financial institutions must ensure that information they hold or give to anyone else, including the Irish Credit Bureau, about an individual\u00a0is correct and up to date.  A person who discovers errors in their credit report should\u00a0ask the\u00a0lender to correct these details.  If they are not satisfied with the actions of the lender and they fail to resolve the matter through the internal complaints mechanism, they could consider making a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO)\u00a0about the lender.  The FSO does not deal with complaints about the Irish Credit Bureau.  Alternatively the matter could be referred to\u00a0the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  Steps are now under way for the establishment of a mandatory credit reporting system on a statutory basis.  The Credit Reporting Act 2013 provides that the Central Bank of Ireland shall establish, maintain and operate a statutory central credit register.  Under the Act there will be an onus on credit information providers to take reasonable steps to verify that the information it obtains from its customers for the purposes of the register is accurate and complete.  Also, in addition to the protections and rights available under the Data Protection Acts, borrowers will also have the right to obtain their credit report at any time and they will also be entitled to request the correction of any information on the register relating to them where it is inaccurate, incomplete or not up to date.  As previously indicated, the Central Credit Register\u00a0is being\u00a0implemented on a phased basis with phase 1 focusing on lending to consumers and phase 2 focusing on lending to businesses.  Data submission by lenders for phase 1 will commence after 30 June 2017.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I should also state that the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO) is independent in the performance of his statutory functions.<\/p>  <p>  However, I have been informed by the\u00a0Financial Services Ombudsman\u00a0that he has adopted a new model of Dispute Resolution since February 2016.  This new model involves considerably more interaction with the parties, particularly in terms of speaking with the parties at an early stage of the process and attempting to resolve their complaint through mediation.  I understand that this approach is delivering a faster, more efficient and effective service and that the majority of complaints are now being resolved through this means.  The Financial Services Ombudsman aims to complete 80% of complaints, resolved through mediation, within a 3 month period.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  If a settlement is not reached through mediation, the complaint will be progressed to investigation and adjudication.  This is a more formal and lengthy process as all the evidence must be gathered, exchanged and considered in accordance with fair procedures.  The adjudication process is more formal than the dispute resolution process and will occasionally require an oral hearing where evidence is taken under oath.  The Ombudsman has informed me that the length of time taken to adjudicate will depend on the number of exchanges that take place between the parties.  Typically this can take about 4-6 months.  The Ombudsman's aim is to issue a finding within 3 months of when the exchanges between the parties are complete (in 90% of cases).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500085#WRG01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Powers","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500085#WRG01450"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[7561\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500085#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 137 of 24 January 2017, if he will reply in full to the question in view of the fact section 851A(8) of the Tax Consolidation Act 1997 states that a charity cannot avail of the confidentiality if it fails in its tax obligations.

A whole raft of new\u00a0European\u00a0regulations have strengthened controls over the banking system and have resulted in an overhaul of regulation, supervision and resolution regimes. <\/p>  <p>  The Capital Requirements Directive and\u00a0Regulation\u00a0which came into force in 2014, brought about significant enhancements in the quality and quantity of capital that banks are required to hold and the\u00a0setting of minimum liquidity requirements.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism have transformed the framework for dealing with failing banks and are designed to provide a financial safety net and a means for recovery and resolution with minimum disruption to the sovereign. <\/p>  <p>  The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is now responsible for the prudential supervision framework for euro area banks.  Building on the single rulebook, the SSM transfers key supervisory tasks for significant banks in the euro area to the European Central\u00a0Bank.  Daily banking supervision is now conducted according to a detailed ECB supervisory manual including frequent and intrusive onsite inspections. <\/p>  <p>  This new regulatory framework is supported by the presence of new European institutions, such as the Single Resolution Board,\u00a0to address weaknesses in the institutional structures and to improve cross-border cooperation, ensuring consistent enforcement of rules and systemic oversight. <\/p>  <p>  While the reform of our statutory code for the financial services sector has been and continues to be driven by comprehensive reforms brought forward at EU level, a number of significant domestic legislative reforms have been undertaken\u00a0towards building a strengthened domestic regulatory framework for the financial services sector which complements the\u00a0strategically important reforms at EU level. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 created a single fully-integrated Central Bank of Ireland with a unitary board, the Central Bank Commission, chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank.  The unitary Central Bank structure gives the Commission members a more complete remit over prudential regulation and financial stability issues.  The Central Bank has demonstrated its willingness to use its macro prudential, micro prudential and enforcement powers to strengthen capital and liquidity positions, business model resilience and governance arrangements of the banks operating in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 introduced a more assertive supervisory approach and overhauled the Central Banks powers across a wide range of areas and throughout the regulatory life cycle of firms.  It strengthened the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely assertive prudential interventions.  The Act also provided the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of financial services legislation in line with international best practice.<\/p>  <p>  The 2013 Act provides the Central Bank with early intervention powers including the power to issue directions to regulated entities and their related undertakings to address emerging problems, including where the entity has become or is likely to become unable to meet its obligations to its creditors or its customers, or where it is not maintaining or is unlikely to be in a position to maintain adequate capital or other financial resources.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The 2013 Act also gave the Central Bank extensive powers to make regulations including in relation to areas identified as weak points in the post crisis analysis such as risk management, consumer protection, audit processes and lending, including lending to 'restricted persons' such as those who work within the bank or family members.<\/p>  <p>  Measures have also been introduced to address cultural change and behaviour in banking.  In 2011, the new Fitness and Probity regime was rolled out by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.  The regime provides for new powers to be exercised by the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has put in place a pre-approval process for persons who apply for relevant positions, known as Pre-Approval Controlled Functions, in regulated firms, to ensure that they meet the required standards of fitness and probity.  If concerns arise that a person or persons in Controlled Functions in a regulated firm do not meet the required standards of fitness and probity, they may be investigated by the Central Bank and could ultimately be prohibited from carrying out a Controlled Function in their firm, or any other regulated firm.  These powers enable the\u00a0Central Bank to ensure that the people in senior roles are capable, competent and act with integrity. <\/p>  <p>  The 2013 (Supervision and Enforcement) Act also provides that if, in the opinion of the Bank, a person has engaged, is engaging or is about to engage in a contravention the Bank may apply to the Court for an order restraining the person from engaging in the conduct. <\/p>  <p>  At present, a one year on report is being prepared for\u00a0Minister of State Murphy on the findings and recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas\u00a0Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  This report will set out the actions taken to date in relation to the Committee's Report and whether further actions are necessary\u00a0for consideration by Government and\/or other bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500086#WRH00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[7580\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500086#WRH01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the possible re-emergence of a bonus based pay culture in the banking system which could increase the probability of reckless behaviour in future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":239,"content":"<p>The excesses seen in the banking system prior to 2008 has resulted in significant changes to the regulatory framework facing the industry.

In this regard, as part of a range of competition measures agreed with the European Commission under their respective EU-Restructuring plans AIB and Permanent TSB are required to provide funding to a public awareness campaign (such campaign to be facilitated by Ireland through an appropriate state body) to raise awareness and promote customer switching.

To the end of September 2016, over 10,600 SMEs, operating across all business and economic sectors of the Irish economy, have benefited from &euro;458 million of SBCI loans.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government also sets out a number of important and practical measures which can be taken to improve the position of variable rate mortgage holders.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has been asked to work with the Central Bank to set out options for Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and to improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.  This work has commenced and draft options are expected to be available for discussion within the coming months.  In addition, the Central Bank has commenced a programme of research into switching in the mortgage market which will, inter alia, inform its consideration of the need for a mortgage switching code. <\/p>  <p>  On the subject of competition in this sector, the Deputy will be aware that I welcomed the announcement on 9 February that KBC Group had carried out a strategic review of the bank's operations in Ireland and confirmed its long standing commitment of almost 40 years to the Irish market.  I understand that Ireland will be designated as one of the group's core markets, alongside Belgium, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary.  The Bank said that it will pursue a \"fully-fledged sustainable growth strategy based on implementation of a 'Digital First' customer-centric strategy.\"  It is worth highlighting that KBC Bank Ireland has 15 branches and provides important competition in the Irish domestic banking market.  KBC said that it believes that \"Ireland is a sound and attractive market which presents opportunities and in which we wish to play a more active role\".  I\u00a0welcome this independent acknowledgement of the progress made under this Government.  The bank also referred to \"significant improvements in cost competitiveness in recent years, a stronger trend in domestic spending augmented by favourable demographics, a supportive fiscal stance and a favourable borrowing environment\" in explaining its reasons for remaining in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  This is another strong sign of the recovery in Ireland and shows confidence by KBC Ireland in the Irish economy.  The fact that KBC is committed to remaining in Ireland ensures continuing competition in the Irish banking market which is good for consumers.  Such commitment is also a mark of the recovering market and of its continuing growth potential into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500086#WRH01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Schemes","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500086#WRH01800"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[7586\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500086#WRH01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the staff of banks who are of the view that they were wrongfully moved off or denied a tracker rate mortgage are to be included in the tracker review being carried out by the banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>The Central Bank has confirmed that the scope of the Tracker Mortgage Examination covers all lenders which sold tracker mortgage accounts, including both for the family home and investment properties, up to the end of 2015.

There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons\/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.<\/p>  <p>  Each ETB will then prepare a report for the Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.<\/p>  <p>  In the subsequent implementation phase, where the level of demand for multi-denominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that.  There will be a role for the existing patron\/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.  It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.<\/p>  <p>  This new process for supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based around principles of transparency and cooperation.  Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the ETBs&rsquo; in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body.

Some of the issues which schools will be required to deal with under the charter include:<\/p>  <p>- Inviting feedback from students and parents and<\/p>  <p>- Providing better information about School Management and School Policies.<\/p>  <p>  Following consultation with our education partners, including the National Parents Council (Primary), National Parents Council (Post Primary) and the Irish Second-level Students Union, I will finalise national guidelines on a Parent and Student Charter.<\/p>  <p>  The draft Bill will now go to the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills for pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500087#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Junior Cycle Reform","counter":279,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500087#WRJ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":280,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[7515\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500087#WRJ01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will review the situation whereby\u00a0history is not deemed to be a core subject of the new junior cycle.","asker":"1278","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":281,"content":"<p>Through comparing education internationally, it has been found that in high performing education systems such as New Zealand, Queensland, Estonia and Finland, schools have been given greater autonomy and flexibility in the programmes they offer.<\/p>  <p>  When schools in Ireland are implementing the new Framework for Junior Cycle, they too will have the autonomy and flexibility to design programmes within the parameters of the framework, mindful in particular of the needs of their students and their teaching resources.  I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered to the discretion of the school, and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Because the total number of full subjects which can be done for assessment in junior cycle\u00a0is\u00a0ten, it is likely that schools will retain most or all of their current subjects in their junior cycle.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, over 90% of students choose History, although it is compulsory only in voluntary secondary schools, not much more than half our post-primary schools.  Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle.<\/p>  <p>  Schools across all sectors offer History. History teachers attract students to their subject through their own love and passion for History, and by engaging the natural curiosity of their students in, for example, the lives of people, the origins of the modern world and in objects and documents from the past.  History is generally the 5th most popular subject in the Junior Certificate examination.<\/p>  <p>  I have every confidence that, through the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle the place of History will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum. \u00a0A new specification for Junior Cycle History is being developed by the NCCA.  This involved extensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public, which finished recently, during which\u00a0over 200 submissions were\u00a0received.\u00a0 The new specification will be available for implementation in all schools from September 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate History syllabus attracts\u00a0about 25% of the total cohort of students.  The aim is to make the new specification for Junior Cycle History more attractive, so young people can see it as a realistic option, rather than focusing on learning content by heart.  Many people believe that uptake in senior cycle could be improved if the junior cycle History was made more attractive, more relevant and perhaps less of a race against time.<\/p>  <p>  In the new Framework for Junior Cycle, all schools are expected to provide opportunities for students to achieve 24 statements of learning over the period of junior cycle.  These statements include valuing local, national and international heritage and understanding the importance of the relationship between past and current events, the forces that drive change, and understanding the origins and impacts of social, economic and environmental aspects of the world around them.\u00a0 Even where students do not take History as a full subject, it is to be hoped that opportunities to achieve such statements through other forms of historical study can be provided to them.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum time allocated for subjects such as History will be 200 hours over the three years of junior cycle, or the equivalent of three 40-minute periods per week over three years.  For many schools, this will lead to an increased time provision for History as a subject, and it will no longer be nominally linked to Geography as previously.<\/p>  <p>  This new minimum time stipulation for History as a subject should allow not only for a deepening of a student's historical knowledge but also of his or her ability to analyse, interpret, write and develop historical skills more thoroughly.  Those very skills, and attitudes, can indeed be hugely important in ensuring that students are able to understand and interpret all forms of\u00a0 history, news and current affairs too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500087#WRJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Educational Psychological Service","counter":282,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500087#WRJ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":283,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[7521\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500087#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to set out in tabular form the name of each school in Dublin which does not have direct access to a National Educational Psychological Service psychologist for the purposes of carrying out an educational assessment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1362","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":284,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware my\u00a0Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides an educational psychological service to schools through the direct assignment of a NEPS psychologist and in some cases by providing schools access to the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) where schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.  SCPA is utilised, in the main, where as yet unfilled vacancies exist in NEPS staffing provision locally or where staffing resource is lost through extended leave (maternity, sick or carer&rsquo;s leave).<\/p>  <p>  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, there follows a list of schools in Dublin who currently derive this service through the above-mentioned SCPA scheme rather than through a NEPS psychologist.  In the case of these schools, NEPs psychologists may no longer be assigned to those schools as a result of retirement, resignation or transfer to another NEPs region.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service (PAS) maintain regional recruitment panels of qualified personnel to fill these vacancies.  During 2016, despite my Department's best efforts the panels did not produce recruits for NEPS in relation to all vacancies,\u00a0the panels were therefore closed.<\/p>  <p>  A new national recruitment competition was put in place last Autumn by PAS to fill all vacancies within all NEPS Regions.  The resulting interview process associated with this competition was recently completed\u00a0and recruitment panels for each NEPS region, including Dublin, will now be formed.  PAS will finalise the processing of the candidates, including Garda vetting, and propose each candidate in series to my Department Human Resources Section for contract negotiations and formal job offer.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the process will produce new NEPS psychologists for assignment to schools, including that to which the Deputy refers in his question, by the end of the current academic year.<\/p>  <p>  However it is important to point out that in cases where NEPS service is not available through staffing vacancy or temporary absence of staff, as described above, the schools affected continue to have access to a psychologist through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments to undertake pupil assessment work.<\/p>  <p>  I would also confirm\u00a0that all schools are able to access full NEP supports in the event of a critical incident\u00a0irrespective of their having ongoing access to an assigned NEPS psychologist or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500087#WRJ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":285,"content":"<p>List of Dublin City and County Schools who do not currently have access to a NEPS Psychologist to undertake pupils assessment but who have instead access to the SCPA Scheme for this purpose.

Depending on the circumstances of the school, e.g. fluctuating enrolment, accommodation available, there may be a variation in the size of the classes in the school.\u00a0 School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any one class is kept as low as possible, taking into account all of the above factors.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Given that the staffing schedule operates to a general average of one classroom teacher for every 27 pupils, if a school has a large class it generally also has a small class.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500088#WRK02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500088#WRK02900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Superannuation Schemes","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500088#WRK02800"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[7754\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500088#WRK02900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to provide pension entitlements to retained fire fighters who are paying a pension levy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>In 2008, retained fire-fighters were given the option of joining the Local Government Superannuation Scheme (LGSS) and receive a pension and retirement lump sum based on their pensionable remuneration and length of service.\u00a0 Retained fire-fighters who opted not to join the scheme receive, on retirement, a gratuity of 1\/8th of the annual retainer multiplied by the number of years of actual service (up to a maximum of four times the annual retainer).\u00a0 All retained fire-fighters appointed after 1 January 2013 must join the Single Public Service Pension Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 states that any public servant who is a member of a public service pension scheme, is entitled to a benefit under such a scheme, or receives a payment in lieu of membership of such a scheme, is subject to Pension Related Deduction (PRD) from their remuneration.\u00a0 Additional pension benefits do not arise as a result of this deduction.<\/p>  <p>  The payment of the retirement gratuity to retained firefighters who are not members of the LGSS is a payment in lieu of membership of a pension scheme and, as such, all retained fire-fighters, whether members of a public service pension scheme or not, are subject to the deduction outlined in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.

It applied in the same way from\u00a0that time to all new pensions awarded up to end-February 2012, which was the expiry date of a &quot;grace period&quot; during which the 2010 public service salary cuts were not reflected in new-award pension calculations.  The PSPR table applying to all of these pensions, as commenced on 1 January 2011 was as follows:<table><tr><th>Annualised amount of public service pension<\/th><th>Reduction<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;12,000<\/td><td>Exempt<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Any amount over &euro;12,000 but not over &euro;24,000<\/td><td>6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Any amount over &euro;24,000 but not over &euro;60,000<\/td><td>9%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Any amount over &euro;60,000 \u00a0<\/td><td>12%<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>On 1 January 2012 an adjustment affecting a very small number of pensions was introduced by way of a new top rate of PSPR, of 20%, applied to that portion on any PSPR-affected pension in excess of &euro;100,000.<\/p><p>On 1 July 2013, additional PSPR-based pension cuts were imposed as part of the further retrenchments of public service pay and pensions legislated under FEMPI 2013.  These additional cuts were confined to higher-value pensions, defined as those with a pre-PSPR value exceeding, at least, &euro;32,500, and were implemented in two ways.<\/p><p>First, the existing PSPR rates, which applied to qualifying pensions awarded up to up to end-February 2012, the &quot;grace period&quot; expiry date, were increased for all pensions with pre-PSPR values above &euro;34,132.<\/p><p>Second, post-February 2012-awarded pensions greater than &euro;32,500, which up to then had been exempt from PSPR, were subjected to a new group-specific PSPR rate regime, featuring lower\u00a0rates\u00a0than those applied to earlier-awarded pensions.  The low-rate regime in respect of these pensions reflected the fact that, unlike earlier-awarded pensions, those pensions\u00a0reflected actual rather than grace period-protected salary rates.<\/p><p>These 2013 changes effectively instituted three separate PSPR rate tables, differentiated by pension size relative to a threshold value, and by date of pension award.  Commencing 1 January 2016, PSPR as applied by reference to these three tables is being significantly reversed in three stages under FEMPI 2015.  This reversal is proceeding in three stages over the 2016 to 2018 period as follows:<\/p><p>On 1 January 2016, increases in the annual pension thresholds for PSPR application were activated.  These exemption threshold increases fully removed PSPR from a significant number of pensions with relatively lower values, while those pensions which continued to be impacted by PSPR received a boost of &euro;400 per year.<\/p><p>On 1 January 2017, additional PSPR amelioration, acting principally via further exemption threshold increases, fully removed PSPR from another significant tranche of public service pensioners, while at the same time boosting those pensions which remain affected by PSPR, in most cases, by up to &euro;500 per year.<\/p><p>On 1 January 2018, the third phase of PSPR amelioration will ensure that all PSPR-impacted pensions with values up to &euro;34,132 will be fully restored, meaning that PSPR will no longer affect such pensions, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR will get a boost of, in most cases, &euro;780 per year.<\/p><p>Over the 2016-2018 implementation period of these FEMPI 2015 PSPR changes, the PSPR exemption threshold will progressively expand as follows: In 2016, all pensions up to &euro;18,700 were exempt from PSPR; from 1 January 2017, all pensions below &euro;26,000 are now exempt from PSPR; and from 1 January 2018 all pensions up to &euro;34,132 will be exempt from PSPR.<\/p><p>This means that, when fully rolled-out from 1 January 2018, these PSPR amelioration steps will ensure that most public service pensioners are not affected by PSPR.\u00a0 All public service pensions with pre-PSPR values of up to &euro;34,132 will be fully exempt from PSPR from then on, while those pensioners not fully removed from the reach of PSPR will, in the majority of cases, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year.  The cost of these changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018.<\/p><p>In the past, the ocupational pensions received by public service pensioners were generally adjusted in line with changes in the wages or salary of the pensioner's grade at retirement.\u00a0 Sometime referred to as &quot;pay parity&quot;, this non-statutory\u00a0linkage lapsed in 2010 when pensions were left unchanged notwithstanding salary cuts at the beginning of that year affecting all public servants.  This pension protection, albeit tempered\u00a0from 2011 in some cases by the imposition of PSPR, has worked to the benefit of pensioners, as indeed have the &quot;grace periods&quot; in respect of new-award pensions which accompanied the public service salary cuts in 2010 and 2013.  PSPR is also being reduced at a faster pace and to a greater degree than\u00a0the ameliorisation of the pay reductions.<\/p><p>In light of these developments,\u00a0the issue of how to adjust the post-award value of public service pensions through appropriate pay or other linkages will be considered by Government in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500091#WRN01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works Projects","counter":403,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500091#WRN01300"},{"type":"question","counter":404,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[7660\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500091#WRN01400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the action the Office of Public Works plans to take to address a building (details supplied).","asker":"1350","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":405,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) is not the owner of the former Courthouse in Tipperary Town.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme was amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 which increased the level of asset contribution from 5% to 7.5% per annum.  This applied to new entrants to the Scheme after the enactment of the amendment and was required in order to ensure the sustainability of the Scheme in light of the increasing population of older people in Ireland.  There are no plans to change the level of asset contribution back to 5% per annum.<\/p>  <p>  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  It is important to note that a person's principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three year cap.  The Scheme has a number of other important safeguards built into the financial assessment which ensures that:<\/p>  <p>  - Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;<\/p>  <p>  - An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his\/her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater.  This is in recognition of the fact that, although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing;<\/p>  <p>  - If an applicant has a spouse\/partner remaining at home, he\/she will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;<\/p>  <p>  - If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;<\/p>  <p>  - Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence;<\/p>  <p>  - A person&rsquo;s eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drug Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these safeguards, where an applicant&rsquo;s assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate.  This is known as the Nursing Home Loan (Ancillary State Support), the purpose of which is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care.  A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage.<\/p>  <p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  A number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including recommendations relating to the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  This work is currently underway and the IFA has made a submission in this context to the Interdepartmental Group which is overseeing the implementation of certain recommendations contained in the Review.  The proposals put forward by the IFA are currently being considered.  Once all of the relevant Review recommendations have been considered, any amendments required to the Scheme will be identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500094#WRQ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme Data","counter":488,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500094#WRQ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":489,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[7525\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500094#WRQ01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of residential properties that have had to be sold at the request of the HSE legal department in order to make a settlement for the health care received by the owner.","asker":"1305","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":490,"content":"<p>Your question relates to operational matters within the HSE and accordingly has been referred to that organisation for direct reply to you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500094#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Data","counter":491,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500094#WRQ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":492,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[7546\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500094#WRQ01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of general practitioners who are practicing in Dublin South West per capita; the way this compares with other constituencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can\u00a0get high speed broadband \u00a0from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>The Broadband Intervention Strategy sets out a detailed service specification that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30 megabits per second download and 6 megabits upload to all citizens, be capable of providing for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand and ensure the availability of high quality wholesale services to allow retail competition to develop.<\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at shows the extent of the State Intervention area:<\/p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.

Air transport for these patients is currently provided in three ways: Air Corps fixed-wing and rotor-wing aircraft; Irish Coast Guard rotor-wing aircraft; and private air ambulance providers.  <\/p>  <p>  As one of the components of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps contributes to all roles assigned by Government including responsibilities relating to the provision of Aid to the Civil Power and maritime security tasks.  Like other elements of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps also undertakes other roles in accordance with agreed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).   <\/p>  <p>  In this context, the Department of Defence has an SLA with the Department of Health and the HSE for the Air Corps to use its fleet of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to transport patients and medical teams between hospitals within Ireland and abroad, on an as available basis.  In accordance with the SLA, this availability is dependent upon the availability of suitable aircraft, the availability of flying crews and the suitability of weather conditions.  The terms of the SLA do not provide for the Air Corps to deliver a dedicated, 24\/7 transport service. <\/p>  <p>  This approach was maintained in the White Paper on Defence (2015) which stated that the Air Corps will continue to provide an emergency inter-hospital transfer service in support of the HSE on an as available basis.  This means that fixed or rotary wing aircraft are not required to be on standby for this purpose.  However, if such aircraft and personnel are available when requested for a mission, they can be deployed.   <\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that the level of availability of Air Corps aircraft for inter-hospital transfer tasks has reduced.  This is largely because the Air Corp has experienced retirements of highly experienced personnel which is outstripping the recruitment and training of replacement personnel.  This has led to a shortage of experienced pilots which has reduced the number of available flying crews.  Due to these crew shortages, aircraft availability for the inter-hospital air ambulance service is reduced. <\/p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to address the H.R. challenges for the Defence Forces.  In the case of the Air Corps, there are 28 cadets, in 3 classes, undergoing the various stages of the Air Corps cadetship to become pilots. In addition, targeted recruitment will continue in 2017.  A new NCO promotion competition, to fill the ranks of Sergeants and above, including those in the Air Corps, has been launched.  Promotions from this competition will commence in Q3 2017.   <\/p>  <p>  My officials will continue to keep the Department of Health and the HSE fully informed of the situation in the Air Corps.  The Department of Health, the HSE, the Department of Defence and other key stakeholders are working together to optimise availability of air transport within current arrangements and to identify longer term options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500103#WRZ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Recruitment","counter":774,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500103#WRZ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":775,"qnumday":308,"qnumall":"[7755\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021500103#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which promotional vacancies remain to be filled in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":776,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to maintaining the stabilised strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500, comprising of 7,520 Army, 886 Air Corps and 1,094 Naval Service personnel,<b><\/b>as stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.

Of this figure, 25,250 Mandays will provide a minimum of seven (7) days annual paid training for all effective members of the Reserve.  It will also provided for fourteen (14) days paid training for all additional personnel recruited to the Reserve in 2017 and provide for career and specialist courses for selected members of the Reserve in line with Reserve priorities.
