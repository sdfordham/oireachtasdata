Such services will include a better range of Government services, financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses. The announcement by An Post is supported by an agreement reached with the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU) executive following three months of intensive negotiations, which has subsequently been endorsed by 80% of IPU members. <\/p>  <p>  The agreement represents a positive first step in reinvigorating our national post office network and making it a viable sustainable, modern and vibrant network for the future, capable of adapting to the changing environment in which it operates by providing a service that meets the needs of communities across the country, particularly in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  We are already seeing a number of important new business initiatives being progressed. <\/p>  <p>  A pilot e-Local service was launched by An Post last year in three districts- Bantry, Mullingar and Ennis. This service combines the strengths of online commerce with that of An Post mails network for the benefit of local business. It gives local business an edge over national and international online operators by connecting retailers with their customers both online and in person. A key feature of the eLocal.ie service is that An Post will give each retailer an online presence, displaying their goods and services, and enabling online orders.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its consideration of the financial position of An Post, Government agreed that further opportunities for Government business through the Post Office Network, particularly the payment of motor tax, should be explored.\u00a0 While Government policy is to offer Government services online, there is always likely to be a segment of the population that is not comfortable or proficient accessing online tools or services. The post office network is the obvious choice as the &ldquo;offline gateway&rdquo; for citizens with its nationwide network and existing strong relationship with offline citizens. My Department\u00a0has engaged with An Post and other relevant stakeholders such as the Office of Government Procurement, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and other Government Departments to assess how additional Government business might be channelled through the post office network. Discussions have been positive in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The first practical step that the Government is taking in this area is to rollout\u00a0the digital assist pilot programme. Under that programme, post offices will provide access to a wide range of Government services. Government funding of &euro;80,000 has\u00a0been secured, by\u00a0the Minister for Rural and Community Development, for the roll-out of the\u00a0pilot\u00a0scheme. Ten post offices will be equipped to help citizens with online Government interactions. The ten\u00a0pilot schemes will be located in rural post offices and will be in place later this year.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2018 the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection renewed her Department&rsquo;s contract with An Post to provide pensions, Child Benefit and other social welfare payments in cash at Post Offices. Last year&rsquo;s contract amounted to &euro;51 million for 33.6 million payments, and the value of the 2018 contract is expected to match that.\u00a0 This re-affirms Government policy which sees the post office network as a key piece of the country&rsquo;s financial and social infrastructure, particularly in rural areas.\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to actively encourage payment at post offices.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this the National Treasury Management Agency also provides significant business to An Post.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that there is concern regarding the potential closure of post offices.\u00a0 An Post have advised that under the terms of the new agreement between An Post and the IPU some postmasters who wish to retire will be offered a voluntary severance package. There will be no compulsory closures of Post Offices as a consequence of this new deal. Postmasters have until July 31st next to signal their intentions in this matter.\u00a0 It\u00a0is important to note that\u00a0a new protocol has been established which sets out how An Post will facilitate the continued provision of Post Office services in areas where an existing postmasters retires or ceases operating an existing Post Office. In such cases An Post will make an assessment on the future provision of post office services within the locality by reference to specific agreed criteria.<\/p>  <p>  Any individuals, groups or representatives concerned with the decision can apply to have An Post&rsquo;s decision reviewed through a new independent review process which will determine if An Post has correctly applied the criteria outlined in the protocol. Details of the independent review process will be specified in the notice detailing the decision of the future post office services within the relevant post office and will also be detailed on the An Post website.<\/p>  <p>  All avenues are being explored to ensure services available through the post office network are enhanced in order that we have a strong, sustainable,\u00a0customer focussed network<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100067#WRA02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"North-South Interconnector","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100067#WRA02100"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[23923\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100067#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if all procurement related activities will be halted pending the determination of the judicial review in view of the recent decision regarding an incinerator development in Northern Ireland and the impending judicial review of the proposed North-South Interconnector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[23924\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100067#WRA02300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if the procurement process that he approved some time ago will be halted in view of a judicial review in Northern Ireland in relation to the proposed North-South Interconnector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[23918\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100067#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the status of the North-South Interconnector project; and if the transmission lines will be undergrounded.","asker":"1225","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":26,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 22 and 47 together.<\/p>  <p>  The North South Interconnector, as proposed as an overhead line, has full planning permission in both Ireland and Northern Ireland.

At its heart is a commitment to transform Ireland into a low carbon society and economy by 2050 and envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the energy system by 80-95% relative to 1990 levels by 2050. The White Paper identifies the importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050 but also recognises that some fossil fuels will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in that transition period.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter target also being legally binding. <\/p><p>Overall, provisional SEAI analysis shows that 10.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2017 were met from renewable sources, with an expectation that\u00a0Ireland will achieve\u00a0at least 80%\u00a0of its 16% renewable energy target by 2020. The SEAI has also estimated that the contribution of renewables avoided \u00a0&euro;276 million of fossil fuel imports in 2017.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government commits to supporting the transition of peat power plants to greater amounts of biomass whilst mindful of the need to develop a sustainable indigenous supply chain and support employment in the regions. Furthermore, the National Mitigation Plan 2017\u00a0restates the Government's commitment to move from a fossil fuel based electricity system to a low carbon power system. <\/p><p>The Government has also\u00a0adopted a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy including the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes.\u00a0\u00a0In addition,\u00a0my Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030.<\/p><p>Ireland aims to increase renewable energy in transport by increasing the use of sustainable biofuels and by the increased deployment of Electric Vehicles.

This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. This exercise is ongoing, and has been\u00a0included in the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme. It is planned to have dedicated Geographic Information System (GIS) resources in place to support this. <\/p>  <p>  - Under Action 40\u00a0of\u00a0the 2016 Report, a review was conducted to identify recommendations to address blackspots. This work is continuing in 2018 under a focus group to inform future policy development and initiatives. The focus group will provide\u00a0guidance with respect to\u00a0categories of locations where high quality mobile phone coverage should be made available as a priority.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - ComReg is also delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem\u00a0with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness,\u00a0allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage.

Furthermore, micro generation will be required given the scale of our climate and energy ambition as laid out in the National Development Plan and Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed pilot scheme for micro generation which I announced earlier this year will target solar PV and self-consumption amongst domestic customers.  It is important that before a scheme like this is introduced, the likely demand for the scheme is understood and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) are currently undertaking a study which will inform the final design of this pilot.  It is equally important that safety, technical and training requirements are established in advance of this pilot scheme being rolled out.<\/p>  <p>  The data gathered during the pilot scheme will inform potential future phases of support for micro generation in Ireland that may be appropriate, as we align with the ambition of the recast Renewable\u00a0Energy\u00a0Directive which recognises the rights, entitlements and obligations of renewable self-consumers. This pilot scheme will deliver on ambitions and commitments made\u00a0in the Energy White Paper and the Programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, my Department assessed micro generation, across a number of renewable electricity generating technologies, as part of the economic analysis to underpin the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). The assessment identified technical and financial challenges which may need to be addressed before a broader support scheme for micro generation can be introduced.

Exchequer investment of &euro;4 billion, along with taxation and regulatory measures, are provided for under the NDP.\u00a0This will be necessary\u00a0to drive the\u00a0step change in energy performance in the residential sector.

A number of actions which are outlined in the NMP and LTRS are already underway to achieve these levels of retrofit and promote deep retrofit of buildings across all building types and tenure.  Those actions which relate specifically to homes are outlined below.<\/p><p>- The Deep Retrofit Pilot Scheme is investigating how to create a scalable offering for the deep retrofit of Ireland&rsquo;s housing stock to an A3 Building Energy Rating (BER), while building consumer demand and contractor capacity for deep retrofit. Under the scheme Government is funding up to 50% of the total capital and project management costs for homes that achieve an A3 Building Energy Rating post retrofit.  This will inform a model that can make deep retrofit available to individual homeowners on a larger scale post 2020, and critically will help Ireland move away from fossil fuels to clean renewable heating systems, such as solar and heat pumps.<\/p><p>- The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides grant aid to homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their home. Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures such as insulation, heating controls and solar thermal technology.

Two reports published by the regulator last year concluded that Irish energy markets are competitive, with the most recently available EU comparable electricity and gas supplier switching data also pointing towards a competitive Irish market.  The CRU is an independent statutory body, and solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions. The regulation of retail market prices for electricity in Ireland ended in 2011 and for gas prices in 2014.  The Government has no statutory function in the monitoring or setting of electricity prices, with the main thrust of Government policy on energy costs focused on the competitive market and supports for energy efficiency. Government\u00a0policy has supported competition\u00a0to drive down prices, and data from approved price comparison sites\u00a0(<i>www.bonkers.ie<\/i>and <i>www.switcher.ie<\/i>) shows that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers. <\/p><p>Consistent with European energy policy, the electricity and gas markets in Ireland are commercial, liberalised, and competitive.

It does not set out targets for specific renewable technologies; rather it provides a framework to guide policy between now and 2030.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030.  The design of the new scheme included an extensive independent economic appraisal which compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, at various scales to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.  The analysis indicates that a number of renewable technologies have converging and in some cases overlapping cost ranges, and I note with interest the continued falling costs of renewable technologies over the past year, such as offshore wind and solar PV.  I expect to bring the final design proposals on the new RESS to Government shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The 2014 Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) sets out the Government&rsquo;s policy for the sustainable development of our abundant offshore renewable energy resources.\u00a0\u00a0The Strategic Environmental Assessment that underpinned the OREDP found that 4,500 MW of offshore wind and 1,500 MW of wave and tidal generation could be sustainably developed in Irish waters in the period to 2030.\u00a0 An interim review of the OREDP\u00a0was\u00a0recently published on my Department&rsquo;s website.

It is difficult to estimate the impact these actions will have, at this early stage.  The EU and the other parties to the JCPOA are continuing to implement the agreement, and so the UN and EU sanctions on Iran, which were directly in force in this country and which were removed under the JCPOA, will not be re-imposed. The US sanctions which had caused the most difficulty for Irish firms seeking to do business in Iran were those in the banking and financial sector, and for the most part these were not suspended under the JCPOA and had remained in operation.  This had led to a continued caution by many European banks, including Irish banks, in handling funds originating in Iran.  This had undoubtedly slowed the regrowth of trade with Iran following the JCPOA. This will unfortunately continue to be a factor.

As Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland has informed me that its members, since 1 June 2014, have factored data on all completed flood defence schemes, provided by the OPW, into their overall assessment of flood risk.  This information has been provided as part of the information sharing arrangement entered into between OPW and Insurance Ireland (Memorandum of Understanding).  The nature of this arrangement is such that it has led to a greater availability of flood cover in previously higher risk areas.  For instance, the most recent Insurance Ireland survey of approximately 85% of the property insurance market in Ireland indicates that of the completed defence schemes, 90% of policies in areas benefiting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while there has been an increase from 66% to 77% of policies in areas benefiting from demountable defences including flood cover.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy should note that the Insurance Ireland\/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the above information flow and to improve the understanding of issues between both parties.\u00a0 The working group allows for the sharing of relevant data on completed flood defence schemes.  In this regard, the OPW has also provided a significant amount of detailed data in relation to adequacy and resourcing of flood warning systems, and mobilisation, efficacy, maintenance and development of demountable defences to Insurance Ireland.

The Roadmap takes a holistic view of pension issues and details specific measures presented under six strands. <\/p>  <p>  While implementation of the Roadmap is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and her Department, the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group (IDPRTG) was\u00a0allocated a number of specific measures\u00a0under the Roadmap.  The IDPRTG is chaired by the Department of Finance and includes representatives from this Department as well as from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Revenue and the Pensions Authority. <\/p>  <p>  Strand 3 of the Roadmap is concerned with improving the\u00a0governance and regulation of supplementary pensions to, among other things, achieve scale, improve standards and simplify the provision of pensions.

Under EET, and subject to certain restrictions, pension contributions and investment returns on pension funds are exempted from tax but pension drawdown is taxed at prevailing tax rates through the income tax system in retirement.  On this basis, it is considered that\u00a0marginal relief represents a significant incentive to encourage pension savings and to a degree represents a deferral of taxation.<\/p>  <p>  The IDPRTG is currently considering this issue and will report by the end of the third quarter.\u00a0 As Minister for Finance, tax policy is a matter for me and my Department, and the work of the IDPRTG will be considered in that context. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100069#WRC04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100069#WRC05000"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[24186\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100069#WRC05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the mechanism used by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to obtain the services of an intermediary in order to provide finance for businesses; his views on whether the SBCI is distorting the market for finance; his further views on whether there are state aid issues in relation to SBCI's use of intermediaries and specifically the use of one intermediary over another; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":154,"content":"<p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is Ireland&rsquo;s national promotional institution.  The purpose of the SBCI is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs that address failures in the Irish SME finance market as well as encouraging competition, innovation and the efficient and effective use of EU resources and financial instruments.  The SBCI achieves this purpose through both on-lending and risk-sharing activities.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the SBCI does not lend directly, rather it acts as a wholesale financial institution providing low cost, long-term wholesale funding to both bank and non-bank finance providers.  These partner financial institutions are known as on-lenders. These on-lenders must in turn pass on the benefit of that low cost finance to the final SME borrowers.  This is a key requirement in order for the SBCI to comply with state aid rules.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the SBCI that the process of engaging in an agreement with a new on-lender generally involves a potential on-lender completing a standard template business plan and due diligence questionnaire.  The SBCI then conducts a thorough and detailed assessment of the potential on-lender, including a consideration of its financial strength and repayment capacity; underwriting ability and credit risk management; operational capacity; and management and governance track record.  Ultimately, the final decision to enter in to an agreement with a new on-lender is made by the board of directors of the SBCI.<\/p>  <p>  The Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and the Brexit Loan Scheme that I announced in Budget 2016 and Budget 2017 respectively clearly demonstrate the SBCI&rsquo;s risk-sharing guarantee model.  The finance providers chosen as financial intermediaries to deploy SBCI&rsquo;s risk-sharing guarantee schemes are selected via an open call process.  In each case, the open call sets out a scoring system against which each applicant is assessed on a number of criteria outlined in the open call document.  These eligibility criteria are determined by the requirements of the SBCI&rsquo;s funding providers, counter-guarantors, Government Departments involved in the scheme and relevant policy considerations.<\/p>  <p>  The SBCI operates on a market neutral basis.  The opportunity to obtain SBCI funding as an on-lender or act as a financial intermediary participating in the SBCI&rsquo;s risk-sharing guarantee schemes is open to any finance provider that can demonstrate that it fulfils the SBCI&rsquo;s requirements through the rigorous processes that I have outlined.<\/p>  <p>  In this way, the SBCI aims to ensure on-lenders and financial intermediaries maximise the benefit and the service provided to Irish SMEs as well as protecting taxpayer money and the investment of both State and European institutions.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100069#WRC05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland Reports","counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100069#WRC05300"},{"type":"question","counter":156,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[24187\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100069#WRC05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the differences in reporting between the legal owner and the beneficial owner in terms of the mortgage arrears statistics published by the Central Bank when mortgage accounts are incorporated in a securitisation model; if, for example the legal owner is a regulated entity and the beneficial owner is not a regulated entity, the areas of the Central Bank's statistics in which this would be recorded; if this would be deemed to be a mortgage owned by an unregulated owner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":157,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Central Bank of Ireland, that in their quarterly published Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions Statistics,\u00a0reporting entities are classified in three ways:<\/p><p>- regulated banks,<\/p><p>- regulated retail credit firms, and<\/p><p>- unregulated loan owners. <\/p><p>Guidance is given to the reporting entities that data is to be reported on the basis of legal ownership of the loan.

The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020, including the need to establish a National Oversight and Advisory Group, comprising of key hospitality stakeholders, to provide a forum for on-going collaboration to support the needs of the sector and oversee implementation of the EGFSN recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Established in 2016 and currently chaired by the Irish Hotels Federation\u00a0the group identified five priority areas for progress on which significant progress has been made:-<\/p>  <p>  - Promoting careers in the sector<\/p>  <p>  - Audit of hospitality related courses and facilities in both HE and FET<\/p>  <p>  - Development of apprenticeship and traineeship programmes<\/p>  <p>  - Launch of a dedicated skillnet for the hospitality industry<\/p>  <p>  - Making employment connections &ndash; DEASP\/Jobsbridge etc<\/p>  <p>  The group has published its first progress report which is available on the Skills Ireland website and work is currently underway on its second progress update. It has also published its report on the audit of both higher and further education courses providing a high level of analysis of the data available that shows the numbers of courses, enrolments and awards in the Hospitality sector to enable the Group to determine how it might address the skill sets required by the sector and to aid it in identifying gaps in the provision of courses.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from Government&rsquo;s commitment to expand apprenticeship and traineeship education, a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship has been developed by the Apprenticeship Council, led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry ETB. To date, 66 people have been registered on this programme with an expected full year intake of around 160. The Apprenticeship Council also approved development funding for separate proposals to develop a Chef de Partie and Sous Chef Apprenticeship, with expected intakes this year of 48 and 16 respectively. It is expected that the Chef de Partie programme will be rolled out\u00a0later this year.\u00a0 Separately, an Executive Chef apprenticeship is also in development. <\/p>  <p>  In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was initiated by SOLAS in collaboration with the ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice. Networks have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers to identify training needs, design training programmes, recruit learners and deliver training on and off the job. There are currently three hospitality traineeships available with further traineeships in development.<\/p>  <p>  A Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet was established in 2017 and, along with the Taste 4 Success Skillnet, will address skill needs in the sector.\u00a0 There were also almost 5,500 beneficiaries in 2017 of\u00a0further education and training in the\u00a0food and beverage and tourism areas.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  All further education and training programmes on offer are fully accessible to all EU citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100071#WRE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100071#WRE03000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Ceremonies","counter":255,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100071#WRE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[24021\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100071#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be called for a citizenship ceremony; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":257,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy, continues to be processed. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  <\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.

These included agriculture and food products (beef meat, pig meat, dairy, processed food products, and alcoholic drinks).  While some agriculture products, in particular beef, are sensitive for Irish businesses the removal of these barriers to trade in Australia and New Zealand may also open export opportunities for Irish producers.<\/p><p>The EU&rsquo;s analysis indicates growth of exports for all sectors apart from minor decreases of EU exports of some agricultural sub-sectors (rice, cereals, fruit and vegetables and fibres and other crops - all of these have low EU trade volumes).<\/p><p>Both New Zealand and Australia were among the 11 countries that signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership in March 2018.

The NCSC is responsible for acting as a conduit for information to constituents including operators of Critical National Infrastructure, businesses, Government Departments and Agencies, and also for providing expert advice and analysis on cyber security issues and for coordinating significant incidents.  The NCSC acts as a central contact point in the event of a government or nation-wide cyber security incident affecting the State and continues to work with\u00a0the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and the Departments and Agencies that own these systems\u00a0to mitigate and manage\u00a0these risks. The expertise contained within the NCSC covers a broad range of capabilities including computer science, software engineering, malware analysis and information technology forensics.  The unit also participates in international exercises.  The NCSC is also engaged in a series of other actions to support organisations of different types and scales. For example,\u00a0the unit has been heavily engaged in work to prepare for the EU Network and Information Security Directive, which will place binding security requirements on critical infrastructure operators and certain key Digital Service Providers.  The Directive also places obligations on the State itself, in terms of ensuring that States can cooperate and share information in the event of a large scale incident affecting several countries and to ensure that every State has significant capacity of its own. Taken together, this will mean that the State will have coordinated system for the management of cyber related risk to Critical National Infrastructure, and for the assessment and response to incidents.

The assessment looked at international best practice, and a renewable energy &ndash; community workshop was held, where barriers and opportunities related to renewable electricity projects were identified for further analysis. The study also looked at how these policies and support measures could be best applied across a range of project archetypes, including developer-led, community-led and wholly owned community projects<\/p><p>Examples of support measures identified include a mandatory requirement for all projects supported under RESS to offer ownership or investment opportunities to the local population, facilitating grid access for community-led renewable projects, ring fencing dedicated capacity for community-led projects and putting in place structures which will support community groups overcome legal, financial and technical barriers to renewable electricity generation.<\/p><p>The Community Report as it is known, along with the Economic Appraisal to underpin the new RESS were both published by my Department last year for public consultation and are available on my Departments website at . <\/p><p>A final design proposal on RESS will shortly be brought to Government for approval, and subsequent to this a formal application\u00a0for State Aid clearance with the European Commission will commence in line with 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.

Furthermore, micro generation will be required given the scale of our climate and energy ambition as laid out in the National Development Plan and Project Ireland 2040. While\u00a0solar power is not supported by REFIT, my Department supports the deployment of Solar PV through the SEAI led Better Energy Communities and pilot Deep Retrofit schemes.   Last year, my Department assessed micro generation, across a number of renewable electricity generating technologies (including solar PV), as part of the economic analysis to underpin the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). The assessment identified technical and financial challenges which may need to be addressed before a broader support scheme for micro generation can be introduced. This is in line with international experience, including across the EU, where many member states who have introduced supports for micro generation have had to reform them or cancel them altogether. <\/p>  <p>  The reality is that bringing micro generation on to a system designed for large generators is complicated.

The recently agreed EU Effort Sharing Regulation sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030. Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction in 2005 levels of non-ETS emissions by 2030.<\/p><p>Closing the gap on Ireland's EU targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and 2030 will be extremely challenging. The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020, in the context of a target that emissions should be 20% below their 2005 levels. While this is very disappointing, it is not surprising given the recent pace of economic growth, and the consequent increases in emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors in particular. <\/p><p>The projected shortfall to our target is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. With this in mind it is crucial that the focus of our efforts must now be to ensure that we, at the absolute very least, meet our 2030 target. <\/p><p>As a means to addressing Ireland&rsquo;s emissions reduction challenge, I published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan in July 2017. It has established the framework for the development and implementation of medium-to-long-term policy options so as to achieve progressive emissions reductions in each of its four key sectors with the most significant contribution to national emissions (Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use). The Plan is a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options. <\/p><p>I subsequently published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Adaptation Framework in January 2018. The Framework sets out the national strategy to reduce the vulnerability of the country to the negative effects of climate change and to avail of positive impacts. Under the Framework, seven Government Departments and Agencies, with responsibility for the twelve priority sectors identified in the Framework, will be required to prepare sectoral adaptation plans in line with the requirements of\u00a0the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 and the Framework itself. <\/p><p>Implementation of both the National Mitigation\u00a0Plan and National Adaptation Framework is overseen by a High Level Climate Action Steering Group,\u00a0which I chair and which reports, in turn, to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action. <\/p><p>Building on these strategies, the publication in February of the National Development Plan, reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to transitioning Ireland\u00a0to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society. It will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade. This funding commitment provides a clear opportunity for significant up-scaling in our investments to deliver deep emissions reductions in the coming decade and to further develop and implement the National Mitigation Plan and National Adaptation Framework. <\/p><p>Reflecting the strong commitment of Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the National Development Plan allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility. This means that well over &euro;1 in &euro;5 spent under the National Development Plan will be on climate mitigation, and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030. <\/p><p>Both the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan explicitly recognise that\u00a0reliance solely on Exchequer expenditure schemes is neither affordable nor adequate to the scale of the challenge to be addressed, and climate mitigation action will require a targeted balance between Exchequer-supported expenditure, taxation measures, regulation and behavioural change. In certain cases, taxation policy may have a stronger role to play in changing individual or business behaviour and investment decisions, including harnessing non-Exchequer finance. <\/p><p>I will\u00a0also shortly publish an update on climate mitigation policy to coincide with the <i>Empowering Communities for Climate Action <\/i>event on 20 June, which will reflect the significant\u00a0policy developments since the National Mitigation Plan, in particular\u00a0with the publication of the National Development Plan.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In terms of on-going climate mitigation policy development, the EU requires that we produce a draft National Energy and Climate Plan by end 2018, with the final plan to be developed by end 2019. This represents a further opportunity to build on the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan to ensure Ireland moves to a pathway of long-term decarbonisation. Finally, I am required, under the 2015 Act, to bring forward a new National Mitigation Plan at least once every five years. The latest date by which this must happen is, therefore, July 2022.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100075#WRJ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenhouse Gas Emissions","counter":503,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100075#WRJ04000"},{"type":"question","counter":504,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[24164\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100075#WRJ04100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the extent to which he is in contact with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine with a view to identifying positive actions that can be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the agrifood sector without damaging the industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":505,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[24165\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100075#WRJ04200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the extent to which he in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has identified the most likely and realistic actions to be taken to reduce carbon emissions in line with EU targets and without negatively affecting the agrifood sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":506,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[24166\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053100075#WRJ04300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the extent to which he in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has identified substantial means of carbon sequestration with a view to ensuring compliance ith EU carbon reduction targets without negatively affecting the agrifood business; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":507,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 185 to 187, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The\u00a0extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.<\/p><p>I published Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation\u00a0Plan in July 2017.

Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.\u00a0 The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in\u00a0December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate\u00a0some of the deficits.  The Implementation Group which I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.  This includes ComReg, which attends as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in its role as the independent Regulator. <\/p>  <p>  Minister Kyne and I published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce.  Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme.  Following close engagement with stakeholders at the National Stakeholder Forum, an additional 23 new measures have been identified for delivery in 2018, that\u00a0will\u00a0lead to improvements for\u00a0consumers across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The fifth meeting of the Taskforce Implementation Group was held on 25 April 2018, and the Quarter 1 2018 Progress Report has since been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  This report offers progress updates on all Q1 actions.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of addressing mobile coverage blackspots, various initiatives are under way:<\/p>  <p>  - My\u00a0Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection\u00a0for deployment of telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.<\/p>  <p>  - Both Departments also\u00a0worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots.  This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis.  This exercise is ongoing under\u00a0the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme.  It is planned to have dedicated Geographic Information System (GIS) resources in place to support this.<\/p>  <p>  - A review was conducted to identify recommendations to address blackspots.  A focus group\u00a0is continuing this work in 2018,\u00a0to inform future policy development and initiatives.  The work of this focus group will\u00a0provide guidance on location\u00a0categories where high quality mobile phone coverage should be made available as a priority, taking account of customer expectations.<\/p>  <p>  - ComReg is also developing a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem\u00a0with its work on handset testing and awareness raising activities,\u00a0allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for 5G rollout, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.<\/p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should help\u00a0enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  Providing telecommunications services, including mobile phone services, is a matter for the relevant service providers operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), as independent Regulator.

This report provides data on trends in mode share of vehicles and people crossing the Canal Cordon including the number of cyclists who pass the canal cordon in Dublin between 7.00am and 10.00am;  The recently published report shows an upward trend of cyclists crossing the canal that continued between 2016 -2017 with numbers increasing by 3%.  There has been a steady year on year growth in the number of cyclists crossing the cordon since 2010. In 2017 almost 12,500 cyclists crossed the cordon in the AM peak period.  This represents an increase of 157% when compared with 2006, and represents an increase of over 57% in the last five years.

This programme will provide \"active travel\" (i.e. cycling and walking) routes, which can help alleviate congestion by improving the viability of these particular forms of travel, and doing so in a way that provides useful connectivity with existing public transport infrastructure. In addition to this, &euro;55m will be spent in this same four year period on Greenways outside of the 5 cities, and the greenway programme will be largely aimed at providing an enhanced tourism and leisure amenity.<\/p>  <p>  A further &euro;135m capital funding has been allocated over this same period for investment in Sustainable Urban Transport projects.  These will include projects that will provide either direct or indirect improvements for urban cycling.\u00a0 This programme builds on investment to date to deliver improvements in public and sustainable transport infrastructure in the regional cities and the GDA.\u00a0 It includes traffic management, bus priority and other smarter travel projects, which will allow transport infrastructure to function more effectively and will help relieve traffic congestion. . <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, investment in the BusConnects Programme in the same period, will deliver a transformative investment package that will finance new and expanded bus routes, greatly improve bus access, and includes designated segregated cycle lanes.

Almost 77,000 children are now benefiting from these schemes; the target had been\u00a070,000.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent estimates for the full-year childcare costs of the ACS were presented in the Regulatory Impact Analysis, which was published in December 2017. The Regulatory Impact Analysis noted that there remains considerable uncertainty over the likely costs of the ACS, especially because of uncertainty about the scheme's impact on the demand for childcare.<\/p>  <p>  According to the Regulatory Impact Analysis, if there is no increase in demand for childcare, then it is estimated that the full-year costs will lie between &euro;127m and &euro;149m. Taking into account potential increases in demand, international evidence suggests that the full-year cost of the scheme could rise to somewhere between &euro;165m and &euro;193m. However, such an impact on demand may only materialise fully over a period of several years, as parents begin to participate more in the labour market in response to improved access to affordable childcare. Increase in demand may also be caused by parents changing their childcare choices towards regulated childcare.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the ACS will see a significant change in eligibility criteria for childcare subsidies. Whereas eligibility for childcare supports under the current schemes depends on possession of a Medical Card \/\u00a0GP Visit Card, or receipt of one of a range of social welfare payments, or participation in a relevant education or training course, the level of subsidy under the ACS will primarily depend on income. In addition, a universal subsidy was introduced in September 2017 for 6-36 month olds, which will remain in place under ACS.<\/p>  <p>  I have no immediate\u00a0plans for changes in ACS eligibility criteria, but the scheme has been designed to give flexibility to adjust both income-thresholds and subsidy-rates each year as part of the budgetary process.\u00a0 This ensures that the ACS can act as a sustainable platform for increasing investment in childcare in Ireland over the years ahead.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the costings published in the Regulatory Impact Analysis, it is estimated that the number of beneficiaries of ACS on its introduction could rise to more than 82,000, but is likely in the first instance to be between 70,000 and 80,000, with the precise level depending on the impact on the demand for childcare.

Given the wide breadth of actions included under the plan, action owners separately include three Government Departments, two Government agencies, a public body and some interdepartmental structures (where policy responsibilities span a number of departments).  Accordingly, a number of governance structures have been developed to oversee progress with development and implementation.  <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately these individual arrangements and progress generally on the implementation of these reforms is being overseen by Government through Cabinet Committee A &ndash; Economy, which is chaired by the Taoiseach and consists of Ministers with responsibility for pension related matters.

To this end, I can confirm that separate national consultation processes will be undertaken in relation to the two most fundamental reforms contained in the Roadmap.  These are the introduction of the &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; for the State pension contributory from 2020 and the development of a new automatic enrolment retirement savings system for employees without supplementary pensions coverage.

All funding schemes seek to secure value for money for the Exchequer and the highest quality social housing home for those on local authorities' waiting lists, including by ensuring that the local authority is fully supportive and approves\u00a0of the project, necessity for independent valuations and a separate independent\u00a0financial appraisal in the case of CALF proposals.<\/p><p>AHBs, with the assistance of local authorities, are\u00a0securing single and multiple\u00a0new build\u00a0properties on a turnkey basis from developers.\u00a0Similarily,\u00a0where it is value for money to do so, AHBs will purchase vacant existing properities, on the basis that such a purchase does not interefere with the local market. In all cases, such purchases must be supported by the local authority\u00a0and represent value for money in the context of local housing need.<\/p><p>The following tables provide information specifically on the AHB turnkey and acquisition projects comprising multiple units in one development, which were\u00a0delivered through\u00a0AHBs in the administrative area of Wexford County Council for 2016 and 2017. The capital\u00a0costings of the units are averaged as a development could include a mix of unit type and\u00a0size, e.g. two or three bed units, which are priced differently:<\/p><p><b>Table 1 - AHB Turnkeys -

Technical assessments of 4,829 water bodies have been carried out, examining their status (quality) and whether they are &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; of not meeting status objectives in the future. Informed by this work, a collaborative workshopping process involving the EPA, senior local authority personnel and all relevant stakeholders was set up to identify, at a regional level, those water bodies that should be prioritised for action during this planning cycle.
