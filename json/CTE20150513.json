Good morning, members of ... chairman, members of the committee.  My name is Liam Kelleher, I was director general of the federation from 1993 to 2007.<\/p> <p>  The CIF is the national and regional body for construction company, contractors, subcontractors and house builders in Ireland.  It is recognised by Government and public bodies as the representative body for the Irish construction industry.  This was reflected in its position as a social partner for the period.  The federation is owned and run by its members via an executive body of 34 members appointed through the various branches and associations that comprise the CIF.  All interests, sectoral and regional, are represented in the CIF&rsquo;s decision-making processes.  The organisation has 13 branches and a number of sectoral associations that pursue the policy objectives of their own sub-sector.<\/p><p>The five main industry groups are the Master Builders and Contractors Association, the Civil Engineering Contractors Association, the Mechanical and Electrical Contractors Associations, the Irish Home Builders Association and the Alliance of Specialist Contractors.  That umbrella group, the details of the membership of it were given in the submission that I made.  At its peak, the federation had in excess of 2,500 members, large, medium and small, whose priorities differed and where competition between groups and regions could be quite strenuous.  The purpose of the federation is to provide services to its members and to represent its members.<\/p><p> For the period covered by this inquiry, 90% or more of the federation's resources were devoted to the provision of services to members.  Some of these services were outlined in the submission and I am covering some of them briefly here.  Industrial relations was a core service, including representation at various labour relations fora: the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, as well as dealing with the trade unions and the industry at the time.  Health and safety was a high priority for the federation during the period the joint committee is examining.  The CIF worked with the Health and Safety Authority and the relevant trade unions to ensure compliance and competence in meeting and exceeding rising statutory safety standards.  The CIF remains one of the key stakeholders and drivers of the construction safety partnership.<\/p><p> Briefly on each of the main groups, main contracting, building and civil engineering, the staff at the federation provide information, advice and assistance to the main contracting members of the federation in general building and civil engineering.  They're the members of the federation who build the country's ports and airports, road and rail network, as well as hospitals, schools, public and private buildings.  Specialist contracting, the mechanical and electrical specialists, as well as the other range of specialist contractors - that group represents a wide range of specialist subcontractors and both the main contractors and the mech. and elec. contractors have built the wide range of foreign direct investment projects which have established in Ireland over the past 25 years and have built an international reputation for expertise in implementing high-technology projects on time and on budget.  In housing and planning, that department addresses a wide range of issues affecting members, including technical, planning, economic and environmental matters.  <\/p><p> Representation and lobbying -  representation and lobbying has always been a key element of CIF&rsquo;s activity.  As the members' representative body for the construction sector, it was our responsibility to represent members and the issues of the industry and to convey those to the media, Government and public bodies, national and local.  The CIF's policy position was clearly set out, after my time in August 2012, which formalised what had always been the federation's approach in this area.  We have always carried out our engagement with Government in an open manner.  We believe transparency should be a requirement for political and public service ... Civil Service engagement, when it comes to public policy issues.  We have always published our reports and policy papers and we have provided information about meetings and conversation ... and conversations concerning political and policy issues to our members.  It's part of a two-way process that encourages a better understanding of the issues involved on both sides.<\/p><p> A variety of the Departments, in keeping with the subject matter of the inquiry, the variety of the Government Departments that we would have met included the Department of the Environment, which had responsibility for construction policy ... for publishing the review and outlook for the construction industry and for many of the issues with which the industry dealt.  Our main contact with the Department of Finance would have been through the budgetary process where we made an annual pre-budgetary ... pre-budget submission, and usually met the Minister for Finance during that process or as part of that process.  Our submission would normally focus on taxation policy, both industry-specific and general, and the public capital programme.  Our interactions with the Department of the Taoiseach were generally around the macroeconomic position of the construction sector in Ireland and its place in the wider Irish economy.  During the years of social partnership, CIF was involved in more extensive discussions with the Department on issues relating to the implementation of successive national development plans and on pay-related issues in specific national agreements.<\/p><p>Striving to increase supply to meet demand across all subsectors of the industry was a recurrent theme of discussion.  Other Departments are listed in my submission: the Departments of Education, Jobs, Enterprise, Transport, Communications, Health, all of which we had communications with in relation to various aspects either of policy or the implementation of specific public expenditure programmes.<\/p><p> Members of the Oireachtas: the CIF engages on a broad level with Members of the Oireachtas, nationally and regionally.  This is done in an open manner, includes distribution of our annual pre-budget submission and other relevant information materials.  We interact with local authorities where there are programmes of local road investment, implementation of water and waste treatment programmes, social housing investment and a variety of other issues.  We would meet with An Bord Plean&aacute;la to discuss policy matters - generally once a year - planning policy, including timescales for decision making.  <\/p><p> In relation to the banks, banking regulators and banking representatives, we had very few ... we had very few interactions with banking authorities such as the Central Bank prior to the economic downturn and that, of course, was in the period that I was there.  Banking was just not a feature of CIF's activities pre-2008.  Access to finance was not an issue for CIF members with the federation in that period.  And I should also point out that the CIF, as an organisation, had no knowledge of the banking arrangements of any of its individual members or of how they financed their businesses or of their cash reserves or their borrowings.<\/p><p> Now, construction in Ireland has always been an important part of the Irish economy.  It has been a strong creator of jobs.  It has enabled foreign direct investment and it has built those inward investment projects very quickly and the necessary infrastructure to go with them to enable the Irish economy and Irish society to grow.  Pre-2000, during the national development plan of '94 to '99, I know that precedes this inquiry's period, but money was scarce and people were plentiful, but as the year 2000 approached, a major concern of the CIF was that as structural and cohesion funding from Europe was reduced that the public capital programme would be squeezed.  That turned out to be largely an unnecessary fear and concerns developed in Government about the capacity of the industry to deliver on the new national development plan.  One senior Government Minister spoke of bringing 2,000 immigrants into the State.  The Taoiseach indicated his concern that the industry did not have the capacity to manage large projects and both Government and Opposition were calling on the industry to expand in order to deliver on NDP projects and to increase the supply of housing.  There was a broad consensus across the political spectrum of the need ... and wider, of the need to build 500,000 plus new housing units in the following decade - that's from 2000 onwards.  Every sector was striving to increase supply and obviously, the figures for the value of the construction industry ... they're contained in my submission and you can see that they grew rapidly.  But in the period from 2000 onwards, I cannot overestimate the pressure I felt, and which I believe the industry was under, to expand its capacity to deliver building and civil engineering projects and to increase housing output.  And right up to ... output increased incrementally each year but right up to the end of 2006, demand for housing continued very strongly and then when housing output commenced to fall rapidly in 2007, a supply adjusted rapidly to falling demand.<\/p><p> Previous evidence to this committee has stated the overwhelming consensus were that the over ... the essential pillars of the economy were sound.  The prevailing wisdom was that if there was a property bubble, if one was to emerge, the country's still-high employment figures and positive Government finances would mitigate against a serious economic downturn.  The prevailing view was that a soft landing would follow.<\/p><p> The figures for housing have been included in our submission and we issued our projections annually.  We got them wrong on occasion, but the trend was pretty well upwards constantly through the years 2000.  But they were ... our forecasts were based on feedback from members but also on reports from NESC, from the ESRI, from the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment and wider sources.<\/p><p>On the way up, up to and including 2006, housing demand exceeded supply and the industry strove to meet that.  Builders secured finance to purchase residentially zoned lands - and this is my final page, Chairman - secured planning permission, secured development finance to build the units, purchased secured mortgages to purchase the homes and builders built, and build, when and where they think they can sell.  Errors made in the scale of building in some parts of the country are fully acknowledged by the industry but these were lands that had been zoned for housing, the financial system had financed land purchase and development and planning permission had been given for the developments.  Taking the wider property investment perspective, the red... the very ready availability of finance for development and property investment generally over the period was a prime driver of the demand for property, for investment property, in general, and, particularly, housing, new and second hand.  The extent of lending to the broader property sector, to property syndicates and to individuals in Ireland and abroad accelerated to levels which, in hindsight, were unsustainable.  The full scale of such lending for national and international property purchases only emerged with the establishment of NAMA.<\/p><p> To conclude, the level of construction activity reached unsustainable levels in the 2006-2007 period.  Specifically, too many houses were being built; too much economic activity was dependent on the sector.  Our mental focus as a federation, rightly or wrongly, was on the pressures that existed to deliver needed works in the building and civil engineering sectors and to meet the demand in the housing sector from a growing population.  When decline in the housing sector commenced, we believed it was a necessary correction and that the industry would settle around the 50,000 units output per annum. We believed in the soft landing expectation from all Irish sources and a wide range of economic forecasts - the IMF, the EU and the OECD.  We made mistakes; I made mistakes.  Not listening to contrarians was one of them, believing too readily the benign economic forecasts of the... and the soft landing, and I am sorry for that.<\/p><p> There were many other entities involved also, but we are a part... we were a part of it, I was a part of it and, to that extent, Chairman, I apologise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Kelleher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431471600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Kelleher.

Before then I spent two months working with Liam in preparation for his retirement.  In my previous career, I was a farmer and was heavily involved in the Irish Farmers' Association serving as deputy president from '91 to '93 and from president... and as president from '97 to 2001.  I also had a brief political career, serving as a TD for Laois-Offaly from 2002 to 2007.  And during my time here in Leinster House, I was also Minister of State in... at the Department of Finance. <\/p> <p>  Liam has already outlined the nature of the CIF and the role and the services played by the federation.  Ultimately, we exist to serve our members.  It is the various construction companies employees and contractors who make up the Irish construction industry and who are the backbone of the CIF.  Without them, there wouldn't be any federation.<\/p> <p>  Our role is to help our members on a broad industry wide level and to provide support to them under many different headings.  These include issue like... issues like industrial relations, contracting representation and lobbying, health and safety as well as several other areas that Liam has already referred to.  The nature of our membership is what gives CIF status in the Irish construction industry and the wider economy.  We are also a means for the industry to come together and to have a strong united voice.  It is also this responsibility that makes the CIF leaders for the construction industry in Ireland.  Our job is not just to work with the industry, but to work on their behalf through good times and through bad times.<\/p> <p>  As this Inquiry is all too aware, over the last ten years, the construction industry went through some very, very good times and we've also had to endure just over seven years of decline.  Obviously, it is the work of this Inquiry to find out the causes of the collapse of the economy as a whole, and I would like... I would also encourage you to take a... a close look at the plight suffered specifically by the construction industry during the course of your deliberations.  Without wanting to pre-empt the findings of the committee, I am sure that these findings will suggest that the causes of what went wrong in the economy were complex and had many different dimensions.  Certainly, one element that went wrong was the scale of the industry, how big it grew.  It reached unsustainable levels of activity and was responsible for far too big a percentage of the Irish economy.<\/p><p>As leaders of the industry, the CIF have to accept responsibility for the role we played in that growth.  Everything we did and every position we adopted we did to help our sector and to help our members.  Our various policy positions were driven by the views of our members as well as the prevailing economic and industry thinking at any particular moment in time.  Yes we were being told by national and international experts, economists and the Government that there would be a soft landing but we have to take responsibility as well.  However, time has shown that that approach was wrong and we're certainly sorry for that situation.  We accept that we should have done more to encourage a more responsible level of activity, we should have taken greater heed of the warnings coming from the various sources even if they were going against the mainstream.  We should have encouraged greater caution.  If we knew of course back then what we know now we would do things entirely differently.  There was a huge demand for houses and people needed some place to live, but looking back with perspective we can see that some of that demand was driven by speculation and the level of house building became sustainable.  We're sorry that this happened, we want to learn from the lessons that the economic collapse has taught us.  We are acutely conscious that tens of thousands of people in the construction sector lost their jobs and we want to ensure nothing like this happens again.  If the construction industry was one of the drivers of the boom it is certainly one of the major victims of the crash.  <\/p><p> Practically from around the time I joined the CIF, the construction industry had entered into a period of decline and difficulty.  I believe if you look at the Ulster Bank purchasing managers index that there were about 75 consecutive months of decline from May 2007 until September 2013.  The impact on the sector was massive, equally the pain felt in the industry had huge implications for the rest of the economy.       <\/p><p> Throughout the course of the downturn huge numbers of construction companies went out of business, at one point practically every week was bringing news of another significant company closing its doors.  At times it seemed like the industry was losing hundreds of businesses every month, it was the case.  It was a depressing and distressing time for our industry, for construction workers and their families.  The impact was most keenly demonstrated in the unemployment figures.  In the second quarter of 2007 there were 273,900 people directly employed in the industry according to the Central Statistics Office, by the first quarter of 2013 the number had fallen to 96,300.  That's a loss of 177,600 jobs over the course of almost six years so, you know, the impact that had on families around the country in every town and every village had a major impact.  <\/p><p> The turnaround had also been clear in Exchequer returns, the people who lost their jobs and the ones who didn't emigrate or seek job opportunities abroad, went from paying income tax to receiving social welfare payment.  We never want to see the construction industry suffer like this again.  We want to see a sustainable construction industry operating at about 12% of GNP.  This is a level that Forf&aacute;s recently and the Government have both stated is appropriate for a country of our size with our demographic needs.  Unfortunately now and I ... acknowledge that we went to 23% of the economy at one stage back in 2006, we're now a long, long way below that particular point but thankfully we're now starting to move in the right direction.  However, as part of our final deliberations I would encourage the inquiry to at least note how badly the construction sector has suffered during the downturn.<\/p><p> As part of my appearance here, Chairman, before the committee, I was asked to talk about the establishment, the operation and the effectiveness of NAMA.  I think it is fair to say that the industry was very worried about what NAMA was going to be and what it was going to involve when it was established.  It was an entirely new entity that hadn't been established anywhere else on the globe, and you will see from the various reports that we provided to the inquiry that our members were expressing massive concern about the various provisions and the powers that would be provided to NAMA.  We were also anxious that the wrong approach could mean even greater suffering for an already distressed construction industry.  As we say in our submission to the inquiry, and I quote, \"It was clear to the CIF that its members would be subject to an entirely different banking environment and the establishment of NAMA would have a profound effect on the ability of some members to support their ongoing businesses.\"<\/p><p> I think a lot of our concerns came at that time from the scarcity of information about NAMA.  There was a lot of speculation floating around and the problem was that no-one fully understood just how NAMA would end up operating and how it would work with the construction industry.  It is also fair to point out that the CIF wasn't alone in having concerns about NAMA prior to its establishment.  I know that many members of both Houses of the Oireachtas were particularly verbal in their opposition to NAMA.  However, the extensive public debate on the establishment of this entity was a very good thing.  It allowed concerns to be taken on board and in some cases assuaged before the enactment of legislation.<\/p><p>The CIF believe that NAMA are doing a good job in handling a very difficult role.  On a macro level, we fully acknowledge that NAMA are fulfilling their remit and seem to be achieving results.  They are also one of the few sources of development capital in recent years for the industry, as they are funding the finalisation and the development of some of their assets to realise their full value.  Again, this is important and has played a part in the recovery of the construction sector.  While we may have expressed strong concerns in the past, I would like to think that the CIF and NAMA have since developed a more co-operative approach.  As we have seen the progress being made by NAMA, the industry has come to realise that they are part of the solution.  We respect what they are doing and a signal of that respect, I think, has been the invitation we have expended to senior members, both chairman and chief executive, to speak at our CIF annual conference for the last three years.  In conclusion, Chairman, I'd like to thank the committee for the opportunity to talk about the various issues surrounding the economic downturn and the construction industry and I would hope in the course of our discussion that we're able to bring some greater understanding to the committee's deliberations.  And I look forward-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431471600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Parlon, and thank you, Mr. Kelleher.

It's incremental and the belief was that there was a substantial infrastructural deficit, the belief was that with the population growing, with incomes growing, with inward investment, that it would continue.

The period around when NAMA was being introduced, bank lending had stopped entirely, house building had practically stopped, there was nobody getting a mortgage or nobody ... the sentiment had turned totally in the opposite direction; nobody wanted to buy a house or know about property.  So that was an extremely nervous time for the industry and, as I said earlier in my opening remarks, you know, the big issue was companies going out of business, people being laid off and people emigrating all over the world to try and find jobs in construction after they'd learn very good skills here.  So, it was a very, very nervous time and we didn't know .. and, like I said earlier, the issue was and probably still would be debated by a lot of experts that would be more expert than me about, you know, was NAMA's intervention and all their different actions, did it, you know ... when they started there was a big concern that there was going to be, you know, major sell-offs.<\/p><p>And clearly if, in a weak market, you start selling off a massive lot of other stuff, it weakens the market further and the market will be in freefall.

The Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV, was established in 1971 as a representative professional body for qualified, licensed auctioneers, valuers and estate agents.  IPAV is the only Irish representative body solely catering for the professional and educational requirements and needs of auctioneers and valuers and, in 2013, represented almost 800 members nationwide.  IPAV has three categories of membership for practising auctioneers and valuers in Ireland which enables it to cater for the professional ... property professional, the certified valuer, the recognised valuer, REV, and this is through its association with TEGoVA, the European Group of Valuers Associations, using the Blue Book and the European valuation standards.<br\/><br\/>The institute is governed by a national council of 20 members from throughout the country.  The institute is further supported by an executive council which consists of IPAV president, senior vice president, junior vice president and CEO.  I am the chief executive officer of IPAV, appointed in May 2013, and I'm responsible for the day-to-day running of the institute.<br\/><br\/>A summary of IPAV's main objectives are: it was originally set up to provide a professional, representative organisation for auctioneers, valuers and estate agents to protect, advance and promote professional standards among its member; to promote professional competence among its members; to protect the interests of members, as between themselves and between non-members and general public; to provide a system of professional education; to ensure education plays a continuous and significant part in its members' professional development; to apply, petition or promote in the Republic of Ireland any Act of the Oireachtas, EU directive or other legal measures in order with a view to attainment of the above objectives; and to establish a disciplinary committee, consisting of five internal and two external professionals.<br\/><br\/>IPAV has submitted to the committee IPAV's memorandum and articles of association, as amended in 2013, which details the structure and process of IPAV.  Further to this, all documents supplied by IPAV to the committee and detailed in the metadata sheets is, to the best of my knowledge, true and correct.  To the best of my knowledge, the majority of documents supplied to the committee are in the public domain.  However, some documents, such as IPAV Practice Handbook, the Blue Book Valuation Templates and the Blue Book Terms of Engagements are specifically for IPAV members and are available to IPAV members in the members area only of <i>ipav.ie<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Chairman, in relation to the specific references, B4b and R5d, I am asked to comment upon, I wish to make the following points but, before so, I wish to emphasis that I can only comment in relation to IPAV and my role as CEO.<br\/><br\/>Self-regulation through IPAV: all IPAV valuers are subject to self-regulation through IPAV.  Unlike auctioneering and estate agency, which is governed by the Property Services Regulatory Authority, there are no national valuation standards for valuers in Ireland.  However, IPAV undertook the role as self-regulator for its own members.  While the valuer must possess the necessary qualifications, experience, ability, knowledge and training, he or she must always be objective and professional in his or her view and in appraisals and assessment of value.  In many cases, it will be necessary for the valuer and, where appropriate, any valuation company, to show that he or she is independent of any party interest in the outcome of the valuation.  Any such connection, or potential conflict of interest, or threat to the valuer's independence and objectivity, should be disclosed in writing to the client and recorded in the valuation report and the terms of conditions.<br\/><br\/>Conflicts of interest: it is important to note a quote from the Central Bank of Ireland, CBI, paper Valuation Processes in the Banking Crisis - Lessons Learned - Guiding the Future in the final paper of 18 December 2012, a copy of which has been supplied by IPAV to the committee.  And they say:<blockquote>Where a conflict of interest exists, the valuation is not independent and accordingly it is much more likely that the valuation provided is neither robust nor reliable.  All valuations include judgements, but where a conflict of interest exists, it is more likely that such judgements are biased and not in favour of the lender.<\/blockquote>The area of conflict of interest is also addressed under IPAV's code of conduct and TEGoVA's Corporate Governance and in the Blue Book itself.  Again, copies of these documents have been supplied by IPAV to the committee.<br\/><br\/>Article 4, paragraph 76 of EU Regulation No. 575\/2013, on 26 June 2013, defines market value and market value is defined as, &quot;The estimated amount for which the property should exchange at the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's length transaction after proper marketing, wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.&quot;  Market value is internationally recognised as the assessment of the value of the property at a given moment in time.  It estimates the price that could be obtained for a property at the valuation date, notwithstanding that date could alter over time and sometimes very rapidly.  The definition of market value should be recorded in both the terms of engagement and the valuation report the valuers produce.<br\/><br\/>Valuation in general: the source of valuation and how properties are valued has been very topical in Ireland for many years.  Basically the valuation process is broken into two segments: the methodology used to arrive at the valuation figure, there are five standard methods of valuation, namely, comparative, contractors, investment, profit and residual; and the standards used in writing the report.  The valuation must be presented in a clear, written format to a professional standard, transparent as to the instruction, purpose, biases, method, conclusion and prospective use of the valuation.  The valuation, as determined by the valuer, must be clearly and effectively conveyed to the client.  The form and detail of the valuation report is a matter for the valuer's discretion, but must meet the specific instructions from the client to the valuer.  A valuation report must adequately report all matters contained within the terms of engagement.<br\/><br\/>In line with the European valuation standards, EVS, a market valuation should report the following: the instructions for the assignment; the valuer's qualifications; the basis and purpose of the valuation; the valuation date; a description of the property, including a note as to the basis on which the area has been measured; a summary of the legal context (tenure, development control, etc.); a commentary on the marketability for the property; a description of the valuation method and analysis; any assumptions that have been made; any limits on the report; and the valuation standards supplied.<br\/><br\/>I am of the understanding that banks and financial institutions have generally organised and managed their own valuation panels, with some exceptions, where valuation panels are outsourced.  IPAV valuers, in the past and to date, must apply to the relevant financial institutions to be accepted onto the panel.  Central to acceptance onto a valuation panel is the holding of an appropriate level of professional indemnity insurance.<br\/><br\/>The valuation figure derived becomes the critical part of the valuation, as it helps banks and other financial institutions to decide the worthiness of the risk it's going to lend on.  The valuation figure will only be reached by experienced, professional valuers, with years of experience in valuing property with their own competency.  The standards, while important, are designed to give financial institutions an explanation of, and insight into, the process, factors and judgments applied to help arrive at the final valuation figure, though not a methodology.<br\/><br\/>Again, I am of the understanding that financial institution valuation panels have operated, and continue to do so, on the basis of getting a spread of valuers throughout the country with the necessary competencies and expertise required by the financial institutions to complete the particular financial institution's own valuation templates.<\/p><p>IPAV, as a professional representative body for valuers, has provided guidelines for practising valuers and regular courses and seminars on the subject.  However, the actual compilation of the valuation report is a matter for the individual valuer.  The completion of the financial instruction's template is a matter between the financial institution and the valuers completing it.  <br\/><br\/>Again, I refer to the Central Bank report of the Valuation Process in the Banking Crisis - Lessons Learned - Guiding The Future, final paper of December 2012.  I would like to quote from it:<blockquote>Credit institutions should have a properly approved panel of valuers using appropriate selection criteria consistent with the loan portfolio risk.  An institution should have [an] on-going assessment of performance to enable a valuer remain on the panel.  This assessment should include a review of [the] valuers performance and professional indemnity insurance...<br \/><br \/>Credit institutions should ensure that no one firm of valuers has the bulk of their valuation business.  Consideration should be given to having no one valuer doing more than, say, 33% of all valuation reports.<br \/><br \/>Credit institutions should report any concerns in relation to non-ethical behaviour, including instances of unrealistic valuations, to the appropriate regulatory body.  In such circumstances, CBI recommend that credit institutions remove such valuers from the panel, which effectively bans them from working with the credit institution...<br \/><br \/>The valuers duty of care is to the credit institution and this should be emphasised by credit institutions in their written instructions to valuers...<br \/><br \/>Instructions to valuers for property valuations on collateral security should come from the credit institution in accordance with its clearly defined terms of engagement.  Fees should only be discharged by the credit institution.  It is for the credit institution to decide as to how it will allocate such costs.<br \/><br \/>Valuation reports should always be addressed to the credit institution that is advancing the [loan].<\/blockquote>And I just want to talk for a minute on European valuation standards, as that's what IPAV use.  In the absence of national valuation standards, and following the economic crisis, as part of its ongoing review to increase the professional standards of its members, IPAV carefully studied the valuation process and standards available in Europe, and its choice was to either adopt the English or European valuation standard.  After detailed analysis and consideration, IPAV concluded that the European valuation standards, EVS, of the blue book were the most appropriate for IPAV's needs.  IPAV believed that with the UK threatening to leave the EU and Ireland committed to Europe, it was both prudent and progressive for IPAV valuers to accept and adopt the EVS.<br\/><br\/>IPAV was awarded membership of the European Group of Valuers Associations, TEGoVA, in 2012 and also appointed as their administrator in Ireland.  From this, IPAV introduced its members to the recognised European valuation, REV, scheme.  This scheme is administered across Europe by TEGoVA, which in 1996 created the blue book.  This book is continually updated and is now in its seventh edition.  There are approximately 2,200 REVs throughout Europe and by 31 December 2013, and 60 of those were in Ireland.  The EVS of the blue book are recognised as reliable International standards by the Central Bank of Ireland, the European Central Bank, and the European Parliament.  <br\/><br\/>To achieve REV status, IPAV educates its qualified valuers through its specially tailored courses, held in the Institute of Technology in Tallaght.  This ensures that IPAV members who complete this course meet with the expected minimum educational standards, MER, of TEGoVA, a copy of which<i><\/i>has been supplied to the committee.  IPAV&rsquo;s qualified valuers are those who are professionally qualified, experienced valuers, with a minimum of ten years practical experience, and who have at their fingertips vast knowledge, comparable instructions, and details of sales in their own area.  Since the REV qualification was first introduced in Ireland in 2013, all IPAV REV valuers must agree and sign up to a contract that demonstrates their commitment to IPAV and also confirms the level of self-regulation it imposes.  Compliance and standards are the cornerstone of the EVS valuation reports, and IPAV compliance officers monitors and examines valuers&rsquo; written valuation reports on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis.  IPAV, as the administrator of the REV scheme in Ireland, is subject itself to five years reviews.<br\/><br\/>I will now move on to R5d.  R5d - appropriateness of relationship between Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector, and the property sector.  Again, Chairman, I wish to begin by starting ... I can only comment on the role of IPAV and its members' relationship with the Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector, and the property industry generally.  I will summarise briefly as follows.<br\/><br\/>The Government: IPAV has always engaged with members of Government in regard to lobbying on various items of legislation and issues of interest as they arise.  For example, IPAV makes an annual pre-budget submission to the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and, in recent years, has also made presentations to the Joint Oireachtas Committees on Finance and the Public Service, and Department of Agriculture.  IPAV has engaged, as necessary, with the Minister, Minister of State, and senior officials in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in relation to housing and related matters.  Ministers and Ministers of State have attended and addressed IPAV&rsquo;s annual conferences and regional seminars over the years.  IPAV has always kept lines of communication open with Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad, both Government and Opposition, in briefing them on relevant issues as they arise both individually and in committee.  IPAV makes regular submissions to joint Oireachtas committees where useful exchanges of views regularly take place.  IPAV has nominating rights to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and members are from time to time elected to either House.<br\/><br\/>The property industry itself: IPAV has engaged with parallel professions and professional bodies in the property business and industry.  IPAV representatives have regularly attended conferences organised by related professionals and institutions and have made, and continue to make, a determined effort to engage with all stakeholders in the industry. Representatives of such professional bodies are invited to attend IPAV&rsquo;s annual conference. <br\/><br\/>And the banking sector: IPAV has engaged as much as possible with the Central Bank of Ireland and individual financial institutions.  IPAV lobbied for the inclusion of the Blue Book as one of the preferred standards in the CBI final report issued in December 2012.<br\/><br\/>And my conclusion, Mr. Chairman: Overall, it is IPAV&rsquo;s view that the relationship between the four sectors, Government, Oireachtas, banks and property stakeholders, should be one of being independent of each other, yet communicating through the correct and transparent channels for the betterment of all, and the common good of Irish society.  While the priorities of the sectors often differ, as is to be expected, IPAV believes there should be an ongoing dialogue between the stakeholders.  However, to date it has tended to be sporadic rather than consistent.  In this regard, IPAV has long advocated the need for establishment of a property council, which would be representative of all stakeholders and which would help advise Government in a holistic way on all issues in relation to property.  While it would advise participants, it would be expected to respect the democratic imperative that Government governs and have the final say on any policy initiative.  IPAV believes such a body, which would have a purely advisory role, would have the potential to play an enormous part in helping build a sustainable property market, bringing about stability and avoiding future troughs and peaks, as have occurred in the recent past.  Volatility may serve isolated interests.  It does not serve consumers, it does not serve the auctioneering profession and it does not serve the common good.  <br\/><br\/>Thank you for all for listening to my long statement, and I'll take some questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#Y00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Davitt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431471600,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Davitt.

It is BelWertV is what they call it, and that might not be the greatest German explanation of it, but we call it BelWert five.  It was brought into law in Germany in 2006, which would use mortgage lending value on a property which would smooth the value over a particular term of the mortgage.  So it could be over 20 years or it could be over 15 years, or whatever it is over.  So that mortgage lending value and a definition of mortgage lending value was brought into the blue book in 2016.

And, finally, in answer to one of my previous questions, I asked about the issue of undue influence possibly being brought to bear on valuers, and you said that sometimes maybe valuers might take calls, \"Did you take such-and-such into account?\"  Is there any obligation on valuers that such calls be recorded or that they would be referenced in the final valuation report and, if not, do you think that the valuation report would benefit from such a record being kept?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#HH03700","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431471600,"counter":845,"content":"<p>Okay.  Let's take the first question firs.  So the ... how IPAV is funded is, we have a membership base obviously of approximately 1,000 members right now, we'd 800 in 2013.  And those members pay a particular amount of money to the institute every year, which, if you're a member or a member firm, you'd pay &euro;400 plus VAT or, if you are an employee, you would pay &euro;200 plus VAT.  Now we're not a conglomerate, we are a very small organisation.  We have three employees and myself, which is four employees.  So our ...  sort of turnover would be about &euro;400,000 to &euro;500,000 and that would ... our expenses ... last year actually we lost 50,000.  But, like, that's unfortunately the way it is.  We would do education and we would do CPD as well and we would get a certain amount of fees in for CPD and for education, which would go towards our running costs.<\/p><p>So, that's basically where we ... we don't get grants from anybody, or we don't get anything else from anybody else, like, that's where we're funded.  The second one was, sorry-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#HH03800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Davitt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431471600,"counter":847,"content":"<p>The sanctions that are available, if a complaint is upheld.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#JJ00200","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431471600,"counter":848,"content":"<p>Yes.

We've only changed our articles of ... of ... memorandum and articles in 2013, where we put in the fining into it, because we found that with members, you either had to put them out of the institute altogether, or suspend them for a short term which could be up to two years, and that's really all we had, so we've changed that round about to make sure that we have other punishments as well that we could do, if you want to take it like that, and financial ... from a financial point of view.<\/p> <p>  The third question is the notes ... valuers would have notes, valuer's notes on every valuation.  So when you go to look at a site you would have a valuation ... you would have a valuation and you would have your valuer's notes, so you would write your valuer's notes down in your valuation.  Now, that could take in the form of e-mails, it could take in the form of site visits, it could take in the form of telephone conversations, so you would, again, expect every valuer to have a site notes and to have them up-to-date, but I can tell you one ... one sort of a small fact which ... from ... I just ... I checked, in the past couple of days, about our ... we would run, with an insurance broker, a professional indemnity scheme for members to make sure that they're covered, and in the past four years, from 2010, '11, '12, and '13 ... In 2010, we've had two claims on our professional indemnity policies.  We've had one in 2011, one in 2012, and one in 2013.  Now, these policies are written by an insurance company, obviously.  They're written by a broker first who would pass them onto an insurance company, so that if there are incorrectness with valuations, that's the place they should go.

Firstly, I'd like to thank the members of the committee for your invitation today.  My name is Pat Cullen, I'm a partner in Deloitte, specialising in taxation, with over 30 years' experience and, for a four-year term from mid-2007 to mid-2011, I served as managing partner of Deloitte.  As managing partner, I was responsible to the partners and the firm's executive committee for the management and operation of all aspects of the firm's affairs.  In my role as managing partner, I oversaw the management of the firm, including the provision of professional services to our clients, the skills and resources of our people and the financial management of the practice.<\/p> <p>  In my written statement - provided to the committee of inquiry some weeks ago - I provided the inquiry with a summary of salient aspects of our legal framework and governance structures, together with key features of our audit quality processes, which are of such fundamental importance to all of the work we carry out as auditors to a wide range of clients.  In the interests of brevity, I'm not going to read my written statement.  Instead, I'm going to refer to some areas that I consider may be of particular interest.  Audit quality is a key area of public and stakeholder interest and delivering the highest standards of services and advice to our clients is our continuing and overarching objective.  An important part of my responsibility as managing partner was to ensure that we had the appropriate processes in place to carry out our responsibilities in this regard.  At an overall level, this helps to ensure that our professional services and our business conduct were in the public interest.  Our audit approach is centred on providing clients with the most skilled audit partner and team appropriate to the needs and complexity of their case.  Our quality governance processes require engagement partners to be fully responsible for the services they provide and for understanding our client's business.  Their involvement in the audit process is required from the very outset of any engagement, with partner-led audit planning key to our audit approach.<\/p> <p>  Our audit practice is structured into specialist industry groups, led by partners with a great depth of experience and expertise in that industry.  Our financial services group, which includes banking, is one such group.  These groups collaborate in order to share their understanding of market developments, risk assessments and emerging trends and this is of particular value during times of market turbulence and change.  Audit partners are also supported by our professional practice directors and by the audit risk and reputation leader.  The professional practice directors are responsible for technical, accounting and auditing support and their approach is responsive and consultative.  Deloitte member firms are also part of a network of similar industry groups from around the world.  These groups include experts with day-to-day, first-hand experience of the application of accounting standards across different legal and regulatory environments and include designated experts who are available to advise audit partners on engagements in dealing with complex or contentious accounting or auditing issues.  The availability of these resources ensure that there is specialist support available if required to deal with difficult issues as they arise and to support our audit teams.<\/p> <p>  A review of our audit practice is carried out annually and this is overseen by Deloitte globally.  The practice review determines whether we have complied, in all material respects, with Deloitte policies and procedures, applicable professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  Our audit practice is also subject to external review by the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board, the independent regulatory board of Chartered Accountants Ireland.  The results of our practice reviews are considered by our executive management committee and action is taken, as and where appropriate, to implement measures to address the recommendations made.  It is a key element in our continuous drive to improve and enhance audit quality.<\/p> <p>  As I explained in my written statement, all partners who act as audit engagement partners for statutory audits have been granted responsible individual status by the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board and are registered statutory auditors.  Personally, I am not, and I never have been, a registered statutory auditor.  My professional expertise lies primarily in the area of taxation.  Therefore, I'm joined here today by Mr. Gerry Fitzpatrick, who is a registered auditor and a specialist in the banking sector.  Mr. Fitzpatrick kindly advised me on the responses in my written statement to the lines of an inquiry in your direction of 2 April.  Today, Mr. Fitzpatrick will address some of the issues in your lines of an inquiry in the context of his role as lead audit partner on the audit of Ulster Bank Ireland Limited, UBIL, from 2004 to 2008.  Before I hand you over to Mr. Fitzpatrick, I would like firstly to make it clear what I understand to be the purpose of financial statements and our role and responsibilities as auditors.<\/p> <p>  International financial reporting standards, or IFRS, which is a framework used by the directors of UBIL to prepare the bank's financial statements, describe the purpose of financial statements as being, \"A structured representation of the financial position and financial performance of an entity\", the objective being to provide information about the financial position, financial performance and cash flows that's useful to a wide range of users in making decisions and presenting the results of management's stewardship of the entity's resources.  The whole essence of IFRS is to provide for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of specific aspects of financial reporting in a way that leads to a true and fair view being shown of the financial position and profit or loss of the entity.  IFRS states that, in virtually all circumstances, an entity achieves a true and fair view by compliance with IFRS.  Objective, professional judgment must be applied by the directors to ensure that financial statements give a true and fair view.  Under the Irish Companies Acts, every company of the size of UBIL must appoint a statutory auditor and that auditor must make a report to the members on the financial statements examined by them, with the primary purpose being to state whether, in their opinion, the company's balance sheet and profit and loss account have been properly prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts and give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at the end of its financial year and of the company's profit or loss for the financial year.<\/p><p>Over the years there has been much done to provide direction and guidance to auditors in carrying out the audits of specialised entities.  This includes practice note 19, the audit of banks in the Republic of Ireland.  While its main purpose is to provide guidance on the application of auditing standards to the audit of banks, it also comments on the objectives of the Financial Regulator and the objectives of the auditor, emphasising that while they may have complementary concerns, there are fundamental differences in their objectives.  The Financial Regulator is primarily concerned with maintaining the stability of the banking system and fostering the safety and soundness of individual banks in order to protect the interests of depositors.  The auditor's primary responsibility is to report his opinion as to whether the financial statements of the bank being audited present a true and fair view.<\/p><p> It's clear that the banking crisis has had an enormous impact on a wide range of stakeholders.  It is absolutely regrettable that a number of major factors came together back in 2007-2008, including international market conditions, major banking failures like Lehman and a slowdown in the Irish property market, which conspired to create conditions of an economically catastrophic nature, which few, if any, could consider would lie within the range of expectations that one could normally predict. <\/p><p> Consequently accounting standards were faced with challenges which they found exceedingly difficult to keep pace with, as, for example, the concept underlying the incurred loss impairment model.  The occurrence of loss events was happening at a pace and on such a systemic basis that the quantum of impairment provisions could change from day to day, let alone from month to month.  And that was the difficult background against which audits were carried out in 2009.  Hindsight does have the benefit of 20:20 vision and in the cold light of day, some seven or eight years later, yes, there is scope for asking questions about, \"What if?\"  There is a broad need to learn from the crisis, and we support inclusion of the role of auditing in any reviews being carried out.  Across the globe and in Ireland, the auditing profession has reflected on their role and considered how financial reporting and auditing could be enhanced.  Deloitte has engaged and been a leader in such developments, some of which Mr. Fitzpatrick will comment on.<\/p><p> I'm now going to hand you over to Mr. Fitzpatrick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#OO00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Cullen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431471600,"counter":863,"content":"<p>Mr. Fitzpatrick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#PP00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431471600,"counter":864,"content":"<p>Thank you, Pat.  Good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity of addressing the committee.  My name is Gerry Fitzpatrick and I'm one of the Deloitte partners engaged with auditing the banking sector.  I've worked with Deloitte for over 30 years and have been an audit partner for 15 years, and I was, as stated, a partner on the auditing of Ulster Bank Ireland Limited, or UBIL, from 2004 to 2008.  I've provided a detailed written statement addressing our role as auditors of UBIL and I would propose to take that statement as read.  I will now make some introductory remarks.<\/p> <p>  As independent auditors to UBIL, our role was to report to the shareholder in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Acts.  Our work was carried out in accordance with international standards on auditing.  The UBIL financial statements were prepared by the directors in accordance with international financial reporting standards and under the requirements of companies legislation.  A true and fair view is normally achieved when the financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS standards.  Auditors do not set the accounting framework but rather, we provide an opinion on whether the financial statements prepared by the directors give a true and fair view.  An audit is a point-in-time examination of the reporting of financial performance and position, measured in accordance with standards and an audit is primarily an examination of historical data prepared by the directors and presented in their annual report.  Shareholders and capital markets value the audit process, as the audit underpins the trust and obligation of stewardship between those who manage a company and those who own it, and with a range of other users.  To demonstrate the stewardship, the financial statements are prepared under IFRS to provide extensive analysis, both of accounting policies adopted by the directors and in preparing the financial statements' extensive financial data.  Separate to the financial statements, the bank submits various capital and liquidity returns to the regulator.  Those returns are prepared under separate rules or sent directly to the regulator, and are not subject to audit.  <\/p> <p>  Our audit process is focused on the financial statements.  The process commences mid-year, when a plan is presented to an audit committee.  The plan sets out our work on key audit areas, on key issues, on major judgments, together with a summary of our proposed approach.  That approach is a risk-based one, which includes tests of controls, reviewing the work of internal audit, evaluating control and remediation within the organisation, IT audit testing and tests of financial data.  And that testing work commences in quarter four of the year, looking then at the transactions to the end of September.  And following the conclusion of the year, we finalise our testing work and examine the financial statements prepared.  The audit process is detailed and uses sample testing of the tens of millions of transactions and balances that the bank has recorded on its financial systems.  Sample items are agreed to supporting records and to external confirmations.  In the case of areas of judgment, we examine the evidence provided by management and challenge the nature and source of that data.  We seek evidence of contradictory data available either internally or externally.  Our work on UBIL was linked closely to the work of Deloitte RBS Group audit team and we reported the results of our work to them also.  And throughout our audit, we met regularly with management and the audit committee of the board.  When the directors have approved the financial statements and our audit is complete, we issue our report on those financial statements and the report for 2008 year issued ... was issued in February 2009.  It was an unmodified, true and fair view opinion.  And in reaching our opinion, we consider the results of our audit work, we assess the accounting policies and, where appropriate ... and consider where they were appropriate.  We consider the nature and risks of and uncertainties in how they were disclosed and then adequate disclosure to be made on key items, such as loan impairment and going concern.  <\/p> <p>  In addition to our statutory audit opinion, which is included in the annual report, we provided a detailed audit summary report to the audit committee of Ulster Bank Group, which included a summary of our work on UBIL.  A copy of that report and similar reports for other years were submitted to the joint committee in February.  In our own summary report, we provided the audit committee with details of our audit work, we showed analysis of risks in customer lending and data on corporation coverage by lending category.  We reported on the impairment process tested by us.  For 2008, as example, we refer to the absence of up-to-date collateral evaluations and the need for enhanced documentation of the impairment process.  We also reported that the going concern assessment relied on RBS Group, the group's management of capital and funding, and in addition to being presented to the audit committee, our summary reports are made available to the regulator.  <\/p> <p>  Our summary is presented to the audit committee as they approve the financial statements and those financial statements, as I've mentioned earlier, provide extensive analysis both of the accounting policies and the financial data.  In taking the 2000 financial statements, by way of example, across 80 pages, these included accounting policies and disclosures on a wide range of topics.  And hide light ... I would like to highlight some key aspects of those disclosures relating to loan quality and finding.  With regard to loan quality, the directors described in their financial statements six important elements.  Firstly, the accounting policy was set out detailing the incurred loss approach which is required by the accounting standard IAS 39.  Next, the directors highlighted key judgments and uncertainties which they explained could cause the actual losses to differ materially from those reported from their reported impairment provision.  A third item was the detailed analysis of the quality of all loans, and this was done by reference to the bank's internal credit grading system.  That data showed details of deterioration in the quality of the bank's loans in the year, showing that the gross value of loans in the lower quality categories had increased from &euro;6.3 billion at the end of 2007 to &euro;14 billion during 2008.  Other aspects, including overdue payments, were also shown.  A fifth item was the analysis of lending exposure by industry and sector, which provided insight into the lending strategy, showing, for example, that of the total exposures that property and related exposures included, construction, 6%; home mortgages, 19%; and property, 22%.  And lastly the impairment for the year ... charged for the year was disclosed.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the funding model of the bank, the financial statements disclosed, amongst other things, three important aspects.  Firstly, that 46% of the funding was provided by RBS Group entities.  Next, that 75% of the financial liabilities fell due within three months of the balance sheet date.  And lastly, the directors explained that, in their judgment, it was appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the bank on a going concern basis, and that the bank had adequate resources to continue its business for the foreseeable future.  The directors disclosed that they had concluded this assessment having considered the financial position of the bank, and referenced the ongoing support of RBS Group by way of capital funding and liquidity facilities.  Similar disclosures on loan impairment and going concern were provided with financial statements for other years.  <\/p> <p>  The analysis presented by the directors within the financial statements shows the transparency of disclosure made available to both the shareholder and to the regulator.  Our role was to ensure the measurement and disclosure was in accordance with a true and fair view.  Our role, as Mr. Cullen has pointed out, is fundamentally different to the of the Financial Regulator, who is primarily concerned with maintaining the stability of the banking system.  And whilst audited financial statements contribute to the regulatory process, the determination of capital, the undertaking of tests for future stress, and the setting of regulatory buffers are functions undertaken by the regulator.  That process is not under statute part of the scope of the audit, of the external audit.  In providing our opinions on the financial statements, I believe we discharged our responsibility professionally and with due care and diligence.<\/p><p>Finally, I would echo Mr. Cullen's comments and recognise the financial crisis has had a normal impact ... enormous impact on a wide range of stakeholders and our profession has recognised the need to learn from the crisis and has reflected on how financial reporting and auditing could be enhanced.  We have engaged in a variety of reviews across the world and at Deloitte in Ireland, we support the enhancements explored in those reviews and I would highlight just five things: firstly, the development of a new expected loss accounting standard, IFRS 9, which subject to EU approval, is due to be implemented in 2018.  The development of with the regulator of an expanded auditor assurance protocol and this involves auditors reporting separately on aspects of governance processes at financial institutions and this expanded process has commenced from 2014.  Thirdly, recommended changes in auditor reporting to audit committees and shareholders are now in place.  Next, availability of new audit tools was proposed and that is now in place.  And, lastly, enhanced dialogue around the audit process with regulators and this has been a feature for the audited banks in Ireland since 2009.<\/p><p> Whilst these are not changes to the scope of the core audit, such initiatives can, through enhanced communication of the existing scope and the setting of a wider scope, help to create a broad level of awareness of banking models and their underlying economics and, in some way, mitigate some of the understandability and relevance issues of historic financial information.  Nonetheless, the preparation and audit of financial statements will continue to require significant judgment.  Finally, the financial statements contain valuable data, but, as a point in time measure, can only attempt to present measures based on that point in time judgment.  And the scope of an audit is an assessment of whether those financial statements present a through and fair view and, in that regard, has significant value.

In the previous pages, on page 28, for instance, there's a reference to Ulster Bank Group having significant euro surplus capital.  So, basically, the way it managed it ... it had a lot of capital.  It just was whether it was in the right entity.  So this transaction, which you say was designed to mitigate something, to my mind it was appropriate transaction.  An organisation that has a number of licensed entities will have capital in one and perhaps risk in another and is obviously ... must retain its capital ratios appropriately, and, therefore, the transfer of loans and the risk associated with loans, into another regulated entity, as long as that entity has sufficient capital, and in this case, Ulster Bank Limited, which is FSA regulated, which we were also the auditors to, I was fully aware that that transaction was taking place and was properly reflected in the books and records of Ulster Bank Limited.

In fact, that standard said that you didn't recognise those losses no matter how likely they were to be.

So yes if loans had been processed with a control weakness was that an isolated incident or was that wholesale and could that have an impact on the actual properly, proper recording of loans?  And then lastly if loans were given and the process in the mortgage centre wasn't identifying impairment because people were maybe not paying on loans and maybe the system didn't allow Ulster Bank to understand that, that would be a concern I would have.  So it wasn't because I could see they were rectifying those issues so they had arrears because maybe things hadn't been processed well but they were closing them down and I don't believe from my understanding and my recollection of the 2007 audit there was material loss associated with the Dublin mortgage centre.  There had been a lot of operational mismanagement that they were correcting but it didn't have financial loss and therefore didn't require loans to be written off because they had been given in an inappropriate way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#UU00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1431471600,"counter":965,"content":"<p>In the bank's growth strategy ... the growth strategy appears to have been predicated on gaining significant market share from their competitors and they did discuss that with us.

Would you agree with that sentiment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#VV00500","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431471600,"counter":990,"content":"<p>Gosh, there is quite a lot of sentiment in that.  First of all, the accounting standards and the preparation of the numbers of the directives, so the accounting standards may ... are backward looking, it is a measurement of a point in time.  IAS 39 meant that there was a particular constraint in looking at what was incurred at the time so it does represent, perhaps, a ... some limitation of what ...  predicting expected loss might be.  So I guess the new standard will allow some greater forward looking, but it still has to be an expected loss, not an unexpected loss.  There is no standard that allows you predict the unexpected, and I think any view that there's a kind of forward future proofing or early warning system for things that might happen in the future, that won't be the case under even the expected law standard, because you still have to have data and say, \"What will this impairment likely turn out to be?\"  And you have to have an assumption, which is what the collateral value might be when you realise it in an impaired loan and, therefore, you have to have a view on the current state of the market, not the future state of the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#VV00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1431471600,"counter":991,"content":"<p>And in this morning's testimony and other testimonies we heard, that sort of transitional period between 2006 and 2008 where, in 2006, a lot of the people that have come before this inquiry have said that there was still an upbeat kind of forward looking, you know, positive view of things, that if things were to slow down, they wouldn't crash, that there'd be a soft landing and all the rest of it.  How would that impact upon IAS 39 in the basis that, by 2008, we could see, whatever was in the rear view mirror, the road ahead was completely different.

I think perhaps your concern is, was the speed of that undermining the model, and therefore was that of a wider concern?  I think in the context of an organisation that's moving, having had acquired a business like First Active moving to grow its loan book, there would be a period where significant growth would be there.  My concern in that situation would be to understand is the funding available to allow them do that.

The setting of the capital plan that ... under ... that ...as to what a licensed bank, I don't ... you know that I suppose ... I don't license the organisation - the organisation that licenses it decides what level of capital in a growth environment like that could be, and decides what scalers to put on its capital.  It can say \"There's a minimum capital level, but because you're growing so fast you need different capital levels.\"  And that's ... the regulator uses the financial information to make those decisions.

If the directors said to me they think it'll go down by 50%, they would have been potentially misrepresenting the information, the financials because they wouldn't know what it was.  It would be pure conjecture.  And the idea of the standard was an evidenced, verifiable evidence-based standard.  And we may believe there are flaws in that but a verifiable evidence-based standard is actually better than one that is purely based on conjecture.  If a group of directors are saying to me, \"We have looked at the valuations and actually yeah we think we'll hack off another 60%\" , that would be misrepresenting because it would be based on conjecture.  So it is a difficult thing I agree with you.  I think we're in agreement that the standard does require you to look at what would be realised and to net present value it but you have to use the available data in terms of what you believe valuations are standing at the moment.  Valuations can equally increase and decrease; it would be conjecture otherwise not to use the available data.

So from a starting point, the structure was good and the materials I saw going to board, although they had laws at times, that was in terms of some elements, they were always corrected and I always found that there was a good attitude towards control so if they had a process with something that was identified, there was an escalation process and it got addressed.  Maybe not always the speed that they might like, but that process seemed on the face of it, quite good.  There was obviously a number of legal entities.  UBIL, which is the Irish entity, First Active, and so the boards, they very much looked to an Ulster Bank Group.

From my recollection, they were raising serious queries at times, as regulators rightly do, and I said in relation to concerns, I think I have voiced this earlier, which is if the concerns were about the business model, the concern was to make sure that the reader of the financial statements fully understood that business model, which was where the lending was being done, what the quality of that loan book was, ensuring that credit quality analysis was provided in the accounts and then most particularly, and maybe was unique, and maybe therefore not why Mr. Nyberg wasn't covering it, was the liquidity issue, which was more acute for those who are stand-alone entities, was a different environment.

And we benefit from that as being what we call, in our audit methodology, the tools and techniques people use are not just the ones I decide on, but people right around our firm, nearly 200,000 people globally, not all are doing banking work, but those who are in banking work are contributing to a model and a database of risks and controls, so I feel that group of people are informed.  It does fall on me, I'm the person who makes the decisions to make sure that those risks are correct and for me and my team to review the work of anybody who has less experience. And every piece of work will be reviewed by another person, including my own, and, therefore, I'm subject in that scepticism to an independent partner who is not directly involved in the audit process looking through my opinion, my key working papers, my audit summary document, and saying, \"Is there a risk, Gerry, that you're being ... that you have a bias here, or that you're subject to this confirmation bias, which is information that passes you is the one that you think is the most relevant at the time?\".  So, your initial point was, was there a perception?  There possibly is a perception.  I'd say there's superb, really bright people working for us, who have lots more skills in some areas than I have.  They are put together in a model and we train them and it's a value-training process, and the amount of specialist time and expertise that goes into it, drawing from the best of our organisation is put into it.

I will also take the opportunity to discuss the new back to work family dividend which will assist parents who are moving from welfare payments to work.  <\/p> <p>  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Catherine Kellaghan, principal officer with operational responsibility for the Department&rsquo;s Longford headquarters and the schemes operated from there, including family income supplement, and Mr. Michael Cunningham, assistant principal officer in the child and family income policy section.  I have responsibility for policy on both jobseekers and lone parents.  I understand the clerk to the committee has circulated copies of the presentation and my colleagues and I will be pleased to address questions committee members may have at the conclusion of the statement.<\/p> <p>  Family income supplement is a weekly tax-free payment for employees on low earnings with children.  The payment, effectively, preserves the incentive to take up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she was claiming other social welfare payments.  Family income supplement is an important policy instrument in reducing child poverty in working households, as well as improving incentives to work.  It is estimated that the Department will spend approximately &euro;349 million this year on family income supplement, an increase of more than &euro;50 million when compared to last year.<\/p> <p>  To qualify for payment of family income supplement, a person must be engaged as an employee in full-time paid employment which is expected to last for at least three months and working a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight, or 19 hours per week.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with him or her or is part of a family supported by him or her.  Furthermore, family income supplement is calculated on the basis of 60% of the difference between the income limit for the family size and the weekly family income of the persons raising the children.<\/p> <p>  An integral part of the family income supplement scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, that rate will continue to be payable for a period of 52 weeks, provided the person concerned remains in full-time employment.  The rate of payment may be increased following the addition of a child to the family, either through birth, fostering, adoption or guardianship, in the course of these 52 weeks.  On the other hand, the rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings or other family income.  A key advantage of this approach which is unique to the family income supplement scheme is that claimants can be certain they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.  This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides a real incentive for families to avail of employment opportunities and ensures a degree of income stability for recipients.<\/p> <p>  In line with this policy, current social welfare legislation generally precludes changing the family income supplement rate within the 52 week payment period.  However, in the light of changes to the one-parent family payment scheme, regulations were introduced in July 2013 as an exceptional measure to enable entitlement to family income supplement to be changed during the 52 week period such that former one-parent family payment recipients in receipt of family income supplement will have the supplement payment automatically increased to compensate them for 60% of the loss of their one-parent family payment.<\/p> <p>  There has been a steady growth in recent years both in the number of families supported by family income supplement and associated expenditure, with the numbers in receipt of the supplement rising from 26,000 families with 56,000 children in 2009 to 50,000 families with 112,000 children by the end of last year.  Increased awareness of family income supplement as a consequence of the Department&rsquo;s information strategy for the scheme and significant improvements in customer service and processing times for family income supplement customers have contributed to the increased numbers.  Some of the increase in the numbers in receipt of family income supplement is also due to transfers from the one-parent family payment arising from the gradual reduction in the age of the youngest child to seven years.<\/p><p>The final phase of the one-parent family payment scheme age change reforms will take place on 2 July this year.  The maximum age of the youngest child at which a lone parent's payment will cease will be reduced to seven years for almost all recipients.  It is expected that approximately 30,000 lone parents will move from the one-parent family payment on that date, of whom approximately 5,200 are already family income supplement recipients.  These individuals will see their family income supplement automatically increase from 2 July and letters were issued to them last month explaining their transition from the one-parent family payment.  This will ensure their family income supplement payment will increase to partially compensate them when they move from the one-parent family payment.<\/p><p> Lone parents who will be affected by the final phase of the reforms to the one-parent family payment scheme have been invited to attend information seminars in their local Intreo office.  To further encourage lone parents to take up employment or increase their hours of employment, departmental staff are actively promoting at these information seminars the family income supplement scheme as the best financial option available to them.  Lone parents who can increase the number of hours they can work to 19 per week will be significantly better off than when in receipt of the one-parent family payment only.  <\/p><p> To assist further, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has asked the Labour Market Council to specifically examine the issue of how employers nationwide can assist lone parents in increasing their hours of work to enable them to qualify for the family income supplement payment.  The employer engagement sub-committee of the Labour Market Council considered the issue on 1 May.  Officials of the Department sought employer support to increase the number of hours available to these clients to take them over the minimum 19 hour per week qualification threshold for family income supplement.  Members of the committee were supportive and undertook to raise awareness of the issue and encourage employers to increase the number of hours available to this client group to take them over the threshold.  It should also be noted that lone parents who will move from the one-parent family payment to family income supplement from 2 July will be entitled to receive the new back to work family dividend which was contained in the recent Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 which the President signed into law last week.  This payment allows lone parents and jobseekers to retain the child proportion of their social welfare payment when they move into employment.  They retain the full amount for the first year and half the amount in the second.  For each child, subject to a maximum of four children, this equates to an additional payment of &euro;1,550 in the first year and &euro;775 in the second. <\/p><p> As the dividend has no impact on an individual&rsquo;s entitlement to family income supplement, it offers an additional and significant incentive to lone parents to take up employment on top of their existing family income supplement payment.  Staff of the Department are actively promoting both the back to work family dividend and the family income supplement sceme, as, combined, they offer a substantial incentive to parents who make the transition to employment.

A huge part of that, but not all of it, is the way we structure the one-parent family payment and the negative effect that structure has on some families.  That has to be dealt with.<\/p><p> Senator Moloney touched on some of the questions that arise in this context.  Someone who loses the one-parent family payment and goes onto a jobseeker's transitional payment will still suffer an element of loss of household income, even if family income supplement is available to him or her.  Perhaps the officials will argue that such a person could be incentivised after a while if he or she finds available work that suits his or her schedule.  That is not always possible, as Senator Craughwell said.  Have the officials assessed what that loss might be?  What is the variable on the 60% increase in family income supplement with the jobseeker's transitional payment?  On the other side, what is the loss on the one-parent family payment?<\/p><p> I will give another example.  I do not know whether this issue has been discussed at Department level.  This approach will simply not work if some employers are trying to bring their employees, such as those who are caught on zero-hour contracts, over the 19-hour limit.  Has the Department engaged with some of those employers that are noted for using zero-hour contracts?  One would expect they would have the flexibility to attract lone parents into the workplace.  That does not happen, however.  Some employees might have an issue with reaching the limits of 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight.  There is no consistency in that.  I think we need further engagement on that.<\/p><p> I will conclude by touching on what Deputy Ryan said.  I have been made aware from anecdotal sources that a large number of families do not access family income supplement because they are not aware of it.  I think there could be more proactive income-sharing between the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners.  Many of these people are not on the books of the Revenue Commissioners because their income limits are so low and are not on the books of the Department of Social Protection because they are at work.  If an information exchange were conducted, I expect it would reveal that thousands of families that do not claim family income supplement are not earning enough income to be taxed.  It would be easy to write to or otherwise contact those families to tell them they might be suitable applicants for family income supplement.  Has that ever been done?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015051300002#D00700","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431518400,"counter":1415,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Craughwell for using the word \"desert\".

I bow to the ability of Senator Moloney in dealing with this on the ground.  Mr. Egan said that the family income supplement payment \"effectively preserves the incentive to take up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if they were claiming other social welfare payments\".  Could he talk to me about what he means by \"marginally better off\"?  Is it not the kernel of the matter here that people are so badly paid in some work that social welfare payments run almost in parallel with their earnings?  I am only asking the question.  What exactly does Mr. Egan mean by \"marginally better off\"?  What are the boundaries of that?  I think that is the main problem here.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask a question that goes back to the point Deputy Harrington made about communication.  How many lone parents have attended seminars in local Intreo offices?  It is not just a question of how people's entitlements are communicated to them; it is also a question of how people pick up on and lock into that communication.

He or she will come out with a net income of more than &euro;600 a week, having started out with a salary of &euro;300, by the time it is topped up by the State to the tune of another &euro;300.

I think it is important for people to know how good a subsidy the family income supplement is.  My question arises from what some of the other members have said.  Having looked at this, I understand that some people who are currently on family income supplement will actually gain after they have lost their one-parent family payment.  Now it might not be a huge gain.  I will give an example because I want to see if I am right.

I ask members to get back to me if I leave any of their questions out.  My colleague, Ms Kellaghan, will respond to the questions that were asked about family income supplement.<\/p> <p>  I will begin by answering the Chairman's question about the reform of the one-parent family payment.  The change in income of each individual person who is working and is already in receipt of family income supplement will be based on family sizes and on the amount of earnings they will have.  In the case mentioned by the Chairman, it is possible that a person with two children who was receiving a one-parent family payment of &euro;100 will be better off.  It is very hard for us to determine the extent of that.  We know that most people who are in receipt of family income supplement and the one-parent family payment have fewer than two children.  The average number of children among lone parents is approximately 1.8.  That is what we are looking at.  We know there will be small income losses for some people.  Other people will have greater income losses.  The smaller the family size, the smaller their earnings.  It is a question of the way family income supplement compensates them for it.  It is hard to give Senator Moloney and Deputy Harrington a definitive answer in terms of how much people will lose.  Some people will gain.  We can categorically state that people who are working already, are not claiming family income supplement and are in receipt of the one-parent family payment will be better off if they can claim family income supplement when they lose their entitlement to the one-parent family payment.  It does not matter as long as they work the 19 hours.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman referred to last year.  This year is different.  The situation is actually better this year compared to last year, when we did not have the back to work family dividend.  In the case the Chairman highlighted, we did not have the &euro;30 for each of the two children.  We did not have that extra &euro;60 to give to the lone parent who made the transition from the one-parent family payment.  This July, more people will be financially better off than they would have been if they had made the transition last year.  There will still be income losses.<\/p> <p>  I would like to pick up on Senator Craughwell's comment about lone parents needing \"to desert their children\".<\/p><p>What I need to say in this context is that the original reform in the 2013 legislation was that, at age seven years, eligibility for one-parent family payment would stop and they would be subject to qualifying for another social welfare payment.  At the time, we expected most people to make the transition onto jobseeker's payment.  Committee members are aware of the key criteria for eligibility for jobseeker's allowance or jobseeker's benefit payments, which is that a person is available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  In that context, if the original reform had been implemented, lone parents would have been expected to be available for and genuinely seeking work with, in the particular case highlighted, children of seven or eight years at home.  We changed that and the Minister introduced the jobseeker's transition arrangement.  As Senator Moloney said, this exempts lone parents for a seven year period until the youngest child turns 14 years from the two criteria of the jobseeker's scheme.  People are not required to be available for, and genuinely seeking, work.  The reform is aimed at engaging with lone parents for the first time ever.  We do not have a record of engaging with lone parents and, since the inception of the one-parent family payment  in the mid-90s, it was just income support.  We never offered them education, training or personalised support in any way other than basic income payment.  The information sessions are telling people to come in and talk to us and we will tell them the best option for them based on their individual circumstances.  The aim is not to force lone parents into employment but to provide them with the assistance over the seven-year period of getting them ready for employment.  This may involve identifying that they need an education or training course, community employment or, if they are already employment ready and want to work, helping them to make the bridge.  It is the first time we are doing it in the Department and it is a key change.<\/p><p> If a lone parent does not want to work and the youngest child is under 14 years, they will not be forced.  We will not require them but we will ask them to come in and engage with us so they can meet a case officer and get a personalised development plan so that we can help them prepare for the time when the child turns 14 years of age.  Then, they will be treated like any other jobseeker and the criteria of genuinely seeking and available for work will apply.<\/p><p> Senator Moloney mentioned a point about the back to work family dividend.  The back to work family dividend is on top of the family income supplement and has no impact on the family income supplement.  It is an additional top-up incentive for a family in employment or making the transition into employment.  This is a key element of it and provides an additional buffer in the first two years of moving from welfare to employment.  Senator Moloney asked us to clarify whether anyone in receipt of the family income supplement will receive the back to work family dividend if, in the circumstances of reforms to the one-parent family payment, they are no longer entitled to the one-parent family payment.  If they claim the family income supplement or are in receipt of it, they will be entitled to apply and they will receive the back to work family dividend.<\/p><p> While legislation was passed and enacted last week, we have taken applications for the dividend from 5 January.  We received just short of 1,000 applications that we are ready to process.  We will process them over the coming weeks.  They may not all be eligible but we will have significant numbers in receipt of the back to work family dividend very quickly, which is positive.  Also, 5,200 lone parents will be affected by the reforms I mentioned if they are already in receipt of the family income supplement.  In the letters sent out last month, they were told that this is the back to work family dividend and that they would receive an application form to fill in.  At information sessions, we are actively promoting family income supplement.  Based on what happened over the past two July periods, we expect an increase in new claimants from lone parents for the family income supplement and all individuals will, if they make the transition from the one-parent family payment onto the family income supplement, receive the back to work family dividend.<\/p><p> Senator O'Donnell asked about what we mean by marginal.  Perhaps the term is wrong.  Some families, based on their size and levels of earnings, may be marginal but there are also cases where they can be substantially better off on the family income supplement.  It is difficult to give set figures.  In a recent television documentary involving the Chairman, an individual who was a lone parent was going to be better off by &euro;200 after working an extra four hours.  It is a combination of family size but there are cases where the gains are smaller.  It depends on family size and it would be more marginal in the case of a one child family.  They would not receive &euro;30 for each of the three children.  Family income supplement is designed to support low-income families and the thresholds are based on family size starting at &euro;506 up to &euro;1,298.  It is a broad range; there can be marginal differences but also significant ones.<\/p><p> The Senator asked how many lone parents are engaged in the information seminars.  We have asked lone parents to come out and engage with us.  Most of the sessions have concluded because we ran them since the end of January or February.  We have a high completion rate of application forms processed for the jobseeker's transition rate.  This is about 75% of what we deem the eligible cohort.  The Intreo offices have invited every lone parent by letter and if they do not attend these information sessions they are guaranteed to get a second letter.  If the Intreo office has capacity and if the person does not attend, the office will phone the person and make every effort, depending on resources, to encourage the lone parent to come in.  It is in the interests of the lone parents to come in to ensure there is another payment after 2 July.  We are in the process of following up on as many of those lone parents as we can but we already have a substantial number of them processed and ready to go.<\/p><p> The 5,200 family income supplement recipients are virtually all done and that will be seamless based on the past two years.  The difference will occur when they apply for the back to work family dividend and this is done through the Intreo office.  My colleague, Ms Catherine Kellaghan, will answer questions on the family income supplement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015051300002#E01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Egan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431518400,"counter":1427,"content":"<p>The first question concerned the increase in take-up.  We outlined the huge increase in take-up since 2012, some of whom were lone parents exiting the lone parent scheme.  There was a more general increase in take-up.  The specific question from Deputy Ryan was whether there are people eligible who are not taking up the payment.  We have no clear administrative data to identify specific people who we are sure are entitled to the family income supplement.  That hampers us in contacting them directly and saying they qualify for it.  The latest research commissioned by the Department was done in 2008 and it included questions on take-up.  There was a sample of 3,000 people and, among them, some were already in receipt of the family income supplement but a large cohort comprised 2,000 cases of the Department and we thought, based on the information, they would possibly qualify.<\/p><p>However, the outcome of the research was that when the Department explored the information it was decided that only about 23% of the people who in our data seemed they may qualify would actually qualify.  It may be that perhaps the previous research done by the ESRI which had identified quite high levels of potentially eligible families who were not applying might have been overstated.  It is difficult to prove either way but those are the indications.  <\/p><p> As Mr. Egan has pointed out, the Department has been actively promoting FIS, in particular, over the past two or three years, through its Intreo service, for all jobseekers and for lone parents.  A poster campaign was launched last year and this was confined to the mid-Leinster region and the north Dublin region.  As a result of that poster campaign, we have seen increases in applications from that region so the campaign has been effective.  As a result of the effectiveness of the campaign it has been rolled out throughout the country.  It is a poster and leaflet campaign on view in all the Department's offices and in the Citizens Information offices.  Anyone interested can pick up a leaflet which will give individuals a good idea of what they might be entitled to if they are working and have families.<\/p><p> In the Department's most recent intervention we have written to Mandate and Siptu and to the public service unions to provide them with details and leaflets about FIS and about who might qualify in order for them to make the information available to their members.  This has potentially given the Department access to 260,000 people who may be entitled to FIS.<\/p><p> At the moment the Department has approximately 50,000 families who are in receipt of FIS but since 2012 at any one time we have over 110,000 families in receipt of FIS.  We have reached quite a lot of families.  Some families have been in receipt of FIS and have progressed within their employment to the stage where they are no longer reliant on FIS as their income increases or they are promoted or work extra hours.  We have covered a large number of families over the past three years.<\/p><p> Senator Moloney raised a question about the 52 weeks.  This period of time is part of the legislation governing FIS.  Except in the stated specific circumstances, FIS will not be reviewed in the 52-week period.  In certain circumstances it might seem harsh but the over-riding policy objective of the scheme is to provide stability for people.  In order to provide that stability, the 52-week period is there so that they can rely on that extra income and make plans based on that income for the next 52 week period.  The answer to the Senator's question is that there is no discretion in applying the rule as it is a statutory requirement for the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015051300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Kellaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431518400,"counter":1429,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kellaghan for that response.  On the flip side the advantage is that if a person's wages increase the FIS payment does not decrease.  I refer to the cohort of people who get caught every year; people such as lollipop ladies, school canteen staff and postal workers in some cases.  I know a post woman who gives up work for the summer because her children are on holidays from school.  She has to surrender her FIS payment and apply to have it re-instated at the end of the holidays.<\/p> <p>  I put this point to the Minister of State in the course of a debate in the Seanad.  He said the Department would investigate.  The JobsPlus scheme pays employers to take on employees.  I suggested that a similar payment could be an incentive - not the same amount - for employers to provide flexible working hours for lone parents so that they could work around school hours and be available to care for their children, thereby avoiding the need for child care which is a significant issue for parents.  This suggestion might warrant a discussion by the committee at a later date. <\/p> <p>  I have concern for people who work as home helps.  They could have one hour a day for five days.

What lone parents on the transitional payment are allowed to do is that they can work as long as they want, as many days as they want in the week and they will get a payment provided they satisfy the means test.  This is done as an additional support.  If the child is young and is in primary school, in many cases the parent will not be able to work a full-time week and it is better to have some employment at that stage than no employment.  That is the reason the flexibility was introduced along with the transitional payment.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of what happens when the child turns 14 years, the parent becomes a jobseeker.  That is an old chestnut that the Department constantly faces.  The jobseeker scheme is very set in terms of the four-in-seven rule which means a person can only work three days in any seven consecutive days.  An hour a day is considered a full day of employment.  Most jobseekers actually work a full day of employment per day.  We will only support someone with a jobseeker's payment if he or she is working a maximum of three days a week.<\/p> <p>  Many people ask about switching that time into hours.  I can understand their position and in particular cases, such as the home help, I can understand that position entirely.  However, from the Department's perspective we have to be very much aware of the consequences of doing a reform of that nature because of the magnitude of that reform.  We believe it would involve a significant inflow into the jobseeker's schemes based on the number of people who are working part-time and are not currently claiming jobseeker's payment.  It would be substantially in excess of what we are paying already in casual payments.  There would be a significant cost to the Exchequer to do that.  There is no easy answer.  <\/p> <p>  Our jobseeker's schemes are set in law so we have to treat everyone equally.  Unfortunately, as described by Senator Moloney, if a home help is working one hour a day and is a jobseeker but not on the transitional payment if he or she is a lone parent, that person will not be eligible.  However, that person could be eligible for a supplementary welfare payment or a payment of that nature.<\/p> <p>  Senator Moloney also mentioned an incentive for employers to offer flexible hours in order to help the employment of lone parents.  We would need to think about the implications of that suggestion.  We are currently in discussion with the Labour Market Council to see if it will leverage support about trying to encourage employers to help lone parents and to provide those flexible hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015051300002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1431518400,"counter":1434,"content":"<p>Marks &amp;amp; Spencer is an employer which does so.

Will the Department employ qualified persons to meet those moving into a transition to provide proper career analysis and carve out a career pathway for them?<\/p> <p>  As the witnesses are probably aware, I left the further education sector to become a Senator relatively recently.  In my previous role, I was often greatly upset by the number of people with children who started further education courses in September before finding by late October, November or December that it was no longer possible to continue the course.  The reason was that their courses will have had a start time of 9 a.m. and while they may have had a special arrangement under which they did not have to be present until 10 a.m. to allow them to drop children at school or whatever, they suddenly found they had fallen behind in subjects.  The Department supported some excellent schemes in Finglas 15 or 20 years ago where the same programme ran three times per day to allow mothers or unemployed people to come together and agree to do either a morning, afternoon or evening session.  I do not blame the Department for this problem because legislators must engage in joined up thinking to bring education and welfare closer together and provide the options required.  <\/p> <p>  On the transition payment, if the purpose of the process is to upskill and train people, why is it not called a training allowance, which is a more user-friendly term for those who need education and training?<\/p> <p>  While I may have come across as a little abrasive in my earlier contribution, I should point out that departmental officials do a tremendous job in difficult circumstances dealing with difficult people who also face difficult circumstances.

The majority of those are former F&Aacute;S employment service officers and many of them would have already had a qualification from NUI Maynooth in a guidance field, so some have experience.  We significantly increased the number of case officers over the last two years by 300.  They all received additional training and the Department is in the process of continuously developing training programmes for our staff.  There is a particular focus on case officers in that regard.  They might not have the qualifications that their other colleagues have from NUI Maynooth, but they have access to training.<br\/><br\/>It is important to be up-front about it as well.  The focus of the Department is not guidance in terms of education.  Obviously, Senator Craughwell was connected with an ETB and the ETB adult education guidance officers are excellent in that respect.  We have a slightly different focus.  It is not education <i>per se<\/i>of a holistic nature, but education and training with the aim of trying to progress somebody into employment.  That is our focus.  We want to give them the supports so they can go off and become financially independent.  The transitional payment is giving them that period of time to help themselves if they are in a position to do so.<br\/><br\/>The flexibility of provision is obviously a long standing issue.  SOLAS and the ETBs already run a great deal of flexible provision.  I am aware that SOLAS, in particular, runs many online courses and part-time evening courses.  I am regularly in consultation with lone parent groups and they make the points that have been made here.  It is a difficult nut to crack.  Some of our former training centres, now ETBs, had a nine-to-five attitude to a large extent.  Part of that was for very good reasons.  It was trying to get the trainee ready for work and to get them disciplined, but that does not always suit lone parents.  It is an issue we will be discussing further into the future.  However, there is some online and part-time provision that might be suitable for many lone parents.  We also provide child care supports that are tied in with ETB provision, so if it was nine-to-five they would be able to have a child care place.  Again, however, that depends on whether a place is available and whether it matches if the child is of school going age or younger. <br\/><br\/>I will not disagree about the name of the jobseeker's transitional arrangement.  Training allowance is an interesting suggestion.  The name came from the Department, probably because it was so close.  We are bringing people from the one-parent family payment and putting them on a jobseeker's payment, but we want to make it not seem like the jobseeker's payment so there was not too much imagination given to it.  It is an interesting idea that we can think about.  It is a somewhat clunky creation, to be honest.<br\/><br\/>Senator Moloney asked about feedback from people who have already gone through the process.  In each of the last two months of July there has been an increase in new FIS recipients, which is very positive from our perspective.  It is what we are trying to achieve.  We have engaged with virtually all of those people through the case officer.  Unfortunately, we are in the process of developing a new active case management system that will not be up and running until later this year.  The way we have done it up to this point is not perfect for getting output information.  They have all been accessed and we have started to collate that.  I have data on it.  Approximately 2,000 people have gone through an engagement process and they are engaged, but the information we have at present is not as good as it will be in the future.  This new system will be up and running in time for the July cohort and we will start engaging with those parents from September.  By the end of the year we will engage with all of them.  That is the Department's plan.<br\/><br\/>The Chairman asked about the &euro;500 grant we provide.  It is not my area but I know it is called the technical employment support grant.  I do not think there is flexibility with it but I will check that with colleagues in the Department and refer back to the clerk with data and information on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015051300002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1431518400,"counter":1460,"content":"<p>That would be very helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015051300002#J00500","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1431518400,"counter":1461,"content":"<p>I have a final question.

This would also apply in some urban centres, especially in parts of Dublin.  What are we doing to attract more trained doctors to take up positions in general practice?  The Minister of State is more exposed to the facts across the State than I am, but I am surprised that, even in very large and generally attractive urban locations, there has been difficulty in attracting doctors to take up vacant positions in practices with GMS associations.

We can put other things in place such as the shared list.  We have more women than men who qualify as GPs and the position is difficult because of family commitments and the choices people have to make.  The ability to share a list will have a positive impact on our lack of ability to attract GPs.<\/p> <p>  Because of the circumstances in which the country found itself some of the financial incentives and grants available in remote rural settings were removed.  We are looking at them again.  I am not saying they will be returned in full or even as they were, but we have to look at how we incentivise people to serve more remote areas.  It comes as a surprise to all of us that even with a good general list, even in an urban setting, although not necessarily the capital city, there is a reluctance to take up positions.  That is easing and there is an assurance in the system for people coming back.  The things we are doing for the over-70s and the under-sixes will attract people, but it is something we cannot take our eyes off.

About what provisions are we talking?  Does this refer to assessing resources?  We are talking about rolling out free GP care for the under-sixes and there are concerns about the capacity to absorb that number of children for the purposes of providing free care at the point of service.  It is a welcome provision, but it raises the question of whether, at the other end of the spectrum, the over-70s will require more frequent visits to GPs as they suffer from more chronic illnesses.  Will GP services have the capacity to deal with more complex cases within primary care, in view of the fact that the stated aim of the Government is for the primary care system to be the bulwark in the delivery of health care?  We are trying to decrease the numbers going into the acute hospital sector and I assume this is to provide an incentive to do so.

The intention is that the under-sixes will be covered by the end of June, if we manage to contain the timeframe we have set out.  We have begun the process of negotiating the bigger contract with GPs which has been in place since the early 1970s and which needs to be updated, given that medical and primary care services have changed so significantly.

On a technical point, the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014, amends the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act of 2005 with the inclusion of three new offences and the definition of terrorist linked activities.  The 2005 Act is the parent Act with regard to terrorism.  <\/p> <p>  In this Bill, any transfer of data to another jurisdiction is governed by EU law and the terms of the Council of Europe convention on the prevention of terrorism, the text of which is set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill.  Paragraph 2 of Article 17 of the convention provides that parties will carry out their obligations in respect of international co-operation and criminal matters in conformity with any treaties or other agreements on mutual legal assistance that may exist between them.  In the absence of such treaties and agreements, parties will provide assistance to one another in accordance with domestic law.  <\/p> <p>  The legal advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is that the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act of 2008, as amended, apply in this case and no further provision is required in this Bill as proposed by the amendment.  The Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act provides the legal framework for the provision of assistance that applies to offences across the Statute Book and it is appropriate for all requests for assistance and transfers of data to be dealt with in the context of the mutual assistance framework, which is used all the time, rather than in individual legislative provision.  There are restrictions on providing the assistance contained in the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act and, in the context of international agreements concerning mutual assistance arrangements to which the State is a party, that is the framework in which business is done and decisions are taken.<\/p> <p>  Data protection legislation also provides a certain amount of checks and balances on data protection and transfers of data.  Requests for assistance and mutual assistance or the restrictions on it come under the mutual assistance legislation.  Data protection legislation also applies and, together, they provide a sufficiently robust regime to protect data transfers.  I will not accept the amendment.  The advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is that it is appropriate that any requests for the exchange of information or assistance are dealt with under the  Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act.

Due to the nature of the Bill, comprising entirely of amendments to existing legislation and providing for no new policy provisions, it had been substantially drafted in advance of submission to Government and is before the committee in draft Bill form, as opposed to the more usual heads of Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny.<br\/><br\/>The Bill provides for amendments to the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the Taxi Regulation Act 2013, the Road Traffic Act 1961, the Railway Safety Act 2005 and the State Airports Act 2004.  It is a short Bill comprising just seven sections, including one providing for the short title and collective citation, with one each for four of the five Acts being amended and two for amendments to the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.  I will give an overview of the main amendments being proposed, but I emphasise that the amendments proposed are technical amendments to existing legislation and do not involve any new regulatory policy.<br\/><br\/>Section 1<b><\/b>relates to the public transport infrastructure functions of the National Transport Authority, NTA.  The proposed amendments to the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 will ensure that the NTA can develop and deliver public transport infrastructure such as bus rapid transit, BRT, in the event that it is decided to proceed with such infrastructure.  The amendments are required to address certain issues identified by legal advisers to the NTA as potentially precluding the NTA from providing such projects.  The proposed amendment ensures that the NTA would have the necessary powers to deliver required public transport infrastructure but does not involve a commitment to the development of BRT.  No decision has yet been made with regard to any of the BRT projects proposed by the NTA.<br\/><br\/>In particular, the amendments in section 1 address a constraint in the existing legislation which creates a differentiation between public roads existing before the establishment date of the NTA and public roads which were developed after the NTA was established.  The advice of the Office of the Attorney General confirmed that a technical amendment would be required to the 2008 Act to address this differentiation and provide that the NTA would have equivalent <i>vires <\/i>to provide public transport infrastructure on public roads that were constructed either before or after the establishment date of the NTA.<br\/><br\/>Section 1 also provides for an amendment to section 44 of the DTA Act 2008 regarding the performance of a &quot;function&quot; by the NTA.  The amendment removes a doubt that has arisen over whether it adequately addresses the situation where only part of the function is required to be performed.  This means that a likely case of the NTA intending to undertake certain aspects of a function, while the other statutory party continues to carry out all of the remaining aspects, may not be permissible, or may carry the risk of a successful legal challenge.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Sections 2 and 3 provide for amendments to the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.  That Act was introduced primarily to give legal effect to recommendations of the Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011 relating to increased enforcement measures, including a demerit scheme to deal with recurrent breaches of small public service vehicle, SPSV, regulations; the issue of on-the-spot fines for an increased range of offences; and a proportionate system for mandatory disqualification from holding a licence on conviction for a serious criminal offence.  The 2013 Act also repealed and replaced the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.<br\/><br\/>The amendments in section 2<b><\/b>can be grouped into those which provide greater precision in the 2013 Act relating to certain provisions; provide more specific enabling powers under the 2013 Act for certain matters which the NTA may provide for in regulations; and relate to punctuation and textual corrections and refinement.  Some of the main amendments providing greater precision in the Act provide for the inclusion of a requirement that the licensing authority may only grant a licence to drive a small public service vehicle to a person who holds a driving licence to drive such a vehicle; the automatic revocation of a SPSV licence on surrender of the licence by the licence holder; and the non-application of the representations and appeal procedures under the Act to decisions of the licensing authority to refuse to grant a licence or to revoke or suspend a licence, arising from a vehicle not meeting the required standard for SPSVs.<\/p><p>Without this amendment, the licensing authority's decision does not take effect until the appeal procedures have been exhausted, which takes around two months, during which the licence continues and the vehicle can be used as a small public service vehicle, SPSV, despite failing the vehicle standards test.  It is proposed to extend the current three-month timeframe to nine months from the date of the death of a licence holder, during which the nominated representative of the deceased licence holder may apply to the NTA for the grant of a licence of the same category.  It is considered that in the circumstances three months is too short a period.  The final amendment relates to the applicability of the dispatch operator licensing requirements to technological intermediaries.  An argument has been put forward that such intermediaries do not provide a booking service, which is the term used in the 2013 Act; rather, they provide a platform whereby intending passengers can directly contact vehicles.  The proposed amendments to sections 2, 7(2)(c) and 22(5) of the Act will bring certainty on this issue.<\/p><p> As regards those amendments providing for more specific enabling powers for certain matters which the NTA may provide for in regulations, the key amendments relate to section 7 and provide for the requirement for prescribed written declarations or undertakings to accompany a licence application - for example, that the applicant has not been convicted of certain offences specified in the Act and that his or her health or mobility does not affect his or her ability to drive a small public service vehicle.  There are also a number of amendments relating to punctuation and textual corrections and refinement.<\/p><p> Section 3 provides for the substitution of section 48 of the 2013 Act relating to fixed payment notices for small public service vehicles.  Section 48 provides that when a person is issued with a fixed payment notice he or she has 28 days, beginning on the date specified in the notice, during which he or she may pay the prescribed fixed payment amount.  That is the first payment option.  If the person does not pay the prescribed fixed payment amount during that first 28-day period, he or she may make a payment of an amount 50% greater than the prescribed fixed payment amount.  That is the second payment option.  However, the timeframe for the second payment option is not currently prescribed in section 48 - it is prescribed in the fixed payment notice issued to the alleged offender.  Legal advice is that it is preferable that the period for the second payment option be prescribed in section 48.  In this amendment, the opportunity has also been taken to provide for greater precision in certain aspects of the wording of section 48 - for example, the addition of the words \"specified in the notice\" to subsection (1)(a), and the addition of the words \"duly completed\" to subsection (1)(b).<\/p><p> Section 4 provides for an amendment to the Railway Safety Act 2005 to change the name of the Railway Safety Commission to the Commission for Railway Regulation.  The Railway Safety Commission was established under the Railway Safety Act 2005 to foster and encourage railway safety and to enforce legislation relating to railway safety.  Directive 2012\/34\/EU establishing a single European railway area, which must be transposed into national law by mid-June 2015, requires each member state to designate a regulatory body to monitor competition in the rail services market in the State to ensure non-discriminatory access to railway markets.  The regulatory body will have a monitoring function and the role of hearing appeals made by railway undertakings and other interested persons.<\/p><p> Draft regulations that are under preparation at present to transpose the directive provide for the assignment of the functions of the regulatory body to the Railway Safety Commission.  The effect of this will be that, in addition to the regulation of railway safety, the Railway Safety Commission will have statutory functions in respect of regulation of the rail services market.  It is considered, therefore, that it would be appropriate to change the name of the commission to Commission for Railway Regulation to best reflect the broadening of its remit.  It is proposed that the date for the change of name be appointed in an order to be made by the Minister to ensure that the timing of the change of name can be carried out in a planned and organised manner.<\/p><p> Section 5 provides for a purely technical amendment to section 27, as inserted by section 51 of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014 into the State Airports Act 2004.  The amendment will bring the provisions of section 27 in line with similar provisions under the Road Traffic Acts as operated by local authorities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and clarifies that the payment accompanying the notice cannot be accepted unless all the required information has been completed on the notice.<\/p><p> Section 5 also provides for an amendment to section 48 of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014, which sets out the basis on which authorised officers can act in the interest of the proper operation or the security or safety of an airport, or the security or safety of persons, aircraft or other property at an airport.  The amendment provides for the inclusion of an offence under section 47 of that Act in the various offences for which an authorised officer at an airport may arrest a person without warrant.  An offence under section 47 relates to a case in which an authorised officer at an airport finds a vehicle remaining stationary or parked in a place in contravention of airport by-laws and the driver does not comply with the requirement of the officer to move the vehicle.<\/p><p> Section 6 is essentially a technical amendment, correcting section 106 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, which deals with duties on the occurrence of an accident.  It was amended in 2014 to introduce new offences for hit-and-run incidents causing death or serious injury.  The Attorney General's office has since advised the Department that the amended version of the section contains an implicit contradiction.  The new hit-and-run provisions are indictable offences, but they come under a section heading referring to summary offences.  The Attorney General's advice is that the intention of the law is clear in spite of the error, and the DPP is continuing to take prosecutions under this legislation.  However, it is also the Attorney General's view that the error should be corrected at the earliest available opportunity, and that is what we are doing here.  At the same time, we are rectifying an omission in the 2014 provisions.  When the new hit-and-run provisions were introduced, there should have been an associated amendment to state that there would be a consequential disqualification for those who were convicted under the new provisions.  As that was not done at the time, we are doing it now though section 6(b) of the present Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015051300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431505800,"counter":1561,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doyle for his presentation.

Mr. Doyle referred to the necessity of the section to deal with bus rapid transit, BRT.  What is the difference between the provision of bus rapid transit and any other form of bus transit?  At the moment the NTA is in the process of going to the marketplace to issue tenders, which is causing a level of upset among workers, and there is the threat of strike action.

Cycling schemes and other such matters could be included there as well.  At the moment, the section refers to other public infrastructure which \"immediately before the establishment day\" was owned or under the control of a public transport authority.  It concerns local authorities in particular.  That would be included in the definition.  Each of the BRT schemes that are under design at the moment envisage works on public roads developed after the establishment date of the NTA.  For instance, the Swords bus rapid transit scheme will include the Glen Ellan Road extension north of Swords, but that extension was created after the establishment day.

This section also adds a new section.  It allows the owner of a vehicle to make a declaration in writing that another person was in charge of the car at the time the offence was committed.

Sections 2 and 3 amend the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.  Section 7 refers to the fitness of a person who is driving a taxi and whether they can handle somebody who is disabled.  Is it not the process that one gets a doctor's certificate to go into the industry in the first place and then one must have a test on an ongoing basis?  There will be some older taxi drivers or people who would not have the ability to lift a person who is disabled into a car.  What is the rule in that regard?  Do they refuse to take the person or say they are unable to take the person?  I am not sure that asking them to sign a declaration that they are fit and so forth is the norm in any industry.  Can the witness explain that?<\/p> <p>  Regarding a vehicle failing a test and a person is then suspended for two months while an appeal takes place, what if that is only a minor issue with the taxi and not a bad mechanical issue?

Will the witness explain if there are any exceptions if it is only a minor matter or a small issue to do with the interior of the taxi or otherwise, or is this purely a mechanical matter?<\/p> <p>  The extension from three months to nine months is quite reasonable.  With regard to the payment of 50% in section 48, I do not know why we continue to do this.  It is an extra charge of 50% for somebody who might not make a deadline.  Why are we putting such a heavy burden on people?  I know people should not do things if it is wrong to do them, but 50% is a massive amount for a penalty.  It is way over the top.<\/p> <p>  Finally, EU Directive 2012\/34 requires each member state to form a regulatory body to monitor competition.  This is another road to privatisation.

The proposed directive, 2012\/34, from which we derogated previously, must be implemented now.  It does not in any way impose a requirement on us to competitively tender for the provision of rail services.  We can still operate with the direct award contract, which the NTA has with Irish Rail.  It was a ten year contract from 2009 so it continues to 2019.  In fact, in discussions in Europe on the fourth railway package we are insisting that we can continue to have a direct award contract and that we do not have to tender competitively due to the size of our rail market, which is approximately 0.4% of the total EU rail market.  In some respects it would not make sense that we would be forced to competitively tender.  That is the position we are adopting in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the mechanical issue the Deputy mentioned, I presume that relates to the appeals procedure where somebody could continue to operate a vehicle which has failed the NCT as a taxi.  The way the legislation is worded at present means that, with appeals procedures and so forth, a person could potentially continue to operate that taxi for a period of two months even though it has failed the NCT.
