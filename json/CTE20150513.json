Good morning, members of ... Chairman, members of the committee.  My name is Liam Kelleher, I was director general of the federation from 1993 to 2007.<\/p> <p>  The CIF is the national and regional body for construction company, contractors, subcontractors and house builders in Ireland.  It is recognised by Government and public bodies as the representative body for the Irish construction industry.  This was reflected in its position as a social partner for the period.  The federation is owned and run by its members via an executive body of 34 members appointed through the various branches and associations that comprise the CIF.  All interests, sectoral and regional, are represented in the CIF&rsquo;s decision-making processes.  The organisation has 13 branches and a number of sectoral associations that pursue the policy objectives of their own subsector.<\/p><p>The five main industry groups are the Master Builders and Contractors Association, the Civil Engineering Contractors Association, the Mechanical and Electrical Contractors Associations, the Irish Home Builders Association and the Alliance of Specialist Contractors.  That umbrella group, the details of the membership of it were given in the submission that I made.  At its peak, the federation had in excess of 2,500 members, large, medium and small, whose priorities differed and where competition between groups and regions could be quite strenuous.  The purpose of the federation is to provide services to its members and to represent its members.<\/p><p> For the period covered by this inquiry, 90% or more of the federation's resources were devoted to the provision of services to members.  Some of these services were outlined in the submission and I am covering some of them briefly here.  Industrial relations was a core service, including representation at various labour relations fora: the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, as well as dealing with the trade unions and the industry at the time.  Health and safety was a high priority for the federation during the period the joint committee is examining.  The CIF worked with the Health and Safety Authority and the relevant trade unions to ensure compliance and competence in meeting and exceeding rising statutory safety standards.  The CIF remains one of the key stakeholders and drivers of the construction safety partnership.<\/p><p> Briefly on each of the main groups, main contracting, building and civil engineering, the staff at the federation provide information, advice and assistance to the main contracting members of the federation in general building and civil engineering.  They're the members of the federation who build the country's ports and airports, road and rail network, as well as hospitals, schools, public and private buildings.  Specialist contracting, the mechanical and electrical specialists, as well as the other range of specialist contractors - that group represents a wide range of specialist subcontractors and both the main contractors and the mech. and elec. contractors have built the wide range of foreign direct investment projects which have established in Ireland over the past 25 years and have built an international reputation for expertise in implementing high-technology projects on time and on budget.  In housing and planning, that department addresses a wide range of issues affecting members, including technical, planning, economic and environmental matters.  <\/p><p> Representation and lobbying -  representation and lobbying has always been a key element of CIF&rsquo;s activity.  As the members' representative body for the construction sector, it was our responsibility to represent members and the issues of the industry and to convey those to the media, Government and public bodies, national and local.  The CIF's policy position was clearly set out, after my time in August 2012, which formalised what had always been the federation's approach in this area.  We have always carried out our engagement with Government in an open manner.  We believe transparency should be a requirement for political and public service ... Civil Service engagement, when it comes to public policy issues.  We have always published our reports and policy papers and we have provided information about meetings and conversation ... and conversations concerning political and policy issues to our members.  It's part of a two-way process that encourages a better understanding of the issues involved on both sides.<\/p><p> A variety of the Departments, in keeping with the subject matter of the inquiry, the variety of the Government Departments that we would have met included the Department of the Environment, which had responsibility for construction policy ... for publishing the review and outlook for the construction industry and for many of the issues with which the industry dealt.  Our main contact with the Department of Finance would have been through the budgetary process where we made an annual pre-budgetary ... pre-budget submission, and usually met the Minister for Finance during that process or as part of that process.  Our submission would normally focus on taxation policy, both industry-specific and general, and the public capital programme.  Our interactions with the Department of the Taoiseach were generally around the macroeconomic position of the construction sector in Ireland and its place in the wider Irish economy.  During the years of social partnership, CIF was involved in more extensive discussions with the Department on issues relating to the implementation of successive national development plans and on pay-related issues in specific national agreements.<\/p><p>Striving to increase supply to meet demand across all subsectors of the industry was a recurrent theme of discussion.  Other Departments are listed in my submission: the Departments of Education, Jobs, Enterprise, Transport, Communications, Health, all of which we had communications with in relation to various aspects either of policy or the implementation of specific public expenditure programmes.<\/p><p> Members of the Oireachtas - the CIF engages on a broad level with Members of the Oireachtas, nationally and regionally.  This is done in an open manner, includes distribution of our annual pre-budget submission and other relevant information materials.  We interact with local authorities where there are programmes of local road investment, implementation of water and waste treatment programmes, social housing investment and a variety of other issues.  We would meet with An Bord Plean&aacute;la to discuss policy matters - generally once a year - planning policy, including timescales for decision making.  <\/p><p> In relation to the banks, banking regulators and banking representatives, we had very few ... we had very few interactions with banking authorities such as the Central Bank prior to the economic downturn and that, of course, was in the period that I was there.  Banking was just not a feature of CIF's activities pre-2008.  Access to finance was not an issue for CIF members with the federation in that period.  And I should also point out that the CIF, as an organisation, had no knowledge of the banking arrangements of any of its individual members or of how they financed their businesses or of their cash reserves or their borrowings.<\/p><p> Now, construction in Ireland has always been an important part of the Irish economy.  It has been a strong creator of jobs.  It has enabled foreign direct investment and it has built those inward investment projects very quickly and the necessary infrastructure to go with them to enable the Irish economy and Irish society to grow.  Pre-2000, during the national development plan of '94 to '99, I know that precedes this inquiry's period, but money was scarce and people were plentiful, but as the year 2000 approached, a major concern of the CIF was that as structural and cohesion funding from Europe was reduced that the public capital programme would be squeezed.  That turned out to be largely an unnecessary fear and concerns developed in Government about the capacity of the industry to deliver on the new national development plan.  One senior Government Minister spoke of bringing 2,000 immigrants into the State.  The Taoiseach indicated his concern that the industry did not have the capacity to manage large projects and both Government and Opposition were calling on the industry to expand in order to deliver on NDP projects and to increase the supply of housing.  There was a broad consensus across the political spectrum of the need ... and wider, of the need to build 500,000 plus new housing units in the following decade - that's from 2000 onwards.  Every sector was striving to increase supply and obviously, the figures for the value of the construction industry ... they're contained in my submission and you can see that they grew rapidly.  But in the period from 2000 onwards, I cannot overestimate the pressure I felt, and which I believe the industry was under, to expand its capacity to deliver building and civil engineering projects and to increase housing output.  And right up to ... output increased incrementally each year but right up to the end of 2006, demand for housing continued very strongly and then when housing output commenced to fall rapidly in 2007, a supply adjusted rapidly to falling demand.<\/p><p> Previous evidence to this committee has stated the overwhelming consensus were that the over ... the essential pillars of the economy were sound.  The prevailing wisdom was that if there was a property bubble, if one was to emerge, the country's still-high employment figures and positive Government finances would mitigate against a serious economic downturn.  The prevailing view was that a soft landing would follow.<\/p><p> The figures for housing have been included in our submission and we issued our projections annually.  We got them wrong on occasion, but the trend was pretty well upwards constantly through the years 2000.  But they were ... our forecasts were based on feedback from members but also on reports from NESC, from the ESRI, from the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment and wider sources.<\/p><p>On the way up ... up to and including 2006, housing demand exceeded supply and the industry strove to meet that.  Builders secured finance to purchase residentially zoned lands - and this is my final page, Chairman - secured planning permission, secured development finance to build the units, purchased secured mortgages to purchase the homes and builders built, and build, when and where they think they can sell.  Errors made in the scale of building in some parts of the country are fully acknowledged by the industry but these were lands that had been zoned for housing, the financial system had financed land purchase and development and planning permission had been given for the developments.  Taking the wider property investment perspective, the red ... the very ready availability of finance for development and property investment generally over the period was a prime driver of the demand for property, for investment property, in general, and, particularly, housing, new and second hand.  The extent of lending to the broader property sector, to property syndicates and to individuals in Ireland and abroad accelerated to levels which, in hindsight, were unsustainable.  The full scale of such lending for national and international property purchases only emerged with the establishment of NAMA.<\/p><p> To conclude, the level of construction activity reached unsustainable levels in the 2006-2007 period.  Specifically, too many houses were being built; too much economic activity was dependent on the sector.  Our mental focus as a federation, rightly or wrongly, was on the pressures that existed to deliver needed works in the building and civil engineering sectors and to meet the demand in the housing sector from a growing population.  When decline in the housing sector commenced, we believed it was a necessary correction and that the industry would settle around the 50,000 units output per annum. We believed in the soft landing expectation from all Irish sources and a wide range of economic forecasts - the IMF, the EU and the OECD.  We made mistakes; I made mistakes.  Not listening to contrarians was one of them, believing too readily the benign economic forecasts of the ... and the soft landing, and I am sorry for that.<\/p><p> There were many other entities involved also, but we are a part ... we were a part of it, I was a part of it and, to that extent, Chairman, I apologise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Kelleher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431471600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Kelleher.

Before then I spent two months working with Liam in preparation for his retirement.  In my previous career, I was a farmer and was heavily involved in the Irish Farmers' Association serving as deputy president from '91 to '93 and from president ... and as president from '97 to 2001.  I also had a brief political career, serving as a TD for Laois-Offaly from 2002 to 2007.  And during my time here in Leinster House, I was also Minister of State in ... at the Department of Finance. <\/p> <p>  Liam has already outlined the nature of the CIF and the role and the services played by the federation.  Ultimately, we exist to serve our members.  It is the various construction companies employees and contractors who make up the Irish construction industry and who are the backbone of the CIF.  Without them, there wouldn't be any federation.<\/p> <p>  Our role is to help our members on a broad industry-wide level and to provide support to them under many different headings.  These include issue like ... issues like industrial relations, contracting representation and lobbying, health and safety as well as several other areas that Liam has already referred to.  The nature of our membership is what gives CIF status in the Irish construction industry and the wider economy.  We are also a means for the industry to come together and to have a strong united voice.  It is also this responsibility that makes the CIF leaders for the construction industry in Ireland.  Our job is not just to work with the industry, but to work on their behalf through good times and through bad times.<\/p> <p>  As this inquiry is all too aware, over the last ten years the construction industry went through some very, very good times and we've also had to endure just over seven years of decline.  Obviously, it is the work of this Inquiry to find out the causes of the collapse of the economy as a whole, and I would like ... I would also encourage you to take a ... a close look at the plight suffered specifically by the construction industry during the course of your deliberations.  Without wanting to pre-empt the findings of the committee, I am sure that these findings will suggest that the causes of what went wrong in the economy were complex and had many different dimensions.  Certainly, one element that went wrong was the scale of the industry, how big it grew.  It reached unsustainable levels of activity and was responsible for far too big a percentage of the Irish economy.<\/p><p>As leaders of the industry, the CIF have to accept responsibility for the role we played in that growth.  Everything we did and every position we adopted we did to help our sector and to help our members.  Our various policy positions were driven by the views of our members as well as the prevailing economic and industry thinking at any particular moment in time.  Yes we were being told by national and international experts, economists and the Government that there would be a soft landing but we have to take responsibility as well.  However, time has shown that that approach was wrong and we're certainly sorry for that situation.  We accept that we should have done more to encourage a more responsible level of activity, we should have taken greater heed of the warnings coming from the various sources even if they were going against the mainstream.  We should have encouraged greater caution.  If we knew of course back then what we know now we would do things entirely differently.  There was a huge demand for houses and people needed some place to live, but looking back with perspective we can see that some of that demand was driven by speculation and the level of house building became sustainable.  We're sorry that this happened, we want to learn from the lessons that the economic collapse has taught us.  We are acutely conscious that tens of thousands of people in the construction sector lost their jobs and we want to ensure nothing like this happens again.  If the construction industry was one of the drivers of the boom it is certainly one of the major victims of the crash.  <\/p><p> Practically from around the time I joined the CIF, the construction industry had entered into a period of decline and difficulty.  I believe if you look at the Ulster Bank purchasing managers index that there were about 75 consecutive months of decline from May 2007 until September 2013.  The impact on the sector was massive, equally the pain felt in the industry had huge implications for the rest of the economy.       <\/p><p> Throughout the course of the downturn huge numbers of construction companies went out of business, at one point practically every week was bringing news of another significant company closing its doors.  At times it seemed like the industry was losing hundreds of businesses every month, it was the case.  It was a depressing and distressing time for our industry, for construction workers and their families.  The impact was most keenly demonstrated in the unemployment figures.  In the second quarter of 2007 there were 273,900 people directly employed in the industry according to the Central Statistics Office, by the first quarter of 2013 the number had fallen to 96,300.  That's a loss of 177,600 jobs over the course of almost six years so, you know, the impact that had on families around the country in every town and every village had a major impact.  <\/p><p> The turnaround had also been clear in Exchequer returns, the people who lost their jobs and the ones who didn't emigrate or seek job opportunities abroad went from paying income tax to receiving social welfare payment.  We never want to see the construction industry suffer like this again.  We want to see a sustainable construction industry operating at about 12% of GNP.  This is a level that Forf&aacute;s recently and the Government have both stated is appropriate for a country of our size with our demographic needs.  Unfortunately now and I ... acknowledge that we went to 23% of the economy at one stage back in 2006, we're now a long, long way below that particular point but thankfully we're now starting to move in the right direction.  However, as part of our final deliberations I would encourage the inquiry to at least note how badly the construction sector has suffered during the downturn.<\/p><p> As part of my appearance here, Chairman, before the committee, I was asked to talk about the establishment, the operation and the effectiveness of NAMA.  I think it is fair to say that the industry was very worried about what NAMA was going to be and what it was going to involve when it was established.  It was an entirely new entity that hadn't been established anywhere else on the globe, and you will see from the various reports that we provided to the inquiry that our members were expressing massive concern about the various provisions and the powers that would be provided to NAMA.  We were also anxious that the wrong approach could mean even greater suffering for an already distressed construction industry.  As we say in our submission to the inquiry, and I quote, \"It was clear to the CIF that its members would be subject to an entirely different banking environment and the establishment of NAMA would have a profound effect on the ability of some members to support their ongoing businesses.\"<\/p><p> I think a lot of our concerns came at that time from the scarcity of information about NAMA.  There was a lot of speculation floating around and the problem was that no one fully understood just how NAMA would end up operating and how it would work with the construction industry.  It is also fair to point out that the CIF wasn't alone in having concerns about NAMA prior to its establishment.  I know that many Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas were particularly verbal in their opposition to NAMA.  However, the extensive public debate on the establishment of this entity was a very good thing.  It allowed concerns to be taken on board and, in some cases, assuaged before the enactment of legislation.<\/p><p>The CIF believe that NAMA are doing a good job in handling a very difficult role.  On a macro level, we fully acknowledge that NAMA are fulfilling their remit and seem to be achieving results.  They are also one of the few sources of development capital in recent years for the industry, as they are funding the finalisation and the development of some of their assets to realise their full value.  Again, this is important and has played a part in the recovery of the construction sector.  While we may have expressed strong concerns in the past, I would like to think that the CIF and NAMA have since developed a more co-operative approach.  As we have seen the progress being made by NAMA, the industry has come to realise that they are part of the solution.  We respect what they are doing and a signal of that respect, I think, has been the invitation we have expended to senior members, both chairman and chief executive, to speak at our CIF annual conference for the last three years.  In conclusion, Chairman, I'd like to thank the committee for the opportunity to talk about the various issues surrounding the economic downturn and the construction industry and I would hope in the course of our discussion that we're able to bring some greater understanding to the committee's deliberations.  And I look forward-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431471600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Parlon, and thank you, Mr. Kelleher.

The period around when NAMA was being introduced, bank lending had stopped entirely, house building had practically stopped, there was nobody getting a mortgage or nobody ... the sentiment had turned totally in the opposite direction; nobody wanted to buy a house or know about property.  So that was an extremely nervous time for the industry and, as I said earlier in my opening remarks, you know, the big issue was companies going out of business, people being laid off and people emigrating all over the world to try and find jobs in construction after they'd learn very good skills here.  So, it was a very, very nervous time and we didn't know ... and, like I said earlier, the issue was and probably still would be debated by a lot of experts that would be more expert than me about, you know, was NAMA's intervention and all their different actions, did it, you know ... when they started there was a big concern that there was going to be, you know, major sell-offs.<\/p><p>And clearly if, in a weak market, you start selling off a massive lot of other stuff, it weakens the market further and the market will be in freefall.

The Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV, was established in 1971 as a representative professional body for qualified, licensed auctioneers, valuers and estate agents.  IPAV is the only Irish representative body solely catering for the professional and educational requirements and needs of auctioneers and valuers and, in 2013, represented almost 800 members nationwide.  IPAV has three categories of membership for practising auctioneers and valuers in Ireland which enables it to cater for the professional ... property professional, the certified valuer, the recognised valuer, REV, and this is through its association with TEGoVA, the European Group of Valuers Associations, using the blue book and the European valuation standards.<br\/><br\/>The institute is governed by a national council of 20 members from throughout the country.  The institute is further supported by an executive council which consists of IPAV president, senior vice president, junior vice president and CEO.  I am the chief executive officer of IPAV, appointed in May 2013, and I'm responsible for the day-to-day running of the institute.<br\/><br\/>A summary of IPAV's main objectives are: it was originally set up to provide a professional, representative organisation for auctioneers, valuers and estate agents to protect, advance and promote professional standards among its member; to promote professional competence among its members; to protect the interests of members, as between themselves and between non-members and general public; to provide a system of professional education; to ensure education plays a continuous and significant part in its members' professional development; to apply, petition or promote in the Republic of Ireland any Act of the Oireachtas, EU directive or other legal measures in order with a view to attainment of the above objectives; and to establish a disciplinary committee, consisting of five internal and two external professionals.<br\/><br\/>IPAV has submitted to the committee IPAV's memorandum and articles of association, as amended in 2013, which details the structure and process of IPAV.  Further to this, all documents supplied by IPAV to the committee and detailed in the metadata sheets is, to the best of my knowledge, true and correct.  To the best of my knowledge, the majority of documents supplied to the committee are in the public domain.  However, some documents, such as IPAV practice handbook, the blue book valuation templates and the blue book terms of engagements are specifically for IPAV members and are available to IPAV members in the members area only of <i>ipav.ie<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Chairman, in relation to the specific references, B4b and R5d, I am asked to comment upon, I wish to make the following points but, before so, I wish to emphasis that I can only comment in relation to IPAV and my role as CEO.<br\/><br\/>Self-regulation through IPAV: all IPAV valuers are subject to self-regulation through IPAV.  Unlike auctioneering and estate agency, which is governed by the Property Services Regulatory Authority, there are no national valuation standards for valuers in Ireland.  However, IPAV undertook the role as self-regulator for its own members.  While the valuer must possess the necessary qualifications, experience, ability, knowledge and training, he or she must always be objective and professional in his or her view and in appraisals and assessment of value.  In many cases, it will be necessary for the valuer and, where appropriate, any valuation company, to show that he or she is independent of any party interest in the outcome of the valuation.  Any such connection, or potential conflict of interest, or threat to the valuer's independence and objectivity, should be disclosed in writing to the client and recorded in the valuation report and the terms of conditions.<br\/><br\/>Conflicts of interest: it is important to note a quote from the Central Bank of Ireland, CBI, paper Valuation Processes in the Banking Crisis - Lessons Learned - Guiding the Future in the final paper of 18 December 2012, a copy of which has been supplied by IPAV to the committee.  And they say:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWhere a conflict of interest exists, the valuation is not independent and accordingly it is much more likely that the valuation provided is neither robust nor reliable.  All valuations include judgements, but where a conflict of interest exists, it is more likely that such judgements are biased and not in favour of the lender. <\/blockquote> <p>The area of conflict of interest is also addressed under IPAV's code of conduct and TEGoVA's Corporate Governance and in the blue book itself.  Again, copies of these documents have been supplied by IPAV to the committee.<br\/><br\/>Article 4, paragraph 76 of EU Regulation No. 575\/2013, on 26 June 2013, defines market value and market value is defined as, &quot;The estimated amount for which the property should exchange at the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's length transaction after proper marketing, wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.&quot;  Market value is internationally recognised as the assessment of the value of the property at a given moment in time.  It estimates the price that could be obtained for a property at the valuation date, notwithstanding that date could alter over time and sometimes very rapidly.  The definition of market value should be recorded in both the terms of engagement and the valuation report the valuers produce.<br\/><br\/>Valuation in general: the source of valuation and how properties are valued has been very topical in Ireland for many years.  Basically the valuation process is broken into two segments: the methodology used to arrive at the valuation figure, there are five standard methods of valuation, namely, comparative, contractors, investment, profit and residual; and the standards used in writing the report.  The valuation must be presented in a clear, written format to a professional standard, transparent as to the instruction, purpose, biases, method, conclusion and prospective use of the valuation.  The valuation, as determined by the valuer, must be clearly and effectively conveyed to the client.  The form and detail of the valuation report is a matter for the valuer's discretion, but must meet the specific instructions from the client to the valuer.  A valuation report must adequately report all matters contained within the terms of engagement.<br\/><br\/>In line with the European valuation standards, EVS, a market valuation should report the following: the instructions for the assignment; the valuer's qualifications; the basis and purpose of the valuation; the valuation date; a description of the property, including a note as to the basis on which the area has been measured; a summary of the legal context - tenure, development control, etc.; a commentary on the marketability for the property; a description of the valuation method and analysis; any assumptions that have been made; any limits on the report; and the valuation standards supplied.<br\/><br\/>I am of the understanding that banks and financial institutions have generally organised and managed their own valuation panels, with some exceptions, where valuation panels are outsourced.  IPAV valuers, in the past and to date, must apply to the relevant financial institutions to be accepted onto the panel.  Central to acceptance onto a valuation panel is the holding of an appropriate level of professional indemnity insurance.<br\/><br\/>The valuation figure derived becomes the critical part of the valuation, as it helps banks and other financial institutions to decide the worthiness of the risk it's going to lend on.  The valuation figure will only be reached by experienced, professional valuers, with years of experience in valuing property with their own competency.  The standards, while important, are designed to give financial institutions an explanation of, and insight into, the process, factors and judgments applied to help arrive at the final valuation figure, though not a methodology.<br\/><br\/>Again, I am of the understanding that financial institution valuation panels have operated, and continue to do so, on the basis of getting a spread of valuers throughout the country with the necessary competencies and expertise required by the financial institutions to complete the particular financial institution's own valuation templates.<\/p><p>IPAV, as a professional representative body for valuers, has provided guidelines for practising valuers and regular courses and seminars on the subject.  However, the actual compilation of the valuation report is a matter for the individual valuer.  The completion of the financial instruction's template is a matter between the financial institution and the valuers completing it.  <br\/><br\/>Again, I refer to the Central Bank report of the Valuation Process in the Banking Crisis - Lessons Learned - Guiding The Future, final paper of December 2012.  I would like to quote from it:<\/p><blockquote>\tCredit institutions should have a properly approved panel of valuers using appropriate selection criteria consistent with the loan portfolio risk.  An institution should have [an] on-going assessment of performance to enable a valuer remain on the panel.  This assessment should include a review of [the] valuers performance and professional indemnity insurance...<br \/><br \/>Credit institutions should ensure that no one firm of valuers has the bulk of their valuation business.  Consideration should be given to having no one valuer doing more than, say, 33% of all valuation reports.<br \/><br \/>Credit institutions should report any concerns in relation to non-ethical behaviour, including instances of unrealistic valuations, to the appropriate regulatory body.  In such circumstances, CBI recommend that credit institutions remove such valuers from the panel, which effectively bans them from working with the credit institution...<br \/><br \/>The valuers duty of care is to the credit institution and this should be emphasised by credit institutions in their written instructions to valuers...<br \/><br \/>Instructions to valuers for property valuations on collateral security should come from the credit institution in accordance with its clearly defined terms of engagement.  Fees should only be discharged by the credit institution.  It is for the credit institution to decide as to how it will allocate such costs.<br \/><br \/>Valuation reports should always be addressed to the credit institution that is advancing the [loan]. <\/blockquote><p>And I just want to talk for a minute on European valuation standards, as that's what IPAV use.  In the absence of national valuation standards, and following the economic crisis, as part of its ongoing review to increase the professional standards of its members, IPAV carefully studied the valuation process and standards available in Europe, and its choice was to either adopt the English or European valuation standard.  After detailed analysis and consideration, IPAV concluded that the European valuation standards, EVS, of the blue book were the most appropriate for IPAV's needs.  IPAV believed that with the UK threatening to leave the EU and Ireland committed to Europe, it was both prudent and progressive for IPAV valuers to accept and adopt the EVS.<br\/><br\/>IPAV was awarded membership of the European Group of Valuers Associations, TEGoVA, in 2012 and also appointed as their administrator in Ireland.  From this, IPAV introduced its members to the recognised European valuation, REV, scheme.  This scheme is administered across Europe by TEGoVA, which in 1996 created the blue book.  This book is continually updated and is now in its seventh edition.  There are approximately 2,200 REVs throughout Europe and by 31 December 2013, and 60 of those were in Ireland.  The EVS of the blue book are recognised as reliable International standards by the Central Bank of Ireland, the European Central Bank, and the European Parliament.  <br\/><br\/>To achieve REV status, IPAV educates its qualified valuers through its specially tailored courses, held in the Institute of Technology in Tallaght.  This ensures that IPAV members who complete this course meet with the expected minimum educational standards, MER, of TEGoVA, a copy of which<i><\/i>has been supplied to the committee.  IPAV&rsquo;s qualified valuers are those who are professionally qualified, experienced valuers, with a minimum of ten years practical experience, and who have at their fingertips vast knowledge, comparable instructions, and details of sales in their own area.  Since the REV qualification was first introduced in Ireland in 2013, all IPAV REV valuers must agree and sign up to a contract that demonstrates their commitment to IPAV and also confirms the level of self-regulation it imposes.  Compliance and standards are the cornerstone of the EVS valuation reports, and IPAV compliance officers monitors and examines valuers&rsquo; written valuation reports on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis.  IPAV, as the administrator of the REV scheme in Ireland, is subject itself to five years reviews.<br\/><br\/>I will now move on to R5d.  R5d - appropriateness of relationship between Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector, and the property sector.  Again, Chairman, I wish to begin by starting ... I can only comment on the role of IPAV and its members' relationship with the Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector, and the property industry generally.  I will summarise briefly as follows.<br\/><br\/>The Government: IPAV has always engaged with members of Government in regard to lobbying on various items of legislation and issues of interest as they arise.  For example, IPAV makes an annual pre-budget submission to the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and, in recent years, has also made presentations to the Joint Oireachtas Committees on Finance and the Public Service, and Department of Agriculture.  IPAV has engaged, as necessary, with the Minister, Minister of State, and senior officials in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in relation to housing and related matters.  Ministers and Ministers of State have attended and addressed IPAV&rsquo;s annual conferences and regional seminars over the years.  IPAV has always kept lines of communication open with Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad, both Government and Opposition, in briefing them on relevant issues as they arise both individually and in committee.  IPAV makes regular submissions to joint Oireachtas committees where useful exchanges of views regularly take place.  IPAV has nominating rights to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and members are from time to time elected to either House.<br\/><br\/>The property industry itself: IPAV has engaged with parallel professions and professional bodies in the property business and industry.  IPAV representatives have regularly attended conferences organised by related professionals and institutions and have made, and continue to make, a determined effort to engage with all stakeholders in the industry. Representatives of such professional bodies are invited to attend IPAV&rsquo;s annual conference. <br\/><br\/>And the banking sector: IPAV has engaged as much as possible with the Central Bank of Ireland and individual financial institutions.  IPAV lobbied for the inclusion of the blue book as one of the preferred standards in the CBI final report issued in December 2012.<br\/><br\/>And my conclusion, Mr. Chairman: Overall, it is IPAV&rsquo;s view that the relationship between the four sectors, Government, Oireachtas, banks and property stakeholders, should be one of being independent of each other, yet communicating through the correct and transparent channels for the betterment of all, and the common good of Irish society.  While the priorities of the sectors often differ, as is to be expected, IPAV believes there should be an ongoing dialogue between the stakeholders.  However, to date it has tended to be sporadic rather than consistent.  In this regard, IPAV has long advocated the need for establishment of a property council, which would be representative of all stakeholders and which would help advise Government in a holistic way on all issues in relation to property.  While it would advise participants, it would be expected to respect the democratic imperative that Government governs and have the final say on any policy initiative.  IPAV believes such a body, which would have a purely advisory role, would have the potential to play an enormous part in helping build a sustainable property market, bringing about stability and avoiding future troughs and peaks, as have occurred in the recent past.  Volatility may serve isolated interests.  It does not serve consumers, it does not serve the auctioneering profession and it does not serve the common good.  <br\/><br\/>Thank you for all for listening to my long statement, and I'll take some questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#Y00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Davitt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431471600,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Davitt.

It is BelWertV is what they call it, and that might not be the greatest German explanation of it, but we call it BelWert five.  It was brought into law in Germany in 2006, which would use mortgage lending value on a property which would smooth the value over a particular term of the mortgage.  So it could be over 20 years or it could be over 15 years, or whatever it is over.  So that mortgage lending value and a definition of mortgage lending value was brought into the blue book in 2016.

And, finally, in answer to one of my previous questions, I asked about the issue of undue influence possibly being brought to bear on valuers, and you said that sometimes maybe valuers might take calls, \"Did you take such-and-such into account?\"  Is there any obligation on valuers that such calls be recorded or that they would be referenced in the final valuation report and, if not, do you think that the valuation report would benefit from such a record being kept?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#HH03700","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431471600,"counter":845,"content":"<p>Okay.  Let's take the first question first.  So the ... how IPAV is funded is, we have a membership base obviously of approximately 1,000 members right now, we'd 800 in 2013.  And those members pay a particular amount of money to the institute every year, which, if you're a member or a member firm, you'd pay &euro;400 plus VAT or, if you are an employee, you would pay &euro;200 plus VAT.  Now we're not a conglomerate, we are a very small organisation.  We have three employees and myself, which is four employees.  So our ...  sort of turnover would be about &euro;400,000 to &euro;500,000 and that would ... our expenses ... last year actually we lost &euro;50,000.  But that's unfortunately the way it is.  We would do education and we would do CPD as well and we would get a certain amount of fees in for CPD and for education, which would go towards our running costs.<\/p><p>So, that's basically where we ... we don't get grants from anybody, or we don't get anything else from anybody else, like, that's where we're funded.  The second one was, sorry-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#HH03800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Davitt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431471600,"counter":847,"content":"<p>The sanctions that are available, if a complaint is upheld.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#JJ00200","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431471600,"counter":848,"content":"<p>Yes.  The sanctions that are available are you can put somebody out of the institute, you can put them out for a short time, or you can fine them.  Now, we didn't have the fine at the particular time.  We've only changed our articles of memorandum and articles in 2013, where we put the fining into it, because we found that with members, you either had to put them out of the institute altogether, or suspend them for a short term which could be up to two years, and that's really all we had.  So we've changed that round about to make sure that we have other punishments as well that we could do, if you want to take it like that, and financial ... from a financial point of view.<\/p> <p>  The third question is the notes ... valuers would have notes, valuer's notes on every valuation.  So when you go to look at a site you would have a valuation and you would have your valuer's notes, so you would write your valuer's notes down in your valuation.  Now, that could take in the form of e-mails, it could take in the form of site visits, it could take in the form of telephone conversations, so you would, again, expect every valuer to have a site notes and to have them up-to-date, but I can tell you one ... one sort of a small fact which ... from ... I just ... I checked, in the past couple of days, about our ... we would run, with an insurance broker, a professional indemnity scheme for members to make sure that they're covered, and in the past four years, from 2010, '11, '12, and '13 ... In 2010, we've had two claims on our professional indemnity policies.  We've had one in 2011, one in 2012, and one in 2013.  Now, these policies are written by an insurance company, obviously.  They're written by a broker first who would pass them onto an insurance company, so that if there are incorrectness with valuations, that's the place they should go.  So, like-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#JJ00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Davitt"},{"type":"speech","time":1431471600,"counter":849,"content":"<p>Do you have figures for the previous years?

Firstly, I'd like to thank the members of the committee for your invitation today.  My name is Pat Cullen, I'm a partner in Deloitte, specialising in taxation, with over 30 years' experience and, for a four-year term from mid-2007 to mid-2011, I served as managing partner of Deloitte.  As managing partner, I was responsible to the partners and the firm's executive committee for the management and operation of all aspects of the firm's affairs.  In my role as managing partner, I oversaw the management of the firm, including the provision of professional services to our clients, the skills and resources of our people and the financial management of the practice.<\/p> <p>  In my written statement - provided to the committee of inquiry some weeks ago - I provided the inquiry with a summary of salient aspects of our legal framework and governance structures, together with key features of our audit quality processes, which are of such fundamental importance to all of the work we carry out as auditors to a wide range of clients.  In the interests of brevity, I'm not going to read my written statement.  Instead, I'm going to refer to some areas that I consider may be of particular interest.  Audit quality is a key area of public and stakeholder interest and delivering the highest standards of services and advice to our clients is our continuing and overarching objective.  An important part of my responsibility as managing partner was to ensure that we had the appropriate processes in place to carry out our responsibilities in this regard.  At an overall level, this helps to ensure that our professional services and our business conduct were in the public interest.  Our audit approach is centred on providing clients with the most skilled audit partner and team appropriate to the needs and complexity of their case.  Our quality governance processes require engagement partners to be fully responsible for the services they provide and for understanding our clients' business.  Their involvement in the audit process is required from the very outset of any engagement, with partner-led audit planning key to our audit approach.<\/p> <p>  Our audit practice is structured into specialist industry groups, led by partners with a great depth of experience and expertise in that industry.  Our financial services group, which includes banking, is one such group.  These groups collaborate in order to share their understanding of market developments, risk assessments and emerging trends and this is of particular value during times of market turbulence and change.  Audit partners are also supported by our professional practice directors and by the audit risk and reputation leader.  The professional practice directors are responsible for technical, accounting and auditing support and their approach is responsive and consultative.  Deloitte member firms are also part of a network of similar industry groups from around the world.  These groups include experts with day-to-day, first-hand experience of the application of accounting standards across different legal and regulatory environments and include designated experts who are available to advise audit partners on engagements in dealing with complex or contentious accounting or auditing issues.  The availability of these resources ensure that there is specialist support available if required to deal with difficult issues as they arise and to support our audit teams.<\/p> <p>  A review of our audit practice is carried out annually and this is overseen by Deloitte globally.  The practice review determines whether we have complied, in all material respects, with Deloitte policies and procedures, applicable professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  Our audit practice is also subject to external review by the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board, the independent regulatory board of Chartered Accountants Ireland.  The results of our practice reviews are considered by our executive management committee and action is taken, as and where appropriate, to implement measures to address the recommendations made.  It is a key element in our continuous drive to improve and enhance audit quality.<\/p> <p>  As I explained in my written statement, all partners who act as audit engagement partners for statutory audits have been granted responsible individual status by the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board and are registered statutory auditors.  Personally, I am not, and I never have been, a registered statutory auditor.  My professional expertise lies primarily in the area of taxation.  Therefore, I'm joined here today by Mr. Gerry Fitzpatrick, who is a registered auditor and a specialist in the banking sector.  Mr. Fitzpatrick kindly advised me on the responses in my written statement to the lines of an inquiry in your direction of 2 April.  Today, Mr. Fitzpatrick will address some of the issues in your lines of an inquiry in the context of his role as lead audit partner on the audit of Ulster Bank Ireland Limited, UBIL, from 2004 to 2008.  Before I hand you over to Mr. Fitzpatrick, I would like firstly to make it clear what I understand to be the purpose of financial statements and our role and responsibilities as auditors.<\/p> <p>  International financial reporting standards, or IFRS, which is a framework used by the directors of UBIL to prepare the bank's financial statements, describe the purpose of financial statements as being, \"A structured representation of the financial position and financial performance of an entity\", the objective being to provide information about the financial position, financial performance and cash flows that's useful to a wide range of users in making decisions and presenting the results of management's stewardship of the entity's resources.  The whole essence of IFRS is to provide for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of specific aspects of financial reporting in a way that leads to a true and fair view being shown of the financial position and profit or loss of the entity.  IFRS states that, in virtually all circumstances, an entity achieves a true and fair view by compliance with IFRS.  Objective, professional judgment must be applied by the directors to ensure that financial statements give a true and fair view.  Under the Irish Companies Acts, every company of the size of UBIL must appoint a statutory auditor and that auditor must make a report to the members on the financial statements examined by them, with the primary purpose being to state whether, in their opinion, the company's balance sheet and profit and loss account have been properly prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts and give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at the end of its financial year and of the company's profit or loss for the financial year.<\/p><p>Over the years there has been much done to provide direction and guidance to auditors in carrying out the audits of specialised entities.  This includes practice note 19, the audit of banks in the Republic of Ireland.  While its main purpose is to provide guidance on the application of auditing standards to the audit of banks, it also comments on the objectives of the Financial Regulator and the objectives of the auditor, emphasising that while they may have complementary concerns, there are fundamental differences in their objectives.  The Financial Regulator is primarily concerned with maintaining the stability of the banking system and fostering the safety and soundness of individual banks in order to protect the interests of depositors.  The auditor's primary responsibility is to report his opinion as to whether the financial statements of the bank being audited present a true and fair view.<\/p><p> It's clear that the banking crisis has had an enormous impact on a wide range of stakeholders.  It is absolutely regrettable that a number of major factors came together back in 2007-2008, including international market conditions, major banking failures like Lehman and a slowdown in the Irish property market, which conspired to create conditions of an economically catastrophic nature, which few, if any, could consider would lie within the range of expectations that one could normally predict. <\/p><p> Consequently accounting standards were faced with challenges which they found exceedingly difficult to keep pace with, as, for example, the concept underlying the incurred loss impairment model.  The occurrence of loss events was happening at a pace and on such a systemic basis that the quantum of impairment provisions could change from day to day, let alone from month to month.  And that was the difficult background against which audits were carried out in 2009.  Hindsight does have the benefit of 20:20 vision and in the cold light of day, some seven or eight years later, yes, there is scope for asking questions about, \"What if?\"  There is a broad need to learn from the crisis, and we support inclusion of the role of auditing in any reviews being carried out.  Across the globe and in Ireland, the auditing profession has reflected on their role and considered how financial reporting and auditing could be enhanced.  Deloitte has engaged and been a leader in such developments, some of which Mr. Fitzpatrick will comment on.<\/p><p> I'm now going to hand you over to Mr. Fitzpatrick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#OO00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Cullen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431471600,"counter":863,"content":"<p>Mr. Fitzpatrick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#PP00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431471600,"counter":864,"content":"<p>Thank you, Pat.  Good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity of addressing the committee.  My name is Gerry Fitzpatrick and I'm one of the Deloitte partners engaged with auditing the banking sector.  I've worked with Deloitte for over 30 years and have been an audit partner for 15 years, and I was, as stated, a partner on the auditing of Ulster Bank Ireland Limited, or UBIL, from 2004 to 2008.  I've provided a detailed written statement addressing our role as auditors of UBIL and I would propose to take that statement as read.  I will now make some introductory remarks.<\/p> <p>  As independent auditors to UBIL, our role was to report to the shareholder in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Acts.  Our work was carried out in accordance with international standards on auditing.  The UBIL financial statements were prepared by the directors in accordance with international financial reporting standards and under the requirements of companies legislation.  A true and fair view is normally achieved when the financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS standards.  Auditors do not set the accounting framework but rather, we provide an opinion on whether the financial statements prepared by the directors give a true and fair view.  An audit is a point-in-time examination of the reporting of financial performance and position, measured in accordance with standards and an audit is primarily an examination of historical data prepared by the directors and presented in their annual report.  Shareholders and capital markets value the audit process, as the audit underpins the trust and obligation of stewardship between those who manage a company and those who own it, and with a range of other users.  To demonstrate the stewardship, the financial statements are prepared under IFRS to provide extensive analysis, both of accounting policies adopted by the directors and in preparing the financial statements' extensive financial data.  Separate to the financial statements, the bank submits various capital and liquidity returns to the regulator.  Those returns are prepared under separate rules or sent directly to the regulator, and are not subject to audit.  <\/p> <p>  Our audit process is focused on the financial statements.  The process commences mid-year, when a plan is presented to an audit committee.  The plan sets out our work on key audit areas, on key issues, on major judgments, together with a summary of our proposed approach.  That approach is a risk-based one, which includes tests of controls, reviewing the work of internal audit, evaluating control and remediation within the organisation, IT audit testing and tests of financial data.  And that testing work commences in quarter four of the year, looking then at the transactions to the end of September.  And following the conclusion of the year, we finalise our testing work and examine the financial statements prepared.  The audit process is detailed and uses sample testing of the tens of millions of transactions and balances that the bank has recorded on its financial systems.  Sample items are agreed to supporting records and to external confirmations.  In the case of areas of judgment, we examine the evidence provided by management and challenge the nature and source of that data.  We seek evidence of contradictory data available either internally or externally.  Our work on UBIL was linked closely to the work of Deloitte RBS Group audit team and we reported the results of our work to them also.  And throughout our audit, we met regularly with management and the audit committee of the board.  When the directors have approved the financial statements and our audit is complete, we issue our report on those financial statements and the report for 2008 year issued ... was issued in February 2009.  It was an unmodified, true and fair view opinion.  And in reaching our opinion, we consider the results of our audit work, we assess the accounting policies and, where appropriate ... and consider where they were appropriate.  We consider the nature and risks of and uncertainties in how they were disclosed and then adequate disclosure to be made on key items, such as loan impairment and going concern.  <\/p> <p>  In addition to our statutory audit opinion, which is included in the annual report, we provided a detailed audit summary report to the audit committee of Ulster Bank Group, which included a summary of our work on UBIL.  A copy of that report and similar reports for other years were submitted to the joint committee in February.  In our own summary report, we provided the audit committee with details of our audit work, we showed analysis of risks in customer lending and data on corporation coverage by lending category.  We reported on the impairment process tested by us.  For 2008, as example, we refer to the absence of up-to-date collateral evaluations and the need for enhanced documentation of the impairment process.  We also reported that the going concern assessment relied on RBS Group, the group's management of capital and funding, and in addition to being presented to the audit committee, our summary reports are made available to the regulator.  <\/p> <p>  Our summary is presented to the audit committee as they approve the financial statements and those financial statements, as I've mentioned earlier, provide extensive analysis both of the accounting policies and the financial data.  In taking the 2000 financial statements, by way of example, across 80 pages, these included accounting policies and disclosures on a wide range of topics.<\/p> <p>  I would like to highlight some key aspects of those disclosures relating to loan quality and finding.  With regard to loan quality, the directors described in their financial statements six important elements.  Firstly, the accounting policy was set out detailing the incurred loss approach which is required by the accounting standard IAS 39.  Next, the directors highlighted key judgments and uncertainties which they explained could cause the actual losses to differ materially from those reported from their reported impairment provision.  A third item was the detailed analysis of the quality of all loans, and this was done by reference to the bank's internal credit grading system.  That data showed details of deterioration in the quality of the bank's loans in the year, showing that the gross value of loans in the lower quality categories had increased from &euro;6.3 billion at the end of 2007 to &euro;14 billion during 2008.  Other aspects, including overdue payments, were also shown.  A fifth item was the analysis of lending exposure by industry and sector, which provided insight into the lending strategy, showing, for example, that of the total exposures that property and related exposures included, construction, 6%; home mortgages, 19%; and property, 22%.  And lastly the impairment for the year ... charged for the year was disclosed.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the funding model of the bank, the financial statements disclosed, amongst other things, three important aspects.  Firstly, that 46% of the funding was provided by RBS Group entities.  Next, that 75% of the financial liabilities fell due within three months of the balance sheet date.  And lastly, the directors explained that, in their judgment, it was appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the bank on a going concern basis, and that the bank had adequate resources to continue its business for the foreseeable future.  The directors disclosed that they had concluded this assessment having considered the financial position of the bank, and referenced the ongoing support of RBS Group by way of capital funding and liquidity facilities.  Similar disclosures on loan impairment and going concern were provided with financial statements for other years.  <\/p> <p>  The analysis presented by the directors within the financial statements shows the transparency of disclosure made available to both the shareholder and to the regulator.  Our role was to ensure the measurement and disclosure was in accordance with a true and fair view.  Our role, as Mr. Cullen has pointed out, is fundamentally different to the role of the Financial Regulator, who is primarily concerned with maintaining the stability of the banking system.  And whilst audited financial statements contribute to the regulatory process, the determination of capital, the undertaking of tests for future stress, and the setting of regulatory buffers are functions undertaken by the regulator.  That process is not under statute part of the scope of the audit, of the external audit.  In providing our opinions on the financial statements, I believe we discharged our responsibility professionally and with due care and diligence.<\/p><p>Finally, I would echo Mr. Cullen's comments and recognise the financial crisis has had a normal impact ... enormous impact on a wide range of stakeholders and our profession has recognised the need to learn from the crisis and has reflected on how financial reporting and auditing could be enhanced.  We have engaged in a variety of reviews across the world and at Deloitte in Ireland, we support the enhancements explored in those reviews and I would highlight just five things: firstly, the development of a new expected loss accounting standard, IFRS 9, which subject to EU approval, is due to be implemented in 2018.  The development of with the regulator of an expanded auditor assurance protocol and this involves auditors reporting separately on aspects of governance processes at financial institutions and this expanded process has commenced from 2014.  Thirdly, recommended changes in auditor reporting to audit committees and shareholders are now in place.  Next, availability of new audit tools was proposed and that is now in place.  And, lastly, enhanced dialogue around the audit process with regulators and this has been a feature for the audited banks in Ireland since 2009.<\/p><p> Whilst these are not changes to the scope of the core audit, such initiatives can, through enhanced communication of the existing scope and the setting of a wider scope, help to create a broad level of awareness of banking models and their underlying economics and, in some way, mitigate some of the understandability and relevance issues of historic financial information.  Nonetheless, the preparation and audit of financial statements will continue to require significant judgment.  Finally, the financial statements contain valuable data, but, as a point in time measure, can only attempt to present measures based on that point in time judgment.  And the scope of an audit is an assessment of whether those financial statements present a through and fair view and, in that regard, has significant value.

In the previous pages, on page 28, for instance, there's a reference to Ulster Bank Group having significant euro surplus capital.  So, basically, the way it managed it ... it had a lot of capital.  It just was whether it was in the right entity.  So this transaction, which you say was designed to mitigate something, to my mind it was appropriate transaction.  An organisation that has a number of licensed entities will have capital in one and perhaps risk in another and is obviously ... must retain its capital ratios appropriately, and, therefore, the transfer of loans and the risk associated with loans, into another regulated entity, as long as that entity has sufficient capital, and in this case, Ulster Bank Limited, which is FSA regulated, which we were also the auditors to, I was fully aware that that transaction was taking place and was properly reflected in the books and records of Ulster Bank Limited.

In fact, that standard said that you didn't recognise those losses no matter how likely they were to be.  It was trying to measure and adopt a neutrality of measures so that you can compare organisation to organisation.

So yes if loans had been processed with a control weakness was that an isolated incident or was that wholesale and could that have an impact on the actual properly, proper recording of loans?  And then lastly if loans were given and the process in the mortgage centre wasn't identifying impairment because people were maybe not paying on loans and maybe the system didn't allow Ulster Bank to understand that, that would be a concern I would have.  So it wasn't because I could see they were rectifying those issues so they had arrears because maybe things hadn't been processed well but they were closing them down and I don't believe from my understanding and my recollection of the 2007 audit there was material loss associated with the Dublin mortgage centre.

Would you agree with that sentiment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#VV00500","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431471600,"counter":990,"content":"<p>Gosh, there is quite a lot of sentiment in that.  First of all, the accounting standards and the preparation of the numbers are by the directors, so the accounting standards may ... are backward looking, it is a measurement of a point in time.  IAS 39 meant that there was a particular constraint in looking at what was incurred at the time so it does represent, perhaps, a ... some limitation of what ... predicting expected loss might be.  So I guess the new standard will allow some greater forward looking, but it still has to be an expected loss, not an unexpected loss.  There is no standard that allows you predict the unexpected, and I think any view that there's a kind of forward future proofing or early warning system for things that might happen in the future, that won't be the case under even the expected loss standard, because you still have to have data and say, \"What will this impairment likely turn out to be?\"  And you have to have an assumption, which is what the collateral value might be when you realise it in an impaired loan and, therefore, you have to have a view on the current state of the market, not the future state of the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051300002#VV00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1431471600,"counter":991,"content":"<p>And in this morning's testimony and other testimonies we heard, that sort of transitional period between 2006 and 2008 where, in 2006, a lot of the people that have come before this inquiry have said that there was still an upbeat kind of forward looking, you know, positive view of things, that if things were to slow down, they wouldn't crash, that there'd be a soft landing and all the rest of it.  How would that impact upon IAS 39 in the basis that, by 2008, we could see, whatever was in the rear view mirror, the road ahead was completely different.

I think in the context of an organisation that's moving, having had acquired a business like First Active moving to grow its loan book, there would be a period where significant growth would be there.  My concern in that situation would be to understand is the funding available to allow them do that.

The setting of the capital plan that ... under ... that ...as to what a licensed bank, I don't ... you know that I suppose ... I don't license the organisation - the organisation that licenses it decides what level of capital in a growth environment like that could be, and decides what scalers to put on its capital.  It can say \"There's a minimum capital level, but because you're growing so fast you need different capital levels.\"  And that's ... the regulator uses the financial information to make those decisions.

If the directors said to me they think it'll go down by 50%, they would have been potentially misrepresenting the information, the financials because they wouldn't know what it was.  It would be pure conjecture.  And the idea of the standard was an evidenced, verifiable evidence-based standard.  And we may believe there are flaws in that but a verifiable evidence-based standard is actually better than one that is purely based on conjecture.  If a group of directors are saying to me, \"We have looked at the valuations and actually yeah we think we'll hack off another 60%\" , that would be misrepresenting because it would be based on conjecture.  So it is a difficult thing I agree with you.  I think we're in agreement that the standard does require you to look at what would be realised and to net present value it but you have to use the available data in terms of what you believe valuations are standing at the moment.  Valuations can equally increase and decrease; it would be conjecture otherwise not to use the available data.

So from a starting point, the structure was good and the materials I saw going to board, although they had laws at times, that was in terms of some elements, they were always corrected and I always found that there was a good attitude towards control so if they had a process with something that was identified, there was an escalation process and it got addressed.  Maybe not always the speed that they might like, but that process seemed on the face of it, quite good.  There was obviously a number of legal entities.  UBIL, which is the Irish entity, First Active, and so the boards, they very much looked to an Ulster Bank Group.

And we benefit from that as being what we call, in our audit methodology, the tools and techniques people use are not just the ones I decide on, but people right around our firm, nearly 200,000 people globally, not all are doing banking work, but those who are in banking work are contributing to a model and a database of risks and controls, so I feel that group of people are informed.  It does fall on me, I'm the person who makes the decisions to make sure that those risks are correct and for me and my team to review the work of anybody who has less experience. And every piece of work will be reviewed by another person, including my own, and, therefore, I'm subject in that scepticism to an independent partner who is not directly involved in the audit process looking through my opinion, my key working papers, my audit summary document, and saying, \"Is there a risk, Gerry, that you're being ... that you have a bias here, or that you're subject to this confirmation bias, which is information that passes you is the one that you think is the most relevant at the time?\"  So, your initial point was, was there a perception?  There possibly is a perception.  I'd say there's superb, really bright people working for us, who have lots more skills in some areas than I have.

I will also take the opportunity to discuss the new back to work family dividend which will assist parents who are moving from welfare payments to work.  <\/p> <p>  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Catherine Kellaghan, principal officer with operational responsibility for the Department&rsquo;s Longford headquarters and the schemes operated from there, including family income supplement, and Mr. Michael Cunningham, assistant principal officer in the child and family income policy section.  I have responsibility for policy on both jobseekers and lone parents.  I understand the clerk to the committee has circulated copies of the presentation and my colleagues and I will be pleased to address questions committee members may have at the conclusion of the statement.<\/p> <p>  Family income supplement is a weekly tax-free payment for employees on low earnings with children.  The payment, effectively, preserves the incentive to take up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she was claiming other social welfare payments.  Family income supplement is an important policy instrument in reducing child poverty in working households, as well as improving incentives to work.  It is estimated that the Department will spend approximately &euro;349 million this year on family income supplement, an increase of more than &euro;50 million when compared to last year.<\/p> <p>  To qualify for payment of family income supplement, a person must be engaged as an employee in full-time paid employment which is expected to last for at least three months and working a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight, or 19 hours per week.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with him or her or is part of a family supported by him or her.  Furthermore, family income supplement is calculated on the basis of 60% of the difference between the income limit for the family size and the weekly family income of the persons raising the children.<\/p> <p>  An integral part of the family income supplement scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, that rate will continue to be payable for a period of 52 weeks, provided the person concerned remains in full-time employment.  The rate of payment may be increased following the addition of a child to the family, either through birth, fostering, adoption or guardianship, in the course of these 52 weeks.  On the other hand, the rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings or other family income.  A key advantage of this approach which is unique to the family income supplement scheme is that claimants can be certain they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.  This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides a real incentive for families to avail of employment opportunities and ensures a degree of income stability for recipients.<\/p> <p>  In line with this policy, current social welfare legislation generally precludes changing the family income supplement rate within the 52 week payment period.  However, in the light of changes to the one-parent family payment scheme, regulations were introduced in July 2013 as an exceptional measure to enable entitlement to family income supplement to be changed during the 52 week period such that former one-parent family payment recipients in receipt of family income supplement will have the supplement payment automatically increased to compensate them for 60% of the loss of their one-parent family payment.<\/p> <p>  There has been a steady growth in recent years both in the number of families supported by family income supplement and associated expenditure, with the numbers in receipt of the supplement rising from 26,000 families with 56,000 children in 2009 to 50,000 families with 112,000 children by the end of last year.  Increased awareness of family income supplement as a consequence of the Department&rsquo;s information strategy for the scheme and significant improvements in customer service and processing times for family income supplement customers have contributed to the increased numbers.  Some of the increase in the numbers in receipt of family income supplement is also due to transfers from the one-parent family payment arising from the gradual reduction in the age of the youngest child to seven years.<\/p><p>The final phase of the one-parent family payment scheme age change reforms will take place on 2 July this year.  The maximum age of the youngest child at which a lone parent's payment will cease will be reduced to seven years for almost all recipients.  It is expected that approximately 30,000 lone parents will move from the one-parent family payment on that date, of whom approximately 5,200 are already family income supplement recipients.  These individuals will see their family income supplement automatically increase from 2 July and letters were issued to them last month explaining their transition from the one-parent family payment.  This will ensure their family income supplement payment will increase to partially compensate them when they move from the one-parent family payment.<\/p><p> Lone parents who will be affected by the final phase of the reforms to the one-parent family payment scheme have been invited to attend information seminars in their local Intreo office.  To further encourage lone parents to take up employment or increase their hours of employment, departmental staff are actively promoting at these information seminars the family income supplement scheme as the best financial option available to them.  Lone parents who can increase the number of hours they can work to 19 per week will be significantly better off than when in receipt of the one-parent family payment only.  <\/p><p> To assist further, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has asked the Labour Market Council to specifically examine the issue of how employers nationwide can assist lone parents in increasing their hours of work to enable them to qualify for the family income supplement payment.  The employer engagement sub-committee of the Labour Market Council considered the issue on 1 May.  Officials of the Department sought employer support to increase the number of hours available to these clients to take them over the minimum 19 hour per week qualification threshold for family income supplement.  Members of the committee were supportive and undertook to raise awareness of the issue and encourage employers to increase the number of hours available to this client group to take them over the threshold.  It should also be noted that lone parents who will move from the one-parent family payment to family income supplement from 2 July will be entitled to receive the new back to work family dividend which was contained in the recent Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 which the President signed into law last week.  This payment allows lone parents and jobseekers to retain the child proportion of their social welfare payment when they move into employment.  They retain the full amount for the first year and half the amount in the second.  For each child, subject to a maximum of four children, this equates to an additional payment of &euro;1,550 in the first year and &euro;775 in the second. <\/p><p> As the dividend has no impact on an individual&rsquo;s entitlement to family income supplement, it offers an additional and significant incentive to lone parents to take up employment on top of their existing family income supplement payment.  Staff of the Department are actively promoting both the back to work family dividend and the family income supplement sceme, as, combined, they offer a substantial incentive to parents who make the transition to employment.

A huge part of that, but not all of it, is the way we structure the one-parent family payment and the negative effect that structure has on some families.

Someone who loses the one-parent family payment and goes onto a jobseeker's transitional payment will still suffer an element of loss of household income, even if family income supplement is available to him or her.  Perhaps the officials will argue that such a person could be incentivised after a while if he or she finds available work that suits his or her schedule.  That is not always possible, as Senator Craughwell said.  Have the officials assessed what that loss might be?  What is the variable on the 60% increase in family income supplement with the jobseeker's transitional payment?  On the other side, what is the loss on the one-parent family payment?<\/p><p> I will give another example.  I do not know whether this issue has been discussed at Department level.  This approach will simply not work if some employers are trying to bring their employees, such as those who are caught on zero-hour contracts, over the 19-hour limit.  Has the Department engaged with some of those employers that are noted for using zero-hour contracts?  One would expect they would have the flexibility to attract lone parents into the workplace.  That does not happen, however.  Some employees might have an issue with reaching the limits of 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight.  There is no consistency in that.  I think we need further engagement on that.<\/p><p> I will conclude by touching on what Deputy Ryan said.  I have been made aware from anecdotal sources that a large number of families do not access family income supplement because they are not aware of it.  I think there could be more proactive information-sharing between the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners.  Many of these people are not on the books of the Revenue Commissioners because their income limits are so low and are not on the books of the Department of Social Protection because they are at work.  If an information exchange were conducted, I expect it would reveal that thousands of families that do not claim family income supplement are not earning enough income to be taxed.  It would be easy to write to or otherwise contact those families to tell them they might be suitable applicants for family income supplement.  Has that ever been done?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015051300002#D00700","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431518400,"counter":1415,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Craughwell for using the word \"desert\".

I bow to the ability of Senator Moloney in dealing with this on the ground.  Mr. Egan said that the family income supplement payment \"effectively preserves the incentive to take up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if they were claiming other social welfare payments\".  Could he talk to me about what he means by \"marginally better off\"?  Is it not the kernel of the matter here that people are so badly paid in some work that social welfare payments run almost in parallel with their earnings?  I am only asking the question.  What exactly does Mr. Egan mean by \"marginally better off\"?  What are the boundaries of that?  I think that is the main problem here.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask a question that goes back to the point Deputy Harrington made about communication.  How many lone parents have attended seminars in local Intreo offices?  It is not just a question of how people's entitlements are communicated to them; it is also a question of how people pick up on and lock into that communication.

He or she will come out with a net income of more than &euro;600 a week, having started out with a salary of &euro;300, by the time it is topped up by the State to the tune of another &euro;300.

I think it is important for people to know how good a subsidy the family income supplement is.  My question arises from what some of the other members have said.  Having looked at this, I understand that some people who are currently on family income supplement will actually gain after they have lost their one-parent family payment.  Now it might not be a huge gain.  I will give an example because I want to see if I am right.

I ask members to get back to me if I leave any of their questions out.  My colleague, Ms Kellaghan, will respond to the questions that were asked about family income supplement.<\/p> <p>  I will begin by answering the Chairman's question about the reform of the one-parent family payment.  The change in income of each individual person who is working and is already in receipt of family income supplement will be based on family sizes and on the amount of earnings they will have.  In the case mentioned by the Chairman, it is possible that a person with two children who was receiving a one-parent family payment of &euro;100 will be better off.  It is very hard for us to determine the extent of that.  We know that most people who are in receipt of family income supplement and the one-parent family payment have fewer than two children.  The average number of children among lone parents is approximately 1.8.  That is what we are looking at.  We know there will be small income losses for some people.  Other people will have greater income losses.  The smaller the family size, the smaller their earnings.  It is a question of the way family income supplement compensates them for it.  It is hard to give Senator Moloney and Deputy Harrington a definitive answer in terms of how much people will lose.  Some people will gain.  We can categorically state that people who are working already, are not claiming family income supplement and are in receipt of the one-parent family payment will be better off if they can claim family income supplement when they lose their entitlement to the one-parent family payment.  It does not matter as long as they work the 19 hours.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman referred to last year.  This year is different.  The situation is actually better this year compared to last year, when we did not have the back to work family dividend.  In the case the Chairman highlighted, we did not have the &euro;30 for each of the two children.  We did not have that extra &euro;60 to give to the lone parent who made the transition from the one-parent family payment.  This July, more people will be financially better off than they would have been if they had made the transition last year.  There will still be income losses.<\/p> <p>  I would like to pick up on Senator Craughwell's comment about lone parents needing \"to desert their children\".<\/p><p>What I need to say in this context is that the original reform in the 2013 legislation was that, at age seven years, eligibility for one-parent family payment would stop and they would be subject to qualifying for another social welfare payment.  At the time, we expected most people to make the transition onto jobseeker's payment.  Committee members are aware of the key criteria for eligibility for jobseeker's allowance or jobseeker's benefit payments, which is that a person is available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  In that context, if the original reform had been implemented, lone parents would have been expected to be available for and genuinely seeking work with, in the particular case highlighted, children of seven or eight years at home.  We changed that and the Minister introduced the jobseeker's transition arrangement.  As Senator Moloney said, this exempts lone parents for a seven year period, until the youngest child turns 14 years, from the two criteria of the jobseeker's scheme.  People are not required to be available for, and genuinely seeking, work.  The reform is aimed at engaging with lone parents for the first time ever.  We do not have a record of engaging with lone parents and, since the inception of the one-parent family payment in the mid-90s, it was just income support.  We never offered them education, training or personalised support in any way other than basic income payment.  The information sessions are telling people to come in and talk to us and we will tell them the best option for them based on their individual circumstances.  The aim is not to force lone parents into employment but to provide them with the assistance over the seven-year period of getting them ready for employment.  This may involve identifying that they need an education or training course, community employment or, if they are already employment ready and want to work, helping them to make the bridge.  It is the first time we are doing it in the Department and it is a key change.<\/p><p> If a lone parent does not want to work and the youngest child is under 14 years, they will not be forced.  We will not require them but we will ask them to come in and engage with us so they can meet a case officer and get a personalised development plan so that we can help them prepare for the time when the child turns 14 years of age.  Then, they will be treated like any other jobseeker and the criteria of genuinely seeking and being available for work will apply.<\/p><p> Senator Moloney mentioned a point about the back to work family dividend.  The back to work family dividend is on top of the family income supplement and has no impact on the family income supplement.  It is an additional top-up incentive for a family in employment or making the transition into employment.  This is a key element of it and provides an additional buffer in the first two years of moving from welfare to employment.  Senator Moloney asked us to clarify whether anyone in receipt of the family income supplement will receive the back to work family dividend if, in the circumstances of reforms to the one-parent family payment, they are no longer entitled to the one-parent family payment.  If they claim the family income supplement or are in receipt of it, they will be entitled to apply and they will receive the back to work family dividend.<\/p><p> While legislation was passed and enacted last week, we have taken applications for the dividend from 5 January.  We received just short of 1,000 applications that we are ready to process.  We will process them over the coming weeks.  They may not all be eligible but we will have significant numbers in receipt of the back to work family dividend very quickly, which is positive.  Also, 5,200 lone parents will be affected by the reforms I mentioned if they are already in receipt of the family income supplement.  In the letters sent out last month, they were told that this is the back to work family dividend and that they would receive an application form to fill in.  At information sessions, we are actively promoting family income supplement.  Based on what happened over the past two July periods, we expect an increase in new claimants from lone parents for the family income supplement and all individuals will, if they make the transition from the one-parent family payment onto the family income supplement, receive the back to work family dividend.<\/p><p> Senator O'Donnell asked about what we mean by marginal.  Perhaps the term is wrong.  Some families, based on their size and levels of earnings, may be marginal but there are also cases where they can be substantially better off on the family income supplement.  It is difficult to give set figures.  In a recent television documentary involving the Chairman, an individual who was a lone parent was going to be better off by &euro;200 after working an extra four hours.  It is a combination of family size but there are cases where the gains are smaller.  It depends on family size and it would be more marginal in the case of a one child family.  They would not receive &euro;30 for each of the three children.  Family income supplement is designed to support low-income families and the thresholds are based on family size starting at &euro;506 up to &euro;1,298.  It is a broad range; there can be marginal differences but also significant ones.<\/p><p> The Senator asked how many lone parents are engaged in the information seminars.  We have asked lone parents to come out and engage with us.  Most of the sessions have concluded because we ran them since the end of January or February.  We have a high completion rate of application forms processed for the jobseeker's transition rate.  This is about 75% of what we deem the eligible cohort.  The Intreo offices have invited every lone parent by letter and if they do not attend these information sessions they are guaranteed to get a second letter.  If the Intreo office has capacity and if the person does not attend, the office will phone the person and make every effort, depending on resources, to encourage the lone parent to come in.  It is in the interests of the lone parents to come in to ensure there is another payment after 2 July.  We are in the process of following up on as many of those lone parents as we can but we already have a substantial number of them processed and ready to go.<\/p><p> The 5,200 family income supplement recipients are virtually all done and that will be seamless based on the past two years.  The difference will occur when they apply for the back to work family dividend and this is done through the Intreo office.  My colleague, Ms Catherine Kellaghan, will answer questions on the family income supplement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015051300002#E01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Egan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431518400,"counter":1427,"content":"<p>The first question concerned the increase in take-up.  We outlined the huge increase in take-up since 2012, some of whom were lone parents exiting the lone parent scheme.  There was a more general increase in take-up.  The specific question from Deputy Ryan was whether there are people eligible who are not taking up the payment.  We have no clear administrative data to identify specific people who we are sure are entitled to the family income supplement.  That hampers us in contacting them directly and saying they qualify for it.  The latest research commissioned by the Department was done in 2008 and it included questions on take-up.  There was a sample of 3,000 people and, among them, some were already in receipt of the family income supplement but a large cohort comprised 2,000 cases of the Department and we thought, based on the information, they would possibly qualify.<\/p><p>However, the outcome of the research was that when the Department explored the information it was decided that only about 23% of the people who in our data seemed they may qualify would actually qualify.  It may be that perhaps the previous research done by the ESRI which had identified quite high levels of potentially eligible families who were not applying might have been overstated.  It is difficult to prove either way but those are the indications.  <\/p><p> As Mr. Egan has pointed out, the Department has been actively promoting FIS, in particular, over the past two or three years, through its Intreo service, for all jobseekers and for lone parents.  A poster campaign was launched last year and this was confined to the mid-Leinster region and the north Dublin region.  As a result of that poster campaign, we have seen increases in applications from that region so the campaign has been effective.  As a result of the effectiveness of the campaign it has been rolled out throughout the country.  It is a poster and leaflet campaign on view in all the Department's offices and in the Citizens Information offices.  Anyone interested can pick up a leaflet which will give individuals a good idea of what they might be entitled to if they are working and have families.<\/p><p> In the Department's most recent intervention we have written to Mandate and Siptu and to the public service unions to provide them with details and leaflets about FIS and about who might qualify in order for them to make the information available to their members.  This has potentially given the Department access to 260,000 people who may be entitled to FIS.<\/p><p> At the moment the Department has approximately 50,000 families who are in receipt of FIS but since 2012 at any one time we have over 110,000 families in receipt of FIS.  We have reached many families.  Some families have been in receipt of FIS and have progressed within their employment to the stage where they are no longer reliant on FIS as their income increases or they are promoted or work extra hours.  We have covered a large number of families over the past three years.<\/p><p> Senator Moloney raised a question about the 52 weeks.  This period of time is part of the legislation governing FIS.  Except in the stated specific circumstances, FIS will not be reviewed in the 52-week period.  In certain circumstances it might seem harsh but the over-riding policy objective of the scheme is to provide stability for people.  In order to provide that stability, the 52-week period is there so that they can rely on that extra income and make plans based on that income for the next 52 week period.  The answer to the Senator's question is that there is no discretion in applying the rule as it is a statutory requirement for the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015051300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Kellaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431518400,"counter":1429,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kellaghan for that response.  On the flip side the advantage is that if a person's wages increase the FIS payment does not decrease.  I refer to the cohort of people who get caught every year; people such as lollipop ladies, school canteen staff and postal workers in some cases.  I know a postwoman who gives up work for the summer because her children are on holidays from school.  She has to surrender her FIS payment and apply to have it re-instated at the end of the holidays.<\/p> <p>  I put this point to the Minister of State in the course of a debate in the Seanad.  He said the Department would investigate.  The JobsPlus scheme pays employers to take on employees.  I suggested that a similar payment could be an incentive - not the same amount - for employers to provide flexible working hours for lone parents so that they could work around school hours and be available to care for their children, thereby avoiding the need for child care which is a significant issue for parents.  This suggestion might warrant a discussion by the committee at a later date. <\/p> <p>  I have concern for people who work as home helps.  They could have one hour a day for five days.

What lone parents on the transitional payment are allowed to do is that they can work as long as they want, as many days as they want in the week and they will get a payment provided they satisfy the means test.  This is done as an additional support.  If the child is young and is in primary school, in many cases the parent will not be able to work a full-time week and it is better to have some employment at that stage than no employment.  That is the reason the flexibility was introduced along with the transitional payment.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of what happens when the child turns 14 years, the parent becomes a jobseeker.  That is an old chestnut that the Department constantly faces.  The jobseeker scheme is very set in terms of the four-in-seven rule which means a person can only work three days in any seven consecutive days.  An hour a day is considered a full day of employment.  Most jobseekers actually work a full day of employment per day.  We will only support someone with a jobseeker's payment if he or she is working a maximum of three days a week.<\/p> <p>  Many people ask about switching that time into hours.  I can understand their position and in particular cases, such as the home help, I can understand that position entirely.  However, from the Department's perspective we have to be very much aware of the consequences of doing a reform of that nature because of the magnitude of that reform.  We believe it would involve a significant inflow into the jobseeker's schemes based on the number of people who are working part-time and are not currently claiming jobseeker's payment.  It would be substantially in excess of what we are paying already in casual payments.  There would be a significant cost to the Exchequer to do that.  There is no easy answer.  <\/p> <p>  Our jobseeker's schemes are set in law so we have to treat everyone equally.  Unfortunately, as described by Senator Moloney, if a home help is working one hour a day and is a jobseeker but not on the transitional payment if he or she is a lone parent, that person will not be eligible.  However, that person could be eligible for a supplementary welfare payment or a payment of that nature.<\/p> <p>  Senator Moloney also mentioned an incentive for employers to offer flexible hours in order to help the employment of lone parents.  We would need to think about the implications of that suggestion.  We are currently in discussion with the Labour Market Council to see if it will leverage support about trying to encourage employers to help lone parents and to provide those flexible hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015051300002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1431518400,"counter":1434,"content":"<p>Marks &amp;amp; Spencer is an employer which does so.

Will the Department employ qualified persons to meet those moving into a transition to provide proper career analysis and carve out a career pathway for them?<\/p> <p>  As the witnesses are probably aware, I left the further education sector to become a Senator relatively recently.  In my previous role, I was often greatly upset by the number of people with children who started further education courses in September before finding by late October, November or December that it was no longer possible to continue the course.  The reason was that their courses will have had a start time of 9 a.m. and while they may have had a special arrangement under which they did not have to be present until 10 a.m. to allow them to drop children at school or whatever, they suddenly found they had fallen behind in subjects.  The Department supported some excellent schemes in Finglas 15 or 20 years ago where the same programme ran three times per day to allow mothers or unemployed people to come together and agree to do either a morning, afternoon or evening session.  I do not blame the Department for this problem because legislators must engage in joined up thinking to bring education and welfare closer together and provide the options required.  <\/p> <p>  On the transition payment, if the purpose of the process is to upskill and train people, why is it not called a training allowance, which is a more user-friendly term for those who need education and training?<\/p> <p>  While I may have come across as a little abrasive in my earlier contribution, I should point out that departmental officials do a tremendous job in difficult circumstances dealing with difficult people who also face difficult circumstances.

The majority of those are former F&Aacute;S employment service officers and many of them would have already had a qualification from NUI Maynooth in a guidance field, so some have experience.  We significantly increased the number of case officers over the last two years by 300.  They all received additional training and the Department is in the process of continuously developing training programmes for our staff.  There is a particular focus on case officers in that regard.  They might not have the qualifications that their other colleagues have from NUI Maynooth, but they have access to training.<br\/><br\/>It is important to be up-front about it as well.  The focus of the Department is not guidance in terms of education.  Obviously, Senator Craughwell was connected with an ETB and the ETB adult education guidance officers are excellent in that respect.  We have a slightly different focus.  It is not education <i>per se<\/i>of a holistic nature, but education and training with the aim of trying to progress somebody into employment.  That is our focus.  We want to give them the supports so they can go off and become financially independent.  The transitional payment is giving them that period of time to help themselves if they are in a position to do so.<br\/><br\/>The flexibility of provision is obviously a long standing issue.  SOLAS and the ETBs already run a great deal of flexible provision.  I am aware that SOLAS, in particular, runs many online courses and part-time evening courses.  I am regularly in consultation with lone parent groups and they make the points that have been made here.  It is a difficult nut to crack.  Some of our former training centres, now ETBs, had a nine-to-five attitude to a large extent.  Part of that was for very good reasons.  It was trying to get the trainee ready for work and to get them disciplined, but that does not always suit lone parents.  It is an issue we will be discussing further into the future.  However, there is some online and part-time provision that might be suitable for many lone parents.  We also provide child care supports that are tied in with ETB provision, so if it was nine-to-five they would be able to have a child care place.  Again, however, that depends on whether a place is available and whether it matches if the child is of school going age or younger. <br\/><br\/>I will not disagree about the name of the jobseeker's transitional arrangement.  Training allowance is an interesting suggestion.  The name came from the Department, probably because it was so close.  We are bringing people from the one-parent family payment and putting them on a jobseeker's payment, but we want to make it not seem like the jobseeker's payment so there was not too much imagination given to it.  It is an interesting idea that we can think about.  It is a somewhat clunky creation, to be honest.<br\/><br\/>Senator Moloney asked about feedback from people who have already gone through the process.  In each of the last two months of July there has been an increase in new FIS recipients, which is very positive from our perspective.  It is what we are trying to achieve.  We have engaged with virtually all of those people through the case officer.  Unfortunately, we are in the process of developing a new active case management system that will not be up and running until later this year.  The way we have done it up to this point is not perfect for getting output information.  They have all been accessed and we have started to collate that.  I have data on it.  Approximately 2,000 people have gone through an engagement process and they are engaged, but the information we have at present is not as good as it will be in the future.  This new system will be up and running in time for the July cohort and we will start engaging with those parents from September.  By the end of the year we will engage with all of them.  That is the Department's plan.<br\/><br\/>The Chairman asked about the &euro;500 grant we provide.  It is not my area but I know it is called the technical employment support grant.  I do not think there is flexibility with it but I will check that with colleagues in the Department and refer back to the clerk with data and information on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015051300002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1431518400,"counter":1460,"content":"<p>That would be very helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015051300002#J00500","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1431518400,"counter":1461,"content":"<p>I have a final question.

First, may I express my thanks to the committee for allowing us to postpone our scheduled meeting with it last month as we were in the middle of the capital raise exercise.  We very much appreciate its understanding at that time.<\/p> <p>  In my opening remarks, I want to address a number of key areas, following which my colleagues and I will be happy to take any questions.  I will first update the committee on some transformational developments on the corporate front.  In the first instance, as committee members will have read, the European Commission completed its review of our restructuring plan and signed off on it in April.  This plan provides a clear roadmap for the group and while it reflects many of our own plans and ambitions for the coming years, it also sets out clear targets in areas such as the deleveraging of non-core assets which the group is now bound to deliver within a specified timeframe.  We believe the plan will support the re-emergence of Permanent TSB as a competitive, profitable and vibrant force focused on the Irish retail banking market and capable of delivering value for both its customers and shareholders.<\/p><p>Approval of this plan paved the way for the second key recent corporate development, namely, the very successful capital raise that we completed last month ahead of the ECB required date of 26 July next.  In that exercise, the group raised a total of &euro;525 million through two transactions.  We successfully sold just under 90 million new shares at a price of &euro;4.50 each to raise &euro;400 million and in a separate transaction, we raised &euro;125 million through the issuance of AT1 capital at a very competitive coupon of 8.6%.  At the same time, the Minister of Finance successfully sold just under 22 million shares raising some &euro;97 million for the taxpayer.  This was done to facilitate the re-entry of the group on to the main markets of the Irish and London Stock Exchanges.<\/p><p> As a result of the capital raise and the sale of shares by the Minister, we have substantially transformed our capital position and equity base, have purchased from the Minister the &euro;400 million of contingent convertible notes which formed part of the recapitalisation of the group by the Minister in 2011, have had the group's shares admitted to the main markets of both the Irish and the London Stock Exchanges, brought new international investors on board while preserving a very significant 75% stake in the group for the Minister, on behalf of the taxpayer, and reinforced our capital position, as requested by the ECB, following the rigorous stress tests undertaken on banks across Europe last autumn.<\/p><p> These are very significant developments in terms of the journey that Permanent TSB is undertaking as we try to rebuild our business and return as much money as possible to the Irish taxpayer and we are delighted that they have been so successful.  We can assure the committee that given that it was a business with zero equity value post-PCAR 2011, the taxpayer now has an asset of real intrinsic value.  I should point out that while the capital raise is now substantially completed, we are technically still in an offer period as smaller investors have a few more days to decide if they wish to buy shares on the same terms offered to larger investors last month.  As a result of this, and because we are also now subject to detailed legal and stock exchange-related rules, there may be some areas where we are limited in terms of what it is appropriate for us to say.  For example, while we will be happy to answer questions related to current facts and circumstances related to our group, which are all set out in our equity prospectus which is available on our website, speculation about future events and circumstances is generally inappropriate for us now.  That said, we will try to be as helpful as possible.<\/p><p> The second area I want to refer to is the issue of standard variable mortgage rates.  Clearly, this has become a very contentious issue in recent months.  I will take this opportunity to share the position of Permanent TSB for which the following facts are particularly relevant.  We must ensure all our variable rate mortgage products make financial sense on their own account.  Making financial sense means making a return for shareholders - my primary fiduciary duty &ndash; after accounting for various inputs, including the cost of funds, business, risk, regulation, tax and debt-equity capital, all of which remain elevated in Ireland.  We do not subsidise our mortgage rates by non-interest charges such as arrangement fees which are common in other markets.  We do not fund our mortgages from the ECB with its historic low rates of interest.  Around 15% of our funding now comes from the ECB - down from over 55% at the height of the crisis.  I wish to place on record that the constant refrain of \"low ECB rates\" is not a material fact in this debate.  When it comes to funding our mortgages, we are much more reliant on relatively expensive retail and corporate deposits paid to customers here in Ireland and on money raised on the international markets, all of which are much more expensive than ECB money.  We are impacted by the high volume of mortgage defaults we have in Ireland.  It is an unfortunate fact that people who pay their mortgages here have to pay a bit extra to make up for the historically high number of people who cannot or will not pay.<\/p><p> Having said all of this, I do not want to close the door on delivering more customer value through compelling propositions and competitive rates.  As I told shareholders at our recent AGM, our goal is to work through the various factors that contribute to the cost of our variable rates and seek to reduce those inputs bit by bit.  Some of that is down to us on our own while some of it is down to the country generally.  If we can do that, I believe we will be able to move to a situation where we can share some of the benefits with our customers.<\/p><p> The third area I want to refer to is arrears and our asset management unit, AMU.  Nothing is of more importance to us than to be able to work with our customers to ensure that they can work through the life of their mortgage without falling into arrears or for those who do fall into arrears, to be able to help them to come to arrangements which are fair to them and realistic for the bank and which avoid, wherever possible, the possibility of them losing their homes or the taxpayer losing a disproportionate level of capital.  I am very proud of our performance in this area.  Mr. Shane O'Sullivan and his team have done a great job of creating a unit which is best in class and which has helped thousands of customers tackle their problems and restructure their loans on an agreed basis.  We have proposed 28,500 sustainable solutions to customers in arrears.  We have reduced the number of home loan customers in arrears of over 90 days by over 8,000 - some 38% - over the past year or so and we are now making realistic offers to thousands of customers every month.  These and other figures are captured in some graphs we have presented to the committee and which we can discuss later.<\/p><p> That said, some people continue to hold out for a silver bullet that will resolve the arrears or negative equity problems for everyone in one go.  Unfortunately, it does not exist.  All the experience of similar challenges internationally tells us that these problems are overcome slowly and patiently and not by waving a magic wand about so we are taking the slow and patient approach and it is paying dividends for us and for our customers.  When talking about arrears, I believe there has been a disproportionate focus on insolvency and bankruptcy as a solution to this problem.  Our view is that both options may work for customers in certain positions but they are never going to be widely utilised solutions.  <\/p><p> Finally, I am happy to say that the improvement that we all see beginning to take hold in the wider economy is reflected in our own trading performance.  We are seeing good progress in deposit gathering, in growing our current account numbers and in mortgages and other lending.  Like other banks in Ireland, Permanent TSB has been through an extraordinarily difficult period.  There were long periods during the past number of years when many people understandably questioned whether the group would survive at all yet here we are today with real evidence that our recovery is real and our prospects are good.<\/p><p>That said, we continue to have significant challenges and I hope we remain humble and focused.  We still have to manage difficult day-to-day issues, including how to return to sustainable profitability while building long-term rewarding relationships with customers.  Additionally, we still have difficult legacy issues to deal with that require a lot of time and resources.  Overall, however,  we are in a good and an improving position.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for allowing these opening remarks.  My colleagues and I are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015051300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431522000,"counter":1482,"content":"<p>I propose that speakers will have approximately ten minutes each if that is okay.

The opening part of the contribution painted a relatively positive picture of his institution.  He spoke about the restructuring plan and the raising of capital, and he indicated that the institution now appears to be on a road towards a vibrant force focused on the Irish retail banking market, capable of delivering value for both customers and shareholders.  The presentation is peppered with phrases like \"fiduciary duty\" and \"responsibility\" to the shareholder.  Does Mr. Masding accept that his recovery is largely based on the backs of the 79,000 standard variable rate mortgage holders?  It is based on the fact that the institution is gouging 4.5% interest from these customers at a time when the rates that Permanent TSB is paying for the funds has been reduced.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Masding profiled where the institution is not getting its funds.  We were told in November 2014 that the cost of funds was approximately 1.74% and it is probably less now.  The delegation has somehow suggested that the costs of funds is high, disguising to an extent what that is.  Will Mr. Masding identify the cost of funds in that regard?  It is clear that those 79,000 mortgage holders do not believe they are getting any value from the product they have with Permanent TSB.  They would feel rightly frustrated, as taxpayers and shareholders in the company, that they are being disproportionately impacted in comparison with other taxpayers in the State.  I cannot understand how the institution can continue to present a position that effectively recapitalises the bank and puts it on a firm footing - leading to eventual selling and trading - when it is done on the backs of people who are being disproportionately affected at this time.  I cannot see how the institution can continue to justify charging 4.5%, effectively because it can, while suggesting that it is necessary to do this in order to discharge losses elsewhere.  They are unrelated.  If there are issues in other elements of the bank, other methodology should be found to deal with that.  It should not be done on the backs of those 79,000 mortgage holders.<\/p> <p>  The delegation spoke of the arrangement it has with the European Commission and that over time the bank will have to reduce or sell off some of the higher-risk loans.  I assume that will relate to tracker mortgages in default.  Will the witness identify the value of that business?  The deadline is 2018 for that sale and it is not clear how much of that tracker book is in default.  There was a gross value of approximately &euro;14.9 billion around the end of 2014.  How does the bank intend to deal with that default portion?  The Springboard Irish sub-prime mortgage book was sold to Mars Capital and is it intended to do something similar here?  In the past, there was talk of curing the issue rather than selling loans.  Is there a process to this end or will it ultimately come to a sale, as with Springboard?  If that ends up being the case, does the witness accept that it would effectively amount to outsourcing repossession rather than curing the issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015051300002#D00300","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431522000,"counter":1484,"content":"<p>I will take each of the comments in turn.  I apologise if I have missed anything, and if the Deputy reminds me, I will answer any other questions.  The return to viability of Permanent TSB is a combination of many different complex factors.  I suggest that they include but are not limited to arrears management work and, sadly, the cost restructuring we have had to do, including lay-offs and branch closures.  There was also some pension decisions that we have had to make.  To narrow it to a particular factor would be not quite right.  There is a multitude of different factors that have enabled us to create a restructuring plan that has been approved.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the standard variable rate, I can only repeat what I said in my opening comments.  The rate takes account of a number of costs that the bank has to recoup, and cost of funds is only one of those.  There is also cost of risk, cost to serve or operating cost and the cost of capital that we must meet.  I give the committee my assurance that we are working to reduce those costs, and as those costs decrease, the bank will aim to share the benefit with customers.  Unfortunately, we are not in a position to do this yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015051300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding"},{"type":"speech","time":1431522000,"counter":1485,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Masding accept that the principal fact of costs being higher or out of kilter arises from legacy issues rather than any future funding, risk or general costs?

I would be spinning a tale if I said we had closed all those legacy issues.  They are much reduced and we are getting much closer to an organisation that I can look Deputies in the eye and say is being normalised, if members allow me to use the term.  We will continue to keep our rates under review and we will do everything we can to achieve the cost savings.  I have a track record of bringing the standard variable rate from way out of kilter into the pack.  We will continue, day in and day out, to drive down the various costs that go into a mortgage pricing model.  We should then be in a position to share that with customers.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's third point is really a cross-subsidisation matter, if I can use my own banking language.  I can categorically assure the Deputy that I run a bank where each product must stand on its own feet.  I am running those pricing models on a regular basis, including the standard variable rate.  As the inputs change, we are getting closer to a position where I believe we can share the benefit.  I am not quite sure where I am going to go with this all afternoon.  Unfortunately, we are not in a position to do that yet.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's next comment referred to trackers.  We came to an agreement with the European Commission around the size of our balance sheet by the end of 2018.  The composition of that balance sheet must change over time and that will include some degree of deleveraging.  I am wary about making the balance sheet too small, as we will not have scale to cover the operating cost.<\/p><p>In the next four-year period, my goal, particularly through Mr. O'Sullivan's good efforts, is not to deleverage those through an asset sale, as the Deputy described it.  Our aspiration is to cure those trackers in default so that we can continue to have relationships with those customers over time.  As such, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on what that would look like in 2018 and on what we might do with them.  It is right that I place on record that our goal is to maintain relationships with customers, maintain scale and not to have to get into a position where, at the bottom of that waterfall, we end up with a rump of customers we have to sell to a third party.  I want to avoid that.

If he puts on his marketing hat - his customer service hat - and attempts to win new business, while he has 79,000 customers paying well above what the odds might be, it does not suggest he is focused on attracting new business in the way any other business would be.  He continues to create an exceptionally bad impression in the minds of that cohort of borrowers who, for one reason or another, are wedded to Permanent TSB.  I talk to them on a regular basis as, I am sure, Mr. Masding and some of his staff do.  I speak to those in my constituency and beyond and they feel absolutely let down by all concerned that they are expected to carry the can for the issues that have arisen in Mr. Masding's institution because they are in a position to pay.  It puts them and their families under extreme pressure on a monthly basis for the short-term - at least as far as the institution is concerned - righting of the business.  It is a long-term commitment for them and it is having a detrimental impact on the way they and their families are living their lives.  Mr. Masding can use the language of the banking world to explain away how or why he is doing what he is doing, but it sits very awkwardly on the shoulders of those people.

On new mortgages, we were the first bank to introduce risk-based pricing.  As such, we no longer, in the purest sense, have a standard variable rate for new mortgages.  Rather, we have something called a managed variable rate, whereby we try to reward the level of equity that our customer can put into a mortgage.  I wanted to place on the record that for new customers we have a managed variable rate.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the back book, I appreciate of course that it might not be clear why a customer who takes out a mortgage today might pay a different rate from someone who took out a loan in the past.  Banking is about pricing a new mortgage on the basis of the cost of adding the marginal cost of funds to the balance sheet.  For example, if I was to issue a mortgage today for &euro;250,000, I would price it off the money in the market that I could get today.  For customers who took out a mortgage in the past, the price was based on the appropriate funding mix to support that mortgage at that moment in time.  It is all a point-in-time decision.  To the extent that funding costs in the past were higher, which they were across the whole Irish banking sector, the cost of the loan to the customer will be higher than that available to a new customer today.  It is important to place that on record, given that Irish banks had to pay a significant market premium - Permanent TSB included - for their liabilities or funding for the last number of years, which premium is now being managed down.  As such, the Deputy will understand that lending to new customers might be cheaper than for existing ones.  That is the second thing I say.  The third is a \"however\".<\/p> <p>  I also would say, as an experienced banker, that I expect the situation to change.  As the funding environment returns to a more normalised level, the imbalance between historic and current costs should right itself.  That means the cost of funding historic mortgages and the marginal cost of new mortgages will get closer to each other.  As the market normalises, banks will have a greater ability to develop propositions that meet the needs of both existing and new customers.  Of course, I am acutely conscious - and the Deputy will not hear me counter anything he says in this regard - that SVR customers might seek to get a lower rate by switching to another lender whose lending criteria they can meet.  Of course, with my marketing hat on, this represents an opportunity for us to win business and, if we are not competitive, it is an opportunity for other lenders to win business from me.  What I am trying to do is strike a balance between earning a return for our shareholders and ensuring we remain competitive.  As such, the final thing I would say is the following.  The Deputy uses the word \"strategy,\" and I agree with him 100% that it is important that this organisation has a mortgage strategy that is understandable, clear, coherent and simple for customers.  That is my goal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015051300002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding"},{"type":"speech","time":1431522000,"counter":1491,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Masding and his colleagues and thank them for the presentation.  I thank them also for the progress they have made in terms of the bank's financial stability, which is important to the State.  I welcome the progress Permanent TSB has made with the Commission on its capital reserves.  That has been reflected in external credit agencies - I think it was Moody's - upgrading the bank's credit rating.  Mr. Masding might elaborate on the following.  The impact of improved credit ratings from the agencies surely manifests in terms of the bank's ability to go to the market and access funds.  I appreciate that a complex matrix of issues is at stake here.  Given that improved credit rating and, equally, given the fact that by its own admission the bank gets 15% of its funding from the ECB, which is five times what AIB receives, at 3%, should it not be in a position to pass on some reduction to its customers across the range of businesses, particularly in the context of the standard variable rate?  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Masding referred a moment ago to funding costs returning to a normalised situation, but we are at historically low rates for funding costs for any borrower, including the State and the banks on international markets.  Notwithstanding the losses Permanent TSB is suffering and its progress in dealing with those, a simplistic analysis suggests that there are a number of significant issues moving in the bank's favour.

I remind the committee that we were criticised regularly, and I suspect openly if I recall correctly, by the troika for the funding gap that this organisation had post-PCAR and for the level of life support that we were relying on from the European Central Bank.  To get that down over a couple of years from 55% to 15% suggests that my chief financial officer and treasurer did a great job.  That is the next bit of the funding mix. <\/p><p> If we then move to the next level of the balance sheet, which we can call retail and corporate deposits, the price we pay for retail and corporate deposits still remains elevated versus what one might expect.  That is something we will have to manage, and by \"we\" I mean the Irish banking community and not just Permanent TSB, over the coming months.  <\/p><p> By doing all of those things - I am focusing particularly on Permanent TSB - I want to be in a position where we can share some of that benefit with the asset side of the balance sheet.  However, it would be irresponsible of me to put the asset side of the balance sheet before the liability side.  That is not how I run a bank.  I want to get my cost of imports right because that makes the bank stable.  Then I will pass the benefits on to the asset side of the balance sheet.

We are trying to find the right balance, particularly on the deposit side of the balance sheet.

I had also noticed that Permanent TSB exercised its veto over insolvency arrangement proposals in what I estimated to be one third of all cases.  I was struck by the opening remarks that the insolvency process was being given too much attention.  As everyone in the room is aware, a proposal has gone to Cabinet to attempt to change how mortgage arrears are being dealt with.<\/p> <p>  Two things struck me about the figures for arrears.  If my maths are correct, Permanent TSB seems to have issued legal proceedings in approximately 40% of the buy-to-let mortgages that were in arrears for more than 90 days.  Similarly the bank seems to have initiated legal proceedings in approximately one third to 40% of home loans in arrears of more than 90 days.  We all know the historical figures are very low and we know the reasons for them being so low.  It is because organisations, not necessarily Permanent TSB, do not wish to take hits at a particular moment of time historically.  In my experience in dealing with mortgage arrears cases, there is no willingness whatsoever to engage with clients.  Looking at the arrears figures, there seems to be much more interest in engaging with clients now and particularly bringing them towards court proceedings.<\/p> <p>  I was also under the impression that the position of Permanent TSB on debt forgiveness was that it did not write down the residual portion of an outstanding debt.  There is a proposal on the table to reduce the bankruptcy period from three years to one year.  Knowing that in one third of cases the bank will not agree to a proposal that is being made and that they would have residual debt attached to them for the foreseeable future - I would regard 20 years or even ten years as a lifetime commitment in terms of outstanding debt - why would someone not go down the road of bankruptcy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015051300002#H01100","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431522000,"counter":1573,"content":"<p>There are a number of things I would say.  As context, I provided a supplemental pack that gives a sense of the performance of our bank in terms of arrears management versus the sector.  If the Vice Chairman has time to look at it, it will show that our performance is fine.  Essentially the key message is that our performance is better than that of the sector.  By better, I mean we have a lower percentage of arrears in home loans and buy-to-let loans.<\/p> <p>  When one looks at the decisions we have made with regard to the accounts, we offer a solution or a restructure in a higher percentage of cases than those that take the court route.  That is an important context to the first part of the Vice Chairman's question.<\/p> <p>  Second, we can look at the legal cases specifically.  The Vice Chairman mentioned buy-to-let loans.  She is correct that we have 1,100 cases relating to buy-to-let loans before the courts at the moment.  The reality is that if we cannot find a restructure solution for customers - it must be remembered that we found more restructures and solutions for customers than other banks - unfortunately we have found it is necessary to commence the legal process to get further engagement.  Our statistics show that when that legal process is commenced, something in excess of 20% of customers who would not speak to us, answer the phone or respond to the letter, actually will engage.  For those customers, more often than not we will find solutions.<\/p> <p>  On the numbers the Vice Chairman mentioned, she should not extrapolate the numbers where a legal letter is issued through to repossessions.  As I mentioned earlier, last year our bank across buy-to-let and home loans had just 37 court-led repossessions, which represents 0.02% of our mortgage book.  That is quite extraordinary when that figure is compared with any other jurisdiction, considering the incredibly high levels of arrears Irish banks have.<\/p> <p>  We have no problem with bankruptcy and we have in fact supported hundreds of bankruptcies.  Last year alone it was in the region of 300.  If bankruptcy is the right answer, it is the right answer.  However, a person cannot elect to be a bankrupt or insolvent without actually being insolvent or being a bankrupt.<\/p><p>By that I mean, some of the cases that we veto are because the applicant - the customer - actually is not insolvent.  Insolvent is not being able to repay one's debts as they fall due and there is no likelihood of that situation changing over the next five years.<\/p><p> In a large proportion of the small number of cases that we have vetoed, we can find a mortgage assistance relief strategies, MARS, treatment.  We can find a sustainable solution like a split mortgage or some of the other options that we have offered to 28,500 customers.  That is why we will veto a case, typically, or it is due to fees.  The average PIP fee has been &euro;12,000 in the insolvencies that we have seen.  Often, that is more than the bank and the other creditors are actually going to get.  The sum of &euro;12,000 is a very significant figure and it would make one question whether it is equitable to agree a scenario like that.  Where there is insolvency, and the customer is insolvent, but there is not a MARS solution, then our door is open to say \"Yes\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015051300002#H01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431522000,"counter":1575,"content":"<p>We have listened to a number of financial institutions that have come before us.

A solicitor requested the information but no information materialised.  They were of the view that the bank simply decided to pull out because there has been an increase in house prices beyond Dublin.  In other words, there has been an increase in Clare and other parts of the country and the bank effectively engaged in something similar to gazumping with the view that it could get a little more if it put the house back on the market now.

The only thing we would add to it is that we do not think there has been enough debate around reducing some elements of the insolvency judicial treatment - the debt relief notice and the debt settlement arrangement, the former of which runs for three years while the latter runs for five years.  We would be very supportive of a dramatic reduction in those terms, because the insolvency regime is in place to keep a roof over people's heads.  To the extent that those terms could be reduced and the unsecured debt written off quicker than is currently the case, that would enable people to focus on the mortgaged portion and maintaining the property.  We feel there should be more discussion in that area, whereas with bankruptcy it is about liquidating the property, so it is about taking the property and selling it.  We have no particular issue with reducing the period from three years to one, but it is not about keeping a roof over one's head.  Insolvency and bankruptcy are different.  One is in a very particular corner, unfortunately, in a bankruptcy situation.  I understand the distinction, but we would like more talk about reducing the terms for the other two solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015051300002#M02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1431522000,"counter":1675,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Sullivan for that.  Certainly, when the then Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, brought it through, he was very clear that they were not meant to be target times.  They were set in the legislation as maximum times and, as was predicted at the time, unfortunately, they became a default.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is the cost of borrowing.  We know that the Irish banks' blended cost of borrowing is significantly higher than for their European counterparts.  If we could get the standard variable rate, which is 4% to 4.5%, down to more European norms - around 2.5% - this would result in a massive benefit for households, for the economy, for job creation, for everything.  With quantitative easing kicking in, as of March, &euro;60 billion per month is being pumped in, so the ECB rate falls.  I appreciate that PTSB is only 15% funded by the ECB, but in the capital markets generally, money is becoming cheaper, so we would expect to see interest rates falling across the board.  Is there anything the Oireachtas could do to help reduce the blended cost of borrowing for the Irish banks?  It appears, from what we are hearing from the Central Bank in its initial report, that there is not profiteering or rent-seeking going on in the Irish banks in terms of the higher rate, but it is two percentage points higher, nearly twice some of the European rates.  Is there anything the Oireachtas or the Government can do to make it cheaper for the Irish banks to borrow money, which then could be passed on to the Irish people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015051300002#M02300","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431522000,"counter":1676,"content":"<p>I do not think so, because I think we are all aligned in wanting to do that.

We are not comparing like with like when we talk about the 2.5% standard variable rate in other countries versus 4.5%.standard variable rate in Ireland.  In most countries I have worked in where I have led banks, arrangement fees are part of the cost of borrowing.  While 2.5% might be the notional amount of the mortgage, certainly from my experience in most cases there is an arrangement fee as well.  We need to be slightly careful that we are not comparing apples with pears.  If Deputy Donnelly is asking me whether I am committed in principle to driving down the cost of inputs, I have to maintain a return for my shareholder and we in the bank are committed to sharing anything over and above that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015051300002#M02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431522000,"counter":1678,"content":"<p>That is not the question I am asking - I am taking that at face value.

Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  We now move to our meeting with four interest groups to discuss the persecution of Christians.  We are meeting the Council for Justice and Peace of the Irish Bishops' Conference, led by the chairman, Bishop John McAreavey, who is accompanied by Ms &Aacute;ine O'Reilly and Fr. Timothy Bartlett.  We are also meeting Tr&oacute;caire, which is represented by Ms Noreen McGrath Gumbo, head of humanitarian aid, Church in Chains, which is represented by Mr. David Turner, director, and Mr. Davood Mahmoodnezhd, trustee, and Open Doors UK and Ireland, represented by Ms Zoe Smith, head of advocacy.<\/p><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for attending to discuss a subject which has been aired repeatedly at the joint committee in recent times.  The format of the meeting will be to take opening statements from each group first.  As their written submissions have been received, the witnesses might synopsise them.  After we take the submissions, we will have questions from the members.  The issues raised will then be brought to the attention of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its Minister.  I remind witnesses, members and those in the Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or set to such a status that they do not interrupt the proceedings.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <\/p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <\/p><p>With that citation out of the way, I call on Bishop John McAreavey to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#A00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431507600,"counter":1686,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman and members of the joint committee for the invitation to attend this morning.<\/p><p>I am Catholic bishop of Dromore and am based in Newry.  I am chair of the Council for Justice and Peace of the Irish Bishops' Conference.  I am joined by Ms &Aacute;ine O'Reilly, a member of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem.  This is a Catholic charitable organisation that provides solidarity and financial support to the Christian communities in the Holy Land.  The organisation has in excess of 200 members in Ireland and more than 30,000 members world-wide.  I am also joined by Fr. Timothy Bartlett, an adviser to the council.  I am glad to be here this morning with Tr&oacute;caire, Open Doors and Church in Chains.<br\/><br\/>The ongoing persecution of Christians is an issue that unites all Christians.  Pope Francis has referred to it as ecumenism of suffering.  The breadth and scale of this suffering is unprecedented.  The Centre for the Study of Global Christianity in the United States estimates that 100,000 Christians are being killed every year because of their faith.  That is eleven every hour.  Others are being tortured, imprisoned, exiled, threatened, excluded, attacked and discriminated against on a widespread scale.  The Pew Research Centre says that Christianity is now the world's most oppressed religious group with persecution against them reported in 110 countries.  Many of these countries have significant trade links with Ireland.  Persecution is increasing in China.  In North Korea, one quarter of the country's Christians live in forced labour camps.  Saudi Arabia, Yemen and the Maldives all feature in the ten worst places to be a Christian.  According to the International Society for Human Rights, a non-religious organisation, 80% of all acts of religious discrimination in the world today are directed against Christians.<br\/><br\/>As the other groups will explain in more detail, the situation for Christians in the Middle East is particularly acute and shocking.  The rise of ISIS has accelerated a brutal religious genocide against Christians and other religious minorities which has been ongoing for well over a decade.  The former Chief Rabbi of Britain, Jonathan Sacks, recently described this suffering of Christians in the Middle East as &quot;one of the crimes against humanity of our time&quot;.  He compared it with Jewish pogroms in Europe and said he was: &quot;appalled at the lack of protest it has evoked&quot;.  I believe many Christians in Ireland, of all denominations, are appalled at the relative lack of attention being given in the Irish media, in political discourse and in government policy and action to the urgent plight of persecuted Christians in the Middle East at this time.  Children, women and men are being beheaded; young men are being brutalised and left to die on makeshift crosses in town squares in a part of the world once described as the cradle of Christianity and of civilisation itself.  Ancient churches and religious monuments from various traditions have been destroyed.<br\/><br\/>Such barbaric actions call out for an urgent, coordinated and determined response from the international community. They are a threat to our common humanity and to the religious and cultural patrimony of the world for future generations.  Any response will require an honest and comprehensive effort to address the sources of violent conflict that converge on this region and which have wider political and religious implications across the world.  <br\/><br\/>I have spoken to senior representatives of the Christian community in Iraq in recent days.  I will quote from a letter which arrived yesterday from the patriarch in Baghdad.  His English is not perfect so I will correct it as I read it:<\/p><blockquote>What has happened is like a tsunami of refugees overwhelming us.  Hosting 120,000 displaced persons and giving those food, clothing and medicines has not been easy.  We thank all churches, agencies and persons who have supported us.  Since eight months ago the city of Mosul and the Christian villages are occupied by ISIS.  [He writes that its release is not yet clear, so the end of this is not in sight].  The moment of trial that Christians in Iraq are going through requires a deeper communion between the churches to persevere in our land and to witness our Christian values.  For such an emergency situation we need of course material assistance for food and health, spiritual encouragement, solidarity visits to displaced Christians and education, particularly for our schools.  Also a political assistance for a fair political solution to the country's situation.<\/blockquote><p>Church leaders in the Middle East find it difficult to deal with the silence of the international community.  That is why this meeting today is very welcome because it represents the response of civic and political society in Ireland to a very painful and difficult situation and yet, even here, there is a reluctance, including on the part of Christian-based international aid agencies, to give direct support to minority religious communities, including to the Christian churches.  If these churches are to remain and if they are to draw strength from one another and continue their own religious, educational and charitable activities in the places where they live and work and where they have contributed for millennia to the shared educational, economic and cultural patrimony of their countries, then they need direct aid.  I am aware that direct aid to churches from State bodies and agencies is not always simple and yet mechanisms can be worked out with the appropriate accountability.  These churches have a right to be supported in rebuilding their bombed-out churches, schools, hospitals and halls that are availed of by the whole community.  They have a right to receive support in building bomb-proof walls and security around these buildings and their homes.  They are also best placed to ensure humanitarian support gets to those who need it most in the villages, towns and refugees camps where the local church continues to be present.  Perhaps because of a fear of being seen as less than secular in their own country, many governments of majority Christian countries in the West are often reluctant to give direct aid to churches and religious minorities in the Middle East, in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. John McAreavey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431507600,"counter":1688,"content":"<p>In commending the committee for taking up this theme of the ongoing persecution of Christians, as a proud citizen of this country, I believe many Irish citizens, Christian and others would like to see our political representatives and our Government giving much greater attention to this issue.  In particular, we ask the committee to provide direct aid to the Christian churches in the Middle East and to other persecuted religious groups so that they can rebuild their communities and infrastructure and protect that which has not been destroyed.  If they are to survive they have urgent and particular needs which they alone are best placed to provide.  They are also best placed to identify where to provide humanitarian assistance in the most difficult to reach areas which are experiencing immediate violence and oppression.  We ask the committee to assist the various Irish aid agencies in providing direct financial support to Christian and other religious communities in the Middle East without fear of being accused at home of being sectarian or giving offence to secularism in a predominantly Christian country.  This is a real concern among Christian aid agencies which the committee can help to address.  We ask the committee to use its political influence to raise awareness of this issue where possible.<\/p> <p>  In commending the committee's decision to hold this hearing, we encourage the committee to recommend a full D&aacute;il debate on the ongoing persecution of Christians and respect for religious freedom and the particular plight of persecuted Christians across the world.  We ask the committee to encourage the Government and Irish MEPs to use their influence in the European institutions to give greater political priority to addressing this issue at a European and international level.<\/p><p>This includes the need to address the complexity of issues in international relations that contribute to the ongoing conflict and instability across the region of the Middle East.<br\/><br\/>In keeping with its Christian roots and founding ideals, we appeal to members committee and, through them, to Europe to open wide the doors of our nations to the numerous refugees fleeing religious persecution in the Middle East.  Many of them wish to return to their homeland at the earliest possible opportunity.  Just as we did some decades ago for the Vietnamese boat people, let us open our shores, our homes and our vacant buildings in a welcoming and reassuring embrace to those fleeing the most brutal attacks by introducing special temporary immigrant schemes focused on responding to this issue.<br\/><br\/>I am reminded that the links between the Christian community in Ireland and the Christian community in the Middle East go back to the early Celtic Church.  They continue today in the heroic work of many Irish missionaries who work in solidarity with persecuted Christian communities in the Middle East even at risk to their own lives.  This continuing link is perhaps most poignantly symbolised by the new mosaic in the apse of the recently restored chapel of the Irish College in Rome.  There in the midst of our national patron saints, St. Patrick, St. Brigid, St. Columcille and others is the image of a young Iraqi priest.  His name is Fr. Ragheed Ganni.  He studied for several years in the Irish college.  He worked in Lough Derg and in various parishes throughout the country during his postgraduate studies.  He loved the Irish people and they loved him.  He radiated joy, gentleness and a true Christian spirit of service to all who knew him and yet his heart was set on returning to bring comfort, strength and support to his suffering people in Iraq.  The Church of the Holy Spirit in Mosul, in which he was ministering, was subject to regular bombings and attack.  On the feast of the Holy Trinity in 2007, as he finished the celebration of mass, Fr. Ragheed and three subdeacons were brutally murdered.  The vehicle in which they had been killed was surrounded by explosives by those who had killed them so that no-one dared approach to offer comfort, prayers or help.  Just a week before, Fr. Ragheed had written: <\/p><blockquote>In a sectarian and confessional Iraq, will there be any space for Christians?  We have no support, no group who fights for our cause; we are abandoned in the midst of the disaster.<\/blockquote><p>It is with this painful, prophetic cry of a young man who knew, loved and appreciated the Irish people so much that we thank members for giving us time to highlight the plight of persecuted Christians in our world today and appeal to them to consider positively the recommendations we have made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431507600,"counter":1690,"content":"<p>We have three more presentations and I ask witnesses to be concise as we already have written versions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#C00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431507600,"counter":1691,"content":"<p>I am head of humanitarian programmes at Tr&oacute;caire.  Mr. &Eacute;amonn Meehan, our director, sends his apologies as he is in Rome at the general assembly of Caritas Internationalis, which takes place only every four years.<\/p> <p>  Tr&oacute;caire is the official overseas development agency of the Catholic Church in Ireland.  It is a registered charity and was established in 1973 with a twin mandate, to combat poverty abroad and to make everyone at home more aware of the needs of developing countries and of our duties towards them.  Justice is at the centre of our mandate and this commitment to a just world has been our defining characteristic for the last 40 years.<\/p> <p>  Tr&oacute;caire has a long history of fighting for the full realisation of human rights.  We work with an extensive network of partners in 17 different countries on various justice related issues.  We also work closely with the human rights unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I would like to acknowledge the active role Ireland has played as a member of the Human Rights Council, and particularly in its commitment to Resolution 25\/12 on freedom of religion or belief.<\/p> <p>  Tr&oacute;caire understands the persecution of Christians and ethnic and religious minorities as a heinous violation of a fundamental human right, namely, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion derived from the inherent dignity of the human person and one of the most vital elements that goes to make up identity.  Across the Middle East, the existence of many minorities, including Christians, is seriously threatened by the deepening conflict.  In Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, we work among many Christians.  We witness a situation where violence, hatred, extremism, intolerance and exclusion are destroying the social fabric of society and endangering the very existence of many communities, communities that have co-existed peacefully for thousands of years.  In conflict, the universality of rights is challenged and rights are denied, freedoms are abused and populations cease to have control over their lives.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, Tr&oacute;caire responded to a call from Caritas Iraq to assist Christians, Turkmen, Yazidis, Shabaks and Shia Muslims forced to flee Mosul after it was taken by the Islamic State.  Our colleagues in Caritas Iraq say it is not only about religion but about power, control and wealth.  A grant of more than US$400,000 was provided by us to Caritas Iraq which assisted thereafter 4,000 of the neediest families.  Families received vouchers to buy basic household supplies, such as mattresses, blankets and utensils and fuel for warmth and cooking during the winter months.<\/p> <p>  In our work, we serve people of all faiths and none, while recognising the vulnerability of minorities and particularly women and children among those minorities.  When we provide humanitarian aid it is given regardless of race, creed or nationality and without adverse distinction of any kind.  Our relief efforts are strictly guided by the humanitarian imperative to ensure that no group is excluded or needs ignored.  Mr. Meehan, in an e-mail this morning, mentioned that the Pope had addressed the gathering in Rome and emphasised the point that no group should be excluded.<\/p> <p>  In Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, Tr&oacute;caire is working with seven local partner organisations, four of whom are Caritas agencies.  Some committee members met Bishop Antoine Audo of Aleppo when Tr&oacute;caire hosted his visit to Ireland in November last year.  He spoke of how, in the midst of the ongoing terror and destruction of Aleppo, people were supporting each other based on what they had and what others needed rather than on religious affiliation.<\/p> <p>  On 28 April last, President Higgins visited Tr&oacute;caire&rsquo;s programme partners in Lebanon where he met with staff and with refugees from Syria and Iraq who shared their personal stories of displacement and their hopes to return to their countries which have been ravaged by conflict.  In his address, President Higgins spoke of the consequences of diplomatic failure in the region and the human tragedy that has resulted.  He noted that displacement is a global problem and that there is a need for urgent and honest recognition of international and moral responsibilities to respond.  The President expressed his solidarity with all those displaced by conflict and called for the international community to help carry the burden of the Syria crisis and recognise the strain on countries like Lebanon which currently hosts more than 1.3 million refugees.<\/p> <p>  The international community can and must do more to support all ethnic and religious communities in the Middle East, remembering always that violence has no religion, gender, ethnicity or morality but reflects a betrayal of basic humanity.  Peace is crucial for the future of the Middle East and is the only way to guarantee the existence of minority communities, including Christians, in this region into the future.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of Tr&oacute;caire and our partners in the Middle East, I ask the committee to consider the following actions that the Irish Government and the broader European Union must take to show leadership and solidarity and to demonstrate our common humanity.  First, the Irish Government must take a more proactive role in ending conflict in the Middle East, building on the experience in Northern Ireland of peace building, conflict prevention and conflict resolution.  Ireland should increase diplomatic engagement on Syria, supporting the UN Special Envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, in efforts to secure a renewed political process.  Second, we ask the committee to work with the Departments of Justice and Equality, Social Protection and Foreign Affairs and Trade to ensure that a greater number of Syrian and Iraqi refugees are offered asylum and protection in Ireland.  Ireland has granted refugee status to approximately 90 Syrian asylum seekers since the conflict began, as well as initiating the Syrian humanitarian admissions programme.<\/p><p>However, these numbers are disproportional to the gravity of the displacement situation and the EU has largely failed to take responsibility for shouldering the burden of the crisis.<\/p><p> I ask members to continue to engage specifically on the Syrian crisis to ensure that the support provided by the Irish Government is holistic and in tandem with the scale and complexity of the crisis.  The Government must give more consideration to the work of national NGOs and local actors in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Syria that are instrumental in ensuring that aid continues to help those trapped in hard-to-reach areas.  In addition to bearing witness to the suffering of others, the staff and families of national organisations in Syria live in fear of being attacked and directly targeted for providing assistance to those in greatest need.  Flexible funding mechanisms must continue to evolve to respond to the increasing complexity and desperate nature of the situation and reach out particularly to local organisations providing life-saving assistance to those who are hard to reach and living in constant fear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Noreen McGrath Gumbo","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431507600,"counter":1693,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McGrath Gumbo.

Church in Chains is an Irish charity that seeks to be an Irish voice for persecuted Christians.  We have been in existence for more than 30 years when our work began by focusing on the plight of Christian prisoners in the Soviet Union.  Deputy Quinn stood with me outside the Soviet Embassy all those years ago.<\/p> <p>  The world has moved on since then, but the persecution of Christians remains in many countries around the world.  We have already heard about the desperate plight of Christians in the Middle East, but it is not only there that Christians face persecution.  The persecution of Christians worldwide has been neglected and overlooked for far too long.  For this reason, we have worked hard to try to secure this meeting.  It is also why we are so pleased that the committee is considering this topic.<\/p> <p>  Although I will focus on Christians, I want to make it very clear that we strongly believe in religious freedom for all people.  While our work focuses exclusively on Christians, we acknowledge that many other religious groups suffer alongside them, for example, the Ahmadi Muslims in Pakistan, the Baha'i in Iran, Muslims in Burma, China and India and the Yazidis in Iraq.<\/p> <p>  In seeking to convey the extent of the situation to Irish people, we produced a global guide booklet, of which some members have copies.  We colour coded 60 countries.  Some are red, denoting severe persecution.  These are countries in which every Christian is in danger of persecution, for example, imprisonment, torture or violent attack.  Such countries include Pakistan where, as many members know, Christians frequently face violent attack and the blasphemy law causes the imprisonment of many people.  Interestingly, that law means that most of those victims are fellow Muslims, but Christians spend many years in prison under it.  In Vietnam, hundreds of thousands of tribal Hmong and Montagnard people are persecuted for their faith and ethnicity.<\/p> <p>  A large part of the world is coloured orange on our map.  This stands for significant persecution, that being, a country where some, but not all, Christians face attack, arrest or restrictions.  Large countries are in this category, for example, India.  There are many places in India, particularly its large cities, where Christians worship freely.  Go beyond the cities to small villages, one will find pastors and small churches facing violent attack from Hindu extremists week after week.  The Indian police and Government are doing nothing about this.  In fact, persecution in those areas has increased since the Government of Prime Minister Modi came to power a year ago.  We could visit cities in China where churches are freely open, but there are also Christians in prison in China because they want to worship in churches whose leaders or activities the Chinese Government does not approve of, and China seeks to control the church.  Those who are unwilling to accept that control face the full wrath of the state.<\/p> <p>  Green coloured countries in our global guide maybe receive less attention because we define that as a limited category of persecution.  Some churches or individuals face restrictions or discrimination, for example, finding it difficult to arrange meeting places or to import copies of the Bible.  However, these difficulties should be addressed.<\/p> <p>  I hope the committee wants to take concrete steps and I will suggest three.  First, it should invite ambassadors from countries where Christians face persecution to discuss their governments' actions.  Ambassadors from China, India, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are resident in Dublin.  It would be good to have them engage with the facts relating to the persecution of Christians in their countries.  Second, we would like the committee to encourage the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to make a major speech on the topic.  In common with previous Ministers, he has issued some press releases but if Ireland wants to address this situation, a major speech by him would make Ireland's position clear.<\/p> <p>  Third, an official in the human rights unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should be dedicated, part-time or full-time, to the issue of religious freedom.  The unit's staff do a good job and are trying to cover a wide area of human rights, but it would be beneficial if one official, even part time for the sake of resources, was dedicated to the issue of religious freedom.  As I am sure members are aware, this would provide the opportunity for continuity and the building of expertise.<\/p> <p>  I will pass over to my colleague, Mr. Mahmoodnezhd, a trustee of Church in Chains who is originally from Iran.  He will briefly discuss his home country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Turner"},{"type":"speech","time":1431507600,"counter":1695,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Turner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#D00400","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431507600,"counter":1696,"content":"<p>I thank the committee on behalf of Iranian Christians.  This is a major opportunity to represent Christians, who have no voice back home in Iran.  I came to this country ten years ago because my life was in danger.  They tried to kill me, so I left the country.  When I came here and went to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce myself as an asylum seeker, my interpreter was an officer from the Iranian embassy.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about persecution but it is not just in my country.  We do not feel safe here as Christians.  For that reason, I introduced myself as a Davood H. M., or no name.  After my interview, my family back home was persecuted.  It had to write a letter denying that I was a son or brother.  My family denied any kind of connection.  The committee can see that persecution of Christians is not just in that country.  We must start from here and build some committee here that has a love for human beings.<\/p> <p>  Iran is a country in which one cannot choose the name of one's children.  How can people have one faith?  If one has a child, one has a booklet from which a name must be found.  Most are from holy people.  In Iran, one does not have any kind of freedom.  Many Iranians are in prison just for saying what they think, feel and believe.  Iran is a one-way system because of its regime and government.<\/p><p>A person who is in cannot come out and if I am born Muslim, I have to be Muslim.  However, I choose my God and who I wanted to follow and serve.  This is a crime in Iran.<\/p><p> In Iran now many Christians are in prison and do not have access to medical aid.  They are persecuted and tortured.  Sometimes it is one or two months until they can see a doctor.  This is one of the big problems in prison in Iran.  A Christian in prison there can be tortured.  Since countries in Europe are focusing on Iran, the Iranian Government is not hanging or killing people in prison any more.  They give a Christian a sentence and he stays there for five or ten years.  Then, when he comes out afterwards, he has an accident.  Somehow, someone comes to rob his house and kills him.  Sometimes we think it is good for a Christian to be in prison because he is far safer there and can stay alive, but when he comes out, he has no chance.<\/p><p> This is a country where it is a crime for a person to say what he thinks and believes.  In Iran, many Christians have somehow lost their family.  Why is this?  It is because those responsible find out about it and take the children away.  Some families have to separate and defect as a result.  The Iranian Government supports that.<\/p><p> As my colleague said, European countries must ask the Iranian ambassadors what they are doing in that country.  They should come before this committee to answer these questions.  Why have so many educated people left the country or elect not to stay there?  I work as a pastor in two churches.  When I arrived in this country with the help of the Lord we planned the churches in Dublin and Belfast.  I would like to do that in my country and provide for people to practise Christianity or what they believe.  In the 21st century it is very sad that a person has to go to another country to practice his faith.  I thank the committee for this opportunity to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Davood Mahmoodnezhd","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431507600,"counter":1698,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

My name is Zoe Smith.  I head the advocacy department at Open Doors UK and Ireland.  We are part of an international organisation which for 60 years has supported Christians facing persecution.  We started in 1955 and now work in over 50 countries throughout the world.  We support Christians by supplying Bibles, leadership training, literacy programmes, livelihood support, trauma counselling, orphanages and advocacy services, among other things.  We work in close consultation with Christians who experience first-hand the denial of their right to freedom of religious belief under Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<\/p> <p>  Every year our research team produces the world watch list, which assesses the 50 countries throughout the world where it is hardest to live as a Christian.  The team provides an annual ranking of 1 to 50 and analyses the trends and dynamics of global persecution.  Since all committee members have the document I will quickly go through the trends and hopefully get to the end quickly.<\/p> <p>  The first point I wish to highlight is that more Christians are being persecuted in more countries and more severely than since Open Doors started compiling the world watch list 13 years ago, including in countries where historically it had been safe to be a Christian.  This not only restricted to the Middle East.  Despite the violence on our television screens this is not even primarily due to increased violence but rather to increased cultural and social pressures squeezing Christians out of society.  At issue is the intentional deprivation of fundamental rights on account of one's faith.  This is often harder to withstand in the long run than direct violence.  Often the visibility of the violence, understandably, attracts all the international attention and policy focus.  We recommend that the committee should pay close attention to the legal and cultural pressures on Christians and constitutional sources of persecution, noting early warning signs such as changes in law or jurisprudence, in addition to the violence with a view to formulating effective policy to protect the right to freedom of religion and belief.<\/p> <p>  Among Christians facing persecution the women of the persecuted church face double discrimination based on their faith and gender.  Christian women are often not only of the second gender but also of the second-class religion.  Christian women in Egypt often report harassment, verbal abuse and intimidation.  In Pakistan and other countries Christian women face kidnapping, forced marriages and forced conversions.  One organisation estimates between 100 and 700 Christian women and girls are affected by this each year.  Obviously, it is devastating to the communities and families and there is a big shame culture as well.  Therefore, getting exact figures on how many girls or women are affected by this is difficult.  However, we can see some of the extent of it.<\/p> <p>  ISIS has further demonstrated this vulnerability by singling out Yazidi Christian women for abuse.  Only last week I heard of one Christian woman who escaped ISIS, but she has lost her mind as a result of the repeated rapes and abuse.  A nine-year-old Yazidi girl is now seven months pregnant because of the rapes of ISIS.  She is unable to cope physically and the doctors fear for her life.  These are not isolated instances.  Therefore, I call on the committee to explore the value and impact of raising religious freedom as a dimension of women's rights and, when discussing the rights of women, ensure that the religious dimension is not overlooked.  In particular, when the Irish Government addresses religious freedom as part of its important role on the UN Human Rights Council, we recommend that this committee advocates the proactive inclusion of female faith group representatives at every instance and works to combat any barriers currently stopping women entering the debate to ensure that gender dimensional persecution is duly considered.<\/p> <p>  Although it is not the only persecution of Christians, Islamic extremism represents by far the greatest source of persecution of Christians worldwide.  In our research, 18 of the top 20 countries listed Islamic extremism as the main source of persecution of Christians and it played a role in 40 of the 50 countries overall.  We have already heard about the Middle East, but sub-Saharan Africa is a second epicentre for this trend.  We recommend that the committee monitor this and that members keep an eye on that region in particular.<\/p> <p>  What we term Islamic extremism comes in a variety of guises.  There are extremist states such as Iran and Saudi Arabia.  There are also extremist local governments, such as in north-eastern Nigeria, extremist political movements, like the Muslin Brotherhood in Egypt, extremist violence groups, like ISIS as well as extremist households and individuals, who are effective at clamping down on family members or community members who happen to step out of line and become Christian.<\/p> <p>  However, Islamic extremism is not the only source of persecution.  We have identified eight sources overall.  Please ask me to explain these terms later because they contain some jargon.  The other seven include  religious nationalism, tribal antagonism and denominational protectionism.  Religious nationalism is where religion is a symbol of national identity.  Tribal antagonism is represented by what we heard about in Vietnam where tribe members try to get their members to stay in the community at all costs.  Denominational protectionism is where one church group tries to dominate all other expressions of Christianity.  Communist oppression, such as in China, is where the state tries to control the church.  Dictatorial paranoia, where dictators seek to dominate every aspect of society, is another source.  Secular intolerance seeks to push religion out of society.  Organised corruption arises where Christians who often espouse a different way of life are killed with sickening frequency.  Please ask about country examples either by way of questions or afterwards and we can provide these for each heading.<\/p> <p>  Finally, anti-conversion, blasphemy and apostasy laws continue to blight many lives throughout the world.  We appeal to the committee to continue to resolutely support the right of each individual to change religion or choose the religion of her choice and insist that this is a clear implication of the Article 18 protection of freedom of religion and belief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Zoe Smith"},{"type":"speech","time":1431507600,"counter":1700,"content":"<p>Thank you.

It is true to say that we would all prefer if we could do more but there is a limit to the extent to which a country can interfere in the internal affairs of another country, as we have found out in recent debates and discussion at this committee.<\/p><p>We also hark back to warnings given before the invasion of Iraq that an invasion would destabilise the entire region and lead to violent clashes between various ethnic groups.  The invasion, however, was outside the control of this committee, the Government and, for that matter, the European Union.  Information placed in the public domain concerning weapons of mass destruction was used as the basis for the invasion of Iraq.  It was subsequently shown to have been incorrect and, sadly, the cost has been great.<\/p><p> The witnesses made some interesting points which the committee will bring to the attention of the Minister.

Bishop McAreavey's remarks on the killing each year of 100,000 Christians paint a disturbing and worrying picture.  It is something of an understatement, therefore, to suggest the international community should be concerned about this issue because it is clear that crimes against humanity are taking place on a vast scale.<\/p> <p>  Bishop McAreavey and Ms O'Reilly asked that direct assistance be provided to rebuild and protect churches and spaces where Christians and other minority groups meet.  My understanding is that local Christian leaders in some of the affected areas would prefer discreet support to be provided because public support might lead to further persecution.  Can a balance be struck between providing support and avoiding the creation of further difficulties for those who are being persecuted?<\/p> <p>  Bishop McAreavey raised the important issue of raising awareness.  I do not know if the persecution of Christians and other minorities has been the subject of a major debate in the United Nations General Assembly which holds plenary sessions every September.  I understand 160 countries are represented at this forum which discusses the issues of the day.  The House of Commons held a full debate on the persecution of Christians some time ago and I believe the European Parliament has also debated and passed a motion on the issue.  Has the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference or its sister organisations in other countries succeeded in having debates held on this issue in other Parliaments, whether at committee or plenary level?  As the Vice Chairman stated, Ireland is a small cog in the global wheel.  I do not mean to detract from the obligation on the Oireachtas to highlight human rights violations and other concerns.  If the sister organisations of the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference had an opportunity to make presentations to parliamentary committees in other countries in the West, it would make an important contribution towards raising awareness of the terrible injustice being done to many innocent people. <\/p> <p>  Ms McGrath Gumbo from Tr&oacute;caire pointed out that humanitarian aid must be provided to people regardless of their race, creed or nationality.  All of us support this principle.  She also stated that the humanitarian principles which guide Tr&oacute;caire's response can be a valuable form of protection for the organisation's staff and its local partners from coercion, threats and demands from armed groups.  Will she address the issue of safety for humanitarian workers from all non-governmental organisations on the ground?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Turner of Church in Chains also raised the need for greater awareness and concern about the ongoing persecution of individuals in international fora.  Could Ireland use its membership of the United Nations Human Rights Council to greater effect in terms of keeping this issue on the agenda of the United Nations and international community generally?<\/p> <p>  Ms Smith of Open Doors noted that the epicentres of the ongoing persecution are the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa.  Are there links between the persecution taking place in these two regions?<\/p> <p>  Ms Smith also referred to apostasy laws.  Are there potential remedies in international law to deal effectively with this important issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#F00200","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1431507600,"counter":1703,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I do not propose to repeat the pertinent questions asked by Deputy Brendan Smith.<\/p> <p>  Many lessons from history can be utilised in this regard.  In his human rights campaign Martin Luther King held up to the white population of America the Constitution of the United States when he called on them to implement constitutional rights for all the country's citizens.  This approach is better than telling people to be better or not to do this or that.  We must hold people to account by asking them legitimate questions based on the conflict between their actions and that to which they signed up.  The lesson from history is that this is the correct approach.<\/p> <p>  It is good to see Mr. Turner again.  The most recent example of the type of scenario I describe was in the agreement on the Helsinki Final Act in 1973.  During the negotiations, the Soviet Union sought certainty by demanding recognition for the post-war borders of central and eastern Europe.  There were three aspects to the negotiations.  The first was the recognition and finalisation of borders, in particular, the division of Germany and its internal border.  Agreement was reached on this issue.  The second issue was economic and social matters and the third was human rights.  In the case of human rights, the Soviet Union, which was the first atheist state in the world, signed up to a declaration of religious freedom for Soviet citizens.  It was on the basis of this declaration that those who favoured allowing Jews to emigrate confronted the Soviet authorities.  They noted the contradiction between the persecution experienced by Jews in the Soviet Union, which was similar to the persecution the witnesses have described, and the country's public statements on religious freedom, and asked why the government was acting in conflict with the principles it proclaimed.<\/p> <p>  I am not an expert in this area and I do not know if the European Parliament or other parliaments have taken any action in this area.  The joint committee has available to it a professional diplomat from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  If an Irish ambassador were called to the Parliament of Iran to answer questions on the reasons Irish people were behaving in a manner that contradicted agreements Ireland had signed, it would have greater substance than simply inviting him or her to a meeting to be scolded.  If possible, the joint committee should invite ambassadors from certain countries before it to explain their failure to uphold the values they have subscribed to in official declarations and commitments, including in the United Nations.  This would be preferable to giving out to people and would give us some credibility.  <\/p> <p>  It is clear from the presentations that the main problem is the persecution of Christians.  As Diarmaid MacCulloch's masterful history of Christianity demonstrates, Christians lived in the areas where persecution is currently taking place long before St. Patrick arrived in Ireland.  They were in a majority in these regions for centuries before Islam arrived on the scene and are part and parcel of the culture of these parts of the world.  Christianity in those regions is distinct from subsequent attempts by Christianity to convert people in other regions of the world, pre-communist China being the classic example.<\/p><p> Religious freedom is a fundamental human right - the right to believe or not believe has to be a fundamental right.  I can see where there would be tensions because of proselytisation or missionaries, on the one hand, as distinct from historic groups who have always been Christian.  While I would not make a distinction between them, I think they will evoke different types of attitudes.  If we are to take the very clear focus of the persecution of Christianity, which is now, as Bishop McAreavey has said, the highest in the world of any religion, can the committee be provided with information, from the vast amount of work that the witnesses have done, about how specific countries that have signed up to a set of international standards have breached those standards?  Then we can explore the possibility of inviting in representatives of those countries, if they are here in this country, and outlining the conflict between what was signed up for and what is happening on the ground, specifically about Christians, because this is about Christian persecution.  I think in that respect, this committee, as one of the 28 member states of the European Union, could do that.  That ambassador will have to file a report back to his government.  It will go back into foreign affairs.  There will be a paper trail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#F00300","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431507600,"counter":1705,"content":"<p>I do not have any questions.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  They have not told us anything we did not know but it is very depressing to hear so many of them making the same presentation.  I am sure that all of us feel that we are already doing what the witnesses are asking us to do, to the utmost extent of our ability.  Nothing is new in what the witnesses have said but it has come into very sharp focus with the rise of ISIS at the moment and the horrendous situation, particularly for people in Syria and Iraq who are living in areas dominated by ISIS.  In Nigeria, Christian girls have been abducted, and women are particularly vulnerable.  The witnesses have probably read that recently, over 230 women and children have been rescued - not the Christian student girls - and of those, 214 had been raped and were pregnant as a result of rape.  That demonstrates the absolute savagery involved and that it has been done in the name of religion is an affront in itself.  What can be done?  We have had the ambassadors in.  We have put it to them and there has been total denial that anything untoward is happening.  I think my colleagues will agree.  If we mention human rights and persecution, they will say it is not happening.  They are in complete denial.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe that the Minister would have a problem with making a major speech but I think to make any progress it is necessary to try to initiate talks on peace and stability in these countries.  The only way that we can have an input is through our role in the EU and through the UN.  That is the only prospect of progress.  In conclusion, all I can say is that we have heard what the witnesses have said and we will do everything we can as a committee and as a country to raise awareness about these issues to the extent that we can embarrass the countries that allow such things to happen within their borders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#G00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1431507600,"counter":1706,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing the beginning but I was chairing an event that also involved Tr&oacute;caire.   The witnesses' reports were extremely informative but also very challenging.  It was very difficult to listen to individual cases, because when it is brought down to individual cases, one can see the effects of the principal questions that have been raised.  I agree that there is a very noticeable absence of media attention, particularly on the persecution of Christians.  I am not sure whether this is political correctness gone crazy in some particular way.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about respecting the right to religious freedom and conscience, that has to be done without interfering in the religious freedom of other people.  Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram and ISIS would all claim that they are acting according to their religious beliefs.  We would be very sceptical of and cynical about what they see as religion and love of God.  It must also be included that people have to have a right to their own religious freedom and conscience and practice without interfering with the rights of other people to their religious belief.<\/p> <p>  We have had ambassadors in but I think another important way is to follow up with them on particular cases.  Some of us have done that with certain of the ambassadors.  The recommendations that the witnesses have outlined in their presentations are extremely practical and I am sure that there is something that the committee can consider.<\/p> <p>  As it is not only Christians who are being persecuted but other groups also, is there any collective engagement with people from those particular churches?  I have been involved with the Baha'i faith and have been in Iran where we raised the issue with the human rights commissioner and at other meetings.  I think the collective voice could be very useful on that.  Ireland is also on the Human Rights Council and it brought up certain issues on Iran which Iran had to come back and answer, and one of those was about the Baha'i faith, but if we are talking about religious persecution we should include all the groups that the witnesses have mentioned, and obviously Christians as well.<\/p> <p>  With the Chairman of the committee, at the invitation of GOAL, I had the opportunity to go to the Turkish Syrian border to look at the refugee situation there.  We are aware that the Syrian refugees who got into the camps were fortunate, and those who had friends were equally fortunate, but there were Syrian couples and families who came across who depended on Turkish farmers and citizens to support them with living arrangements.  There was no doubt that this was a major human rights issue.  That brings me to Ireland accepting Syrian refugees.  We are not accepting enough but I always have this in my head that we accept a certain kind of refugee.  We accept the educated refugee, the better-off refugee, and we are not looking at people like the ones we met when we were in that area of Turkey - very ordinary people living in appalling conditions, some of them with families.  When we talk about refugees, I think that is another aspect that we should highlight.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their presentations.   The committee must take on board some of the recommendations that have been made because they will be very practical for going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#G00300","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1431507600,"counter":1707,"content":"<p>I join my colleagues in welcoming our guests today.  They have certainly brought home to all of us, in a very graphic way, the issues which we are all conscious of but which we probably need to be presented with in a very graphic fashion, as the witnesses have done today.  What we are doing is a major element of heightening awareness in Ireland, within our national parliament, and hopefully at a European and UN level as well.  It is obvious that it has occurred in all the countries that have been mentioned where politics has failed and there is a major need for the international community to redouble its efforts to try to restore peace, stability, and normality.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Quinn made a very practical suggestion for us to hold the representatives of some of those countries to account and to see how they are measuring up against what they have signed up for within their own countries.  That would be a very useful debate and discussion to have at the committee.<\/p><p> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned the very significant issues of refugees fleeing torture in the various parts of the world and particularly the major issue of refugees from Syria.  We need to take on this issue as a country and we are not doing enough.  We have our own problems with accommodation, trying to house homeless people in our country and we are facing major challenges in that regard.  Nevertheless, these people have nothing at all and there is no support from anybody.  It is incumbent on us to have a major debate in this country on the level of support we can give to these displaced people.<\/p><p> Support is given by Irish Aid to the various non-government organisations and Bishop McAreavey raised the issue of direct aid to churches and religious minorities in the Middle East to rebuild their communities.  It certainly seems a laudable suggestion.  We have to be cognisant of the issue raised by Deputy Smith on the possibility of that causing further difficulties.  I am sure there are ways around this.  Ms Smith might spell out a little more what she means by the denominational protectionism and organised corruption.  Could she put a little more flesh on that for us?

When we speak of human rights, the right to freedom of conscience and religious believe is part of the process.

Europe will have to face this and Ireland as a responsible member of the European community will also have to face its responsibilities.

The response from committee members clearly indicates their knowledge in the area.  Individually, we have brought the subject matter before the D&aacute;il by way of parliamentary questions and letters to the Minister and his predecessors.<\/p> <p>  It goes without saying that religious intolerance is not new and it has been going on for hundreds and thousands of years.  Over Christmas I took to reading about the Crusades in one of my madder moments.  It was an interesting period and it is odd that nothing has changed; intolerance is the same as it was then and it continues.  There is something particularly sensitive about religious intolerance.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned an interesting point.  Various countries have anti-blasphemy laws but each in their turn believes those laws apply to others only and not themselves.  That is the interesting point.  There is good cause for anti-blasphemy laws but they should apply to all.  This means the degree to which a person can become offended by an ignominious reference to religion is lessened.<\/p> <p>  All members have dealt with scores or hundreds of refugees over the past ten or 15 years, and we continue to do so.  The horrific stories we hear from time to time have been confirmed by the witnesses.  I remember dealing some years ago with a young woman from Rwanda who had been a victim of rape and continued abuse in the war.  She was 19 years old but on looking at the individual, one would know immediately what she had been through.  I remember at the time trying to get a hearing for her here but because this was not her first landfall in Europe, we could not help.  She eventually died on the streets in London.  Those stories repeat what we have heard many times in the past.<\/p> <p>  The war in Vietnam started through religious intolerance.  Madame Nhu was the influential sister-in-law of President Diem at the time.  It has been mentioned many times that the regime was not tolerant and it kept freedom to a minimum but, ironically, it stopped the kind of intolerance that followed.  The same pattern emerged in the western Balkans, and after Tito's reign, everything else happened.  I am sure all members have at some stage visited Mostar, which has two cemeteries, one on each side of the road.  There are 500 Christians in one and 500 Muslims in the other.  We have it here as well.  Reference has been made to the extent to which we can use the Irish analogy in dealing with issues overseas.  I assure the witnesses that we have tried that too.  We have done it as a committee and I know the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its Minister and his predecessor have done exactly that.  It does not necessarily resonate with the people with whom we have discourse.  They only see one side.<\/p> <p>  In 1979 I stayed in a kibbutz in Israel and we visited both sides.  We got both types of opposing propaganda.  I remember an army colonel making a speech detailing all the atrocities which occurred that were offensive to him.  I returned two years ago and I heard the same speech.  Nothing seemed to happen at all.  Any time there is a conflict of that nature, with major emphasis on the atrocities of the past, there is no moving forward.  Northern Ireland was a somewhat different case.  It is true the issue had been ongoing for 700 years and there was a national issue.  Oddly enough, it was the forces outside of Northern Ireland and even Europe that forced the opposing sections to concentrate on the issues.<\/p><p>It was an interesting time and an interesting place to be.  While it sets an example to the rest of the warring world, it does not resolve the problems, unfortunately.<\/p><p> We will go to work on the recommendations of the witnesses and members.  Given that the recommendations have been made before, we should not expect dramatic results.  We have raised these issues, and continue to do so.  The policy has been raised most recently by the Minister in debates here and throughout Europe.  At the March Human Rights Council, the Minister made freedom of religion and belief a key theme, saying: \"Violence in the name of religion is a disturbing phenomenon and one which is not confined to ISIL\".  The entire free world supported ISIS in the initial stages.  Everybody thought they were freedom fighters and that they were going into Syria and Egypt to free the people.  This was not what they were doing.  They had a different agenda.  In Iraq, forces were overrun virtually overnight by people who had prepared plans well in advance, knew what they were doing and were well-funded.  The affront to society of people being publicly beheaded on television for us to look at nightly on our screens is something that focuses the mind.<\/p><p> Ireland has done as much as it can do along with its colleagues in Europe, through the UN and the EU, and it will continue in this regard.  The fact we have not seen dramatic results to the extent we would like is not a reflection of a lack of effort but an indication of the magnitude of the task before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#H00400","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431507600,"counter":1713,"content":"<p>In availing of the opportunity given to us today, we want to give a voice to the voiceless who do not get a chance to speak for themselves.  Restriction on the practice of religion is an abuse of human rights.  The issue of human rights is largely the currency through which we deal with these matters and it is right that we do it.  I am delighted that there is a gentleman from Iran here today as part of one of the other delegations.  Although we had planned to have a citizen of Iraq as part of our delegation, on reflection, he felt it was too risky for his family, who are still in Iraq.  We are sensitive to the difficulties that speaking here can create for others.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Smith made a very powerful point about the need for sensitivity.  Even in a discussion such as this, there is a danger that Christians in some of the countries in which they are in the minority might continue to be seen as crypto-Westerners.  In speaking out for these people, we are not asking for anything for them other than that they be respected citizens of the country in which they live.  We are not asking for any particular privileges but are only saying they should be respected and that their rights in those countries should be acknowledged.  Deputy Quinn made a point about holding countries to what they have signed up to, which is important.  He will know better than many people that it is not easy.  A few years ago, I was with Tr&oacute;caire in Pakistan and was told that although the law on bonded labourers there was perfect, the culture meant that action was not taken against wealthy landowners who were abusing labourers.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate very much the experience and wisdom of the Deputies and Senators.  In speaking here today, I would like to think that our main target is the people of Ireland, particularly on issues such as opening our doors and being more sensitive to the needs of people fleeing war-torn areas, such as Syria and Iraq.  Our own people will have to free our politicians up and say we must do what we have to do, difficult as our situation is and will probably remain.<\/p> <p>  Religion never comes unalloyed.  There is a toxic mix between a kind of religion and a kind of politics.  Christians in many parts of the world pay a price for what the West has done and, in some instances, is not doing.  In an ecumenical context, I have heard it said that Washington is the new Rome.  The Crusades were directed from Rome.  A very practical example is that Christians in Pakistan feel the backdraft from drones in Afghanistan.  What Washington does is seen as &ldquo;the West&rdquo; and the new Rome.  The West has much to answer for in terms of its foreign policy bias and willingness to tolerate situations such as in Israel and Palestine, which, although not easy to resolve, will not be resolved by a totally partisan approach.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak for those people who cannot speak for themselves.  I hope, through the exposure of this topic, people in Ireland, Christians and those who do not consider themselves Christians, might be moved to a deeper compassion and hospitality, where it is required.

As well as raising the issue among our people, all the groups present are feeding back directly to people on the ground who are encouraged, supported and helped by the knowledge that this is taking place in the Irish Parliament today.  The members must not undervalue such events, familiar as they and the issues may be.  They are tremendous and important acts of solidarity and support.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on an issue Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan raised that has not yet been examined, namely, the question of what is happening in our culture.  Rabbi Jonathan Sacks identified the issue as \"one of the crimes against humanity of our time\" and said he was \"appalled at the lack of protest it has evoked\" in many western Christian societies.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned political correctness.  Ms Smith mentioned the cultural freeze or squeeze on Christianity in many allegedly secular countries.<\/p><p>To be very positive about that, in terms of a challenge to us all, for far too long the issue of the right to religious freedom and conscience in a diverse, pluralist, modern democracy, such as our own, has been a second-class right and has never really been given the exposure or consideration it deserves and yet it is fundamental to the effective operation of a genuinely diverse society.  We could make a tremendous contribution, particularly the members, as political and public representatives, to lift the public debate into a more mature, calm, respectful, and considered debate about the calibration of that, even in our own society.<\/p><p> There are some Christians who would say there are signals emerging in our country, North and South, that they are being told not to take up a particular post or not to follow a particular line of business which might bring their conscience on certain matters into conflict with the services they will be expected to provide under our laws.  Without taking a position on that issue, it is a real issue.  It concerns the interface between religious freedom, secularity and what is a genuinely diverse pluralist society and how we calibrate these as fellow citizens in the interest of our common humanity and our shared interest in a peaceful, stable society and from that to the world because this issue will continue to grow in our global society and global institutions.<\/p><p> I disagree with the Vice Chairman when he suggests things have not changed.  They have changed.  We now have a humanitarian principle and concept in human rights law.  The fundamental values of Christianity are implicit in all those things.  Many would argue they stem from a Christian influence on the development of civilisation.  That is not the relevant point.  Pope Benedict XVI emeritus talked about the future of the world depending on a shared humanistic synthesis where we can all gather around common values.  There also needs to be an honest, constructive discussion about the right to be different and the space to be that in an appropriate way that is still consistent with the common good.  There will never be a Christian crusade again, other than in defence of the right to life but there will never be any proactive taking of anybody&rsquo;s life by Christians today.  I could not foresee that in any circumstance.  I hope our common humanity has progressed.  That is why we are here expressing concern about these issues.  I thank the committee and encourage it in its work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Fr. Timothy Bartlett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431507600,"counter":1716,"content":"<p>I congratulate Fr. Bartlett on his contribution.  I would love to see traditional Catholic and Christian people in this country mobilised to respond to what he has described.  We will respond, and we are responding.  There are three kinds of Catholics on this island, certainly in this State: Catholics by conviction, Catholics by culture and Catholics by compulsion.  The Catholics by compulsion are those people who feel they cannot get their children into the local school, or one of the seven Catholic schools in many of the towns around the country, unless they have that child baptised.  It is institutional hypocrisy, which does nobody any good.  Fr Bartlett and his colleagues control 90% of the primary schools in the Republic of Ireland in those towns where there is a demand &ndash; we have the patronage report &ndash; for diversity.  It is not easy to persuade in terms of which of those six or seven schools will be transferred or that how can that happen.  Progress on the pluralism and patronage report has been painfully slow at a time when our population numbers for primary school are growing and will not stop growing until 2028.<\/p> <p>  It requires leadership from the Irish Bishops' Conference.  Change is always difficult and there has to be buy-in but there has been painfully slow change in this area.  It would remove the necessity in many towns for people who feel the only way they can guarantee their child a place in a primary school is to go through the charade of having their child baptised.  That must be a terrible insult to committed Catholics or Christians.  That is what is happening.  If that change could happen, it would be a very clear recognition that here on this island, in this State, there is a respect for pluralism which naturally translates into those areas where Christians are not just being discriminated against but are being murdered for their very beliefs and for historic beliefs they held in those communities long before St. Patrick came to this island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#K00200","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1431507600,"counter":1717,"content":"<p>We can have a discussion on that issue at a later stage and I will be delighted to accommodate it.  Maybe Fr. Bartlett is right and maybe I am wrong.  I am not so sure civilisation has changed.  Man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man has not ceased or changed at all.  It continues as it was.  For example, the war in Rwanda was started by a zealot who had access to a propaganda outlet, a radio station.  He revved up the intolerance to such an extent that 500,000 people were killed and the killing was justified by the people who thought that way.  That is man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man.  In the western Balkans, similar violence happened in the past 20 years.<\/p><p>While civilisation has come a long way and we have achieved a great deal, we have put man on the moon and have a few other achievements worth mentioning, we still have much to learn about tolerance and the degree to which tolerant people are willing to be tolerant of each other and recognise each other&rsquo;s existence and their right to exist.

I thank Deputy Quinn for his specific recommendation that countries be held to account for the commitments they have signed up to.  That is a real step forward which this committee could take.  Church in Chains, with the other groups, would be very happy to supply a list of the commitments the countries have signed up to.  Taking on board what Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan said about individual cases, we could match commitments on the one hand with individual cases on the other hand and the committee could take that forward.  We would be happy to work with the committee secretariat on that list.<\/p> <p>  Several contributors spoke about taking this forward at EU and UN level.  I agree with them on that.  It strengthens my point that a call be made for an official within the human rights unit to be dedicated at least part-time to religious freedom.  That would mean that organisations, such as ours, could liaise with that individual and there could be continuity of focus.  Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan also mentioned strengthening the case if we work with other religious groups.  That is beginning.  I have very good relations with the Baha'i community in Ireland.  When it appeared before this committee to speak about the situation in Iran, it also mentioned the fact that Christians were persecuted.  I made sure in my contribution to mention its situation.  There is the beginning of something and I would be happy to work with others on that.

There are some connections.  Boko Haram has pledged allegiance to ISIS a number of times.  The media are playing an interesting part in the persecution there in that groups that previously would only have been known locally are now known internationally and able to feed off each other's success.  To that extent, the success of ISIS in the Middle East spurred on Boko Haram, al-Shabab and so on.  There are splinter groups in various countries.  We are not sure how powerful they are, but they are, at least verbally, connected with one another.  We are interested in sub-Saharan Africa as the growing epicentre of Islamic extremism, particularly in countries where it has not previously been an issue such as Kenya.  I visited that country about three years ago and was a little frustrated in going there because I did not think Christians faced many problems, but we are all aware now that they do and they have been growing over time.  We are aware of and concerned about this.  We are also concerned about the situation in Tanzania where there are sporadic attacks, the number of which has been increasing.  It is something on which to keep an eye.<br\/><br\/>Apostasy and blasphemy laws work on an international level.  The Vice Chairman has mentioned a resolution at the United Nations to combat hate speech.  It has been a real success, as it replaced a resolution on the defamation of religions, which effectively legitimised all apostasy and blasphemy laws internationally and which had been voted through continually at the United Nations.  There was a huge campaign a few years ago to get rid of it.  For the first time in a long time, it was not tabled in 2012, which was a major success, but it has not been defeated, which is a shame.  It has not been voted out, but it has not reared its head for a while.  I have heard different country representatives say that to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>at the United Nations on freedom of religion, one must work incredibly hard to stay still and not regress.  Ireland is already working to ensure a lack of international resolutions supporting apostasy and blasphemy laws and it would be great to see that work continue that.<br\/><br\/>Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights is very explicit in what it covers.  One of the things it covers is the freedom to choose or change one's religion or beliefs or not to hold a religion or beliefs at all.  That freedom is under constant attack in various parts of the international community and successive treaties on human rights; the right to choose and change religion is often dropped.  I do not think it made it into the<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>Commonwealth human rights charter, for instance, and there are other regional human rights charters in which freedom of religion is mentioned but the right to choose and change one's religion is not.  Maintaining the specific wording is something on which Ireland can definitely work and it would make a significant difference for those who decide to leave a religion or choose another one and follow their conscience.<br\/><br\/>It is great to see Senator Michael Mullins back.  He asked me to expand a little on the issues of denominational protectionism and organised corruption.  To do this, I will use two country examples.  We see denominational protectionism in Ethiopia.  The Ethiopian Orthodox Church has a great deal of control over society.  Members of other Christian denominations face harassment, intimidation and false imprisonment because of this.  When one talks about the persecution of Christians, it is awkward to mention that Christian groups do not always like each other, but it is something of which we are aware and which needs to be addressed.  A good news story from Syria is that different denominations that have been suspicious of each other for a long time are increasingly working together and realising we are all one in Christ.  That is very good news as far as we are concerned.  In Colombia we run an orphanage for children of Colombian pastors who dared to speak out against the guerilla organisations and lead young people who could have been caught up in violence to Christ and show them there was a different way of life.  For this they have often forfeited their lives.  That is what we mean by organised corruption.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Turner mentioned the asylum system and the fact that he had received a translator from the Iranian embassy.  In the United Kingdom we are working with the Home Office on the asylum procedure to make it more accessible for Christians who face persecution.  For instance, in one of the questions asked five years ago which, thankfully, is no longer asked the applicant was asked how they cooked a turkey at Christmas time as a means of proving they were a genuine Christian.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015051300002#L00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Zoe Smith"},{"type":"speech","time":1431507600,"counter":1720,"content":"<p>Translators are always available in this country.

I agree with the Deputy that it cannot go on forever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015051300002#C00100","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1431533400,"counter":1744,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1431533400,"counter":1745,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1431533400,"counter":1746,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1431533400,"counter":1747,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, Mr. Thomas Monks and Deputies Robert Dowds, Billy Kelleher and Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for their presence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015051300002#C00450","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1431533400,"counter":1748,"content":"<p>We deeply appreciate the fact that the committee made itself available at the end of a very long day to conclude Committee Stage of the legislation.

I remind members, witnesses and those in the public gallery to switch off their mobile phones as they interfere with the broadcasting of these proceedings.  Today, the committee has requested the attendance of officials from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to discuss its investigation into the safety, quality and standards of service provided by the HSE to patients in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  The HIQA report published last week examines patient safety and maternity services at Portlaoise.  One of the roles of this committee is to ensure accountability on the part of the Department of Health and associated bodies, including the HSE, and on that basis, the committee requested an early meeting with HIQA to discuss its findings and recommendations.  Committee members have discussed the report in private session and pending today's deliberations, it is fair to say that this is only the first step in the process of our committee dealing with this report.  I thank Mr. Quinn, Ms Dunnion and Mr. Whelan from HIQA for coming today.  I also wish to thank the families affected by this report for their tenacity, courage and bravery.  They are meeting the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, this afternoon to discuss the report.<\/p><p>The report raises a number of fundamental issues around governance, accountability, hospital standards and resources.  As I already implied, our discussion today will be followed by a further meeting with the HSE.  The committee decided in private session that, irrespective of what happens today, members need to hear from the HSE on this issue.  We will also set about hearing from the families affected by this report.  We hope that the recommendations of the report are implemented in full.  Again, I thank HIQA for facilitating our early request for a meeting.  Our key focus must be on the parents, families and children who had a negative experience with our health services and who raised issues of patient safety in maternity units.  Our collective aim should be to ensure that we improve our maternity services so that they are safe services in which we can all have confidence.<\/p><p>I welcome Mr. Phelim Quinn, chief executive of HIQA, Ms Mary Dunnion, acting director of regulations at HIQA, and Mr. Marty Whelan, head of communications and stakeholder engagement with HIQA.  Before we begin, we have received apologies from Deputies Ciara Conway and Catherine Byrne and Senator Imelda Henry.  I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I invite Mr. Quinn to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#B00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431523800,"counter":1757,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  On behalf of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, I thank the Joint Committee on Health and Children for giving me the opportunity to discuss our investigation into the safety, quality and standards of services provided by the Health Service Executive, HSE, to patients in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  As the Chairman noted, I am joined by Ms Mary Dunnion, director of regulation and by Mr. Marty Whelan, our head of communications and stakeholder engagement.  We welcome this opportunity to appear again before the joint committee and to engage with members.<\/p> <p>  Following a request in 2014 from the former Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, in accordance with section 9(2) of the Health Act 2007, HIQA has investigated the safety, quality and standards of services provided by the HSE to patients in Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  This is the seventh statutory investigation carried about by HIQA since 2007.  <\/p> <p>  On 30 January 2014, an RTE investigations unit \"Prime Time\" programme was broadcast about the tragic deaths of newborn babies in Portlaoise hospital and the subsequent management of patients and their families by the hospital and the HSE.  Following the broadcast, the then Minister of Health asked the chief medical officer of the Department of Health to conduct a preliminary assessment of perinatal deaths and related matters from 2006 up to that point in 2014 in the maternity services at Portlaoise hospital.  Following publication of the chief medical officer&rsquo;s report, the board of HIQA considered and agreed to a request from the then Minister for Health to conduct an independent investigation into the services provided by the HSE at Portlaoise hospital.  <\/p> <p>  This statutory HIQA investigation has been carried out in line with the authority&rsquo;s published terms of reference and published guidance in order to make recommendations to improve the safety, quality and standards of services provided by the HSE.  Central to this investigation was the experience of a number of patients and families whose experience of care fell well below the standard expected in a modern acute hospital.  The assessment of these patients and families&rsquo; experience reflects their experience of care and its aftermath when they raised concerns at local, regional and national levels of the HSE.  I would like to acknowledge the courage and fortitude of the many patients and families who made contact with the authority to outline their experience of care within Portlaoise hospital.  It should be acknowledged that their efforts, harnessed with the required actions of those charged with delivering services, should ensure a better experience for those availing of services at Portlaoise hospital in the future.<\/p><p>This investigation examined the quality and safety of maternity and general clinical services at the hospital, and the Health Service Executive governance arrangements in place nationally, regionally and locally.<\/p><p> In his report, the chief medical officer said two HSE reviews into breast cancer misdiagnosis cases at Portlaoise hospital, published in 2008, should have provided a very strong case for external oversight and support to Portlaoise hospital as it dealt with those issues.  HIQA strongly reiterates this view.  Throughout this investigation it has found examples of weak oversight and variable levels of action by the HSE at national, regional and local level in relation to risks to patients at Portlaoise hospital.   Two previous HIQA reports relevant to Portlaoise hospital were the investigation reports into Ennis and Mallow hospitals, published in 2009 and 2011.  Both reports stress that patients with complex needs should be directed to hospitals with the necessary staffing, competence, infrastructure and equipment for safe and effective care.  Our latest investigation found that the HSE &ndash; as the provider of health care services &ndash; failed to take decisive action on defining the role of Portlaoise hospital, its model of care and the nature and profile of services that could be safely delivered on the site in the context of the findings of previous investigations. <\/p><p> As the committee is aware, this investigation was initiated as a result of very negative experiences of a small but significant number of patients and their families at Portlaoise hospital.  When the investigation started, HIQA was contacted by or received information on 83 patients and their families, most of whom had used the maternity services at Portlaoise hospital.  While the purpose of the investigation was not to undertake a detailed examination of individual patients&rsquo; care, in line with the investigation work of other regulatory bodies internationally, hearing the experiences of service users is an invaluable part of this process.  The experiences of these individuals and families helped to inform the investigation and gave a range of personal perspectives on the quality of care received and helped in shaping the findings and recommendations in the report. <\/p><p> Parents who spoke with the investigation team gave examples of poor communication with hospital staff where they were not afforded adequate explanations following an adverse event including the death of a baby or regarding a clinical condition.  Some parents said they felt they were not entitled to an explanation.  Others said that medical jargon left them feeling intimidated and unclear about what was being said.  Parents found that such a lack of openness in providing information and explanations compounded their feelings of fear and grief.  Parents also described significant delays in the time it took the HSE at all levels to respond to their requests for information and explanations following the adverse events.  HIQA is aware that delays in investigation of adverse events have occurred elsewhere in the health services.  The current HSE review process is often protracted and leaves families with unanswered questions pending completion of a final report, thereby increasing their upset and trauma.  As a result of these delays safety issues may potentially remain unidentified and unresolved for lengthy periods of time. <\/p><p> There were many reasons the HSE should have maintained very close oversight of the quality and safety of services at Portlaoise hospital.  These reasons included local and national HSE inquiries and clinical reviews into patient-safety incidents, significant service failures, statutory investigations of hospital services, and resultant publication of findings and recommendations.  However, there was no evidence that the HSE nationally was proactively exercising meaningful oversight of the hospital and the inherent risks identified there. <\/p><p> Another concern of the investigation team was that for seven years prior to the chief medical officer&rsquo;s report, the State Claims Agency through its clinical indemnity scheme knew of actual or potential risks in the maternity services at Portlaoise hospital.  HIQA recognises that the State Claims Agency does not have statutory powers by which it can compel healthcare institutions, including the HSE, to engage with it or to implement any recommendations which it may make.  However, we are concerned that the interaction between the State Claims Agency and the HSE on the sharing and use of available information did not result in effective mitigation of the identified risks. <\/p><p> The investigation team found that Portlaoise hospital continues to provide undifferentiated, namely, in all manner of conditions, emergency services 24 hours a day seven days per week.  It also provides undifferentiated surgical services where there is a low number of complex surgical cases going through the hospital.  The investigation team found that Portlaoise hospital had major deficiencies in corporate and clinical governance arrangements.  Although described as a model-3 hospital by senior HSE and local hospital staff, the investigation team found that the hospital was not governed, resourced or equipped to safely deliver this level of clinical services.  In 2012 and 2013 HSE itself specifically identified clinical risks associated with surgery, emergency medicine and acute medicine and said that surgical services at the hospital should cease. <\/p><p> Following interaction with HIQA about concerns for the governance at Portlaoise hospital, in 2013 the then HSE regional management altered the local management arrangements. The purpose of the alterations was to increase the interaction between regional and local management structures and bring decision-making powers onto the hospital site.  However, despite overwhelming evidence to suggest that the local management team at Portlaoise hospital was struggling to deliver the service, there is no evidence to show that the regional HSE managers took effective control of the situation at that time.  The senior hospital management committee was responsible for providing safe, effective services through leading and directing performance of the hospital.  The minutes of these meetings show little evidence that the committee was effective in identifying or implementing actions to address quality and safety issues within the hospital. <\/p><p> HIQA also concluded there were significant ongoing problems with workforce planning in Portlaoise hospital.  The absence of a clear vision for the hospital, coupled with the national imperative to reduce the staff headcount, ensured that planning was focused on counting staff rather than on the type of services the hospital should be delivering and the competencies needed to deliver them.<\/p><p> Risk management structures in the hospital were poorly developed.  Incident management at Portlaoise hospital was largely reactive and focused on recording incidents.  It was evident that the deficiencies in risk management processes in the hospital contributed to the poor experiences described by patients who met the investigation team.  As part of the investigation, HIQA assessed the prevailing patient safety culture in Portlaoise hospital using the safety culture index.  The results, used to inform our lines of inquiry of this investigation, suggested that Portlaoise hospital did not have a strong patient safety culture. <\/p><p> Increasing pressure on maternity services at Portlaoise hospital was highlighted as far back as 2004.  Deficiencies in midwifery staffing had been identified in a review carried out by the hospital in 2006.  These issues were not substantially addressed until 2014, following publication of the chief medical officer&rsquo;s report.  At the time of writing this report, an interim management team including a general manager, risk manager and director of midwifery had been put in place and were effecting positive change.  However, a senior obstetric lead had not been appointed to the maternity department to provide independent senior experienced, obstetric, clinical leadership - despite a direct request by HIQA to the director general of the HSE in September 2014 to do so following our concerns about the absence of adequate clinical leadership in the maternity unit and failure to progress a clinical network with the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital in Dublin. <\/p><p> Since the chief medical officer&rsquo;s report, midwifery staffing levels have significantly improved with the appointment of senior clinical midwifery managers, shift leaders, a bereavement specialist, a clinical skills co-ordinator and a clinical midwife specialist.  One additional consultant obstetrician has also been appointed.<\/p><p> Clinical experts on HIQA's investigation team identified a lack of senior clinical leadership and supporting formal clinical network arrangements &ndash; and current staffing arrangements for non-consultant hospital doctors &ndash; as a serious concern and risk for the sustainability of the maternity services at Portlaoise hospital.<\/p><p>These experts considered it vital that a system of rotation be designed between Portlaoise hospital and a large maternity hospital such as the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital.  Setting up a clinical network incorporating Portlaoise hospital and the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital is an essential first step in developing such a system of rotation.<\/p><p> Poor standards of multidisciplinary communication were highlighted by a number of people who met the authority.  These concerns were reported as far back as 2007 and had not been addressed.  Additionally, concerns over the governance arrangements for ultrasound scanning services and effective clinical audit at Portlaoise hospital were identified during our investigation.  Specific issues relating to service capacity, staff competency and clinical oversight of the ultrasound service were acknowledged by the hospital management team.<\/p><p> Portlaoise hospital provides a 24-7 emergency service for adult and paediatric patients with any degree of seriousness or complexity of illness or injury who present at the hospital.  The clinical governance arrangements in the hospital&rsquo;s emergency department were unsatisfactory and over-complicated.  Despite the fact that both the HSE&rsquo;s emergency medicine programme and acute medicines programme had previously identified concerns over these arrangements, the inherent risks remained unaddressed.<\/p><p> The HSE&rsquo;s own emergency medicine programme considered that the emergency department was not appropriately resourced to provide a 24-7 model of emergency care.  Also, the HSE&rsquo;s unpublished performance review in 2014 concluded that a 24-7 emergency care service at Portlaoise hospital was not clinically sustainable.  At the time of this investigation, the clinical profile of emergency department patients is still not being actively assessed to inform the type of service that is required to best meet the needs of those patients presenting to it.<\/p><p> The overall volume of critical care activity within the intensive care unit of the hospital was low.  The intensive care unit does not meet the minimum requirements for critical care, patient confidentiality and privacy, and it was not fit for purpose.  Senior clinical staff were aware of the limitations of the care that could be safely provided there.  They confirmed that if necessary, patients are transferred to a more appropriately resourced hospital.<\/p><p> A report by the HSE in 2014 recommended that critical care services in the hospital should be discontinued.  In light of this HSE review and the concerns of senior local clinicians, the investigation team is not assured that critical care services are sustainable in Portlaoise hospital.  The surgical services at Portlaoise hospital operate a 24-7 emergency service basis, catering for all degrees of surgical illness or injury arriving at the hospital.  Most hospital inpatients using the surgical services at Portlaoise hospital were admitted through the emergency department.<\/p><p> Two recent HSE reviews of the surgical services at Portlaoise hospital both concluded that the hospital on its own was not structured to provide safe, acute and preplanned surgical care.  The investigation team found that low numbers of complex surgical procedures were being carried out at the hospital.  As previously reported by the authority, surgeons who do not have the opportunity to treat sufficient numbers of patients or carry out a sufficient volume of procedures run the risk of becoming de-skilled.  This potential risk has not been addressed at Portlaoise hospital.<\/p><p> The investigation team found that medical services at Portlaoise hospital required significant restructuring and resourcing in order to deliver a service aligned to the HSE&rsquo;s acute medicine programme.  Despite the recommendations of the HSE&rsquo;s acute medicine programme, the hospital did not have a medical assessment unit or a bed management structure.  This investigation also found that the medical team was under-resourced, with local clinicians reporting that two extra medical consultants were needed for care of the elderly and endocrinology.  These appointments would also help release the hospital&rsquo;s clinical director from general medical duties for 25 hours each week in order to increase time for the functions of the clinical director role.<\/p><p> The diagnostic imaging service at Portlaoise hospital is significantly under-resourced with a lack of resources preventing the development of strong clinical governance arrangements to ensure the quality and safety of service delivery.  At the time of reporting, the diagnostic imaging service is overly reliant on one clinician.  Therefore, this model of care is clearly not sustainable.<\/p><p> The findings of this investigation reflect an ongoing failure on the part of the HSE to evaluate the services provided at Portlaoise hospital against the volume of patients attending the hospital and the profile of their clinical needs, and the findings of aligned risks and recommendations identified in previous local and national reviews and investigations conducted by this authority and the HSE.  The findings of this HIQA investigation highlight again issues and recommendations that have been identified on a number of occasions previously in both internal HSE reviews and independent HIQA investigations.<\/p><p> This investigation concludes that Portlaoise hospital was allowed to struggle on despite a number of substantial governance and management issues over the quality and safety of services.  Sufficient action was not taken by the HSE at a national, regional or local level to address these issues.<\/p><p> The experiences outlined by patients and families during the course of this investigation were disturbing when viewed within the context of the delivery of a modern health service.  These experiences highlight significant deficiencies in the delivery of person-centred care at Portlaoise hospital.  Poor experiences by patients and families were compounded by ineffective governance arrangements at all levels of the HSE with the result that the patient&rsquo;s voice was ignored, and valuable insights and learning were lost.<\/p><p> The HSE must now address the risks and deficiencies identified within this report in order to improve the quality, safety and experience of patient care in Portlaoise hospital.  It must also ensure that where similar risks and deficiencies exist in other hospitals, these are addressed as a matter of urgency.  The HSE governance arrangements to support the implementation of the national recommendations contained in this investigation must be clear, with a named accountable person or persons with overall delegated responsibility for implementation.  The implementation plans should include clear timelines and identified individuals with responsibility for each recommendation and each associated action.<\/p><p> A national maternity strategy must be developed and published as a matter of urgency.  We welcome the establishment of a steering group to advise on the development of such a national maternity strategy.  The authority acknowledges the work that has been done to date to incorporate the maternity services at Portlaoise hospital into a clinical network with the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital and welcomes the recent signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital and the Dublin-Midlands hospitals group of the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p> In light of the findings of this investigation, the authority has made eight recommendations which must be implemented to ensure that risks and deficiencies identified are addressed at both local and national level to ensure the delivery of safe and consistent patient care.  Among the recommendations in our report is the creation of an independent patient advocacy service to ensure that patients&rsquo; reported experiences are recorded, listened to and learned from, and reports published.  Lessons learned should be shared between hospitals within the new hospital groups, between hospital groups and nationally throughout the wider health system.  I hope to address some of our recommendations in more detail in reply to questions from committee members.  It is imperative that these recommendations are fully implemented and that a clear timeline is set out and followed up, with named individuals taking responsibility for the implementation of each recommendation.<\/p><p> Given the significant system-wide recommendations in the report, it will be vital that there is the necessary political commitment to their managed implementation in order to drive further improvements in the quality, safety and governance in our health services.  The authority therefore recommends that the Minister for Health should establish, as a priority, an oversight committee in the Department of Health to ensure the implementation of the recommendations in this HIQA investigation report.<\/p><p> I thank the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for inviting us here today.

When speaking about this report, we must be mindful that it came about because of the very tragic circumstances that arose for at least five families involving the maternity services in Portlaoise and elsewhere.<\/p><p>In 2008 there was an investigation carried out into the misdiagnosis of breast cancer in Portlaoise.  Is it within HIQA's remit to monitor, visit, or assess a hospital?  Were alarm bells ever raised in the period prior to the Minister's request for HIQA to carry out an investigation under the 2007 Act?  The 2008 investigation showed difficulties in governance and patient safety.  Will Mr. Quinn clarify whether or not HIQA engaged with the hospital in these areas?<\/p><p> The report is damning.  We cannot assess it any other way.  It calls into question accountability and commitments in terms of basic governance and patient safety, not only in the context of maternity services but right across the spectrum of services provided at the hospital.  Mr. Quinn has said that there must be a designated, named person in the hospital who is responsible for patient safety.  Did Mr. Quinn find in his investigation that there was a complete absence of accountability in terms of people's roles and responsibilities?<\/p><p>From reading the report and the executive summary, it seems that there was very little emphasis put on patient safety at local, regional and national level, right throughout the HSE.  Red flags were being raised on a continual basis and some people would say that there were alarm bells ringing everywhere, yet there seemed to be inactivity or an inability to understand the seriousness of the situation.  Was the weakness at local or national level or was there just weakness across the whole system right to the top in terms of understanding the deficiencies in the hospital itself?  Will Mr. Quinn provide clarity on that?<\/p><p> The chief medical officer's report was also damning.  It spurred some activity in terms of addressing some of the deficiencies but, again, this seemed to be quite lethargic, in spite of the recommendations made in the report and the findings made before HIQA began its investigation under the 2007 Act.  It seems that there is quite a distance to go, even on the recommendations that were outlined in that report, which was published over a year ago.  There is still no lead clinical obstetrician or proper safety governance in place.  At present, HIQA cannot say with 100% certainty that all services are being operated in a safe manner in Portlaoise.  That is clearly something that gives rise to concern.  I do not want to fuel fear or concern but I believe that the public have an entitlement to believe that when they engage with the HSE, as its stated mission is to provide safe care, that they receive this, at the very least.  That does not seem to have been part of the culture at Portlaoise.   Serious deficiencies were exposed in 2008 in the breast cancer misdiagnosis but there were concerns from as early as 2004 about the lack of resources in the maternity and midwifery services, and about the lack of consultant leads, not only in maternity but throughout the hospital.<\/p><p> Mr. Quinn has referred to the State Claims Agency, and the report indicates that it corresponded with the HSE.  Did it express concerns about the number of claims coming from the hospital?  Were those claims in relation to maternity services or were there other claims coming from Portlaoise hospital?  In that correspondence, does the State Claims Agency outline that something should be done to address the number of claims?  Was the hospital informed that it was out of kilter with other hospitals of similar size?<\/p><p> I have asked a lot of questions but there is a lot in this report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#D00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431523800,"counter":1763,"content":"<p>Will the Deputy please conclude?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#E00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1431523800,"counter":1764,"content":"<p>Have I been speaking for five minutes already?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#E00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1431523800,"counter":1765,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#E00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1431523800,"counter":1766,"content":"<p>Neither governance nor clinical and general resources were in place in Portlaoise even though it was regarded as a level 3 hospital.  Mr. Quinn referred to this in his statement today and it is highlighted in the executive summary.  What is the motivation to pretend that a service exists when, in effect, that service cannot be delivered?  Was the HSE in some way trying to obligate itself to provide a service that it clearly could not provide or was not willing to resource?  I find it extraordinary that the hospital is identified as a level 3 hospital.  In the emergency department, for example, the number of emergency consultants was exceptionally limited, and the broader hospital just simply was not resourced to deliver a level 3 service.  Was there any analysis carried out as to why the HSE said it was providing a service that it simply could not provide, or was unwilling to, or could not, resource?<\/p> <p>  We have had the Tania McCabe case in Our Lady of Lourdes and the Savita Halappanavar case in Galway and there have been investigations in Ennis and Mallow.  There seems to be an inability on the part of the HSE to cross-fertilise best practice throughout its organisation.  Has HIQA looked at that?  Why is that the case?  If something is deficient in a hospital, one would assume that, at national level, other hospitals would be assessed to see whether those deficiencies exist and what practices can be put in place.  Why does that not happen?<\/p> <p>  Given the significant system-wide recommendations in the report, it is vital that there is necessary political commitment to manage their implementation in order to drive further improvements in quality, safety and governance of care provided in our health system.  That is an indication that sometimes when hospital services are being withdrawn or downgraded there is political involvement and very often the consequences for patients and the need to ensure that there is quality and safety provided in hospitals are secondary considerations.  Will Mr. Quinn elaborate on what he means by political commitment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#E00500","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1431523800,"counter":1767,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Quinn for his hard work on the report and for his presentation today.  I mean no intrinsic disrespect when I say that the core recommendations seem to boil down to one group of administrative oversight, investigative staff in HIQA, commenting on the generally inadequate administrative responses of another group of administrative staff, that is, the HSE and the staff on the ground in Portlaoise hospital.  On the role of clinicians, the lack of a clinical lead is highlighted - again, the lack of a clinician who is identified as having an essentially administrative role in the running of the department.  Mr. Quinn will be aware of the data presented some time ago by Dr. Michael Turner, who is the HSE lead in obstetrical care, which showed that Ireland is at the very bottom of a league table of obstetricians per head of population.  The question has to be asked, how many of the problems that arose in Portlaoise or other hospitals would have arisen if an adequate cohort of fully trained specialists were available to provide the care?<\/p> <p>  Does the HIQA report provide a figure for how many obstetricians occupy posts in Ireland?  How many posts are empty?  How many of the occupied posts are occupied by locums?  What is the average duration of a locum's appointment in the system?  <\/p> <p>  It is bad enough if there are far too few senior specialists in an institution - all kinds of pathologies happen as a result of that.  One of them is that far too much work is devolved to trainee doctors.  The report refers repeatedly to situations with non-consultant hospital doctors.  With respect, unless HIQA is taking on a role in medical education, the presence or absence of one or a million junior doctors in any hospital should be a subject of monumental irrelevance, because they are trainees.  They are there to train.  They are not there as service providers.  The fact that we depend on them so heavily, not just in this hospital but in much larger hospitals, for the provision of routine health care service, is an indictment of the way that we have structured our hospital system.  I know the answer to some of these questions.  We have a very small number of obstetricians and we have an unusually large number of locums.  I worked in two fine medical institutions in the United States and one in London before I came back to Ireland.  There were never locums because the units were sufficiently large, muscular and well-staffed that they could absorb somebody going sick, having a family crisis, or having paternity or maternity leave without the necessity of bringing in locums.  That is the way a good well-run system should be.<\/p><p>There should be enough people in place to provide cover for each other and continuity of care.  That is no disrespect to the individual locums, many of whom are fine people who are good solid medical graduates and well trained.  However, the very act of being temporary in a job means there will be an issue with the continuity of care that is delivered.<\/p><p> A number of other questions arise.  Has the authority made any recommendation that there is or is not a special care baby unit in Portlaoise hospital?  How many neonatologists are there in Ireland, how many are in Portlaoise hospital and how many are in that hospital group?  Another question must be asked of all of us in this room, and obviously this is a fight in which I have had a dog recently.  Would anybody want their child to be born in a hospital where a neonatal intensive care unit or a neonatologist specialist paediatrician was not available should they be necessary or unless one had the certainty that there was a well trained, experienced obstetrician available should something unforeseen and catastrophic occur in the course of a pregnancy?<\/p><p> I probably sound a little subdued because, at this stage, my morale is shot on this issue.  I returned to this country 22 years ago and 21 years ago, after a respectable period of silence, I started pointing out the incredible deficiencies I saw not only in the cancer service but also in the health service in general.  I see little effort or little attention being paid to fixing the fundamental problems we have.  With no disrespect to the witnesses, there is a heavy emphasis in these recommendations on administrative efficiencies, on the need to appoint more people to essentially bureaucratic and administrative positions and on the need to set up new agencies.  These are very subsidiary priorities in a system which is so starved of specialists that catastrophes such as those we have seen will continue to occur while we are talking about it.  Good Lord, was there ever a country that found itself so much in the glare of the international spotlight for deficiencies in its obstetric services as this country - I will not personalise it - after the very well-known tragedy that occurred several years ago?  To think that we are still scratching our heads and trying to work out how to get the administration in place is very depressing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#E00600","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431523800,"counter":1769,"content":"<p>In the absence of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I will call the following members in turn, Deputy Regina Doherty, Senator Colm Burke and Deputy Mitchell O'Connor.

I thank the witnesses for attending the meeting.  Regarding the report issued on Friday, how does it differ from the original draft report the authority had issued to the Minister and the HSE?  Did it differ substantially arising from the threat of legal action?<\/p> <p>  Second, the first recommendation is probably the weightiest, notwithstanding all of the other deficiencies.  The authority talks about immediately setting up, between now and next May, an independent patient advocacy service.  How does the authority understand the word \"independent\"?  How does it envisage it running?  The authority has challenged the HSE to establish it.  That is a contradiction in terms in my book.  This relates back to the authority's investigation team.  The response of the patient safety director and his team in the HSE in the last two years to doing their job with regard to patient advocacy has been to fund and finance the establishment of Patients for Patient Safety Ireland under the leadership of a lady called Margaret Murphy who, coincidentally, was on the authority's investigation team.  How was the authority's investigation team selected?  I assume the authority did not find any conflict of interest because Ms Murphy is on the team but did any conflict arise before she was part of the independent investigation team, since she is on the HSE's payroll?<\/p> <p>  When the authority went to Portlaoise was it made aware of the HSE's internal patient safety culture survey which it conducted in Portlaoise last year?  If the authority was, what were the findings of it?  What were the recommendations of the HSE's internal review and were any of them implemented?  Has the authority any thoughts as to why the HSE in Portlaoise is not using the clinical indemnity STARS database to log adverse events and report incidents, as most other clinical practices do with regard to best practice in collating data?  Does the authority think it odd that, aside from Portlaoise, the HSE's patient safety agency and directorate has not conducted even one independent survey of the patients' experience, views or anything else, other than establishing Patients for Patient Safety Ireland, in over two years?  In fact, as far back as 2013 it actively starved the people who were responsible, on behalf of the State, for providing independent patient surveys on patient experience and data collection, because it could not control and manipulate the data, as there was no direct connection for it.<\/p> <p>  I have two further questions, Chairman.  Two matters scream for attention but they are not highlighted in the authority's report, although they were highlighted in the CMO's report.  The CMO's report highlighted the fact that the 24-7 emergency services being operated in Portlaoise only have a consultant on site four days per week for six hours.  What happens in the accident and emergency department for the other three days and for all of the hours there is no consultant present?  When the authority went to Portlaoise to carry out its investigation why did it not immediately recommend that the 24 hour service in Portlaoise should be closed or properly manned with immediate effect?  Perhaps the personnel were put in place between the CMO's report being issued in February and the authority issuing its report.<\/p> <p>  As a result of the CMO's report an additional 16 midwives were added to the staff, which is extremely welcome given the low morale and the outcomes in Portlaoise in recent years.  There are 19 places in this country where one can have a baby.  What is the proportional ratio of midwives to births in each of the other 18 locations and do they come up to standard as to what should be in place?  If not, what are we doing about it at national level?<\/p> <p>  Finally, a question was raised today in the Chamber.  There was a really tragic incident in Cavan yesterday.  There was a query regarding whether HIQA was asked-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#F00300","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1431523800,"counter":1771,"content":"<p>The issue of Cavan hospital is not relevant to our meeting today.

I am at a disadvantage as I do not know what questions my colleagues asked so if there is repetition, I apologise.<\/p> <p>  What changes, if any, did the authority make to the original draft report before the publication last Friday?  Were any changes made or did the authority hold to the draft that was first advised to the HSE?  Has the authority met with the families concerned since the issuance of the threat of legal action to prevent publication of the report and, if not, will it with regard to the Portlaoise cases?  I understand the Minister is meeting them today.  Has the authority done so, or will it, in the context of the publication of the report?<\/p> <p>  The first recommendation refers to an independent patient advocacy service.  One of the deficiencies in the relationship between HIQA and the HSE is that there is a serious lack of compellability to act on findings and recommendations contained in reports.  I am unclear about the status of HIQA's relationship with the HSE in respect of the publication of reports and the recommendations contained therein.  A recommendation, by its nature, is not necessarily an insistence that one must do something.  Will the witness expand on that?<\/p> <p>  I have read what the authority says in the first recommendation regarding an independent patient advocacy service where patients' reported experiences are recorded, listened to and learned from.  That is far too weak; it is not strong enough.  We need something much stronger.  The recommendations contained in the report are not made lightly.  They are a professional assessment of deficiencies and needs within our health system, be it acute hospital settings or other settings across the health care sector.<\/p><p> I believe we need a patient safety authority, of which HIQA would be a significant component.  I understand this was part of the programme for Government agreed in 2011, but that it has been parked in the period since.  A patient safety authority would not only give teeth but would give certainty to those of us dependent on the health services, public health services in particular, that the required steps will be implemented.  This must happen and I am anxious to hear Mr. Quinn's views on that.  The second recommendation is that the Department of Health should ensure implementation of the recommendations of HIQA.  This echoes the point I made already.<\/p><p>On the fifth recommendation, I welcome the proposition of the appointment of a director of midwifery in all maternity units across the State that do not have such a director.  I note the sixth recommendation recommends systems to support a competent and appropriately resourced workforce.  These two recommendations aside, there is no other mention of staffing or of nursing midwife shortages in any of HIQA's recommendations.  Despite no explicit reference to overworked and under-resourced staffing at the Portlaoise maternity unit, and by extension across all maternity units, does HIQA accept there is a critical shortage of properly qualified full-time staff across all obstetric maternity settings?  Does it accept this is a serious element in regard to the tragic outcomes at Portlaoise, at Cavan and other hospital sites?<\/p><p> I do not intend to stray, but I have just come from a Topical Issue engagement with the Minister of State in the Department of Health on these matters.  It has been reported that the former Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, stated in an interview he gave in Cavan that he would request HIQA to look into the situation.  He suggested that priority be given to a review of the maternity services in Cavan General Hospital against the national standards, in tandem with the address of the Midland Regional Hospital maternity unit at Portlaoise.  However, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has just advised me that this was a \"request\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#F00700","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431523800,"counter":1776,"content":"<p>We will have an opportunity at another forum to deal with the issue of Cavan hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#G00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1431523800,"counter":1777,"content":"<p>I am referring to it in the context of the Portlaoise report because that was what was suggested.

I will give a brief oversight of some of its involvement and will then pass on to my colleague Ms Dunnion.  Following the 2008 activity, HIQA would have been in receipt of individual pieces of what we would call \"unsolicited information\" in respect of some risk issues within Portlaoise hospital.  Also, through the conduct of a governance review under our monitoring against the national standards for the prevention and control of health care associated infections, we had escalated a range of issues into the HSE nationally in regard to risk management arrangements within Portlaoise hospital.<\/p> <p>  It was as a result of the accumulation of that range of risk issues, that in 2014, as was in our business plan, we agreed to conduct a governance review within Portlaoise hospital.  That was simply because we had significant concerns accumulating about the hospital and felt there was a requirement for proactive engagement with it on that basis, under section 8 of the Act.

We had made a series of recommendations previously, both to the HSE and the Department.  In regard to our call for political commitment to the recommendations we make, this is linked to the questions put to us by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  We reported previously to this committee and in previous investigations that at times we have found the recommendations made by HIQA have not been implemented.  If we were to look at the range of recommendations across the seven investigations we have conducted, there are still significant deficits in the uptake and implementation of those recommendations.  When it comes to the \"compellability\" of those recommendations, the current legislation on our monitoring and investigation function does not provide us with \"compellability\".  However, if the plans in regard to health care licensing come to fruition, they would provide some form of enforcement framework that would be available to us.<\/p> <p>  I will now pass over to my colleague to respond to a number of Deputy Kelleher's questions on accountability and the CMO report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431523800,"counter":1785,"content":"<p>Most of the CMO report was concerned with national recommendations, many of which would have been aligned with the maternity strategy and would have been identified by the authority as far back as 2013.<\/p><p>In the context of the recommendations in the CMO's report, some changes were made in the maternity hospital and benefits were noted.  Let me give an example.  One recommendation the CMO made was to have an interim management team for the maternity service.  He identified significant deficits in the governance arrangements.  What was disappointing for the investigation team was that, while that happened in the maternity service, the same governance arrangements remained unchanged in the general hospital because the interim management team was specific to maternity services.  However, one could see the benefits of having an effective management team, a director of midwifery and a risk manager come on board in the maternity service.  They are reflected in the report.<\/p><p> The recommendations were taken on board but the one that was of considerable concern to us concerned the networking into a clinical network, as in the case of the Coombe hospital.  While we appreciated the difficulties that would arise in the context of a voluntary and statutory hospital and setting up those arrangements, we were significantly concerned about the lack of senior clinical leadership.  This was reinforced by the clinical expertise of two obstetricians on the investigation team.  We regard clinical leadership as an integral part of the important process of driving best practice, clinical supervision, clinical auditing and all the associated factors.  We were so concerned because there was not senior clinical leadership with that level of experience in Portlaoise.  The interfacing with the Coombe hospital had not happened.  We wrote to the director general because we were concerned about this.  Thankfully, at the latter end, four weeks before the publication of the report, the memorandum of understanding has been signed.  Although it has not been implemented yet, we are aware that there is senior clinical leadership from the Coombe on-site in Portlaoise hospital.  We very much welcome that development.

The result is that they have demonstrated to us an assurance - we have not been in Cavan because it will be part of the monitoring of the 19 hospital - that there is matching against compliance with the national standards; their status of implementation of the recommendations of the CMO report; named accountability for implementation of those recommendations; and the timeframes in which they are to be implemented.

Mr. Quinn referred in his report to the request for additional staff.  To whom were those requests made?  Mr. Quinn stated he received correspondence about it.  Was there any increase in the number of staff in that time?  I refer to nursing staff, medical staff and junior hospital doctors.   What levels of increases were provided over that period and how was it responded to?<\/p> <p>  There is very much a focus on doctors and nurses, but one of my findings over the past 12 months is the number of administrative staff within the HSE who have ended up in jobs without ever having a job interview.  Have we identified deficiencies in management across the board in this matter and is this one of the consequences of that process where staff end up in jobs without every going for a job interview?  We will not promote a nurse up along the line without her going through a job interview, and we will not do it in the case of doctors, but are we doing so in the case of management?  Has it arisen in reports HIQA has produced that there are serious deficiencies regarding the ability of management to make a judgment call and react to the needs of the staff who work on the front line, namely, the nursing and medical staff?<\/p> <p>  Recommendation 5 of the report is that the HSE \"should ensure the appointment of a director of midwifery\" in all the 19 units that do not have one.  Has Mr. Quinn identified the number of units that do not have a director at this stage and have we set a timeline for them being appointed?<\/p><p>This issue needs to be examined. <\/p><p> The report found no evidence that the Health Service Executive nationally was proactively exercising meaningful oversight of the hospital.  Who in the HSE is responsible at national level?  One of the problems with it is the difficulty in identifying those with responsibility.<\/p><p> The report notes a failure to flag an increase in the number of claims in a particular area and an apparent absence of communication between the State Claims Agency and the HSE.  Has HIQA recommended that the State Claims Agency address this issue at a senior level to ensure it will not happen again?<\/p><p> The third recommendation relates to the development of a national maternity services strategy.  A report produced in 2003 set out the number of medical staff to be employed in maternity services.  It recommended, for example, that the number of medical consultants in maternity services be increased to 190.  The current figure is 104 whole-time equivalents.  <\/p><p> None of the report's recommendations has been implemented.  HIQA has produced another report.  Will it also languish on a shelf?

For the purposes of clarity, can we be absolutely certain that no substantial change has been made to the report?  Is documentation available showing what changes were made?<\/p> <p>  The background to this issue is a significant reduction in funding and staffing in the health service in recent years.  The health budget has been reduced by approximately &euro;4 billion, while staff numbers have declined by approximately 12,000 as a result of the moratorium on recruitment.  HIQA's report states the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, did not have the proper governance procedures, resources or equipment in place to operate at this level.  The budgets of many other hospitals have been reduced by up to 25%.  Is there a link between recent budget cuts and the events that occurred in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise?<\/p> <p>  The report is shocking and in reading it one feels all sorts of emotion, from sadness and disappointment to frustration and anger.  Failure and dysfunction occurred at many levels.  The report begs the question as to whether the Health Service Executive is fit for purpose and capable of running a health service properly.  Perhaps the delegates might a view on that issue.  <\/p> <p>  Has the post of director of midwifery services been introduced in the other 19 maternity units?<\/p> <p>  The first recommendation relates to the establishment of an independent patient advocacy body.  I fundamentally agree with Deputy Regina Doherty on this issue.  How does one define \"independent\" in this regard?  In recent years I have encountered cases where it transpired that independent patient advocates were fully funded by the HSE and certainly could not be described as independent.  This scenario must not be repeated.  If there is an independent patient advocacy organisation, it must be truly independent and not be linked in any way with the HSE.  <\/p> <p>  On the recommendation for a national maternity strategy, is HIQA involved in discussions on this matter and does it have a preferred outcome?<\/p> <p>  I understand from the comments of the delegates that the recommendations made in this and previous HIQA reports cannot be enforced by HIQA or any other body.

To echo the sentiments of previous speakers, one almost experiences a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>when reading the report because much of it repeats what we have heard previously.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to have any confidence that the recommendations made in the report will ever be implemented, although we could all be pleasantly surprised.<\/p><p>On the role of the Health Service Executive's internal national incident management team, why did this entity not take any action?  It was fully aware of developments, had expressed a degree of concern and examined details of infant deaths in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, in 2012?  Why was no action taken?  Is this unit or however it describes itself fit for purpose?  There are definitely question marks hanging over it. <\/p><p>I have been raising the issue of perinatal mortality statistics for some time and note Senator Colm Burke did likewise in recent days.  The figures appear to be entirely unreliable and inaccurate.  The fact that reporting is voluntary means that clinicians and other hospital staff are not under any obligation to report infant mortality.  We often hear that Ireland has one of the best maternity services in the world.  I find this difficult to believe when it is so patently obvious that the statistics are not accurate because certain baby deaths are not reported and there is no legal obligation to provide such information.  Should criminal sanctions be introduced for individuals and hospitals which do not report infant deaths? <\/p><p>What are the delegates' views on the possibility of introducing legislation on open disclosure?  I understand a scheme of open disclosure has been piloted in the Health Service Executive.  Has HIQA, through its regulatory and monitoring functions, noted any sign of success where this practice has been piloted?  It certainly works in the United States and other countries and it would result in a much more transparent and accountable system here, one in which families would never again have to endure what families endured in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, which beggared belief.<\/p><p>I echo Senator Colm Burke's question regarding who at a national level in the HSE is accountable, or should be held accountable.   Who is responsible?  We hear mention of regional, local and national levels, but somebody somewhere is responsible at all these levels.  The question is: who is responsible?  Is it possible for people to see accountability for the litany of negligence and cover-ups?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#L00400","speaker":"1204","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431523800,"counter":1834,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to speak at the committee.  As a Laois person, I am sad that we are here again.  I thank all the parents for the perseverance they have shown over the period, as otherwise we would not be here.<\/p> <p>  I have a few straightforward questions which were referred to earlier.  Mr. Quinn said that he could not say the service in Portlaoise hospital was safe.  By what date does he expect to be able to say it is safe?  The Government said yesterday that it hopes to have some of the recommendations implemented by the end of the year, but 1,200 to 1,500 more babies will be born there in the meantime.  Where is the position for patients going into that hospital?  Surely HIQA cannot just ask it to draw up a timetable.  That is not adequate; HIQA should be setting the timetable.  <\/p> <p>  Second, the memorandum of understanding between the Coombe hospital and Portlaoise hospital is welcome, but will Mr. Quinn explain how that will integrate with the maternity unit and the rest of the Portlaoise hospital?  There is an impression that the maternity unit and general management at the hospital have been operating on parallel tracks.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Quinn comment on the physical resources and structure of the ward in Portlaoise hospital which resulted in a situation in which mothers in labour were in the same room as mothers who had just suffered the loss of a baby?  It is inhumane that this should have occurred.  One mother was grieving while another mother about to enter that ward was afraid that what happened to that mother would happen to her next.  I am not a female, but I know it would be horrific to be in that position.  Perhaps the physical resources of the hospital were unsuitable.   <\/p> <p>  The State Claims Agency has &euro;1 billion provided in its annual accounts primarily for obstetric claims.  Mr. Quinn will be aware of that.  Up to &euro;1 billion is provided, and that amount is contained in its published figures.  When HSE delegates appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and we ask them about medical negligence, they tend to say that the State Claims Agency manages it and the agency sends the HSE the bill, which could be &euro;60 million or &euro;90 million this year depending on the outcome and the amount of time spent in court.  They say it has nothing to do with the HSE and that it just pays the bill.  That procedure has divorced the HSE from direct concern for, and day-to-day management of, cases.  The HSE washes its hands of it the day the case goes to the agency, and the HSE sends a cheque every so often when it gets a bill.  That demarcation is harmful.  Lessons should have been learned.  Is Mr. Quinn satisfied that those in senior management in the HSE, who knew about these life-and-death issues, are probably still in their positions?  They should not be there; they should be on administrative leave today.  HIQA should have had that recommendation in its report.  Given that there are no adequate disciplinary procedures in place, that finding should have been recommended.<\/p> <p> This investigation happened as a result of a \"Prime Time\" programme.  Had those parents not gone to \"Prime Time,\" would Mr. Quinn be here today?  Where was HIQA's  proactive role in this?  Surely Mr. Quinn is not waiting for a Minister to telephone and ask him about a matter before he agrees that HIQA will carry out an investigation?  HIQA is in place to do that without being asked.  I am sorry to be a bit strong on Mr. Quinn in this respect, but he can understand the point.  I am not in any way criticising anything, but HIQA could have been a bit more proactive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#M00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1431523800,"counter":1835,"content":"<p>On the point regarding the State Claims Agency, the committee has concluded a report on medical indemnity.

I spoke earlier about some of the information we had received over a period, some of which was received from parents.  That was what prompted us to initiate a proactive assessment of the governance arrangements within Portlaoise hospital.  I am not saying that was the only indicator, but it was one of the indicators, and it certainly would potentially have led us to some of the conclusions we made in the investigation report.  However, that would have been under section 8 of the Act, because it would not have been a statutory investigation in terms of monitoring against the national standards.<\/p> <p>  With respect to proactiveness, I would say - this is not an excuse - that HIQA has been in existence for eight years.  It came into existence in 2007, and since then it has conducted seven statutory investigations.  The vast majority of HIQA's activities within the health care system in Ireland have been focused on investigation work.  Therefore, most of the resources of HIQA have had to be pulled into what is a reactive form of regulation within our health care system.  I came to HIQA two years ago as director of regulation, and one of the things we have tried to do is to initiate a more proactive programme of monitoring against standards, because we believe that not only will that elicit information from our health care system, but it has a better chance of driving improvement, as opposed to a situation in which we are continuously reacting to crises within our services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1431523800,"counter":1837,"content":"<p>Does a culture of being more proactive than reactive exist within the HSE?

However, I believe our obstetric colleagues within the investigation team believe there is a way to go here, because that memorandum of understanding enables clarity in relation to patient pathways.  There is the question about which pregnant women avail of services within Portlaoise hospital and which women presenting with a higher risk are referred on to obstetricians and midwives within the Coombe hospital.  Also, there is the question of learning across the two sides and the rotation of both obstetric staff and midwifery staff across the two sides to maintain competence within their particular disciplines.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fleming asked about the physical resources in Portlaoise hospital, and he asked a specific question about the physical environment and the experiences of those who had been bereaved.

It is good to know that controls have been put in place in Portlaoise hospital to provide that if a woman has that tragic event, a single room will be provided where she can be managed and cared for.  A bereavement counselling service has be put in place in the hospital which will help in that situation, but that facility and that service were not provided until those tragic events came to the fore.<\/p> <p>  We were asked whether Portlaoise hospital was safe.  I do not think anybody can say that any hospital is safe, because risk is inherent in all clinical services.  When we looked at maternity services we relied very much on our obstetric experts, and Professor Jimmy Walker was the main expert.  He would have said that the majority of patients going through the maternity services in Portlaoise hospital are safe because they are normal healthy ladies expecting a baby and delivering a baby, and that the concern arises where there are patients with risk.  As my colleague outlined, we need to be able to transfer that patient in the right time and manner to another hospital.  We see the memorandum of understanding, that network with the Coombe hospital, as being the essential determinant of that.<\/p><p>It will not get rid of all risks, as there is always risk in hospitals.  <\/p><p> In the context of critical service provision, by virtue of its layout, the intensive care unit is not conducive to providing a service to the level one would expect in 2015.  There is no confidentiality or privacy for people.  It is a poor facility.  The anaesthetists, who are primarily in charge of a ventilated patient, do excellent work.  In Portlaoise hospital they moved patients very quickly when they needed to do so, but the question is whether the service can continue in that way.  From the point of view of HIQA's investigation, the answer is no.  The infrastructure is not good and the clinical staff would identify that they need to get the pathways right.  The recommendation about having hospital groups is not about diminishing the role of any hospital but ensuring the pathway for patients is safe.  The same applies to surgical services.  There were just not enough major cases in Portlaoise hospital to ensure the surgeon remained competent.  It is not a matter of questioning his ability.  It is like anything else - the more often one does something, the better one becomes at it.  The hospital did not have a sufficient volume of cases.  It dealt with 6,000 surgical cases per year, but only 49 of these were major.  It is a tiny number of cases to ensure sustainable delivery of the service.  These were not the findings of the investigation team only; they were also the findings of the HSE which reviewed the service and made the same findings.  Therefore, in the context of accountability, the issues were known and it was a source of huge concern for our investigation team that they had remained unaddressed.  That was the position as we had found it and reported accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Dunnion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431523800,"counter":1843,"content":"<p>If a woman ends up in the intensive care unit of the hospital tonight, will she be looked after?

The recommendation is that, irrespective of whether it involves a hospital or a group of hospitals, it publicly state the types of service it has been equipped and resourced to provide and what it can safely deliver.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the numbers of staff available in the maternity unit, additional staff have been put in place.  This very action suggests staffing levels were inadequate.  However, when the investigation team looked at staffing levels in the hospital, it was unable to ascertain what were the actual staffing levels in the maternity service or the general service because it was given a global figure for the whole hospital.  We were not able to determine  what were the staffing levels in different areas.  More importantly, no one can tell us what the actual staffing levels in a maternity hospital should be.  That is why in 2013 we emphasised the need for a maternity strategy to begin to identify what the staffing levels should be because in the absence of such a strategy, it is speculative.  We know that the hospital was challenged to keep its staffing levels acceptable, as determined by it.  There were several reasons for this.  If a member of staff left, for example, it was almost impossible to obtain sanction to recruit.  If sanction was given, it was a protracted process and took ages to get someone new into the system.  As a consequence, the hospital was reliant on agency staff all of the time.  That raises issues because different people are reporting for work, they have to learn the ropes, be supervised and so forth.  There were resource issues at Portlaoise hospital which were not unidentified.  In fact, the hospital had been identifying them continuously at a local level and had escalated them at regional and national level.  They were then de-escalated regionally again.  There is a plethora of documentation which shows this to be the case.  All we know, to address the issues identified and make the maternity service safer, staffing numbers had to be increased.  This was done in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051300002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Dunnion"},{"type":"speech","time":1431523800,"counter":1847,"content":"<p>Ms Dunnion says there was a plethora of correspondence.

On a technical point, the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014, amends the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act of 2005 with the inclusion of three new offences and the definition of terrorist linked activities.  The 2005 Act is the parent Act with regard to terrorism.  <\/p> <p>  In this Bill, any transfer of data to another jurisdiction is governed by EU law and the terms of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, the text of which is set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill.  Paragraph 2 of Article 17 of the convention provides that parties will carry out their obligations in respect of international co-operation and criminal matters in conformity with any treaties or other agreements on mutual legal assistance that may exist between them.  In the absence of such treaties and agreements, parties will provide assistance to one another in accordance with domestic law.  <\/p> <p>  The legal advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is that the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act of 2008, as amended, apply in this case and no further provision is required in this Bill as proposed by the amendment.  The Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act provides the legal framework for the provision of assistance that applies to offences across the Statute Book and it is appropriate for all requests for assistance and transfers of data to be dealt with in the context of the mutual assistance framework, which is used all the time, rather than in individual legislative provision.  There are restrictions on providing the assistance contained in the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act and, in the context of international agreements concerning mutual assistance arrangements to which the State is a party, that is the framework in which business is done and decisions are taken.<\/p> <p>  Data protection legislation also provides a certain amount of checks and balances on data protection and transfers of data.  Requests for assistance and mutual assistance or the restrictions on it come under the mutual assistance legislation.  Data protection legislation also applies and, together, they provide a sufficiently robust regime to protect data transfers.  I will not accept the amendment.  The advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is that it is appropriate that any requests for the exchange of information or assistance are dealt with under the  Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act.

Due to the nature of the Bill, comprising entirely of amendments to existing legislation and providing for no new policy provisions, it had been substantially drafted in advance of submission to Government and is before the committee in draft Bill form, as opposed to the more usual heads of Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny.<br\/><br\/>The Bill provides for amendments to the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the Taxi Regulation Act 2013, the Road Traffic Act 1961, the Railway Safety Act 2005 and the State Airports Act 2004.  It is a short Bill comprising just seven sections, including one providing for the short title and collective citation, with one each for four of the five Acts being amended and two for amendments to the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.  I will give an overview of the main amendments being proposed, but I emphasise that the amendments proposed are technical amendments to existing legislation and do not involve any new regulatory policy.<br\/><br\/>Section 1<b><\/b>relates to the public transport infrastructure functions of the National Transport Authority, NTA.  The proposed amendments to the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 will ensure that the NTA can develop and deliver public transport infrastructure such as bus rapid transit, BRT, in the event that it is decided to proceed with such infrastructure.  The amendments are required to address certain issues identified by legal advisers to the NTA as potentially precluding the NTA from providing such projects.  The proposed amendment ensures that the NTA would have the necessary powers to deliver required public transport infrastructure but does not involve a commitment to the development of BRT.  No decision has yet been made with regard to any of the BRT projects proposed by the NTA.<br\/><br\/>In particular, the amendments in section 1 address a constraint in the existing legislation which creates a differentiation between public roads existing before the establishment date of the NTA and public roads which were developed after the NTA was established.  The advice of the Office of the Attorney General confirmed that a technical amendment would be required to the 2008 Act to address this differentiation and provide that the NTA would have equivalent <i>vires <\/i>to provide public transport infrastructure on public roads that were constructed either before or after the establishment date of the NTA.<br\/><br\/>Section 1 also provides for an amendment to section 44 of the DTA Act 2008 regarding the performance of a &quot;function&quot; by the NTA.  The amendment removes a doubt that has arisen over whether it adequately addresses the situation where only part of the function is required to be performed.  This means that a likely case of the NTA intending to undertake certain aspects of a function, while the other statutory party continues to carry out all of the remaining aspects, may not be permissible, or may carry the risk of a successful legal challenge.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Sections 2 and 3 provide for amendments to the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.  That Act was introduced primarily to give legal effect to recommendations of the Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011 relating to increased enforcement measures, including a demerit scheme to deal with recurrent breaches of small public service vehicle, SPSV, regulations; the issue of on-the-spot fines for an increased range of offences; and a proportionate system for mandatory disqualification from holding a licence on conviction for a serious criminal offence.  The 2013 Act also repealed and replaced the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.<br\/><br\/>The amendments in section 2<b><\/b>can be grouped into those which provide greater precision in the 2013 Act relating to certain provisions; provide more specific enabling powers under the 2013 Act for certain matters which the NTA may provide for in regulations; and relate to punctuation and textual corrections and refinement.  Some of the main amendments providing greater precision in the Act provide for the inclusion of a requirement that the licensing authority may only grant a licence to drive a small public service vehicle to a person who holds a driving licence to drive such a vehicle; the automatic revocation of a SPSV licence on surrender of the licence by the licence holder; and the non-application of the representations and appeal procedures under the Act to decisions of the licensing authority to refuse to grant a licence or to revoke or suspend a licence, arising from a vehicle not meeting the required standard for SPSVs.<\/p><p>Without this amendment, the licensing authority's decision does not take effect until the appeal procedures have been exhausted, which takes around two months, during which the licence continues and the vehicle can be used as a small public service vehicle, SPSV, despite failing the vehicle standards test.  It is proposed to extend the current three-month timeframe to nine months from the date of the death of a licence holder, during which the nominated representative of the deceased licence holder may apply to the NTA for the grant of a licence of the same category.  It is considered that in the circumstances three months is too short a period.  The final amendment relates to the applicability of the dispatch operator licensing requirements to technological intermediaries.  An argument has been put forward that such intermediaries do not provide a booking service, which is the term used in the 2013 Act; rather, they provide a platform whereby intending passengers can directly contact vehicles.  The proposed amendments to sections 2, 7(2)(c) and 22(5) of the Act will bring certainty on this issue.<\/p><p> As regards those amendments providing for more specific enabling powers for certain matters which the NTA may provide for in regulations, the key amendments relate to section 7 and provide for the requirement for prescribed written declarations or undertakings to accompany a licence application - for example, that the applicant has not been convicted of certain offences specified in the Act and that his or her health or mobility does not affect his or her ability to drive a small public service vehicle.  There are also a number of amendments relating to punctuation and textual corrections and refinement.<\/p><p> Section 3 provides for the substitution of section 48 of the 2013 Act relating to fixed payment notices for small public service vehicles.  Section 48 provides that when a person is issued with a fixed payment notice he or she has 28 days, beginning on the date specified in the notice, during which he or she may pay the prescribed fixed payment amount.  That is the first payment option.  If the person does not pay the prescribed fixed payment amount during that first 28-day period, he or she may make a payment of an amount 50% greater than the prescribed fixed payment amount.  That is the second payment option.  However, the timeframe for the second payment option is not currently prescribed in section 48 - it is prescribed in the fixed payment notice issued to the alleged offender.  Legal advice is that it is preferable that the period for the second payment option be prescribed in section 48.  In this amendment, the opportunity has also been taken to provide for greater precision in certain aspects of the wording of section 48 - for example, the addition of the words \"specified in the notice\" to subsection (1)(a), and the addition of the words \"duly completed\" to subsection (1)(b).<\/p><p> Section 4 provides for an amendment to the Railway Safety Act 2005 to change the name of the Railway Safety Commission to the Commission for Railway Regulation.  The Railway Safety Commission was established under the Railway Safety Act 2005 to foster and encourage railway safety and to enforce legislation relating to railway safety.  Directive 2012\/34\/EU establishing a single European railway area, which must be transposed into national law by mid-June 2015, requires each member state to designate a regulatory body to monitor competition in the rail services market in the State to ensure non-discriminatory access to railway markets.  The regulatory body will have a monitoring function and the role of hearing appeals made by railway undertakings and other interested persons.<\/p><p> Draft regulations that are under preparation at present to transpose the directive provide for the assignment of the functions of the regulatory body to the Railway Safety Commission.  The effect of this will be that, in addition to the regulation of railway safety, the Railway Safety Commission will have statutory functions in respect of regulation of the rail services market.  It is considered, therefore, that it would be appropriate to change the name of the commission to Commission for Railway Regulation to best reflect the broadening of its remit.  It is proposed that the date for the change of name be appointed in an order to be made by the Minister to ensure that the timing of the change of name can be carried out in a planned and organised manner.<\/p><p> Section 5 provides for a purely technical amendment to section 27, as inserted by section 51 of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014 into the State Airports Act 2004.  The amendment will bring the provisions of section 27 in line with similar provisions under the Road Traffic Acts as operated by local authorities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and clarifies that the payment accompanying the notice cannot be accepted unless all the required information has been completed on the notice.<\/p><p> Section 5 also provides for an amendment to section 48 of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014, which sets out the basis on which authorised officers can act in the interest of the proper operation or the security or safety of an airport, or the security or safety of persons, aircraft or other property at an airport.  The amendment provides for the inclusion of an offence under section 47 of that Act in the various offences for which an authorised officer at an airport may arrest a person without warrant.  An offence under section 47 relates to a case in which an authorised officer at an airport finds a vehicle remaining stationary or parked in a place in contravention of airport by-laws and the driver does not comply with the requirement of the officer to move the vehicle.<\/p><p> Section 6 is essentially a technical amendment, correcting section 106 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, which deals with duties on the occurrence of an accident.  It was amended in 2014 to introduce new offences for hit-and-run incidents causing death or serious injury.  The Attorney General's office has since advised the Department that the amended version of the section contains an implicit contradiction.  The new hit-and-run provisions are indictable offences, but they come under a section heading referring to summary offences.  The Attorney General's advice is that the intention of the law is clear in spite of the error, and the DPP is continuing to take prosecutions under this legislation.  However, it is also the Attorney General's view that the error should be corrected at the earliest available opportunity, and that is what we are doing here.  At the same time, we are rectifying an omission in the 2014 provisions.  When the new hit-and-run provisions were introduced, there should have been an associated amendment to state that there would be a consequential disqualification for those who were convicted under the new provisions.  As that was not done at the time, we are doing it now though section 6(b) of the present Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015051300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431505800,"counter":1954,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doyle for his presentation.

At the moment the NTA is in the process of going to the marketplace to issue tenders, which is causing a level of upset among workers, and there is the threat of strike action.  What is the difference between getting the services of an external private operator through the tendering process and getting the service provider to provide BRT?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015051300002#E00300","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431505800,"counter":1956,"content":"<p>The relevant section is section 44 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  It relates to securing the provision of public transport infrastructure.  At the moment, what section 44 provides is that the NTA shall arrange the functions set out in that section to be performed on its behalf in relation to railway, metro, light rail interchange facilities and other public transport infrastructure.  Cycling schemes and other such matters could be included there as well.  At the moment, the section refers to other public infrastructure which \"immediately before the establishment day\" was owned or under the control of a public transport authority.  It concerns local authorities in particular.  That would be included in the definition.  Each of the BRT schemes that are under design at the moment envisage works on public roads developed after the establishment date of the NTA.  For instance, the Swords bus rapid transit scheme will include the Glen Ellan Road extension north of Swords, but that extension was created after the establishment day.

Sections 2 and 3 amend the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.  Section 7 refers to the fitness of a person who is driving a taxi and whether they can handle somebody who is disabled.  Is it not the process that one gets a doctor's certificate to go into the industry in the first place and then one must have a test on an ongoing basis?  There will be some older taxi drivers or people who would not have the ability to lift a person who is disabled into a car.  What is the rule in that regard?  Do they refuse to take the person or say they are unable to take the person?  I am not sure that asking them to sign a declaration that they are fit and so forth is the norm in any industry.

Will the witness explain if there are any exceptions if it is only a minor matter or a small issue to do with the interior of the taxi or otherwise, or is this purely a mechanical matter?<\/p> <p>  The extension from three months to nine months is quite reasonable.  With regard to the payment of 50% in section 48, I do not know why we continue to do this.  It is an extra charge of 50% for somebody who might not make a deadline.  Why are we putting such a heavy burden on people?  I know people should not do things if it is wrong to do them, but 50% is a massive amount for a penalty.

The proposed directive, 2012\/34, from which we derogated previously, must be implemented now.  It does not in any way impose a requirement on us to competitively tender for the provision of rail services.  We can still operate with the direct award contract, which the NTA has with Irish Rail.  It was a ten year contract from 2009 so it continues to 2019.  In fact, in discussions in Europe on the fourth railway package we are insisting that we can continue to have a direct award contract and that we do not have to tender competitively due to the size of our rail market, which is approximately 0.4% of the total EU rail market.  In some respects it would not make sense that we would be forced to competitively tender.  That is the position we are adopting in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the mechanical issue the Deputy mentioned, I presume that relates to the appeals procedure where somebody could continue to operate a vehicle which has failed the NCT as a taxi.
