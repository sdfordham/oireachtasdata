This plan contains a significant volume of\u00a0responses to the current housing crisis, of which the Help to Buy incentive is one.\u00a0 This comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector.  While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.<\/p>  <p>  It is in this context that the Help-to-Buy scheme should be considered.  Its role is to complement the other measures in the Action Plan.  The extent to which the scheme could lead to an increase in residential property prices will very much depend on the speed and efficiency with which structural supply constraints are eliminated and residential building activity increases.  Therefore, the impact of the Help-to-Buy\u00a0incentive on property prices cannot be considered in isolation from the impact of other measures contained in the Action Plan, which are primarily designed to increase supply.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market including property prices on an ongoing basis.

Income tax is due on the difference in the relevant values and\u00a0is generally collected via the PAYE system, while income tax due on share options must be returned within 30 days of the exercise of such options.

This was effected through the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015.  It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.  The significant point is that we regulated at the point of contact with the customer.  Therefore relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation in July 2016.  It is also important to highlight that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, to further enhance the protection of borrowers, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 ensures that a regulated credit servicing firm cannot do something, or fail to do something, which would be a prescribed contravention if performed, or not performed, by a retail credit firm.  The legislation also prevents the owner of credit from instructing a regulated credit servicing firm to perform such an action.\u00a0 Therefore the\u00a0borrower is protected because the owner cannot give an\u00a0instruction that would\u00a0breach the rules\u00a0but also the instruction\u00a0cannot be implemented by the regulated credit servicer, over whom the Central Bank has oversight as a regulated entity.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, my Department will continue to keep all relevant legislation under review in order to ensure that borrowers whose loans have been sold are properly protected and do not lose any protections which they previously enjoyed.  In addition, the Department of Finance expect that the Central Bank, as regulator of credit servicing firms, will be vigilant in this area and raise any specific instances where they have found consumers have not had their protections upheld or that their positions have been disadvantaged.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to tenants, landlord-tenant relations are governed by multiple pieces of legislation (mainly under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for the Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government).  The landlord\/owner of the property is restricted in what they can do in relation to removal of tenants from a property.  These restrictions are the same whether the landlord bought the property, built the property themselves, became a landlord as a result of renting out what was formerly a principal dwelling house or acquired the property by other means such as enforcing loans secured on the property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700063#WRB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[1494\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700063#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has made a complaint to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Central Bank and other relevant agencies regarding the alleged illegal transfer of mortgage payers from tracker to variable interest rate mortgages; the actions he has taken in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>The Central Bank\u00a0is responsible for the regulation and supervision of financial service providers and\u00a0for\u00a0protecting the consumer of financial services.\u00a0\u00a0As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank has commenced an industry wide examination of tracker mortgage related issues\u00a0covering among other things transparency of communications with and contractual rights of tracker mortgage customers.

Rental profits of\u00a0companies are subject to Corporation Tax at 25%.  Rental profits arising in a REIT are exempt from Corporation Tax.  However, profits from any other activities are subject to Corporation Tax in the normal way.<\/p>  <p>  As such, the estimated cost attached to the REIT relates not to an exemption from tax, but rather to the move from direct taxation of rental income to the taxation of dividends distributed from REIT profits arising from that rental income.\u00a0 The extent of any net tax cost of the REIT exemptions will therefore be the difference between the tax which would have arisen on the property income in non-REIT ownership, and the tax charged on the dividends paid out of that property income by the REIT to their investors.\u00a0 The REIT legislation requires that 85% of all property income profits be distributed annually to shareholders.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Any potential\u00a0loss of tax relating to foreign investors is due to the difference between how company dividends are taxed in the hands of foreign investors compared to how profits from direct ownership of property are taxed.

In the absence of any other provisions, foreign REIT shareholders would not have had any liability to Irish tax on REIT dividends, despite the fact that the REIT itself benefits from a tax exemption on qualifying profits of the rental business.\u00a0\u00a0Foreign investors from treaty resident countries may be able to reclaim some part of this DWT if the relevant tax treaty allows for this.\u00a0 The taxation of dividends varies from treaty to treaty, but commonly a source state would retain the right to approximately 15% tax on dividends paid from that state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700063#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Avoidance","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700063#WRB01800"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[1648\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700063#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide an update on his Department's work with the Revenue Commissioners in tackling the tax evasion uncovered in the Panama Papers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":86,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that they have\u00a0 been to the forefront in acting against the use of offshore accounts, trusts and structures to evade tax liabilities, and that their approach has set the model for much of the work undertaken by other tax administrations in this area.

NAMA has facilitated the sale or lease by its debtors and receivers of properties, on commercial terms, to public bodies for a wide-range of purposes, including social housing; schools; healthcare facilities; and urban economic, environmental and cultural regeneration.\u00a0 All such transactions are executed at market value.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, NAMA can only identify these potentially suitable\u00a0properties and, ultimately, it is a matter for local authorities to determine which properties are most suitable for their housing needs.

The Valuation Act 2001, as amended, provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 to the Act.  However, such exemptions specifically include any \"domestic premises\" except for apartments which may be rateable in certain limited circumstances specified in the Act.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from Schedule 4 to the Act, domestic premises which provide Bed and Breakfast type accommodation and\/or lodgings are not rateable.

Similarly, those parties can also apply to have a property entered on a valuation list.

There is also a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.<\/p>  <p>  Once a property has been valued and entered on a valuation list, the calculation, collection and payment of rates is entirely a matter for the rating authority concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700065#WRD02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence","counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700065#WRD02200"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[41607\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700065#WRD02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps that have been taken to bring practice in line with the commitment the State has made in signing the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combatting violence against women and domestic violence, in view of the fact that the convention contains rules on the retention of residence status by victims of domestic violence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":205,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[41609\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700065#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps that have been taken to bring practice in line with the commitment the State has made in signing the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combatting violence against women and domestic violence, in view of the fact that the convention contains rules on the retention of residence status by victims of domestic violence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":206,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 137 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Istanbul Convention is a significant legal instrument in combatting domestic violence and work is underway in implementing the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention.  With regard to the Convention article which is the subject of the Deputy's question, Ireland is already compliant. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) has published guidelines on how the Irish immigration system deals with cases of domestic violence where the victim is a foreign national whose immigration status is currently derived from or dependant on that of the perpetrator.  The key element is to offer the victim an avenue to obtain independent immigration status is his\/her own right.  The guidelines set out the options that people have in these circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  INIS considers each case on its merits.  INIS requires as much information as possible to make a decision.  The application for independent status as a victim of domestic violence should set out details of the domestic violence suffered and make a request for independent immigration status.  Any relevant family circumstances, especially whether there are any children involved, should be disclosed.<\/p>  <p>  The sort of supporting material INIS looks for to establish that domestic violence is being suffered would include Protection Orders; Safety Orders or Barring Orders from the Courts; medical reports; Garda incident reports; a letter from a State body such as the HSE; a letter of support from a domestic violence support organisation etc.<\/p>  <p>  Generally the immigration status granted would be at the same level as that which was previously held as a dependant.  The main difference is that this status is no longer dependent on the spouse or partner and that person will have no say in whether the applicant is permitted to stay in Ireland.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p>  <p>  The Lucan and Clondalkin Garda Districts form part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Division and I am informed that on the 30 November 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the Garda strength of the Lucan District was 164, of whom 6 were Community Garda&iacute; and the strength of the Clondalkin District was 197, of whom 7 were Community Garda&iacute;.<\/p>  <p>  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. <\/p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 members will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that have been recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide, including 62 to the DMR West Division.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end.<\/p>  <p>  The focus on investment in personnel is critical. While it is the case, as advised by the Commissioner, that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises and, in that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of dedicated Community Garda&iacute; throughout the state.  We are now rebuilding the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; including Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700065#WRD04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700065#WRD04200"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[41174\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700065#WRD04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the psychological and medical interventions and supports which have been provided to a person (details supplied) who is currently on remand in Cloverhill Prison; if she will liaise with the Department of Health to urgently provide the person with necessary psychiatric medical intervention and admission to the Central Mental Hospital; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1239","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that the prisoner concerned remains in custody in Cloverhill Prison to date, and is currently under the care of the In-Reach Forensic Mental Health Services from the Central Mental Hospital.

In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Given that there was no recruitment for a period of five years it will take some time before there are fully trained officers available to replace the number of personnel that have retired across the entire organisation, including traffic.  However, the Commissioner has confirmed that the personnel requirements of the Garda Traffic Corps is currently being assessed to identifying the most vulnerable areas in regard to serious traffic collisions and the level of compliance to Road Traffic Legislation.  Combined with this data I am informed that the Assistant Commissioner, Roads Policing and Major Event\/Emergency Management is currently assessing the capacity of Divisions and Districts to identify and target areas where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could accelerate the deployment of personnel to traffic in 2017.  The filling of the vacancies identified will be conducted on a structured basis and will be further enhanced with the recently renewed recruitment campaigns to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>Road traffic legislation is, of course, also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.<table><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Garda Traffic Corps Strength<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>31 December 2013<\/td><td>804<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>31 December 2014<\/td><td>742<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>31 December 2015<\/td><td>716<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>30 November 2016<\/td><td>674<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700065#WRD05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting Legislation","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700066#WRE00100"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[41332\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700066#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the vetting arrangements that are in place in accordance with section 15 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997; if she will confirm that requests for information from a housing authority are processed by the superintendent in charge of the district wherein the subject of the request resides and that they are dealt with on a case-by-case basis; the number of requests that have been made by South Dublin County Council on a year-by-year basis over the past five years; and if this request process is used in every allocation and transfer locally.","asker":"1309","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":244,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that requests for information in respect of social housing from housing authorities under section 15 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 are processed by the Superintendent in Charge of the District in which the subject of the request resides.

This reform of the <i>in camera<\/i>rule was made to enable the media, researchers and legal professionals to gain access to valuable information on the operation of the law in this area.  We have all seen the results of this change in the form of increased coverage of family law proceedings in both print and other media.  This coverage has proven in the round to be very responsible, in that while public interest issues have been highlighted for debate, this has been done in such a way as to protect identities of individuals involved.  It is also, of course, very informative in terms of policy making and review.<\/p><p>However, it is open to the court to exclude representatives of the media from the court or otherwise restrict their attendance during the hearing or parts of it, or restrict or prohibit the publication or broadcasting of evidence given or referred to during the proceedings.  The court may impose these restrictions where it is satisfied that it is necessary to do so (i) to preserve the anonymity of a party to the proceedings or any child to whom the proceedings relate, (ii) by reason of the nature or circumstances of the case, or (iii) if otherwise necessary in the interests of justice.<\/p><p>Section 40A of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 prohibits the publication or broadcasting of any information which would be likely to lead members of the public to identify the parties to family law proceedings or any children to whom the proceedings relate.  Anyone breaching this prohibition will be liable on summary conviction to a class A fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both, or if convicted on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years, or both.  Section 31 of the Child Care Act 1991 contains a similar prohibition in relation to child care cases.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that these provisions are sufficiently robust and that there is no need at the present time for a further review of the <i>in camera<\/i>rule in family law cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700066#WRE03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Resources","counter":275,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700066#WRE03400"},{"type":"question","counter":276,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[41486\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700066#WRE03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she has satisfied herself that the Garda information technology forensics unit is adequately resourced; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":277,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[41487\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700066#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will sanction further funding to expand the Garda information technology forensics unit in view of the fact there is a backlog of up to four years in dealing with Garda forensic analysis of computer hard drives and other electronic storage devices; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":278,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 132 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for distribution of Garda resources and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, on foot of a review of the Computer Crime Investigation Unit (CCIU) under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, a dedicated Garda Cyber Crime Bureau has recently been established, headed by a Detective Superintendent, to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity and capabilities to deal with cyber crime and cyber security threats.

I am deeply conscious of the serious issue of road safety and mindful of the increase in 2016 of road traffic fatalities.  I am also mindful of the traumatic impact of road traffic collisions on those directly affected and their families, as well as the impact of dangerous driving more generally on the quality of life of residents in local communities across the country.<\/p>  <p>  As you are aware, I have no direct role in the enforcement of Road Traffic legislation, which is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that they conduct a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies.  Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including speeding.  By working together with the Road Safety Authority and other agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to confront dangerous road-user behaviour through public presence, legislative enforcement, education and partnership.<\/p>  <p>  Underpinning this, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme (2016-2021) sets out key strategic objectives for Road Policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Road Policing plans over the next 5 years.  Under the Programme, the Commissioner will undertake a number of road safety traffic enforcement initiatives, including expanding the use of technology and increasing checkpoints.  One of the focuses of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is on the most vulnerable road user categories of motor cyclists, pedal cyclists, pedestrians and learner permit holders.  Garda operations will specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions.  Speed will continue to be a primary focus of Garda enforcement activities through the deployment of high visibility patrols in conjunction with safety camera vans and the use of hand-held speed detection devices.<\/p>  <p>  This targeted approach to speed enforcement is undertaken in order to significantly reduce the incidence of fatal and serious injuries and improve road safety.  To this end, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in conjunction with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (formerly the National Roads Authority), completed an extensive analysis of the collision history on the road network.  Sections of road were identified where a significant proportion of collisions occurred whereby speed was deemed the primary contributory factor.  Based on this analysis, a list of speed enforcement zones has been developed with the aim of providing information to motorists in order to raise awareness of speeding in these zones.<\/p>  <p>  Since May 2016 there are 1,031 speed enforcement zones nationwide where safety cameras operate.  Prior to the introduction of safety cameras, approximately 31% of fatal collisions occurred in these zones.  In 2015, this figure had reduced to 14%.  This shows a dramatic reduction in terms of risk in these areas and a huge increase in terms of road safety.<\/p>  <p>  The locations of these speed enforcement zones are available on the Garda website www.garda.ie.  These speed enforcement zones are continually reviewed in light of ongoing survey data, collision history and local feedback to ensure that enforcement activity is properly targeted.<\/p>  <p>  Road traffic legislation is also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted operations and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.<\/p>  <p>  Road safety is a shared responsibility, one which, as you are aware, the Government take very seriously.  Ireland's current Road Safety Strategy (2013 - 2020) aims to place Ireland consistently on the list of safest countries in the EU and beyond.  To achieve this, we are continuing to work together in partnership.  I attended a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee on Road Safety recently, along with the Road Safety Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Attorney General and other agencies.  This Committee oversees the implementation of the Road Safety Strategy and provides a forum for high-level discussion of road safety issues and generally meets twice a year; however, in light of the 2016 increase in road fatalities, the meeting was brought forward to January.  The purpose of the meeting was to bring together all stakeholders to see what immediate actions could be taken to reverse the upward trend in road fatalities.  During this meeting, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated that there will be an additional 10% increase in the traffic corps during the course of 2017, which should also lead to better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also informed the meeting that it was intended to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700066#WRE04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stardust Fire","counter":285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700066#WRE04400"},{"type":"question","counter":286,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[41516\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700066#WRE04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will make the records, reports and minutes of the meeting of 12 December 2008 which discussed the first final report of a person (details supplied) with regards to the Stardust tragedy available to the families of the victims of the tragedy; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":287,"content":"<p>I would inform the Deputy that insofar as the receipt of this report is concerned, the position is that the final report was submitted on 7 January 2009.

Under this decision, the Government confirmed that Ireland will take in up to 4,000 persons in order to give effect to the EU legal instruments it has opted into, with approval of the Oireachtas, in respect of relocation and the solemn commitments Ireland has also entered into in respect of resettled refugees.<\/p><p>The figure of 4,000 includes 2,622 asylum seekers to be taken in from migration hotspots in Italy and Greece under the new EU relocation programme and 1,040 programme refugees from Lebanon which the Irish Government has committed to taking in by the end of 2017 under Ireland's Refugee Resettlement Programme.  Up to<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>two hundred unaccompanied minors from the former refugee camps in Calais may be admitted from France.  The mechanism by which the balance will be admitted has yet to be decided by Government.<\/p><p>Among the measures agreed under the Programme was the establishment of a Network of Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres (EROCs)  which would be used to provide initial accommodation in order to meet the basic needs of asylum seekers relocated from hot spots in Italy and Greece while their applications for refugee status are processed.<\/p><p>In addition, the Government has committed under the Programme to take in additional resettled refugees who must also be temporally accommodated in EROCs for the purposes of reception, orientation and integration training, prior to being resettled in communities across Ireland.  In this specific regard two EROCs were opened in the past year, one in County Kildare and one in Co. Waterford.<\/p><p>Those coming in as relocated asylum seekers via Greece\/Italy are managed by the Programme Office of the IRPP.  Those destined for the new Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC) in Ballaghaderreen, Co. Roscommon, will be asylum seekers coming via the Greece\/Italy route.  As this cohort will receive a grant of international protection within a period of 8-12 weeks, their stay in EROCs is intended to be short-term after which they will be housed somewhere in Ireland.<\/p><p>In terms of the resettlement in local communities of refugees temporarily accommodated in EROCs, the Deputy will be aware that the Government has established a Taskforce to oversee the implementation of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  Senior Officials from Government departments and key agencies, including the City and County Managers Association, sit on the Taskforce.  A sub-committee of the Taskforce, established to oversee the implementation of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and composed of senior officials from Government Departments including the City and County Managers Association, is working on a distribution key to inform the distribution of refugees admitted under the programmes across the country.  To-date, refugees have been resettled in Dublin, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Clare, Galway and Mayo.  In advance of each resettlement, work takes place with each receiving Local Authority and local service providers to prepare for the arrival of the refugees in the community.  Initially, meetings take place with statutory service providers only.  Once the initial phase is over, representatives of local NGOs and the Community and Voluntary Sector are invited to join the Inter-agency Working Group to support the resettlement programme at a local level.  Funding is provided through the Local Authority to support the work of local Community Groups which includes the recruitment of a full or part-time Resettlement Support Worker.  The amount of funding available will depend, inter-alia, on the number of refugees resettled and the number of locations involved.  The Local Authority must submit an application for funding but is supported though the funding process by an experienced member of the resettlement team of my Department.  Over the next 18 months, refugees will be resettled in counties around the country until the full cohort of refugees have arrived in Ireland and have been resettled into the community.  Over that period it is likely that County Donegal will be expected to house a representative proportion of the refugees admitted to Ireland.  It is not possible at this stage to say how many of these refugees might go to Donegal in 2017, and discussions are ongoing with the local authority in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700066#WRE05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Procedures","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700067#WRF00100"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[41635\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700067#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to parliamentary question number 88 of 6 December 2016, if she will investigate further a case (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts, including the provision of information on the courts system, is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions.<\/p><p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that, based on the information provided, the Courts Service has no record of the Freedom of Information request referenced by the Deputy.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p><p>I am advised that Garda Drug Units personnel are assigned on a Divisional basis.  Ballymun and Santry Garda Stations are located in the Ballymun Garda District which forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan North (DMR North) Division while Finglas Garda Station is located in the Cabra Garda District which forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan West (DMR West) Division.  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of the 30 November 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 233 members assigned to the Garda Divisional Drugs Units, of whom 22 were assigned to the DMR North Divisional Drugs Unit and 20 to the DMR West Divisional Drugs Unit.<\/p><p>It is important to note that all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences or otherwise.  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs supply.  This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.<\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed that so far 52 and 62 of these probationer Garda have been assigned to the DMR North and DMR West Divisions respectively.  I am further informed that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end.<\/p><p>Drug law enforcement activities and all other Garda activities will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream.<\/p><p>The investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.

In addition, the GNPSB is responsible for working with other agencies to manage sex offenders in the interest of community safety.  As part of the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 Protective Services Units (PSUs) are to be established in every Garda Division with specially trained staff.

Part 4 of the Act makes provision for the operation of the Garda Diversion Programme under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner.  The aim of the Diversion Programme is to deal with young people who offend, by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the offender away from the courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending.<\/p>  <p>  To support the operation of the Diversion Programme, my Department, through the Irish Youth Justice Service, funds some 106 Garda Youth Diversion Projects around the country.  These projects are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime\/anti-social behaviour.  In 2016, some &euro;12m was allocated by the Irish Youth Justice Service to Garda Youth Diversion Projects and a number of other youth justice community based projects around the country.  Similar monies will be expended in 2017.  In addition, monies secured from the Dormant Accounts Fund supported the establishment of ten new projects in the period 2015\/2016.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Youth Justice Service working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitors the need for Garda Youth Diversion Projects on an ongoing basis.  This is achieved in the main through the Garda Youth Diversion Projects annual planning and budget application process.  The provision of youth crime statistical information by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service to all Garda Youth Diversion Projects is an integral part of the annual planning process undertaken by the projects.  When completed, these plans provide details in relation to youth crime in the relevant catchment area, numbers of persons referred to the Diversion Programme and the programmes and interventions to be implemented in relation to young people admitted to the projects.  These plans are assessed by the Irish Youth Justice Service and support it in its monitoring and oversight role in relation to the projects and with any decisions required to be taken in relation to reviewing or restructuring the provision of services in particular areas.  The Annual Plans for 2017 are currently being assessed by the Irish Youth Justice Service.<\/p>  <p>  Developments which could have implications in the future for the Garda Youth Diversion Projects include the report of the Review Group established by the Garda Commissioner to examine the operation of the statutory Diversion Programme, the recommendation of the Penal Policy Review Group that a diversion programme be established for offenders aged eighteen to twenty four years, and the Programme for Government commitment to support the expansion of Garda Youth Diversion Projects to that particular age cohort.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects have undergone significant development in recent years with the introduction of revised annual planning and budget application and reporting processes.  In addition, a comprehensive risk\/needs assessment tool has been introduced.  The tool is used in the projects to assess the risk of recidivism in young people and developing a case management plan on the basis of the specific risks and needs of the individual.  This allows interventions to be tailored appropriately and lead to more positive outcomes for young people.  In addition, a new Garda Youth Diversion Project service delivery model has been introduced in County Kerry which, following its evaluation, may give rise to similar models being introduced in other counties.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects will continue to undergo development, all the time ensuring that they are located in the areas where the need is greatest having regard to both the quantity and profile of youth crime and its underlying circumstances.  Such information will continue to inform decision making in relation to the reform or restructuring of projects and service delivery, or altering project catchment areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700067#WRF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":329,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700067#WRF02900"},{"type":"question","counter":330,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[41871\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700067#WRF03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 114 of 1 December 2016, the number of those appointed detectives in each division that are current firearm card holders.","asker":"1296","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":331,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for carrying on and managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including by arranging for the training of its members and civilian staff and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the information requested by the Deputy in respect of the numbers of appointed detectives in each Division who are current firearm card holders is deemed to be operationally sensitive and cannot be disclosed for security reasons.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Garda Commissioner that since January 2007, each Garda member who is authorised to carry firearms on duty is required to attend two live fire refresher firearms courses and one judgmental firearms training course each year.

No. 383 of 2016, I commenced those provisions of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 as necessary to get the new Authority up and running, particularly in terms of its membership and appointment. On 29 September 2016, I signed the Order appointing 1 October 2016 as the official &ldquo;establishment day&rdquo; of the Regulatory Authority as provided under section 7 of the 2015 Act - S.I. No. 507 of 2016 refers. In conjunction with these initial steps the nomination, approval and appointment procedures for the members of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority set out in Part 2 of the 2015 Act were also completed. This has included the required resolutions approving such appointment having been passed by each House of the Oireachtas. Dr. Don Thornhill has also been appointed as Chairperson of the Regulatory Authority in accordance with the Act. <\/p>  <p>The Authority, which has eleven members including a lay majority and lay-Chairperson, held its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016 and has been meeting monthly since then with its next meeting scheduled for 19 January 2017.  Initial office accommodation and has been provided for the Authority by my Department along with the secondment of an officer at Assistant Principal level in support of its start-up phase. Funding support of &euro;1 million has also been provided to the new Authority  by my Department in December on a strictly recoupable basis as the new Authority will be self-funding by levy. In the building up of capacity and resources to become fully operational, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has recently appointed a person to fulfil the duties of its Chief Executive on a solely interim basis to drive the initial start-up phase. At the same time this will enable the Authority to prepare the way for the public recruitment of a full-time Chief Executive in the coming months having had the opportunity to more clearly identify its existing and future management needs and capacities in real time. <\/p>  <p>As part of the commencement of Part 2 of the 2015 Act, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the Honorable Society of the King's Inns have furnished the Legal Services Regulatory Authority with copies of their professional codes as required within one month of the Authority's establishment under section 23(6)(a). On 5 December 2016, under S.I. No. 630   of 2016, I also commenced sections 118 to 120 of the 2015 Act. These provisions set statutory delivery deadlines for the completion of public consultations and reports on the specified matters concerned. These relate to Legal Partnerships, Multi-Disciplinary Practices and certain restrictions on barristers in relation to direct access on contentious matters and the holding of clients' monies. The working focus right now is on the managed roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions in tandem with the phased commencement during the year of the various remaining Parts and provisions of the 2015 Act. <\/p>  <p>  Against this background, it is intended that the phased commencement of the remaining Parts of the 2015 Act will be implemented in the first half of this year. The current focus includes the phased commencement of respective sections or Parts of the 2015 Act such as those dealing with the introduction of a more transparent legal cost regime, the establishment of a Roll of Practising Barristers and the separate introduction under the Act of Pre-Action Protocols.

I am aware of the High Court decision referenced and wish to reassure the Deputy that this is currently being examined by my Department and the matter will be kept under review in terms of any definitive additional obligations arising.  <\/p><p>In relation to County Registrars, as a matter of law, a County Registrar may only make an order for possession of any land in cases where no defence to an action for possession has been delivered by the defendant or no appearance has been entered by the defendant.  Therefore the power of a County Registrar as regards making possession orders is extremely limited and where any defence is raised by the defendant, including any defence in relation to the nature or terms of the mortgage contract between the borrower and lender, the matter must, when it is in order for hearing, be transferred by the County Registrar to the judge's list at the first opportunity.  At that point it would be a matter for the judge to consider any such issues raised, including, if applicable, issues in relation to the EU Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts which was given effect to in Ireland by Regulations in 1995 and amending Regulations in 2000 and in 2013.  In addition, all orders of a County Registrar are subject to appeal to the Circuit Court. <\/p><p>The Directive and Regulations are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and it is understood that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has supervisory powers to ensure compliance with the legislation.<\/p><p>The raising of this issue in relation to the matters for consideration by the Court in a possession case underlines the critical importance of people who are in mortgage arrears on their homes and who have been issued with legal proceedings engaging with their lender and with the court processes and entering a defence for the consideration of the court where they believe that they have a defence. If they engage with the court processes they will be subject to various forms of statutory and non statutory protection including the provisions of special legislation introduced in 2013 and 2015 and also the ability to avail of the free legal and financial advice services provided for under the Government's Abhaile service introduced in October 2016.  <\/p><p>It is already the case, since special insolvency legislation passed in 2015, that a PIA (personal insolvency arrangement), the key statutory insolvency measure which has the objective of keeping a homeowner in arrears in the family home and restoring him\/her to solvency, can be imposed by the court in particular circumstances where it has been rejected by the creditors. It is also the case that, under Section 2 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 the Circuit Court may, in any repossession proceedings in respect of a borrower's principal private residence, adjourn proceedings so that a proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may be fully explored as an alternative to repossession.  The Act provides for an initial adjournment period not exceeding 2 months, with the possibility of further adjournments where it considers that progress has been made on preparing a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA).<\/p><p>The concentration during the latter part of 2016 was to get the new Government Abhaile service up and running and producing results as the new national mortgage arrears resolution service, operating with MABS (the Money Advice and Budgeting Service which has a network of offices across the country) as the key point of entry.  This now ensures that people who are in danger of losing their home have access to free professional advice, including advice from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner. Under this Scheme, home owners who are in arrears on their home mortgage and at risk of losing their homes are provided with access to free independent expert financial and legal advice and assistance, so that a solution can be put in place that will deal with their debt and keep them in their home, where that is a sustainable option.<\/p><p>The Abhaile service is in addition to the help already available from MABS to homeowners in mortgage arrears. This includes the presence of MABS court mentors at all Circuit Court repossession hearings across the country to provide information and assistance to unrepresented borrowers; and providing in-house dedicated Mortgage Arrears advisers (DMA advisers) in MABS offices across the country, specifically to assist and negotiate on behalf of borrowers in mortgage arrears. <\/p><p>Over 3,700 vouchers for financial or legal advice and assistance were issued under Abhaile between 22 July and 13 January 2017, of which over 3,000 were requested for consultations and assistance with Personal Insolvency Practitioners.\u3000The Abhaile Scheme includes provision for free legal aid for homeowners where a PIA which includes arrears on the home mortgage has been rejected by creditors and an application needs to be made to the Court to review the case and impose the arrangement where applicable. Legal Aid has been approved under the Abhaile Scheme in over 100 such cases, up to 13 January 2017.<\/p><p>During 2015, the Insolvency Service of Ireland helped almost 1,700 debtors secure permanent debt solutions that returned them to solvency, up from 996 in 2014. <\/p><p>The number of people availing of solutions through the Insolvency Service of Ireland continued to grow in 2016. During 2015 ISI received 2,028 applications, 1,371 Protective Certificates were issued and almost 1,700 permanent solutions for debtors were put in place. In the year Quarter 4 of 2015 to Quarter 3 of 2016, the latest full year figures that are available, the ISI received 2,731 applications, 1,581 Protective Certificates were issued and almost 1,800 permanent solutions for debtors were put in place. The number of solutions for this period is expected to increase further over the coming months, as the outcomes of vouchers issued under the Abhaile Scheme come to fruition and as personal insolvency review cases currently before the courts are decided or settled.<\/p><p>Continuing education for the Irish judiciary is facilitated by the Committee for Judicial Studies and any person appointed to judicial office agrees to take such course or courses of training or education, or both, as may be required by the Chief Justice or President of the court to which that person is appointed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700068#WRG02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bench Warrants","counter":383,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700068#WRG02350"},{"type":"question","counter":384,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[1356\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700068#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of bench warrants currently waiting to be executed in Cork city, Cork west and Cork north Garda divisions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":385,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, difficulties in relation to the execution of warrants, including bench warrants, are a long-standing issue for many police forces around the world; notably relating to persons actively seeking to evade detection and where limited identification information might be available to support enforcement.

A welcome analysis of this issue was provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate in their report on Crime Investigation of November 2014.  The Inspectorate Report acknowledges the difficulties often faced by Garda&iacute; in pursuing the execution of warrants but it also points to deficiencies in the current systems, some of which are tied to the available technology for recording and monitoring information on warrants.  In this regard the Government is providing a very important investment in new Garda technology under the Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021; some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. <\/p><p>In addition, as part of the overall strategic transformation programme underway in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a Warrants Review Group has been working on means of better managing and enforcing warrants taking on board the Inspectorate's analysis.  I am advised that a number of improvements have been put in place, including greater use of clerical support staff which helps to free up Garda&iacute; to concentrate on the execution as opposed to the administration of warrants.

It is a statutory requirement that the Appeal Committee has two practising lawyers, as well as members in reserve.  The Board has a Corporate Governance Manual that seeks to address any potential conflict of interest situations and it is express practice that any Committee member who has a conflict of interest in relation to a particular application does not sit on the Committee for the purpose of that application. <\/p>  <p>  The Board has been well served by many eminent lawyers since its establishment and I think the Deputy will appreciate that handling any potential conflict is an inherent part of lawyers work.

I attended a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee on Road Safety recently, along with the Road Safety Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Attorney General and other agencies.  This Committee oversees the implementation of the Road Safety Strategy and provides a forum for high-level discussion of road safety issues and generally meets twice a year; however in light of the 2016 increase in road fatalities, the meeting was brought forward to January.  The purpose of the meeting was to bring together all stakeholders to see what immediate actions could be taken to reverse the upward trend in road fatalities. During this meeting, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated that there will be an additional 10% increase in the traffic corps during the course of 2017, which should also lead to better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also informed the meeting that it was intended to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore. <\/p><p>Following this meeting, my colleague Minister Ross announced that his Department will review Section 29 of the Road Traffic 2010 with an intention of ensuring that all drivers, if caught drink driving, will in future receive a mandatory disqualification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700068#WRG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Resettlement Programme","counter":414,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700069#WRH00150"},{"type":"question","counter":415,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[1466\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700069#WRH00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there are plans to rehome refugees in counties Cavan and Monaghan; if so, the status of these plans; the locations and areas which have been identified; the number of refugees this involves; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":416,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was approved by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 in response to the migration crisis which has developed in Southern Europe, and as an act of solidarity with other Member States  Under this decision, the Government confirmed that Ireland will take in up to 4,000 persons over the next two years in order to give effect to the EU legal instruments it has opted into, with approval of the Oireachtas, in respect of relocation and the solemn commitments Ireland has also entered into in respect of resettlement of refugees. <\/p>  <p>  Among the measures agreed under the Programme was the establishment of a Network of Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres (EROCs)  which would be used to provide initial accommodation in order to meet the basic needs of asylum seekers relocated from hot spots in Italy and Greece while their applications for refugee status are processed.     <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has committed under the Programme to take in additional resettlement refugees who must also be temporally accommodated in EROCs for the purposes of reception, orientation and integration training, prior to being resettled in communities across Ireland.  In this specific regard two EROCs were opened in the past year, one in Co. Kildare and one in Co. Waterford.   <\/p>  <p>  Those coming in as relocated asylum seekers via Greece\/Italy are managed by the Programme Office of the IRPP.  Those destined for the new Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC) in Ballaghaderreen, Co. Roscommon will be asylum seekers coming via the Greece\/Italy route. As this cohort are expected to receive a grant of international protection within a period of 8-12 weeks, their stay in EROCs is intended to be short-term after which they will be housed elsewhere in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the resettlement in local communities of refugees temporarily accommodated in EROCs, the Deputy will be aware that the Government have established a Taskforce to oversee the implementation of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.

A sub-committee of the Taskforce, established be me to oversee the implementation of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and composed of senior officials from Government Departments including the City and County Managers Association, are working on a distribution key  to inform the distribution of refugees admitted under the programmes across the country.  To-date, refugees have been resettled in Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Clare, Galway and Mayo.  Over the next 18 months, refugees will be resettled in other counties around the country until the full cohort of refugees have arrived in Ireland and have been resettled into the community.  Therefore at some point over that period it is highly likely that County Cavan and County Monaghan will be asked to house a proportion of the refugees admitted to Ireland.

The Deputy will understand, of course, that the detail of such security measures should not be disclosed publicly.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has developed considerable operational capacities in countering terrorism and in responding to critical incidents.  There is, in particular, a highly-trained and well-equipped special intervention capability in the Emergency Response Unit that is supported by the regional Armed Support Units and the range of other resources across the Garda organisation.  In addition, the considerable skills and resources of the Defence Forces are also available in support where needed.<\/p><p>While there are a number of persons here whose activities in support of extremism give rise to concern they will continue to be monitored closely by the Garda authorities and all appropriate measures will be taken in this regard. <\/p><p>The Garda Authorities will continue to work closely with their EU and other international security and intelligence counterparts in responding to the shared threat of international terrorism.  The gathering and sharing of relevant information is an important aspect of this international co-operation.  The Government is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to enhance their connectivity to a range of EU and other international resources and significant work is ongoing in this regard.  This includes connecting to the Schengen Information System and, indeed, to other EU and Interpol information-sharing resources relevant to countering the terrorist threat.  A series of measures is being rolled out to build on the current EU framework for information-sharing, combatting terrorism and controlling illegal firearms, and Ireland is fully engaged in pursuing these developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700069#WRH00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deportation Orders","counter":425,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700069#WRH00950"},{"type":"question","counter":426,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[1497\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700069#WRH01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will defer implementation of a deportation order in the case of a person (details supplied); the way in which the person can proceed to regularise their status; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":427,"content":"<p>A deportation order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 2 September 2016.

I attended a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee on Road Safety recently, along with the Road Safety Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Attorney General and other agencies.  This Committee oversees the implementation of the Road Safety Strategy and provides a forum for high-level discussion of road safety issues and generally meets twice a year; however in light of the 2016 increase in road fatalities, the meeting was brought forward to January.  The purpose of the meeting was to bring together all stakeholders to see what immediate actions could be taken to reverse the upward trend in road fatalities. During this meeting, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated that there will be an additional 10% increase in the traffic corps during the course of 2017, which should also lead to better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also informed the meeting that it was intended to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore. <\/p><p>Following this meeting, my colleague Minister Ross announced that his Department will review Section 29 of the Road Traffic 2010 with an intention of ensuring that all drivers, if caught drink driving, will in future receive a mandatory disqualification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700069#WRH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Eligibility","counter":458,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700069#WRH03150"},{"type":"question","counter":459,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[1691\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700069#WRH03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) was refused entry here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":460,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that a person refused permission to enter the State is required to be given a written notice which sets out the grounds under section 4(3) of the Immigration Act 2004 on which the refusal decision was made. <\/p><p>There is no record of the person concerned having been refused permission to enter the State on the dates provided by the Deputy.

To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p><p>The first attestation of trainee Garda&iacute; in 2017 will take place on 2 February and their allocation will be a matter for the Commissioner.

As the name suggest, an EROC is largely about reception and orientation for those who are to be subsequently resettled.  The overwhelming majority of persons being relocated to Ireland are Syrian.<\/p>  <p>  The services provided to people arriving from Syria will include education, GP services, HSE medical screening, and access to the services of the Department of Social Protection.  A core part of the job of the IRPP is coordination and ensuring appropriate service delivery.  Staff of the IRPP hold weekly clinics in the EROC with clients and any service level issues become immediately apparent.<\/p>  <p>  The relevant services will be provided locally or in some cases may be provided at the centre.  The mode of service provision is determined on a case by case basis depending on the local situation and the individual circumstances of the asylum seekers.  Every effort is made to mainstream services with local populations while not impacting on the delivery of local services.  Thus children may attend local schools and adults will be provided with English language classes by the local ETB.  Services can in some instances be provided directly to the children and adults although the preference is that they are provided in conjunction with local services as this helps significantly with integration.  It should be noted that accommodating persons in EROCs for a period of time is considered to be good practice as it allows for a period of acclimatisation, de-stressing and on-site processing.  It is also a process that is supported by the UNHCR as best practice.<\/p>  <p>  By law all children resident in the State must attend school between the ages of 6 and 16. The children of those staying in the Ballaghaderreen EROC will be no different.  IRPP officials are liaising with colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills to ensure all children of school-going age resident in the centre are either placed in an appropriate school in the general area or whether facilities in the EROC are the most appropriate mechanism to address educational needs.  It is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills to determine whether or not additional resources (e.g. SNAs) will need to be put in place in local schools to meet requirements.  If necessary, a bus service will be established should any of the school placements be outside walking distance. The availability of cr&egrave;che\/pre-school facilities is also subject to discussions with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that the local service demands generated by the refugees and asylum seekers can be met, an EROC team composed of local service providers is being established.  This model works extremely well in both of the current EROCs located in Clonea Strand and Monasterevin respectively.  Persons arriving under relocation will also have had the benefit of direct engagement with my officials while in Greece or Italy, including a vulnerability\/needs assessment.  Officials of the IRPP will continue to closely engage with those placed in the EROC and will work to ensure that any local service issues that may arise are promptly resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700070#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":487,"content":"<p>Question No. 206 answered with Question No. 139.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":488,"content":"<p>Question No. 207 answered with Question No. 169<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":489,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700070#WRJ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":490,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[1864\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700070#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she has received advice from the Attorney General on a report (details supplied) and brought the matter to Cabinet; if not, when she expects to do so; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":491,"content":"<p>The Deputy is referring to a report which I have received from Mr Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill of his Review relating to two protected disclosures which were made to me by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in early October. <\/p>  <p>  Mr Justice O'Neill was asked to review the allegations of wrongdoing contained in the disclosures, to make any inquiries with persons or bodies that he considered appropriate in relation to the review and to report to me on the conclusion of the review, including any recommendations which he may consider necessary in relation to any further action which may be appropriate and warranted to address the allegations.  <\/p>  <p>  The Report, which I received on 7 December 2016, sets out in detail the allegations contained in the protected disclosures.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. To make this a reality for all the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. <\/p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that have been recruited by the end of 2016 since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign of 2016, again received a strong response. <\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 41 to the Louth Division. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which when taking account of projected retirements will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Garda Reserve, some 1,500 Reserves will require to be recruited over the next 5 years in order to achieve the medium term target of 2,000. The Commissioner is currently developing a recruitment and training plan to recruit 300 this year and annually thereafter.  In the case of civilians the Government has approved a medium term target of 20% civilians by 2021 which equates to an increase in the number of civilians from approximately 2,000 at present to 4,000. This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently at 14% civilians, more in line with international norms. The target is to be achieved through the implementation of a combination of redeployment of Garda&iacute; assigned to technical\/administrative tasks to front-line policing duties and &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policies. This latter policy refers to the Commissioner adopting a default position in relation to new posts that are not on their face operational policing posts.   <\/p>  <p>  As I have said funding for the recruitment of up to 500 civilians has been provided in Budget 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The distribution of those recruited across the three personnel strands will be a matter for the Commissioner but undoubtedly all Divisions and Garda activities will benefit from the very substantial uplift in resources coming on stream this year and over the next number of years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700070#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":499,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700070#WRJ02250"},{"type":"question","counter":500,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[1959\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700070#WRJ02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the cost of the presence of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at Shannon Airport protecting civilian troop carriers and military planes of the United States of America, by month, in 2016; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":501,"content":"<p>The primary aim of deployment by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at Shannon Airport is to protect the safety of passengers and other people working at and using the airport and its environs.

am advised also that it is inherently difficult to estimate with confidence the extent of any illegal activity and that it is not possible, therefore, to put a figure on the cost to the Exchequer of fuel laundering. Nevertheless, the serious threat that criminal activity of this kind poses to legitimate and compliant businesses, consumers and the Exchequer is recognised, and action against it has accordingly been a priority for Revenue over recent years.<\/p><p>Revenue has implemented a comprehensive strategy to tackle the illegal fuel trade, including the introduction of stringent new supply chain controls underpinning a rigorous programme of enforcement action and supported by a range of new legislative measures that I brought forward in Finance Acts. In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from the beginning of April 2015.<\/p><p>Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity. <\/p><p>This work is being supported and facilitated by the setting up earlier this year, in the framework of &quot;A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan&quot;, of a Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts. Under the aegis of this Task Force, a very successful joint initiative between Revenue and HMRC, directed against suspicious movements of substitute fuel with potential for considerable excise and VAT fraud, won the &quot;Outstanding Collaboration&quot; category at the UK Government Counter Fraud Awards in September 2016. This award, from Revenue's perspective, recognises the excellent work and collaboration between Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs on investigations into the illegal movement of suspected substitute fuels. <\/p><p>Revenue also works in close cooperation also with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat the illicit fuel trade.<\/p><p>I understand that the industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in curtailing fuel laundering in Ireland.\u00a0 This view is supported by a significant increase in tax revenues from road diesel over the past three years.\u00a0 An analysis of long term consumption trends for road diesel and marked diesel in Ireland undertaken by Revenue and published on their website at also points to a significant change in the pattern of consumption following implementation of the measures referred to above.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Deputies may also be interested to note that in an intelligence-led operation in December 2016, Revenue enforcement officers supported by the Garda Regional Support Unit, seized two oil tankers, 20,000 litres of laundered mineral oil, 140 bags of bleaching earth, ancillary equipment associated with oil laundering and cash, bank drafts and cheques in excess of &euro;60,000 in the Castleblayney area. This is the first oil laundry detected in this jurisdiction since 2014. <\/p><p>The penalties for offences relating to fuel fraud are laid down in section 119 of the Finance Act 200 and section 102 of the Finance Act 1999. On conviction following summary prosecution under these provisions, a court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both. Where a person is convicted for an indictable offence, the court may impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970, or both. In addition, for an indictable offence under section 119 of the Finance Act 2001, if the value of the fuel concerned in the fraud exceeds &euro;250,000, including duty and taxes, the court may impose a penalty of three times the value of the fuel, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or both. The current levels of fines were introduced by the Finance Act 2010 and represented significant increases over the previous amounts: for example, the fine on conviction for an indictable offence was increased from &euro;12,695 to an amount not exceeding &euro;126,970.<\/p><p>The Courts decide on the amount of the fine to be imposed in any particular case and, in practice, do not apply fines up to the existing limits. There are no proposals at present to increase the level of fines available to the courts. However, the position is kept under review taking account, among other considerations, of the practical experience of the fines imposed under the current provisions.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that Revenue's work against fuel laundering has achieved a considerable level of success, and I am assured that action against fuel fraud will continue to be a high priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700070#WRJ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Availability","counter":510,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700070#WRJ03050"},{"type":"question","counter":511,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[41848\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700070#WRJ03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there is grant aid available to parents of a child with physical disability to install a swivelling seat to allow the child to independently enter and exit the car; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":512,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Drivers &amp;amp; Passengers with Disabilities Scheme provides a range of tax reliefs linked to the purchase and use of specially constructed or adapted cars for the transport of persons with disabilities. \u00a0The scheme is available to persons (including children) who meet specified medical criteria and have obtained a Primary Medical Certificate to that effect from the HSE.\u00a0 The car will qualify under the scheme if it is adapted to take account of the person's disablement, for example the fitting of a swivel seat.

Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance.  These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue's overall staffing levels have reduced from a total of 6,076 full-time equivalents at the start of 2011 to 5,647 at end 2014, they are currently at 5,976.\u00a0 Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities has been maintained at around 2,000 during this period.  I have supported Revenue's case for an increase in staff resources which has seen their allocation increased over the past three budgets, primarily in respect of compliance resources.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are committed to ensuring that enforcement work generally, and action against fuel fraud specifically, will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that the serious threat that fuel fraud poses to legitimate and compliant businesses, consumers and the Exchequer is recognised, and that action against criminal activity of this kind is, and will continue to be, a central element of its work.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has implemented a comprehensive strategy to tackle the illegal fuel trade, including the introduction of stringent new supply chain controls underpinning a rigorous programme of enforcement action and supported by a range of new legislative measures that I brought forward in Finance Acts over recent years.  In addition, Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from April 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Revenue works with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State also cooperate closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity.  I believe that this work is being supported and facilitated by the setting up last year, in the framework of \"A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan\" of the Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue also works in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat the illicit fuel trade.<\/p>  <p>  An analysis of the fuel market undertaken by Revenue in 2015 indicates that the wide-ranging programmes of action taken against fuel fraud have had a significant impact on illegal activity.  This is borne out by feedback from fuel traders and their representative bodies, who report a significant reduction in the incidence of laundered fuel.  In addition, Revenue carried out an extensive random sampling programme early in 2016 which tested for the presence of the new fuel marker in the storage tanks of forecourt fuel retailers.  No samples tested positive for the new fuel marker.<\/p>  <p>  I consider that Revenue's action against fuel fraud has had considerable success, and I am assured that action against criminal activity of that kind will continue to be a high priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700071#WRK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Currency Circulation","counter":536,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700071#WRK01200"},{"type":"question","counter":537,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[41063\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700071#WRK01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated amount of cash to be still unaccounted for in respect of each coin and note of the Irish punt; the arrangements that apply; the amount exchanged for euro in each year since 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":538,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Central Bank that the value of Irish Punt currency outstanding as of 31 December 2016 is as follows:<\/p><p>Banknotes &euro;227,125,638.68<\/p><p>Coin &euro;123,741,177.34<\/p><p>Following the publication of\u00a0the Irish Pound Notes and Coins (Cessation of Legal Tender Status) Order 2001 (S.I.

Relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation on 1 July 2016.

Furthermore, the Central Bank notes that there is strong evidence that banks and non-banks are looking to exhaust available options before moving into the legal process.  Section 4.3 of this report comments on legal proceedings and notes that non-bank entities accounted for 17% of the total stock of repossessed PDH properties in possession as of end-June 2016, with banks accounting for the remaining 83%.  The proportion of legal proceedings that result in an order for possession is higher among the non-bank entities.

The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'. \u00a0Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes, such as the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.  The Act means that any purchasers of loans books are required either to become regulated themselves by the Central Bank or use a regulated credit servicing firm to service their loans. <\/p><p>Finally, it is clear from the most recent Central Bank data on mortgage restructures\u00a0that where a borrower actively engages with their lender under the CCMA\u00a0with a view to agreeing a sustainable arrangement to address their mortgage arrears, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that the borrower will be able to remain in their family home.\u00a0\u00a0The new Abhaile mortgage resolution service, which can be accessed through the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service (MABS) helpline,\u00a0can provide access to independent financial and legal advice at no cost to individual borrowers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700072#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":586,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700072#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":587,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[41553\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700072#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he and his Department continue to monitor the potential affects of Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":588,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[41558\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700072#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps his Department can take to counter the likely negative impact of Brexit on this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":589,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[34564\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700072#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which remedial steps can be taken to address the impact of Brexit on the economy as envisaged in the recent report by his Department in conjunction with the ESRI and the Department of the Taoiseach.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":590,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[1963\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700072#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he and his Department expect to be in a position to counter any negative economic impact arising from Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":591,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 242, 247, 310 and 341 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance has been assessing and preparing for the impact of Brexit since well before the referendum on 23 June 2016.  Work was carried out in the Department to assess the potential economic and financial sector implications arising, including through the ESRI-Department of Finance research programme study published in November 2015 titled 'Scoping the Possible Economic Implications of Brexit on Ireland'.  This work was undertaken within the whole-of-Government framework established by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  Following the result of the UK referendum and to prepare for the forthcoming negotiations, work has been intensified across the whole of Government level including in my own Department.  A new Brexit Unit within the EU and International Division \u00a0was established in July 2016 to oversee and coordinate this work and to act as a key liaison point with the Department of the Taoiseach, in particular.  In addition, the Department\u00a0of Finance staff complement in the Irish Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels has been strengthened.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2017, the Department of Finance published the Economic and Fiscal outlook which presented a full macroeconomic projection including updated estimates of economic growth, the public finances and the fiscal space, taking account inter alia of the impact of Brexit.  In addition, the Department published detailed analysis of sectoral exposure to Brexit across the economy. \u00a0More recently, the Department has worked with the ESRI to deepen the macroeconomic analysis and a report titled 'Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland' was published in November 2016. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 included a number of measures to respond to the challenges of Brexit, to mitigate future risks, and to support any opportunities that might arise.  These include measures to support SMEs, entrepreneurship, agri-food and Irish exporters.  These measures are an important first step in mitigating the impacts on the Irish economy from the economic implications of Brexit.  More information on these measures is available in the Budget documentation.<\/p>  <p>  The best and most immediate policy under the Government's\u00a0control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the\u00a0public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  In this context, Budget 2017 signalled a lower debt target of 45 per cent of GDP for the mid-to-late 2020s.  This will help to provide an additional fiscal 'shock absorber' capacity to the public finances to help withstand any shock including the impact of Brexit.  This will complement the contingency or 'rainy day' fund to be established following the achievement of a balanced budget in 2018 which will help provide a further counter-cyclical buffer. <\/p>  <p>  The work being done by the Department, including the work of Minister of State Murphy T.D. who has responsibility for Financial Services, will be an important input to ensuring that Ireland will be in a position to counter any negative economic impact arising from Brexit and to ensure that Ireland's \u00a0interests are protected in the upcoming negotiations at EU level.\u00a0 The Department will continue to monitor the economic impacts, to carry out relevant analysis and to frame budgetary policy advice in this new\u00a0context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700072#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Competitiveness","counter":592,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700072#WRL01100"},{"type":"question","counter":593,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[41554\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700072#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which this economy remains competitive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":594,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[1970\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700072#WRL01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied regarding the continued competitiveness of the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":595,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 and 348 together.<\/p><p>Significant progress has been made in recent years in improving Ireland's competitiveness.\u00a0 The latest figures from the Central Bank of Ireland\u00a0show that Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator (a widely used measure of competitiveness in Europe) has improved by over 20 per cent between 2008 and November 2016. <\/p><p>The gains in Irish competitiveness achieved since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements and\u00a0wage and price moderation.

Indeed, personal consumption is up 3.2 per cent in the first three quarters of this year on an annual basis. <\/p><p>The economic recovery is most clearly evident in the labour market.  Employment grew by 2.9 per cent (+57,500) over the year to Q3 2016, the sixteenth successive quarter of employment growth.  The increase in employment remains broad based with gains recorded in 12 of the 14 sectors reported by the CSO.<\/p><p>Recent data published indicate that:<\/p><p>- The volume of retail sales increased by 4.3 per cent year-on-year in November 2016.

The sharp depreciation of sterling is the most significant short-term impact arising from Brexit.  While the euro-sterling exchange rate has moderated from the post referendum peak of &euro;1 = &pound;0.90, it remains particularly volatile increasing to almost &euro;1 = &pound;0.87 in recent trading, representing a 13 per cent appreciation since the UK vote.

For example, it has asked the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to\u00a0work with the Central Bank to set out\u00a0options for\u00a0Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and to\u00a0improve the degree of competition and consumer protection. \u00a0Also the Government considers that measures to encourage and promote a greater level of switching in the mortgage market would\u00a0help boost the level of competition in the market for existing mortgages.\u00a0 In particular, the Programme for Government considers that the development of a code of conduct\u00a0for switching mortgage provider would be a useful and practical initiative\u00a0which would have the potential to deliver savings to many existing mortgage holders.\u00a0 As the Deputy will be aware, research carried out by the Central Bank last year\u00a0indicated that a significant number of\u00a0borrowers could make savings by switching mortgages.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in order to promote the option of switching mortgages,\u00a0I have also asked the Central Bank to consider and\u00a0formulate a code in this area and in response the Central Bank has indicated that it has commenced a programme of research on this topic to inform its consideration of this matter.<\/p><p>More immediately,\u00a0it should be noted that the Central Bank is introducing some further protections for variable rate mortgage holders.  The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an , and effective from 1 February, will require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase.  The measures will also improve the level of information to be provided to borrowers about other mortgage products their lender provides that could provide savings for the borrower and signpost borrowers to the CCPC's mortgage switching tool. <\/p><p>It is important also to take account of the diversity of the residential mortgage market which comprises, inter alia, fixed interest rate, loan to value managed variable rate mortgages, trackers, restructured mortgages of various types, etc.\u00a0 Therefore, the residential mortgage market cannot be assessed by only looking at standard variable rate mortgages, and any assessment would need to consider the large number of different factors that influence interest rate pricing.<\/p><p>Overall, the\u00a0Government is of the opinion that real competition among lenders is the best way to ensure that retail mortgage lending rates are further reduced in a sustainable way for the market as a whole but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for new mortgage lending.\u00a0\u00a0This is a policy\u00a0area that the Government will keep under active review in its\u00a0ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders and in implementing the Programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700072#WRL02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Help-To-Buy Scheme Data","counter":611,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700072#WRL03000"},{"type":"question","counter":612,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[41612\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700072#WRL03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of applications to date for the help-to-buy scheme as announced in budget 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":613,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[41613\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700072#WRL03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of applications for the help to buy scheme that have been deemed valid to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":614,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[41614\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700072#WRL03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of successful or pending applications for the help-to-buy scheme in each category (details supplied), in tabular form.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":615,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 to 251, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Help to Buy (HTB) application system was launched on time on the first working day of the New Year, following the announcement of the measure in Budget 2017.

Disposable income refers to the sum of market income received by all household members - gross earnings, self-employment income, capital income - , plus the current cash transfers received, less direct taxes paid, social security contributions and transfers to other households.  Disposable household income is then adjusted for household size.<\/p>  <p>  The income distribution is calculated for each year.

The OECD IDD database also presents data on household disposable income which is arguably a more appropriate metric for comparing movements in income over time.

However, it is important to view these receipts in conjunction with the overall corporation tax receipts for 2016, which were very strong.  Corporation tax receipts closed 2016\u00a0&euro;737 million or 11.1 per cent above target, representing an annual increase of 7.0 per cent.  In relation to the under-performance in December, a contributing factor was a large repayment of c. &euro;150 million, scheduled for October 2016, which was delayed and subsequently paid in December.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, corporation tax refunds and one-off payments are a normal feature of our tax system, which subsequently increases the difficulty in forecasting this tax-head.  While my Department liaises very closely with Revenue's Large Cases Division, which plays a key role in formulating forecasts, corporation tax remains difficult to forecast, due to various company specific and other idiosyncratic reasons.<\/p><p>There are a number of reasons why a company may be entitled to a refund of corporation tax paid.  For example, large companies are required to make preliminary tax payments in the sixth and eleventh months of their accounting period.  The preliminary tax payments are determined either with reference to the company's liability in the previous accounting period, or based on the anticipated liability of the current accounting period.  The actual liability, determined after the end of the accounting period, may be lower than the preliminary tax payments thus resulting in an overpayment of tax.  This could occur where a company's profits are lower than initially forecast.<\/p><p>Secondly, sections 766 and 766A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provide for a tax credit in respect of qualifying expenditure on Research &amp;amp; Development (R&amp;amp;D).  The R&amp;amp;D tax credit must be initially used to reduce the corporation tax liability of the company for the accounting period in which the relevant expenditure is incurred.  Any unused amount may be carried forward and used to reduce the corporation tax liability of subsequent accounting periods.  However, where an excess remains, instead of carrying forward that excess, a company may claim to use it to reduce the corporation tax liability of the preceding accounting period.  If any excess still remains it may still be carried forward and used to reduce the corporation tax liability of succeeding accounting periods.  In the event that there is no corporation tax liability in the current year, the company may claim to have the amount of that excess paid to them by the Revenue Commissioners in 3 instalments over a period of 33 months from the end of the accounting period in which the expenditure was incurred.<\/p><p>Thirdly, where a company incurs a trading loss, section 396A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, allows for this loss to be carried back to the previous accounting period.  As the company would have already paid its liability for the earlier accounting period, such a situation would result in the company being entitled to a refund in respect of that loss.<\/p><p>Finally, circumstances such as company restructurings, mergers and acquisitions, as well disposals of subsidies, amongst others, can result in changes to corporation tax liabilities.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners\u00a0that\u00a0higher-than-profiled repayments in December contributed to the shortfall in corporation tax receipts in that month.  For reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, Revenue is unable to provide further details.  However, it should be noted that, as outlined above, repayments are a normal part of the functioning of the tax system and occur throughout the year.  As indicated in their report on Corporation Tax receipts in 2015, <i><\/i>, repayments of Corporation Tax totalled around &euro;800 million in 2015 and levels are expected to be similar in 2016.

The levy was charged at 35% of the Deposit Interest Retention Tax\u00a0(DIRT) paid by a financial institution in 2011 and raises approximately &euro;150 million annually for the Exchequer.  In the case of a financial institution where the amount of DIRT in the base year does not exceed &euro;100,000,\u00a0the levy is not payable.<\/p>  <p>  In the budget statement two years ago,\u00a0I announced that I intended to extend the levy for a further five years to 2021.  I indicated that the overall yield from the levy would be maintained at &euro;150 million annually but that I would undertake a review of the DIRT based methodology for calculating the\u00a0levy.<\/p>  <p>  That review, which included a public consultation on the issue, was undertaken by my Department in early 2016.  Following that review, I decided that the DIRT based formula should be retained but that the base year for calculating the levy in 2017 and 2018 would be changed from 2011 to 2015.  I have also decided to introduce a rolling two-year series of base years which will introduce a new base year of 2017 for calculating the levy in 2019 and 2020 and a new base year of 2019 for calculating the levy in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the rolling two-year series of base years has a twofold effect.  Firstly, it ensures that financial institutions entering the market over the five further years for which the levy will apply will be subject to the levy and\u00a0financial institutions exiting the market will cease to be subject to the levy.  Secondly, it will help to correct, on an ongoing basis, any anomalies for individual institutions thrown up by prevailing market conditions, such as the interest rate offering, in any one year.<\/p>  <p>  In order to maintain the annual yield from the levy at &euro;150 million, I have to increase the rate at which the levy is\u00a0charged from 35% to 59% for 2017.  This is because the assessable amount, DIRT payments in 2015, have reduced significantly since 2011. This new rate, combined with the new 2015 base year, will preserve the existing contribution of &euro;150 million paid by the affected financial institutions.  That rate will be subject to review to ensure that the yield\u00a0from the levy is not impacted from changes in interest rates and\/or DIRT rates. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700074#WRN03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":737,"content":"<p>Question No. 298 answered with Question No. 85.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Banking Sector","counter":738,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700074#WRN03850"},{"type":"question","counter":739,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[1674\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700074#WRN03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the State will still move to sell off all or part of a bank (details supplied); the estimated timeframe for this; the expected yield to the exchequer; if this yield will be ring fenced for a particular purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":740,"content":"<p>The State's\u00a0shareholding\u00a0in AIB\u00a0is a valuable asset and it is the Government's intention that the State will exit this and our other banking investments in a measured and careful manner.

This is available to self-employed individuals who have an active trade or profession, and who do not have access to the PAYE credit.  This will be a significant benefit to small business-owners right across the country including small retailers, publicans, farmers and tradesmen. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also committed to introduce a PRSI scheme for the self-employed, and in Budget 2017 the Government announced the extension of access\u00a0to Invalidity Pensions to the self-employed.  Invalidity Pension is a pension payment for people who cannot work because of a long-term illness or disability.  When someone develops a long-term illness it can cause serious financial repercussions.  Gaining access to Invalidity Pension will provide the self-employed with a much stronger safety net to protect them in the event of injury or disablement.  The self-employed will gain access to Invalidity Pension on the same basis as employees from December 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Also announced in Budget 2017, is the extension of Treatment Benefits to the self-employed on the same basis as employees.

The Governing Council has also stated that if, in the meantime, the outlook becomes less favourable or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment of the path of inflation, it intends to increase the programme in terms of size and\/or duration.

It is expected that Mr Gentiloni, the previous Italian Foreign Minister, can provide the required continuity as the Italian political system will inevitably need some additional time to take stock and agree a way forward.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note\u00a0that this referendum was about internal constitutional reform in Italy, not about support for the European Union.  In this sense it is entirely different from the UK referendum in June.  The only political parties which took an explicitly anti-EU line during the campaign, and after the results, have no more than 15 per cent of the vote.  And the 59 per cent of No voters will certainly have included people who are pro-European but just did not support the proposed constitutional reforms.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the euro area is now sufficiently robust to\u00a0deal with the fallout from the referendum result.  In this\u00a0regard, I note that there was a relatively muted market reaction to the result.

Deputies will be aware that Revenue has committed to facilitate the appeals process should a taxpayer raise an appeal to the independent Tax Appeal Commission in relation to this issue.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In relation to share based remuneration schemes, in general, employees are subject to income tax on share issues where the employer issues such shares and\u00a0charges\u00a0the\u00a0employee less than the market value for them.  Income tax is due on the difference in the relevant values and\u00a0is generally collected via the PAYE system, while income tax due on share options must be returned within 30 days of the exercise of such options.  In certain cases the relevant shares may be subject to a clog, restricting the employee from selling such shares for a set period of time.  However, notwithstanding this restriction on sale, any income tax due is payable at the time of the share award.<\/p>  <p>  A more favourable treatment may apply under certain Revenue Approved share schemes, but such schemes are subject to a range of restrictions, and are used primarily by larger, quoted companies.  Deputies will be aware that\u00a0I announced my intention to introduce a new, SME focussed share-based remuneration incentive in Budget 2018.  This is a complex undertaking, as a focussed scheme of this nature will need to comply with State Aid regulations, and it is likely to\u00a0require EU approval.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, in the years in which the patronage scheme was active, employees who received share based remuneration in an SME company would in most cases have been subject to income tax on any value received.  As such, there would not appear to be a policy rationale to legislate for different treatment specifically for patronage shares in those years.  Furthermore, an amendment of the nature proposed by the Deputy would be retrospective, in that it would change the tax treatment of transactions occurring in the years 2011 to 2013.  Retrospective changes undermine the certainty of the tax system for all taxpayers and can be subject to Constitutional challenge in the courts, and would not\u00a0be appropriate in this instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700075#WRO02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exchequer Revenue","counter":782,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700075#WRO02950"},{"type":"question","counter":783,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[1755\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700075#WRO03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to tackle black market smuggling here that a recent report stated cost the State &euro;2.35 billion in 2015 in lost revenue; if his attention has been drawn to hardships faced in particular by small retailers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":784,"content":"<p>I am aware of a number of reports that have presented estimates of the losses to the economy and the Exchequer caused by smuggling and illicit trade.

Unless a clear and credible methodology is specified for particular estimates of illicit trade and the resulting losses, they must be viewed as speculative.<\/p>  <p>  It is, nevertheless, accepted by all interested parties that smuggling, and shadow economy activities in general, pose a threat to legitimate and compliant businesses and to consumers, as well as depriving the Government of tax revenues.  Tackling these illegal activities is, therefore, a key priority and Revenue has implemented wide-ranging programmes of action to combat them.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue's actions against the illicit tobacco trade include a range of measures to identify and target those who are involved in the smuggling, supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing those products and prosecuting the persons involved.  This multifaceted strategy also includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, development and sharing of intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, use of analytics and deployment of detection technologies.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has also implemented a comprehensive strategy to tackle the illegal fuel trade, based on the introduction of strict new supply chain controls underpinned by rigorous enforcement action, as well as the very successful introduction, from April 2015, here and in the UK, of a new fiscal marker for marked fuels sourced in cooperation with the UK authorities.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of alcohol, Revenue's action against illicit trade encompasses the full supply chain for alcohol products and includes measures to confront smuggling, the illicit production of alcohol and the supply or sale of illicit products.<\/p>  <p>  Action taken by Revenue against smuggling is directed also at prevention of the importation of counterfeit goods and medicines and illegal drugs.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue works closely with other agencies in the State, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in acting against illegal activities related to smuggling and illicit trade.  The relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a significant proportion of smuggling and other illegal activities.  This work is being supported and facilitated by the Joint Agency Task Force, including Revenue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts, that was established in the framework of \"A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan\".  Under the aegis of this Task Force, a very successful joint initiative between Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs, directed against suspicious movements of substitute fuel with potential for considerable excise and VAT fraud, won the \"Outstanding Collaboration\" category at the UK Government's Counter Fraud Awards in September 2016.  From Revenue's perspective, this award recognises the excellent work and cooperation between Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs on investigations into the illegal movement of suspected substitute fuels.<\/p>  <p>  There is close cooperation also with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat smuggling and illicit trade.<\/p>  <p>  I am assured by Revenue that combatting smuggling and illicit trade is and will continue to be, a core element of their work.  For my part, I have taken action through the Finance Acts over recent years to ensure that Revenue has all the necessary powers to act against these forms of criminal activity and I am satisfied that, as a result, there is a robust legal framework in place that allows effective action to be taken against such crimes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700075#WRO03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":785,"content":"<p>Question No. 317 answered with Question No. 40.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Data","counter":786,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700075#WRO03250"},{"type":"question","counter":787,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[1840\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700075#WRO03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a breakdown by loan owner of the 10,007 PDH mortgages owned by unregulated loan owners as quoted in the third quarter of 2016 Central Bank mortgage arrears statistics publication, page 11; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

To this end, Revenue has established an in-house analytics team of eight permanent staff, supported by a technical services team of an additional four permanent staff. The role of this unit is to use statistical and machine-learning methods to support Revenue's risk assessment and operational decision-making. The focus of the team's work is on detecting potentially suspect anomalies in Revenue data, and on learning from the outcomes of past Revenue interventions in order to target non-compliance more accurately in future.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The particular project referred to falls into the former category: it aims to identify non-compliant income-tax payers by highlighting those whose declared income is unusually low compared to their peers. To identify such taxpayers, the project draws on a wide range of data sources, including third-party information returns made by financial institutions, insurance providers, government bodies, and other tax administrations. \u00a0A predictive model built by Revenue's data analysts then compares each income-tax payer's declared income against the average declared income of other taxpayers with a similar expenditure profile and demographic characteristics.

In fact, NAMA has an established policy of identifying\u00a0to Local Authorities, properties which may be suitable for their purposes.  NAMA has facilitated the sale or lease by its debtors and receivers of properties, at market value, to public bodies for a wide-range of purposes, including social housing; schools; healthcare facilities; and urban economic, environmental and cultural regeneration.  This\u00a0engagement has resulted in\u00a0almost 2,400 units\u00a0being\u00a0acquired by Local Authorities from NAMA debtors through commercial\u00a0sales or leases, with a further 370 units in the pipeline.<\/p><p>To\u00a0streamline delivery under this initiative, NAMA established National Asset Residential Property Services Limited, &quot;NARPS&quot;, to purchase\u00a0suitable properties from NAMA debtors for onward leasing to local authorities or approved housing bodies on the basis of long-term, commercial\u00a0arrangements.  NARPS is both\u00a0consistent with\u00a0NAMA's commercial remit and also\u00a0reduces\u00a0the upfront\u00a0capital required by local authorities to\u00a0secure\u00a0social housing units.<\/p><p>NAMA can only offer and facilitate the take up of units for social housing.  NAMA cannot force the\u00a0take-up of these properties.  This is a reserved matter for Local Authorities which NAMA engages with on this initiative through the Housing Agency and\u00a0Approved Housing Bodies.  NAMA advise that,\u00a0in the majority of cases, NAMA\u00a0was not given detailed reasons as to why the properties were not required by the local authorities.  However, regular liaison between the Housing Agency and NAMA during the process indicated that the main reasons for rejecting available properties was that there was no demand for social housing in some of the geographic locations where the NAMA debtors  properties were located, or that the housing body and local authority felt that it would result in an over-concentration of social housing in a particular area.  During an appearance before the\u00a0Oireachtas Committee\u00a0on Housing and Homelessness, on 12th May 2016,\u00a0chaired by\u00a0the Deputy,\u00a0the NAMA Chairman explained\u00a0that NAMA's\u00a0understanding was that units were not accepted\u00a0&quot;primarily because the units were not in the locations where social housing was needed, or they were too big or too small for their requirement&quot;. <\/p><p>Ultimately, it is a matter for local authorities and the Housing Agency to determine the suitability of properties for social housing.  Neither NAMA, nor the Department of Finance, has a role in reviewing or assessing these decisions or determining\u00a0the ultimate suitability of units offered for sale or lease.  Thus, I would advise the Deputy to\u00a0discuss such a review\u00a0with\u00a0the Department of Housing, Planning, Community, and Local Government, which has responsibility for local authorities and the Housing Agency.

In many cases, a demand for a smaller number of properties in the same development was confirmed with the balance declined on the basis that there was insufficient demand.  These units may have been in unfinished developments outside of urban centres without infrastructural or community supports. <\/p><p>- No\u00a0-\u00a0Sustainable Communities: \u00a01,279 units: \u00a0Includes units\u00a0in areas local authorities\u00a0considered there was already a high concentration of social housing or, by adding additional properties, the concentration would be unacceptable and not consistent with local authorities' commitment to mixed tenure developments.<\/p><p>- Not Suitable: \u00a092 units: \u00a0Includes units\u00a0that local authorities deemed\u00a0were not suitable for social housing, either by virtue of the nature of the development, e.g. holiday home type developments, or the units were in areas of exceptionally high market rents or required high management service charges and therefore were not financially viable to be acquired or leased for social housing purposes.<\/p><p>- Not Available: \u00a01,770 units: \u00a0Includes units that were no longer available to local authorities\u00a0due to having either been sold or let to the private sector prior to the local authority confirming demand.\u00a0<\/p><p>It should be noted that all of\u00a0the units above, which the local authorities deemed as\u00a0&quot;no longer under consideration&quot; are no longer available for reconsideration by\u00a0local authorities\u00a0as all of these units have now either been sold or let.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>I am advised that NAMA continues to liaise with the Housing Agency, when NAMA\u00a0becomes aware of additional availability of units.  Where demand is not confirmed,\u00a0properties are marketed\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0residential sales or rental markets.NAMA advise that there has been no shortage of uptake of these properties in the market.  Almost all remaining\u00a0properties, owned by NAMA debtors, are now either occupied,\u00a0for sale, or in process of being readied for sale. \u00a0<\/p><p>I am also\u00a0advised that NAMA, in its capacity as secured lender, has exposure to\u00a0just 173\u00a0vacant\u00a0residential properties.

A REIT is a collective investment vehicle designed to hold properties in a tax neutral manner.  I am informed by Revenue that there are currently three REIT established and operating in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Part 25A provides, inter alia, that a REIT must distribute to its shareholders at least 85% of property income by way of property income dividends.  In the absence of the REIT tax legislation, non-resident REIT shareholders would not have had any liability whatsoever to Irish tax on REIT dividends.  In order to ensure that tax from foreign REIT investors is retained in the State, the REIT tax legislation specifically provided that Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) would apply to REIT dividends at the standard rate of income tax of 20%.  As such, a non-resident REIT investor who might otherwise be exempt from DWT enjoys no exemption in respect of dividends paid by a REIT.  However, non-resident REIT investors from countries with which Ireland has a tax treaty may be able to reclaim some part of this DWT if the relevant tax treaty allows for this.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The taxation of dividends varies from treaty to treaty, but commonly a source state would retain the right to a withholding tax of up 15% on dividends paid from that state.  Subject to specified exceptions within the treaties, the reduced rate applying to dividends paid to investors resident in the countries mentioned in the Deputy's question, as provided for in the respective double taxation agreements, are as follows: 15% in USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland; 10% in China; 0% in Spain and Australia; and in the case of France and Austria no reduction in the 20% rate applies.  Where the investor is a corporate and holds, generally, 25% or more of the voting power in the company paying the dividend the withholding tax rate can be further reduced.<\/p>  <p>  As no dividends were paid by Irish REITS until 2015, no DWT was deducted in either 2013 or 2014, and consequently no claims for repayment of DWT were made by non-resident investors in either of those two years.  In 2015, DWT amounting to &euro;5,267,914 was collected in respect of dividends paid by Irish REITS, and DWT amounting to &euro;67,955.13 was refunded to non-resident investors in respect of REIT dividends paid in 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700076#WRP02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":826,"content":"<p>Question No. 334 answered with Question No. 75.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Meetings","counter":827,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700076#WRP02650"},{"type":"question","counter":828,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[1932\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700076#WRP02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the details of the meetings he or officials of his Department have had in 2015 and 2016 in relation to private equity funds, investment funds and REITs; the dates on which these meetings took place; the meetings listed which he was personally in attendance at; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Review Office overturns more than 50% of appeals it receives. <\/p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth. I can assure the Deputy that my Department, working with other relevant Departments, Bodies and Agencies, such as the Credit Review Office, will continue to advance policies to ensure the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that viable Irish SMEs have sufficient access to finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700077#WRQ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":866,"qnumday":352,"qnumall":"[1979\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700077#WRQ02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the banking sector is currently meeting the working capital requirements of the farming community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":867,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, supporting SMEs, including those in the farming community, in terms of access to finance has been a cornerstone policy for Government in our efforts to rebuild the economy and bring back jobs.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In terms of monitoring the working capital requirements for SMEs, my Department commissions biannual surveys to ascertain the demand for credit by SMEs.\u00a0 This survey series, most recently conducted by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes on behalf of my Department, is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs.

This increase in apprentice registration is primarily being driven by employers in the electrical, engineering and motor sectors with modest growth occurring in construction related apprenticeships.\u00a0 Budget 2017 saw\u00a0&euro;80 million\u00a0made available from the National Training Fund (NTF).\u00a0 This is &euro;20 million greater than the 2016 allocation\u00a0to provide for increased apprenticeship activity in 2017. The 2018 and future year allocations will be considered through the budgetary process, taking into account forecast\u00a0increased participation\u00a0in\u00a0existing apprenticeships and traineeships and the costs of development and roll out of new\u00a0apprenticeship programmes and career traineeships.<\/p><p>SOLAS regularly conducts evaluations on the imbalances in skills supply and demand in the workplace, including the construction sector and provides forecasts of the apprenticeship requirements over a five year period.\u00a0 SOLAS in partnership with the Higher Education Authority and Education and Training Boards Ireland ensures sufficient training provision and resources are in place to meet the labour market demands for apprentices.\u00a0 SOLAS has recently produced the 2016 National Skills Bulletin (NSB) where shortage indicators are highlighted across a range of construction-related occupations. \u00a0The data and trends provided in the 2016 NSB will feed into the annual\u00a0service planning process which incorporates\u00a0the planning of construction related apprenticeships by SOLAS in conjunction with Education and Training Boards and Institutes of Technology.The forecast for future apprenticeship registrations remains strong and it is predicted that craft based apprentice registrations will continue to grow incrementally up to 2020. SOLAS is working with its partners to ensure adequate capacity exists within the education and training sector to meet this expected increase in apprentice registrations over the next five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700079#WRS00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Psychological Assessments","counter":958,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700079#WRS01000"},{"type":"question","counter":959,"qnumday":384,"qnumall":"[41518\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700079#WRS01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will expedite an educational assessment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":960,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychology service to all primary and post primary schools through an assigned NEPS psychologist and in some cases through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department's website. Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

A range of measures have already been taken to reduce the monthly repayments of these borrowers.<\/p><p>The\u00a0Index Linked Shared Ownership Scheme, which operated from 1999 until 2002, has been revised with regard to the annual indexation of the rental equity balance and rental payments.  The amendments, which came into effect on 1 July 2015, reduce the monthly cost for these borrowers and avoid existing rental equity balances increasing for the\u00a0remaining term.  My Department has issued directions to local authorities outlining the measures and I understand that these changes are being applied to individual loan accounts. <\/p><p>In addition, the variable mortgage interest rate charged to local authority borrowers was reduced to 2.3% with effect from 1 July 201 6, which has helped many Shared Ownership borrowers. <\/p><p>An innovative Shared Ownership Restructuring Option has been available to Shared Ownership borrowers since 1 April 2016.  This new restructuring option involves rolling-up all outstanding debt into a single annuity loan &ndash; i.e. the new restructured loan principal will comprise any outstanding annuity loan balance, rental equity balance, plus any arrears &ndash; with an all-sums-owing mortgage charge applying to the property.  The term of the annuity loan will be determined by the amount of the monthly repayment deemed to be affordable and sustainable for each SO borrower.  This restructuring option allows the borrower to have a regularised, restructured repayment solution which is more easily understood. <\/p><p>This arrangement may be of particular benefit to those SO borrowers who are nearing the end of their annuity term but who have not made sufficient provision for the repayment of their Rental Equity balance.  The feasibility of this new option for each SO borrower will be determined by their local authority, and may not be appropriate in all cases.  For example, in some instances, continuing with the current SO arrangement may be the best option for both the SO borrower and the local authority, or in other cases where the outstanding debt may not be sustainable for the borrower in the long-term, the Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) option might ultimately be the appropriate solution.  Detailed guidance, training and direction have been provided by my Department and the Housing Agency to local authorities regarding the implementation of the measure and my Department is continuing to monitor the impact of the new measure for borrowers.<\/p><p>Local authority borrowers are encouraged to engage with their local authority at the earliest opportunity if they are having difficulty making the repayments on their Shared Ownership arrangement.

In their report, the UN Committee expressed concern at the housing situation in Ireland, and noted in particular the limited supply of social housing and the level of homelessness amongst families and children.  The Committee went on to urge Ireland to adopt policies to tackle these problems. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the report in question reflected the position at the end of 2015. Since the UN Committee's observations were made, the Government has published the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  Under that Action Plan, launched in July 2016, urgent action is being taken to deal with the challenges that currently exist in the housing sector and which were referred to by the UN Committee.  The Plan sets out a clear roadmap to achieve the Government's goals to significantly increase and expedite the delivery of social housing, boost private housing construction, improve the rental market, and deliver on the commitment to see housing supply, in overall terms, more than double to some 25,000 new homes every year by 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan has a particular focus on meeting the housing needs of the most vulnerable members of Irish society.  It is recognised that accommodating family units in hotels is inappropriate for anything other than a short period of time and a very clear target has been set to ensure that by mid-2017, hotels are used only in very limited circumstances for emergency accommodation for families.  With regard to social housing, 47,000 new social housing units will be provided by 2021 under the Action Plan, at a cost of &euro;5.35 billion. <\/p>  <p>  With reference to evictions, I believe that there are now robust legal protections in place across all tenure types to ensure that families are not removed from their homes without access to appropriate redress.  Security of tenure in the social housing sector is well protected by the provisions of the Housing Acts 1966 to 2014. Social housing tenancies are lifetime in nature and evictions can only take place in very limited and prescribed circumstances.  Social tenants have a right under legislation to appeal any decisions made to evict.  However, I know that local authorities are committed to working with their tenants to resolve their housing problems with evictions seen very much as a last resort. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the private rented sector, key concerns for households relate to rent uncertainty and associated security of tenure concerns.  The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 introduced a right to a four year tenancy (recently increased to 6 years), with limited grounds for a termination where a tenant has been in occupation for six months continuously and no notice to quit has been served.  Amendments introduced in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 strengthen the protections around tenancy terminations by providing for measures that will guard against, for example, landlords falsely declaring that the property is needed for a family member, or that it is going to be sold.  In addition, the Act provides for graduated increases in the notice periods that must be given to tenants of the termination of a tenancy so that a landlord must now give a tenant up to a maximum of 224 days' notice for tenancies of 8 years or more.  The Act also provides, inter alia, that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies is increased from 12 to 24 months.  In addition, the Act increased the minimum period of notice of new rent from 28 days to 90 days. <\/p>  <p>  The Strategy for the Rental Sector, which I published in December 2016, is building on this work by introducing a Rent Predictability Measure, to cap rent increases at 4% per year in designated Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs). RPZs have now been given a statutory basis via the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  The measure was introduced with immediate effect in the four Dublin local authority areas and in Cork city. RPZs are to be designated for a maximum period of three years by which time it is anticipated that new supply will have come on stream and pressures will have eased somewhat in the areas concerned.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700083#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates","counter":1180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700083#WRW00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1181,"qnumday":462,"qnumall":"[41103\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700083#WRW00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the status of proposals to increase the powers of local authorities to collect commercial rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1182,"content":"<p>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation pursuant to the Valuation Act 2001.

The scheme was launched in Waterford and Carlow in early October 2016, on a pilot basis, and it is my intention that the scheme will be available nationally by April 2017.   <\/p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an Approved Housing Body (AHB).  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease. <\/p>  <p>  A property owner can either choose to arrange for a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have on-going management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties. <\/p>  <p>  A scheme of this nature will require both significant capital and current exchequer investment expenditure over the next 5 years and therefore must be properly analysed and assessed to ensure the best use of public money.  The purpose of the pilot is to ensure that the scheme is appropriately modelled from a financial perspective but also, and critically, that it is workable from local authorities' and AHBs' perspectives and delivers high quality social housing effectively. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Housing Agency, who are assisting with implementation of the scheme, are in regular contact with the two pilot local authorities and I understand that the pilot is progressing well at a local level. In parallel, my Department is also in contact with other local authorities to assist them with necessary preparations for the rollout of the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Several AHBs are working together with the Waterford and Carlow local authorities to manage the scheme in those particular areas and, as the scheme becomes available nationally, I expect that more AHBs will become involved in its roll out. AHBs have a proven record in managing the refurbishment of properties and their experience puts them in an excellent position to play a key role in the success of the scheme.   <\/p>  <p>  Waterford and Carlow have been advertising the scheme with local media and have made good progress in engagements with property owners.  I understand that they have also been actively targeting properties that they are aware have been vacant for more than a year and would be suitable for social housing within city and town centres.  Equally, Carlow County Council has indicated that many property owners expressing an interest have properties outside of town centres. Inspections of potential units have also commenced in both authorities.  Some of the properties that are being put forward have not been suitable for social housing. In other instances, property owners have opted to explore selling the property to the local authority instead.  The availability of the complementary Buy and Renew scheme, which I also launched in October, means that local authorities and AHBs, will have a range of funding mechanisms available to them to harness the social housing opportunity these vacant properties present. <\/p>  <p>  Over the period 2016 to 2021, it is anticipated that up to 3,500 units will be secured for social housing under this scheme and I have committed to making &euro;140m available over that period.  While the current target for 2017 is 150 units, the interest expressed by property owners and stakeholders so far indicates that the 2017 target will be achieved and may even be exceeded following national rollout.  Depending on the capacity of local authorities and AHBs to deliver under the scheme, as well as the necessary agreement on the financial considerations arising, I would certainly be supportive of the acceleration of delivery under the new scheme.   <\/p>  <p>  I would encourage any local a authorities that are eager to engage early with the scheme to liaise with the pilot local authorities and my Department, in order to be familiar with the requirements around participation and also the practical implementation issues that are being worked through with the pilot scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700083#WRW03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Control of Dogs","counter":1212,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700083#WRW04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1213,"qnumday":472,"qnumall":"[41372\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700083#WRW04100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will introduce additional legislation to deal with the problem of noise from barking dogs in residential areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1214,"content":"<p>Under the provisions of section 25 of the Control of Dogs Act 1986, the District Court may act on a complaint by any person where a nuisance has been created by excessive barking by a dog.

The accelerated delivery to be provided through this programme will contribute to one of the core objectives of the Plan, namely to deliver housing in a way that meets current needs while contributing to wider objectives such as the need to support sustainable urban and rural development and communities.<\/p><p>The results of the 2016 Summary of Social Housing Assessments were published in December 2016 and provide details on the number of households qualified for social housing support across each local authority.  The Summary results will be used to inform the social housing targets to be set on a county by county basis over the period of the Action Plan.  Decisions relating to the location of social housing units within an authority&rsquo;s administrative area are a matter for the authority concerned, by reference to national and local planning and housing policy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700084#WRX01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Reform","counter":1258,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700084#WRX02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1259,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[41887\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700084#WRX02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the process that will be involved in implementing the proposals to amalgamate Galway city and county councils in one new authority; if there will be a plebiscite in the county as a whole on this matter; if legislation will be required to implement this decision; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the elected members of Galway county council passed a resolution rejecting the proposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1260,"content":"<p>An Expert Group was established recently to carry out further detailed examination and planning arising from the report of the Galway Local Government Committee in relation to future local government arrangements in Galway.

The independent Pyrite Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave (i.e. red category) should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated.  Dwellings which have no significant damage but have reactive pyrite in the hardcore material (i.e. amber category) should be monitored and only remediated if they display significant damage due to pyritic heave.  This remains the position with regard to dwellings, which do not display significant pyritic damage.<\/p><p>In response to this recommendation, <i>I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and <\/i><b><i>Categorisation<\/i><\/b>was published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland in late January 2013, and provides the means by which dwellings, which may be affected by pyrite can be tested and categorised.  In broad terms, the national standard sets out a two-step process to facilitate the testing and <b>categorisation<\/b>of dwellings. <\/p><p>The first step requires that a Building Condition Assessment be carried out; this comprises a desktop study and a visual non-invasive internal and external inspection of a dwelling to establish the presence or absence of visible damage that is consistent with pyritic heave and to quantify the extent and significance of such damage in that dwelling.  Damage ratings of 0, 1 or 2 can be assigned to a dwelling under this process.<\/p><p>The second step involves the sampling and testing of the sub-floor hardcore material and is informed by the assignment of the Damage Condition Rating under the Building Condition Assessment process.  At the conclusion of this two-step process, buildings may be categorised under I.S. 398-1:2013 into four categories which are broadly consistent with the traffic light system that was used by the Pyrite Panel as a means of prioritising pyrite remediation works.<\/p><p>The provides for the making of a pyrite remediation scheme by the Pyrite Resolution Board for certain dwellings affected by significant pyrite damage.  The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme, which is available on the Board's website ().<\/p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013.  It is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  There are no proposals to amend eligibility criteria.<\/p><p>In late 2015, the National Standards Authority of Ireland commenced a review of I.S. 398-1:2013 in the light of practical experience since the standard was first introduced in January 2013.  The standard is being updated and revised to reflect the on-site experiences and evidence gathered by technical experts, such as engineers, geologists, professionals providing sampling and testing services and other technical experts, who have been using the standard over the past four years. A public consultation was announced on the revision of I.S. 398-1:2013, which closed on 17 December 2016.

The local authorities and the Housing Agency have been working systematically through these units with NAMA to determine if there is a social housing demand for the properties identified as potentially suitable for social housing. <\/p><p>1,770 of the units, having been initially identified by NAMA as potentially available for social housing prior to consultation with the relevant receiver or owners, were subsequently sold or let privately by the receiver and were therefore recorded as ' No longer available'.  Demand was confirmed by local authorities for 2,751 of the available units and as at end 2016, 2,378 of these have been secured for social housing with the remaining units at various stages of progression. <\/p><p>According to the information available to my Department and Housing Agency, it does not appear to be the case that local authorities rejected properties offered to them by NAMA due to legal title or management issues or because the properties offered were below local authority compliance standards.  In that context, the process is such that the Housing Agency contacts all the relevant local authorities to discuss the demand requirements and to co-ordinate the response to NAMA offers.  Where a demand is identified by a local authority, this information is provided to NAMA and efforts are made to secure as many of the suitable properties as possible for social housing.  It is only once demand is confirmed that more detailed information on the units is provided to either the local authority or to the Approved Housing Body (AHB).  It should be noted that the vast majority of information relating to planning, title etc. would only have come to light during the due diligence process which followed. <\/p><p>It is the established process that property handed over by NAMA is fully remediated to full compliance\u00a0with all construction and building standards, and in compliance with the conditions of planning and local authority regulations.  Additionally, prior to hand-over, any issues relating to legal title or financial matters have been fully regularised.  As a result, no local authority or AHB would be liable for costs relating to remediation works, or legal fees relating to title issues.<\/p><p>The majority of units that have been delivered through this programme had issues requiring resolution, e.g. many in unfinished housing developments.  The variety of these issues have ranged from title issues, imperfect security, judgment mortgages, insolvent owner\/developer, receivership appointments, non-compliance with planning or building regulations, insolvent management companies, non-compliance with Multi-Unit Development Act 2011 etc. \u00a0<\/p><p>The Special Purpose Vehicle (NARPS), established by NAMA, to expedite the transfer of these units has resolved all of these issues for properties it has acquired to ensure that full and marketable title is held.

These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a minimum of 10 years of paid contributions.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age). <\/p>  <p>  In 1986, the Commission on Social Welfare published a range of proposals aimed at developing and enhancing the structure and operation of the social insurance system.<\/p>  <p>  The exclusion of clergy and other religious denominations from social insurance coverage was examined and in this context, it was not considered appropriate to continue to exclude from the system those who are employed in what might be termed secular employment as employees under a contract of service.  The categories involved were religious who are mainly employed in schools, hospitals and other institutions.  They came within the social protection system as employees, insurable at the ordinary or modified rate, as appropriate to their particular circumstances from 1988.  The effect of this is that clergy and people of other religious denominations who are employed in public or private sector employment &ndash; i.e. in schools, hospitals and other public\/social institutions &ndash; are afforded the same level of coverage as other employees in those sectors and generally insurable at PRSI Class A or D, as appropriate.  Those involved in pastoral care only are generally insured as self-employed workers provided they meet the minimum income threshold. <\/p>  <p>  Social insurance contributions (Class S PRSI) were introduced for self-employed people on 6th April 1988.  These contributions provide cover for self-employed people for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widows\/widowers pension (contributory).  In addition to the qualifying conditions above, a person must have paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one contribution year prior to reaching age 66, and all self-employment contributions payable must have been paid in full. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that religious missionaries outside Ireland do not pay PRSI into the Irish social insurance system but can pay voluntary contributions.  If they fulfil the eligibility criteria they may qualify for a State pension contributory. <\/p>  <p>  Where a person is unable to meet the qualifying conditions for a State pension (contributory), or is only eligible for a reduced rate of contributory pension, they may alternatively apply for State pension (non-contributory) amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate which is subject to a means-test.  A person must also satisfy the habitual residence condition, live in the State while getting this pension, be aged 66 or over, have a valid personal public service number, and satisfy a means test.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the habitual residency clause, missionaries who have chosen to resettle in Ireland will be considered to have their main centre of interest in Ireland thereby satisfying the habitual residency clause.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700087#WRAA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service","counter":1456,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700087#WRAA02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1457,"qnumday":555,"qnumall":"[41387\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700087#WRAA03000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of applicants to date to the Abhaile scheme; the number of persons who have been accepted into the scheme; the number of participants who availed of the services of each of an accountant, a mortgage adviser, a personal insolvency practitioner, a solicitor or a court mentor on the basis of a voucher issued by the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1458,"content":"<p>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments.  As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.  <\/p>  <p>  The role of MABS was expanded in 2015 with the establishment of a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS service (DMA MABS) across the MABS network, to help people specifically with home mortgage arrears.  There are now 32 specialist DMA advisers working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.  To date over 2,800 people have availed of the DMA MABS service.  People seeking to access help under the DMA MABS service do not require a voucher to do so.  <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, MABS has established a national network of court mentors.  The mentors attend each listed repossession Court hearing nationwide and provide support to distressed borrowers who are facing the loss of their home and signposting them to the appropriate services.  To date, over 1,300 borrowers have been referred to MABS services through the court mentor service.  Borrowers do not require a voucher to access this service.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2016, an additional initiative was announced by Government.  The scheme, known as Abhaile, further extends the free services already available to borrowers through the DMA MABS service and the court mentor service.  The new voucher based scheme, for which MABS is the gateway, provides access for people, who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to defined levels of independent expert financial and\/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.  Qualification for help under the scheme is based on the borrower meeting the following four conditions: they must be (a) in mortgage arrears on their home; (b) insolvent; (c) at risk of losing their home because of their mortgage arrears; and (d) reasonably accommodated. <\/p>  <p>  The new services are provided by professionals drawn from one or more panels of solicitors, personal insolvency practitioners or accountants.

To date, 3,732 vouchers for services have been issued in respect of 2,468 principle private residences.  Of the vouchers issued to date, 3,013 relate to the provision of personal insolvency practitioner services, 600 for legal advice services on issues related to mortgage arrears, and 119 for legal aid services relating to Section 115A Appeals, as defined under the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015.

This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  <\/p><p>In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  <\/p><p>Reversing this measure would have a significant Exchequer cost.  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, it is anticipated that well over half of that cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 is likely to be in the region of &euro;80 million, and this is expected to increase over time.<\/p><p>Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.<\/p><p>The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.<\/p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform is responsible for the terms and conditions of employment and pensions of public servants, including the age at which they may be required to retire.  An interdepartmental group on fuller working lives was chaired last year by that department to consider policy around retirement age in both the public and private sectors and it reported in August.  Any question regarding the work of that group, and the retirement age of public servants, may be addressed to the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy<b>.<\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700088#WRBB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Free Travel Scheme","counter":1481,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700088#WRBB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1482,"qnumday":564,"qnumall":"[41524\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700088#WRBB00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if consideration has been given to indicating on a disabled person's free travel companion pass that they are allowed to be accompanied by more than one carer in the exceptional circumstances where two persons are required due to the patient's condition; and his views on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1483,"content":"<p>The current free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.

Following a review of best practice in other countries and taking account of advice  and recommendations from a number of expert groups and bodies (including the OECD, NESC and CESI) and a consultation process within Ireland it was decided to develop the JobPath service to increase capacity under a &lsquo;payment by results&rsquo; contract model.

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid at a higher rate under that scheme than those with more intermittent contributions made during their working life. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory, whether at full or reduced level.  These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a minimum of 10 years. Provided a person satisfies all the relevant conditions, they may qualify for a State pension contributory, the minimum personal rate of which is &euro;93.20, and the maximum personal rate of which is &euro;233.30.<\/p>  <p>  Since the contributory pension was introduced in 1961, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age). <\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA.  It is planned that, following receipt and analysis of data from the forthcoming independent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, a consultation process will be conducted in the middle of this year, and following this, proposals on the final details of the scheme will be made by the Government to the Oireachtas before the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s worth noting that this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.

This provides cover for self-employed people for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widows\/widowers pension (contributory).<\/p>  <p>  Social welfare legislation stipulates that a self-employed contributor shall not be regarded as satisfying the qualifying conditions for State pension (contributory), unless all outstanding self-employment contributions have been paid by him\/her in full.  Where contributions are paid subsequent to a claimant&rsquo;s 66th  birthday, State pension (contributory) can only be awarded from the date on which the self-employment liability has been fully discharged.  These provisions are consistent with the contributory and solidarity principles which underpin the social insurance system.<\/p>  <p>  In the event that a person has not paid the required PRSI contributions to qualify for a State pension (contributory), they may make a claim to the State pension (non-contributory), subject to their satisfying the qualifying conditions for that payment.  The maximum rate of that pension is 95% that of the maximum contributory pension rate, and while it is means-tested, over 70% of recipients receive it at the full rate.  If a person only qualifies for this payment at a reduced rate, they will generally have more means, when the payment is taken into account, than a person wholly dependent upon the State pension.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note matters related to the collection of tax are outside the responsibility of my Department, and should be pursued with the Revenue Commissioners.

However, she did not qualify for SPNC due to her means, and was unsuccessful in her appeal of this decision.<\/p>  <p>  In assessing means for social assistance payments such as SPNC, account is taken of the income and the value of property of the claimant and his or her spouse\/partner, where applicable.  Social welfare legislation provides that the yearly value of property, including capital, owned but not personally used or enjoyed is assessable for means-testing purposes.  Such property includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares as well as houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use.  However, it does not include property such as the family home a person is personally using or enjoying i.e. residing in or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business.<\/p>  <p>  The current market value of the relevant property is established (having regard to local property prices) as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages on that property.  The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is assessed by reference to a notional formula. <\/p>  <p>  The current assessment method, involving a disregard of an initial amount of capital and an increasing notional weekly value for amounts in excess of the disregarded amount, applies for most welfare schemes.  The formula reflects the policy of ensuring that those with property and capital of modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support while those with larger amounts avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs.  This approach is one of the key elements of a means-tested income support system.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that it is open to this person to re-apply for SPNC if her circumstances have changed or to apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance if the resources currently available to her are insufficient to meet her needs.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700092#WRFFFF02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illness Benefit Eligibility","counter":1727,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700092#WRFFFF02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1728,"qnumday":648,"qnumall":"[1475\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700092#WRFFFF02700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the entitlements of a person on a community employment scheme if he or she becomes ill or is injured short term and does not have enough PRSI contributions to avail of illness benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It is not necessarily the case that the first decision was incorrect.  It is often the case that new evidence is provided with an appeal and that, as a result, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person.  This occurred in some 37 per cent of favourable appeal outcomes in 2016 (5,100 cases) and some 35 per cent of favourable appeal outcomes in 2015 (5,200 cases).<\/p><p>Where the decision was not revised by the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds.  In addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may influence the outcome of the appeal.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, appeal processing times are kept under constant scrutiny by the Chief Appeals Officer and significant effort and resources have been devoted in recent years to reducing the length of time taken to finalise an appeal.  As a result good progress has been made in this regard as outlined in the following table.<\/p><p>The average time taken to determine an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced from a peak of 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 28.6 weeks in 2014, 25.5 weeks in 2015 and 24.1 weeks in 2016 and the average time taken to finalise an appeal decided by way of a summary decision dropped from 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 21.1 weeks in 2014, 18.1 weeks in 2015 and 17.6 weeks in 2016.<\/p><p>The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved.  However the system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information at all stages.  The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which require a high level of judgement, and the need to ensure due process and natural justice.<\/p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that the further reduction of appeal processing times will continue to be a priority for her office.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<table><tr><th colspan=\"6\">Appeal Receipts and Percentage of Favourable Decisions of Appeals Finalised <br \/><br \/>2012 &ndash; 2016<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Appeal Receipts<\/td><td>Appeals <br \/><br \/>Finalised<\/td><td>Favourable Decisions<\/td><td>Appeals Disallowed<\/td><td>Withdrawn<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>35,484<\/td><td>32,558<\/td><td>50.4%<\/td><td>42.6%<\/td><td>7.0%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>32,777<\/td><td>38,421<\/td><td>55.0%<\/td><td>39.0%<\/td><td>6.0%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>26,069<\/td><td>31,211<\/td><td>56.5%<\/td><td>37.7%<\/td><td>5.8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>24,475<\/td><td>25,406<\/td><td>58.8%<\/td><td>36.1%<\/td><td>5.1%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>22,461<\/td><td>23,220<\/td><td>59.2%<\/td><td>35.9%<\/td><td>4.9%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><table><tr><th colspan=\"3\">Appeal Processing Times 2012&ndash; 2016 <\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Average processing times (weeks)<br \/><br \/>Summary Decisions<\/td><td>Average processing times (weeks)<br \/><br \/>Oral Hearings<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>27.8<\/td><td>39.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013 <\/td><td>25.8<\/td><td>33.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>21.1<\/td><td>28.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>18.1<\/td><td>25.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>17.6<\/td><td>24.1<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700092#WRFFFF03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Appeals","counter":1739,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700092#WRFFFF03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1740,"qnumday":652,"qnumall":"[1540\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700092#WRFFFF03900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when arrears of jobseeker's allowance will be paid to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1741,"content":"<p><b><\/b>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an oral hearing of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance appeal of the person concerned was scheduled for 10.45 am on Thursday, 12 January 2017 in the Prince of Wales Hotel, Athlone.

Nevertheless, my Department recognises that abuse of the welfare system is an ongoing reality and must be tackled proactively.  Anti-fraud measures are set out in the Department&rsquo;s Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018 and are designed to prevent and detect fraud, to ensure effective oversight of schemes, to pursue prosecution of offenders and the recovery of any overpaid entitlements identified.  The Strategy and annual reports on implementation is published on the Department&rsquo;s website &ndash; <i>www.welfare.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>All Departmental staff exercise a control and compliance function in processing new applications and reviewing existing entitlements.  The systems used to support schemes are also designed  to detect wrongful claiming and to highlight anomalies.  In addition, the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate undertakes detailed examination of claims on a risk assessed and random basis.  This is supplemented by at least three fraud and error surveys of Departmental schemes annually.  The findings from these surveys support the design and targeting of control actions on schemes, as is found necessary.  These survey reports are published and subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p>In addition, the Deputy should note that my Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit, which comprises trained inspectors and Garda officers, is tasked with undertaking targeted and systematic examination of claims to tackle fraud and to work with other enforcement agencies to identify more serious breaches of the law.<\/p><p>Cross-functional and targeted actions are undertaken - both internally and in joint operations with other national and international agencies - to ensure a strategic response to high risk sectors or where fraud is considered to be most prevalent.  In particular, actions are focused on sectors of the economy where there is a risk of concurrent working and claiming social welfare payments.<\/p><p>Overall, my Department conducts of the order of one million claim reviews annually.<\/p><p>The Deputy should also note that the continued roll-out of the Public Services Card has considerably reduced the potential for identity fraud and the Department has deployed identity and analytics software and other intelligence systems to reinforce its fraud prevention work.  Members of the public also play an important role in supporting these anti-fraud activities and some 19,000 reports from concerned citizens have been received during in 2016.<\/p><p>The Department seeks the recovery of all sums overpaid and its ability to recover overpayments has been strengthened by recent legislative provisions and the introduction of a modern debt management system at the end of 2014.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.<\/p><p>Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing every year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing almost &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable as life expectancy increases.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.<\/p><p>In advance of the abolition of the State pension (transition), in 2012 an Interdepartmental Working and Retirement Group convened to discuss the wide range of issues impacting on the labour market participation of older workers; enterprise issues and employment and equality law issues.  This was in order to consider cross departmental policy issues that may support longer working and thereby improve the sustainability and adequacy of the pensions system.<\/p><p>This Group confirmed that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age of retirement is a matter for agreement in the contract of employment between employees and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.<\/p><p>In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  To accommodate situations where this may not be possible, specific new measures were put in place within my Department which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.<\/p><p>Matters relating to employment and equality legislation do not fall under the remit of the Department of Social Protection.  However, with reference to any<b><\/b>discrepancy between retirement age and pension age resulting from retirement compelled by employers, I can confirm that in 2015 the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act amended Irish equality legislation to set out the grounds on which employers must justify the setting of particular retirement ages, such grounds being underpinned by the provisions of the Employment Equality Directive.<\/p><p>More recently, in January 2016, an Interdepartmental Group on Fuller Working Lives, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was established specifically to examine the implications arising from prevailing retirement ages.  The final report of the Group made a number of recommendations to support working and retirement practices.  This included a request to the Workplace Relations Commission to prepare a Code of Practice under Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to help manage the engagement between employers and employees regarding retirement issues and longer working.  The final report, the recommendations of which were accepted by Government in August 2016, is available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700093#WRGG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":1758,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700093#WRGG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1759,"qnumday":658,"qnumall":"[1581\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700093#WRGG00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of a carer's allowance application in resect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1760,"content":"<p>I confirm that my department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question on 28 October 2016.

EU membership has been central to Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social progress of recent years.  Now, more than ever, our membership of the EU must remain at the heart of our engagement with the wider world.  Continued EU membership guarantees access to a Single Market of 500 million consumers and is vital to the economic well-being of the Irish people.  In facing the challenges of the UK withdrawal from the EU, the priority areas for the Government also remain unchanged &ndash; this is about our citizens, our economy, Northern Ireland, our Common Travel Area and the future of the EU itself.  We continue to outline these priority issues at all of our meetings with EU counterparts &ndash; at both official and political level.  From an EU perspective, the Taoiseach, the Minister of State for European Affairs and I remain actively engaged with our European counterparts, as do other Ministers and senior officials.  At this critical phase, building on the round of contacts I have had since 23 June with each one of my EU counterparts, efforts are intensifying to ensure that an understanding of our priority issues is reinforced and factored into negotiations with the UK when these formally commence. I spoke with several EU Foreign Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels yesterday, and had an in-depth discussion with the newly appointed Spanish Foreign Minister; I plan to meet more of my colleagues in the period ahead. My officials have also had a range of recent engagements with their colleagues in other EU Member States and with the EU institutions, and these will continue in the weeks and months to come.    In parallel, the Government continues to engage closely with the UK government and the devolved administrations and of course more broadly with Northern Ireland, including through the All-Island Civic Dialogue. The Taoiseach met with Prime Minister May in July last and is due to meet her again at the end of January. I have met with the UK Secretary of State for Exiting the EU and his Parliamentary Under Secretary, as well as the UK Foreign Secretary and on a number of occasions, with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  There have also been very constructive discussions at political and official level within the framework of the British Irish Council, while the First Minister of the Scottish Government, Nicola Sturgeon, visited Dublin at the end of November and met with me in Iveagh House.<\/p>  <p>  Our planning ahead of the negotiations &ndash; both for the risks and opportunities for Ireland &ndash; is currently intensifying and Departments are deepening and refining their understanding of the key issues.

The present rules are set down in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which Ireland became a party in 1996.  The Convention extended the maximum permissible limits of a coastal state&rsquo;s territorial sea from three nautical miles to 12 and, by creating the new exclusive economic zone, extended the maximum exclusive fishery limits to 200 nautical miles.  Provision for these rules of international law is currently made in statute by Part 3 of the 2006 Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, which replaced and updated the Maritime Jurisdiction Acts 1959-1988.  <\/p>  <p>  The outer limits of the territorial sea in the Irish Sea are established by reference to Section 83 of the 2006 Act, which provides that the limits are &lsquo;the line every point of which is at a distance of 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline.&rsquo;  The baseline is defined by section 85 of the Act and means that in the Irish Sea the outer limit of the territorial sea is the line every point of which is at a distance of 12 nautical miles from the coast of the mainland or of any off-shore island.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 88 of the Act &lsquo;the exclusive fishery limits of the State comprise all seas that lie inside the outer limit of the exclusive economic zone.&rsquo;  The outer limits of the exclusive economic zone are established by section 87 of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union member states have transferred to the Union exclusive competence for the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy.  That policy rests on the principle of equal access to fishing grounds within the member states&rsquo; 200 mile fisheries limits, which in turn is a concept that stems from the fundamental Treaty principle of non-discrimination among member states.  <\/p>  <p>  As a temporary derogation from that policy the arrangements made under the 1964 London Fisheries Convention for fishing within 12 miles of the coasts of the states in North West Europe have been maintained within the European Union, and were again temporarily preserved for a ten year period at the time of the most recent reform of the common fisheries policy in 2013.  The 1964 Convention allowed the states concerned to extend their exclusive fisheries limits to 12 nautical miles at a time when international law permitted a territorial sea of just three miles in breadth, subject to the condition that the vessels of states that had traditionally fished in the six to 12 mile band be allowed to continue doing so.   These limits, and the arrangements applying within them, are currently set out in Irish law in the 1984 Fisheries Limits (European Communities) Regulations.  <\/p>  <p>  The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in 1989 that the six and 12 mile limits established by the 1964 Convention cannot be altered for the purposes of the common fisheries policies to take advantage of subsequent developments in international law because the arrangements that apply within them are a derogation from the principle of equal access and non-discrimination under European law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700094#WRHH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":1822,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700094#WRHH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1823,"qnumday":681,"qnumall":"[1881\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700094#WRHH02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the engagement which has taken place with the new ambassador to the European Union from the United Kingdom by Irish officials and representatives in Brussels.","asker":"1276","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1824,"content":"<p>I can confirm that our Permanent Representative to the EU met with the new UK Permanent Representative at last week&rsquo;s Committee of Permanent Representatives (Coreper II) meeting.

Similar concerns about the protection of children exist in relation to many other states besides Israel, both elsewhere in the Middle East and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700094#WRHH04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":1851,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700094#WRHH04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1852,"qnumday":691,"qnumall":"[41379\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700094#WRHH05000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the plight of the Rohingya people in Myanmar, Burma;

We in Ireland understand that building peace and trust takes time, and that there is a need to ensure that respect for the human rights and access to livelihoods for all communities is central to enabling long-term peace and stability.<\/p>  <p>  However, as I noted in Parliamentary Question 255 on 15 December 2016, the Government is deeply concerned about recent violence in Rakhine State. The Government calls for an end to this violence, and is of the view that there is a pressing need for an impartial, independent investigation into allegations of human rights violations in this region, as well as the full restoration of access for humanitarian aid.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department met recently with members of the Rohingya Community in Ireland and representatives of Burma Action Ireland to discuss their views and information they had collected from families and friends in Myanmar\/Burma, some of which involved allegations of serious human rights abuses.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been active in raising our concerns at bilateral level with the authorities in Myanmar\/Burma. We have also been active in raising our concerns in the context of our membership of the EU and the UN, where the situation in Rakhine State continues to receive attention since the latest outbreak of violence began in October 2016. <\/p>  <p>  There has been no change in the diplomatic relations between Ireland and Myanmar\/Burma, since the reports emerged. Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Bangkok, which is accredited to Myanmar\/Burma, is monitoring the situation closely. Earlier this month Ambassador Brendan Rogers travelled to Nay Pyi Taw and Yangon, where he raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the situation in Rakhine State with Minister of State for Foreign Affairs U Kyaw Tin. He conveyed the Government&rsquo;s recognition of the complexity of the issues involved, while urging the Government of Myanmar to ensure that allegations of human rights violations are addressed, and to restore access to the region for humanitarian aid and the media. <\/p>  <p>  On 9 December 2016, the Embassy joined a number of like-minded diplomatic missions in a statement which expressed serious concerns about access for humanitarian aid to the region. The statement welcomed the Government of Myanmar&rsquo;s agreement to allow a resumption of humanitarian assistance and initial deliveries to some villages, but expressed serious concerns about delays and urged Myanmar&rsquo;s authorities to overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented a full resumption. In relation to attacks against security personnel in Rakhine State and allegations of abuse in the subsequent security operations, the statement said that security forces must ensure protection of all civilians, and that the creation of an Investigation Commission offers an opportunity to investigate these incidents and allegations objectively and transparently, as well as expose acts of violence and abuse.<\/p>  <p>  The third EU-Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue took place on 22 November 2016. At the meeting, the EU similarly expressed concerns about the recent security and human rights situation in northern Rakhine state, reiterating calls for an independent, credible investigation into both initial attacks and subsequent actions, as well as for the urgent re-opening of humanitarian access to the populations in need.<\/p>  <p>Ireland also supported the EU-led resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar\/Burma at the 31st session of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in March, which conveyed the HRC&rsquo;s serious concerns over human rights violations in the country, including the situation in Rakhine State and particularly with respect to religious and ethnic minorities, including the Rohingya minority. Ireland also raised this issue in a statement at the 32nd   session of the HRC in June 2016 and during the review of Myanmar&rsquo;s human rights record at the HRC&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review in November 2015. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to these efforts, Ireland has provided development assistance and humanitarian aid to address the needs of people in Rakhine State, including the Rohingya community. Since 2014 Ireland has provided &euro;284,000 to Plan International for interventions in the region. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Government is of the view that the underlying root causes of tensions in Rakhine State must be addressed with long-term solutions led by the Government of Myanmar\/Burma. The need to guarantee respect for human rights and the rule of law for all people in Myanmar\/Burma remains central to achieving this. Ireland has also called for more investment in early recovery and support for livelihood opportunities for both the Rohingya and Buddhist communities in Rakhine State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700094#WRHH05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":1860,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700094#WRHH05800"},{"type":"question","counter":1861,"qnumday":692,"qnumall":"[41410\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700094#WRHH05900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to re-open the Irish Embassy in Iran; the steps being undertaken by the Government to promote and grow trade links between the two countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1862,"content":"<p>My Department takes a range of factors into account when considering the expansion of the Embassy and Consular network overseas.

The aim of these rules is to promote an open,\u00a0competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate in favour of a particular candidate on grounds such as location or\u00a0existing relationship with the contracting authority that is carrying out a tender process and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.  The Remedies Regulations allow tenderers or candidates who feel that a procurement process was not carried out in an open, and transparent manner the option of seeking recourse from the courts.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition,\u00a0the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), offers a service known as the Tender Advisory Service (TAS) which\u00a0is designed to give an informal outlet for potential suppliers to raise concerns in relation to a particular live tender process.\u00a0 The primary objectives of the service are to improve communications with suppliers and increase professionalism and consistency in how procurement processes are carried out across the public service. \u00a0Engagement with the service in no way impedes the rights of individuals to pursue their rights formally under the aforementioned\u00a0Remedies legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to\u00a0bear in mind that public procurement is a competitive process aimed at\u00a0delivering much needed\u00a0public goods,\u00a0services and works in a sustainable manner.  In such processes it is inevitable that there will be a number of unsuccessful tenderers.\u00a0 It is recommended that unsuccessful tenderers be given an objective assessment of the comparative strengths and weaknesses of their tenders having due regard to commercial sensitivity and the need to avoid compromising the rights or competitive situation of other tenderers.  There are important benefits from giving constructive feedback to unsuccessful bidders.  For contracting authorities it can identify ways of improving the process for the future; encourage better quality of future\u00a0bids; help establish the public sector as a fair and\u00a0open buyer; and, encourage continued participation by suppliers which promotes competition.  For tenderers it can generate confidence and reassurance about the integrity of the process; help improve future performance; help them understand and operate the different procedures and practices that might apply in the public sector. <\/p>  <p>  The OGP will continue to examine ways to improve the quality and content of\u00a0communication and feedback during tender processes.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700097#WRLL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","counter":1990,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700097#WRLL01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1991,"qnumday":742,"qnumall":"[1767\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700097#WRLL01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of the case presented by community employment supervisors to have access to a pension scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":1992,"content":"<p>The\u00a0issue of pension entitlements for Community Employment Scheme Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors was the subject of a Labour Court recommendation in 2008.

This Regulation has been given effect in Irish law by the European Union (Provision of Food Information to Consumers) Regulations 2014 and 2016.  These Regulations provide for a mandatory nutritional declaration on pre-packed foods indicating the amounts of energy, fat, saturates, carbohydrates, protein, sugars and salt per 100g\/100ml of the food product.  This nutritional declaration for pre-packed foods became mandatory from 13th December 2016.<\/p><p>In addition to the above requirements food business operators may also present these details per portion size, if desired.

Following reports of narcolepsy among children and adolescents who were vaccinated with Pandemrix in Ireland, a National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee was established to conduct a retrospective population based study in relation to the Irish data.  This Committee comprised expertise in the areas of epidemiology, neurology, paediatrics and paediatric neurology.   <\/p>  <p>  The study found that there was a 13 fold higher risk of narcolepsy in children\/adolescents vaccinated with the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine compared with unvaccinated children\/adolescents.  The development of narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination is not a uniquely Irish issue.  The results from the Irish data concur with those observed in Finland and Sweden. <\/p>  <p>  As of 16 January 2017, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 81 reports with clinical information confirming a diagnosis of narcolepsy in individuals who were vaccinated with Pandemrix (80) and Celvapan (1).  The majority of these reports relate to children\/adolescents (latest numbers).<\/p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills continue to work together to provide a wide range of services and supports for those affected by narcolepsy following the administration of pandemic influenza vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE's Advocacy Unit acts as liaison with service and support providers and other Government Departments to facilitate access to required services.  It is in regular contact with individuals affected and regularly meets with representatives of the SOUND (sufferers of unique narcolepsy disorder).  Regional co-ordinators have been appointed to assist individuals by providing advice, information and access to local services.<\/p>  <p>  The ex-gratia health supports include clinical care pathways to ensure access to diagnosis and treatment, multi-disciplinary assessments led by clinical experts, counselling services for both the individuals and their families, discretionary medical cards for those who have been diagnosed have been provided to allow unlimited access to GP care and any prescribed medication, ex-gratia reimbursement of vouched expenses incurred in the process of diagnosis and treatment, including travel expenses for attending medical appointments; physiotherapy, occupational therapy assessments, dental  assessments and dietary services all on a needs basis. <\/p>  <p>  Work is underway on the proposed Centre of Excellence for Narcolepsy based in St James's Hospital which will cater for all people diagnosed with narcolepsy, including those diagnosed with narcolepsy after receiving pandemic influenza vaccine.  In relation to the queries raised by the Deputies, as these are service issues, I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700100#WROO08000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":2222,"qnumday":815,"qnumall":"[41059\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700101#WRPP00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an application for a hearing aid by a person (details supplied).","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2223,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700101#WRPP00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services Waiting Lists","counter":2224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700101#WRPP00500"},{"type":"question","counter":2225,"qnumday":816,"qnumall":"[41065\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700101#WRPP00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the delay in the treatment of a person (details supplied) on the list for orthodontic surgery at St. James's Hospital, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2226,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700101#WRPP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2227,"content":"<p>Question No. 817 answered with Question No. 814.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":2228,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700101#WRPP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2229,"qnumday":818,"qnumall":"[41067\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700101#WRPP00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an operation in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 7; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1239","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2230,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health. The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. <\/p><p>Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers. Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests. NIAC recommended that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  <\/p><p>Gardasil is the HPV vaccine used in Ireland in the context of the HSE schools immunisation programme,.  By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil had been distributed worldwide. In Ireland over 620,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 220,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.<\/p><p>No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use. The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level. In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland. The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  <\/p><p>The HSE provides information for parents about diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and side effects to allow them to choose whether or not to give consent to vaccination.  All vaccination information provided to parents is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet.  The information booklets include information on the most common adverse events that can occur after each vaccination.  Seizures, muscle weakness, leg pain, joint pain and chronic fatigue are not mentioned as known side effects to Gardasil in the Patient Information Leaflet.  There are no known long term side effects to the vaccine Gardasil.  The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults as the average reading age in Ireland is 12 years of age.  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions. <\/p><p>Should parents require additional information about vaccines the immunisation leaflet refers to the HSE's national immunisation website ().  The national immunisation website has been accredited by the World Health Organisation for credibility, content and good information practices.  The website allows members of the public to contact the National Immunisation Office to ask a question if they require further information.  These questions, when possible, are answered by the staff of the National Immunisation Office within one working day.<\/p><p>I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women. An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter's condition. It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services. The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.<\/p><p>The benefits of HPV vaccines  outweigh the known side effects.  The safety of these vaccines, as with all medicines, will continue to be carefully monitored and will take into account any future new evidence of side effects that becomes available.  I encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.<\/p><p>My Department has contacted the HSE who have confirmed that as the Gardasil vaccine has been approved for use in the European Union by the European Medicines Agency there is no requirement for indemnity.<\/p><p>Finally my Department has carried out a search in the Minister's Office and Constituency Office and found no record of the e-mail which Deputy Healy-Rae refers to.

The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill contains a suite of meaningful measures to reduce the level of harmful consumption of alcohol in Ireland.  The aim of the legislation is to reduce alcohol consumption and the harms caused by alcohol. The Bill includes provisions for:<\/p><p>- minimum unit pricing;<\/p><p>- health labelling of alcohol products;<\/p><p>- the regulation of advertising and marketing of alcohol;<\/p><p>- the regulation of sponsorship;<\/p><p>- separation of alcohol products in mixed trading retail outlets; and<\/p><p>- the regulation of the sale and supply of alcohol in certain circumstances<\/p><p>The Bill provides for restrictions on the display, advertisement and visibility of alcohol products in mixed trade retail outlets.  These provisions address concerns that alcohol is not an ordinary consumer product but a psychoactive drug that requires a licence for sale.  The separation and reduced visibility of alcohol products in the manner prescribed will achieve the following objectives:<\/p><p>- access to alcohol products will be controlled in premises to which it applies;<\/p><p>- alcohol products cannot be on open display near grocery products, thereby discouraging impulse purchases and the purchase of alcohol products as part of everyday household grocery shopping;<\/p><p>- separate display of alcohol products or closed display in storage units will make alcohol products less visible to children and protect them from in-store marketing techniques.<\/p><p>The range of options provided for in Section 20 of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill addresses the reasonable need for flexible implementation of the requirements.  The provisions in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill represent a significant compromise from the provisions set out in Section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, which required a separate walled area with its own point of sale for alcohol products.<\/p><p>The Bill commenced Committee Stage in the Seanad on the 26 October 2016.

In addition to an authorisation from the HPRA, clinical trials also require a positive opinion from an ethics committee that is recognised by the Department of Health, prior to being commenced.  The types of trials authorised range from first-in-man trials for new medicines to studies with medicines which already have marketing authorisations.<\/p>  <p>  Clinical trials in Ireland are governed by the European Communities (Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products for Human Use) Regulations 2004, S.I. No. 190 of 2004. These Regulations transposed into Irish law the provisions of Council Directive 2001\/20\/EC and superseded the Control of Clinical Trials Acts 1987&ndash;1990 for clinical trials using medicinal products.  <\/p>  <p>  The Regulations require that all clinical trials covered by the provisions of the Regulations are designed, conducted and reported in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), a set of internationally recognised ethical and scientific quality requirements that must be observed for clinical trials involving human subjects.  Compliance with GCP provides assurance that the rights, safety and wellbeing of trial subjects are protected, and that the results of the clinical trials are accurate and credible.  <\/p>  <p>  As the competent authority for the Regulations, the HPRA may carry out GCP inspections of trial sites in order to establish compliance with relevant legislation and guidelines. A trial site can be defined as any location where trial-related activities are conducted. Therefore, an inspection can occur at an investigator site, sponsor company site, laboratory site, manufacturing site or at other establishments deemed appropriate by the regulatory authority.  The HPRA also requires that an annual safety report is submitted for any trial which is ongoing in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Any member of the public who has concerns over the conduct of a specific clinical trial for a medicinal product should contact the HPRA in the first instance.

This is an area of significant priority that my Department is actively progressing in partnership with the HSE and the health services.  <\/p><p>The importance of, and the opportunity for, eHealth or digital health to support health care reform and the delivery of a modern health care system has been recognised for quite some time.  In 2013, the Government approved and published a strategy for developing eHealth capability in the Irish health system called the <i>eHealth strategy for Ireland, 2013.  <\/i>This strategy sets out a number of objectives and a road map for the delivery and implementation of eHealth for the benefit of patients. The Government eHealth strategy draws heavily on and incorporates many aspects of the work done by the EU Task Force set up in 2011 to look at the potential for eHealth<i>. <\/i>A number of the elements of the strategy have been progressed with the recruitment of a Chief Information Officer within the HSE to lead out on eHealth initiatives, the development of a system of identifiers with a legal basis with the passing of the Health Identifiers Act 2014 and the development by the HSE of an EHR (Electronic Health Record) business case.  <\/p><p>The Health Identifiers Act, passed in July 2014, provides for a system of identification for patients, professionals and providers in support of patient safety and administrative efficiency.  The implementation of an Individual Health Identifier (IHI) for Ireland will allow the identification of patients in multiple health settings, both public and private, in a secure and confidential way and will support improved patient safety.  <\/p><p>A core deliverable for eHealth is the development of a longitudinal patient record that incorporates a patient identifier.  The Electronic Health Record programme has a number of components to allow for patient information to be shared across the primary, community and acute care settings to deliver  modern, safe and efficient patient care.  Utilising the Individual Health Identifier to integrate the information, they can underpin a more sophisticated and patient-centred model of connected health.  With regard to Electronic Health Records, the Office of the Chief Information Officer has submitted a detailed business case for a national electronic health record programme for Ireland. My Department is currently evaluating how this might be progressed particularly in delivering an EHR in the context of the work being planned for the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital which aspires to be the first digital hospital facility in the country. In developing a national electronic health record programme we must build on the progress to date in ICT deployment and also the lessons learnt from other jurisdictions in developing an optimum solution for Ireland. I hope to bring proposals to Government shortly on how this plan might be progressed. <\/p><p>My Department currently participates in a number of forums including the EU eHealth Network in the context of digital services in support of the Cross-Border Directive (Directive 2011\/24\/EU) on  the  application  of  patients&rsquo;  rights  in  cross-border  healthcare and furthering the eHealth agenda on issues such as interoperability and common standards for the exchange of information in support of patient care. <\/p><p>The delivery of digital health care services and the roll out of an electronic health record (EHR) will require a robust legal framework to ensure confidentiality and security of patient data consistent with the new EU data protection regulation, Regulation (EU) 2016\/679. The new EU regulations (General Data Protection Regulation) will have a significant effect on how and where data is gathered and the purpose for which it is used.  My Department is currently examining the appropriate information framework that will provide the optimum environment to support eHealth and the deployment of electronic health records in the future. The health care delivery system requires a robust information governance environment to ensure the right information about the right patient is available securely, in the right place and at the right time.  The confidentiality of health data and the right of citizens to privacy must always be respected while at the same time be balanced against the health needs of the individual and the use of health data for the greater good of society.  These are complex and demanding issues which must be addressed in the context of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill, national and health sector implementation of the new Regulation and existing health legislation including the Health Identifiers Act 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700111#WRZZ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2801,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700111#WRZZ02700"},{"type":"question","counter":2802,"qnumday":1023,"qnumall":"[41621\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700111#WRZZ02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a surgery appointment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":2803,"qnumday":1283,"qnumall":"[1544\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700111#WRZZ02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite an appointment for a carpel tunnel operation for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2804,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1023 and 1283 together.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The Strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and well being so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural and family life in their own communities for as long as possible, thereby representing a vision for an age-friendly society.  The Strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and wellbeing of our ageing citizens.  The Department of Health has an overall coordinating and collating role for the Strategy and a more direct role for the health-related objectives, as outlined by the Deputy.<\/p><p>At the launch of the Strategy, a commitment was made to publish an Implementation Plan to facilitate the translation of the Goals and Objectives of the Strategy into action on the ground.  The approach to implementation originally included in the Strategy would have worked where a finite number of discrete and concrete steps could be taken after which the implementation could be deemed complete.  However, many of the objectives included in this Strategy are quite broad, and can be viewed as a set of principles to which Government has committed, and which will inform policies that affect older people on an indefinite basis into the future, rather than concrete objectives that can be delivered in the short term.<\/p><p>The Department has therefore formulated new arrangements to implement and monitor the implementation of the  National Positive Ageing Strategy.  The new proposals will see mechanisms established that will give stakeholder groups effective and on-going access to Government Departments and  State Agencies relevant to older people.  Structures will be established for engagement between relevant Government Departments and State Agencies and relevant stakeholders on how the Strategy&rsquo;s principles are being implemented.  An Annual Forum for stakeholders will be established which will seek to identify what stakeholders consider to be their key priorities for Government for the coming year and the next three years.  Issues will be considered on a thematic basis and will include Health, Social Protection, Transport, Security, Community Housing and Local Government, etc.  Clear channels of communications will  be established with relevant Government Departments assigning a named senior official to engage with stakeholder representatives on  issues relevant to their remit.<\/p><p>The revised arrangements were approved by the  Cabinet  Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 27 October, 2016.  These new arrangements will now be communicated to stakeholders and arrangements made to commence implementation.<\/p><p>As part of the NPAS implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative has been established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies to measure the impact of the Strategy and establish an ongoing system for measuring and reporting on Positive Ageing.  The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the Goals and Objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  This will be done primarily through the development of Positive Ageing indicators to be published every two years.  The Initiative is intended to provide evidence of the factors contributing to positive ageing, including at local level and ultimately inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland.  The first national Positive Ageing Indicators report was published in November 2016 and highlights many of the positive and negative aspects of growing old in Ireland.<\/p><p>The National Positive Ageing Strategy and the activities of the HaPAI are strongly embedded within the vision and actions set out for Healthy Ireland, the Government-led initiative which aims to create an Irish society where people of all ages can enjoy good physical and mental health, and where wellbeing<b><\/b>is supported at every level of society.  The Healthy Ireland Framework was launched in 2013 and seeks to provide people and communities with<b><\/b>accurate information on how to improve their health and wellbeing and to make the healthy choices easier choices.  Healthy Ireland takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and wellbeing and the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and a number of new structures have been put in place to ensure that all sectors of society are given opportunities to participate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700114#WRCCC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Services","counter":2990,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700115#WRDDD00250"},{"type":"question","counter":2991,"qnumday":1100,"qnumall":"[41846\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700115#WRDDD00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide funding to a first responders group (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2992,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700115#WRDDD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":2993,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700115#WRDDD00450"},{"type":"question","counter":2994,"qnumday":1101,"qnumall":"[41847\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700115#WRDDD00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an operation for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2995,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The Programme for a Partnership Government has committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms. <\/p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  This work is currently underway and the IFA has made a submission in this context to the Interdepartmental Group which is overseeing the implementation of certain recommendations contained in the Review.  The proposals put forward by the IFA are currently being considered.  Once all of the relevant Review recommendations have been considered, any amendments required to the Scheme will be identified.

Such admissions are subject to review by a Mental Health Tribunal.  Persons admitted on this basis do not have the right to leave the approved centre while subject to an admission or renewal order without the express permission of the Consultant Psychiatrist.<\/p>  <p>  Most people, however, who go to an approved centre for treatment do so by choice and admit themselves as a voluntary patient.  Where a voluntary patient indicates at any time that he or she wishes to leave the approved centre, then under section 23 of the Act, if a consultant psychiatrist, registered medical practitioner or registered nurse on the staff of the approved centre is of opinion that the person is, at that time, suffering from a mental disorder, he or she may detain the person for a period not exceeding 24 hours.  The Consultant Psychiatrist responsible for the care and treatment of the person prior to his or her detention must then arrange for the person to be examined by another Consultant Psychiatrist.  If the person is deemed to be suffering from a mental disorder, the person may then be detained as an involuntary patient.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out that any assessment of whether a person should be admitted as an involuntary patient because he\/she is deemed to be suffering from a mental disorder, will take into account the question of whether there is a serious likelihood of the person concerned causing immediate and serious harm to himself or herself or to other persons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700122#WRLLL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":3385,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700122#WRLLL00750"},{"type":"question","counter":3386,"qnumday":1237,"qnumall":"[1376\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700122#WRLLL00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the case of a person (details supplied) who is on the waiting list for a prosthetic leg; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":3387,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700122#WRLLL00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland","counter":3388,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700122#WRLLL00950"},{"type":"question","counter":3389,"qnumday":1238,"qnumall":"[1377\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700122#WRLLL01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) has not received registration to start working as a midwife in Cavan General Hospital.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":3390,"content":"<p>I wish to thank the Deputy for the matter raised.

Such reviews should ideally be undertaken on a periodic basis and have a medium to long term focus.  Given the changes in population, epidemiological trends and fiscal environment since the last report in 2007, a review at this stage is appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  Assessing capacity requirements, however, is a complex task and cannot be divorced from considerations on the underlying model of care we want to develop for the Irish health service.  It is widely acknowledged that primary care can provide more appropriate and effective management and treatment of some illnesses and conditions, especially chronic diseases.  Similarly, the availability of non-acute beds and services in the community can mitigate the need for acute hospital admission, or facilitate earlier discharge.  These factors directly contribute to the demands on the acute hospital system.<\/p>  <p>  For this reason, I am anxious that the review will have a wider scope than previous reviews and will examine key elements of primary and community care infrastructure in addition to hospital beds.  Initial work on the 2017 Capacity Review has focused on expanding the concept of a preferred model of care and how it can inform the assessment of future capacity requirements.  Arrangements for the review are now being put in place.  It will be undertaken by my Department and will be overseen by a steering group and an international expert advisory group.  External expert inputs will be commissioned to provide independent and impartial analysis of capacity needs.  Finalised details of the review process will be made public shortly. <\/p>  <p>  Given the current pressures being experienced within our hospital services, the process must also have a short-term focus and determine how capital investment over the coming years can be best targeted.  I can confirm that the review will be advanced sufficiently to enable it to inform considerations around the mid-term review of the capital programme.  It will be finalised for publication later in the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700122#WRLLL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Meetings","counter":3394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700122#WRLLL01350"},{"type":"question","counter":3395,"qnumday":1240,"qnumall":"[1386\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700122#WRLLL01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of times he, or his Department, have met with the health unions in the past three months; the unions which were met and the number of times each were met with; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":3396,"content":"<p>A significant number of meetings took place between my Department and unions representing public health sector employees in the three month period from 10 October 2016 to 10 January 2017.

It is imperative that existing GP services in these areas are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly-qualified GPs.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government commits to increasing the number of GP training places to 259 places annually.  In July 2016, the GP training intake increased from 157 to 172 places  and the HSE's 2017 National Service Plan envisages a further increase, to 187 places this year.  I am anxious to achieve further increases in future years in order to ensure that the future manpower needs of general practice can be met.<\/p>  <p>  Further efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible\/shared GMS\/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices.  These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practising for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I am cognisant of the need for a new GP services contract which will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector, and health service management have already progressed a number of significant measures through engagement with GP representatives.  Preparations for the next phase of discussions on a new GP contract are underway.  The GP contract review process will, inter alia, seek to introduce further measures aimed at making general practice a fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700123#WRMMM01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Data","counter":3454,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700123#WRMMM01650"},{"type":"question","counter":3455,"qnumday":1262,"qnumall":"[1464\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700123#WRMMM01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which the HSE is designating home help hours to its external and agency carers in counties Cavan and Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":3456,"qnumday":1263,"qnumall":"[1465\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700123#WRMMM01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the waiting times for persons waiting on the allocation of home help hours in counties Cavan and Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":3457,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1262 and 1263 together.<\/p><p>As these are service matters they have been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700123#WRMMM01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Treatment Abroad Scheme","counter":3458,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700123#WRMMM01950"},{"type":"question","counter":3459,"qnumday":1264,"qnumall":"[1467\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700123#WRMMM02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will request the HSE to intervene to ensure that treatment is received in Northern Ireland in relation to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":3460,"qnumday":1309,"qnumall":"[1629\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700123#WRMMM02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if treatment for a person (details supplied) under the treatment abroad scheme is still available and sanctioned for Belfast; if, following the initial three months treatment, the person can continue infusions at another location in Northern Ireland, in view of capacity issues in Belfast; if he will provide a full list of locations in Northern Ireland where other patients that have been released from the hospital in Belfast have continued their infusions in order that the person can select the most convenient location to travel to; if, in the event that the person cannot be facilitated in Northern Ireland after the three months, the HSE will facilitate the infusions here under the treatment abroad scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":3461,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1264 and 1309 together.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE operates a Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS), for persons entitled to treatment in another EU\/EEA Member State or Switzerland under EU Regulation 883\/04, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulation 987\/09, and in accordance with Department of Health Guidelines.

The HSE National Ambulance Service (NAS) provides some emergency capacity in the greater Dublin area, as well as non-emergency patient transport.  <\/p>  <p>  In recent years three comprehensive reviews of our ambulance services have been undertaken; the HIQA review, the independent Lightfoot Review of NAS capacity, and the review of Dublin ambulance services which was jointly commissioned by the HSE and Dublin City Council. <\/p>  <p>  The HIQA report on ambulance services, which was published in December 2014, highlighted significant public safety issues arising from two ambulance services operating in the same domain.  The report identified concerns around the existence of two separate control and dispatch processes, and also highlighted the need for greater clinical governance of both services.  <\/p>  <p>  The HIQA report points, very clearly, to the need for enhanced integration of service provision in the greater Dublin area.  In that context, the HSE is working closely with Dublin City Council, which is leading on this issue on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities, to devise and agree the elements of a safe, sustainable, integrated and quality ambulance service for the citizens of Dublin.  I fully accept that, in the interest of patient safety, we need the DFB and the NAS to have a more coordinated and integrated approach to service delivery.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that HIQA has recently engaged with Dublin City Council and the NAS as a follow up to the 2014 report and in that context, issues with regard to capacity in the Dublin region may have arisen.  I expect that HIQA will publish a further report in a matter of weeks.  The Deputy will however be aware that additional funds have been provided to the NAS in 2017 to fund increase capacity. The allocation of these additional resources is an operational matter for the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The Dublin ambulance services review, which was commissioned in 2014, is focused on identifying a service model for the optimal provision of emergency ambulance services and patient care in the Dublin region, including service quality, patient safety and value for money.  I understand that the Review has been completed and is under consideration by the HSE and Dublin City Council, who as I mentioned earlier, commissioned the Review.  <\/p>  <p>  While I have yet to be apprised of the detailed outcome of the Review, I can assure the Deputy that before any changes are implemented, a formal proposal for same will be required to be submitted to both myself and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, for our consideration and approval.  I therefore expect that my Department and the Dept of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will, over the coming weeks, continue to engage with the HSE and Dublin City Council, in relation to any changes in service provision which may be proposed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Provision","counter":3666,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ02500"},{"type":"question","counter":3667,"qnumday":1343,"qnumall":"[1865\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress being made in providing a primary care centre in Lucan, County Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":3668,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":3670,"qnumday":1344,"qnumall":"[1866\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress being made in providing a primary care centre in Clondalkin village, Dublin 22; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":3671,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":3673,"qnumday":1345,"qnumall":"[1867\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress being made in providing a primary care centre in Rowlagh, Clondalkin, Dublin 22; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":3674,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":3675,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ03400"},{"type":"question","counter":3676,"qnumday":1346,"qnumall":"[1879\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the engagement he has had with management and medical staff at Cork University Maternity Hospital; and if his attention has been drawn to the governance and resources issues that are currently outstanding.","asker":"1276","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":3677,"content":"<p>I am aware of difficulties in relation to waiting times for gynaecology services in Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH), which are in part due to staff resource challenges including those associated with recruiting theatre nursing staff.  <\/p>  <p>  Last week, I visited the hospital to meet with hospital management, South\/South West Hospital Group (SSWHG) management and a number of consultant obstetricians\/gynaecologists, to learn at first-hand about these problems and how they can best be resolved.  I have asked my officials to work closely with the HSE and the SSWHG to ensure that the waiting list for gynaecology procedures is addressed as a priority.  I have also committed to convene a follow-up meeting on this matter in approximately six weeks time. <\/p>  <p>  In demonstration of the Government's commitment to address waiting lists, Budget 2017 makes specific provision for the treatment of the longest-waiting patients.  I am assured that the 2017 NTPF waiting list initiative will help to alleviate some of the difficulties in Cork.  In 2017, the NTPF will have an allocation of &euro;20 million and, in the first instance, in the region of &euro;5m will be targeted at daycase procedures.  The NTPF anticipate that 2,500 of the longest waiting daycase patients, including patients on the CUMH waiting list, will be treated under this initiative.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with the HSE and NTPF to ensure best use of the additional resources allocated to tackle hospital waiting lists.  In that regard, the HSE has been requested to submit Action Plans for 2017, in January, in respect of both the Inpatient\/Daycase Waiting List and the Outpatient Waiting List.  Further consideration will be given to the needs of CUMH in that context.<\/p>  <p>  Lastly, I should mention that the governance structures for our maternity services is currently being remodelled with the establishment of the HSE National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme and maternity networks across Hospital Groups.  The Programme will lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services, ensure the consistent delivery of high quality care in these services and oversee the development of maternity networks.  I am hopeful that the new maternity network which is currently being established in the SSWHG will ensure better co-ordination and utilisation of maternity and gynaecological resources across the group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Delays","counter":3678,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ03700"},{"type":"question","counter":3679,"qnumday":1347,"qnumall":"[1916\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) who was referred for epidural injections 18 months ago in University Hospital Waterford will receive them","asker":"1224","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":3680,"content":"<p>In relation to this particular query, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":3681,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ04000"},{"type":"question","counter":3682,"qnumday":1348,"qnumall":"[1917\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700127#WRQQQ04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding St. Mary of the Angels, Beaufort, County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":3683,"content":"<p>I was delighted to visit St Mary of the Angels last week and I would like to express my gratitude for the welcome I received from residents and their families along with staff and management.

Any opportunity for residents to live in smaller settings in the community will come after considerable planning and discussion with those residents and their families.<\/p>  <p>  2. If any resident moves from St Mary of the Angels, it will be on the basis that it will enhance their life. Anyone who moves will continue to access the services they require. If a resident experiences difficulties after moving out, all options will be explored &ndash; including moving back to St. Mary of the Angel's for a short or long period of time.<\/p>  <p>  3. No planning for any move will take place without an open and inclusive discussion with residents and their families, based on the assessments and as part of the care-planning process.<\/p>  <p>  4.

For the agriculture sector, this includes an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food protection. <\/p>  <p>  The development of the National Mitigation Plan is led by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and\u00a0 Environment and represents a whole-of-Government approach, involving my Department which is responsible for inputs in relation to the agriculture and forest sector. My Department has been actively involved and has submitted the agriculture and forest sectoral contribution to the Plan, outlining the mitigation actions which we are taking in the sector. A discussion document on the agriculture and forest contribution to the Plan was made available as part of a public consultation process which also included a half day consultation seminar.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the\u00a0Draft Plan will be published in March for a period of public consultation by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p>  <p>  The Act also requires a National Adaptation Framework. My Department is currently preparing agriculture, forest and marine sectoral adaptation plans to meet the requirements under the Act. My Department has recently launched a non-statutory draft adaptation plan for the agriculture and forest sector for a period of public consultation which is open until 27 January. This plan has been drafted under the 2012 National Climate Change Adaptation Framework. This draft adaptation plan can be viewed as a first step towards reducing vulnerability and building resilience in the agriculture and forest sector. Its aim is to stimulate thinking from the public and interested stakeholders on this very important subject. <\/p>  <p>  Both the agriculture and forest sectoral contribution to the National Mitigation Plan and Adaptation Plans for the agriculture, forest and marine sectors are informed by scientific evidence and research findings. The plans will specify the policy measures to be undertaken for both mitigation and adaptation and will be fundamental pillars of future national policy. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also contributed to the first Annual Transition Statement presented by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment early last month. <\/p>  <p>  Irish agriculture production has been independently and internationally recognised as one of the most climate and resource efficient agri-food production systems in the world. However, there is no room for complacency and we will continue to work with all stakeholders to find even greater efficiencies and drive down emissions further. This will not be an easy task particularly in light of the limited cost-effective mitigation options available in agriculture. We will continue to make efforts and polices such as &ldquo;Food Wise 2025&rdquo; provide a framework for the sector to engage with the National Mitigation Plan and for the development of a common vision of transition to a low carbon, climate resilient future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700128#WRRRR02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crop Treatments","counter":3720,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700128#WRRRR02400"},{"type":"question","counter":3721,"qnumday":1361,"qnumall":"[41323\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700128#WRRRR02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the World Health Organization said last year that pre-harvest desiccation with glyphosate, as recommended by Teagasc, is probably carcinogenic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1345","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":3722,"qnumday":1362,"qnumall":"[41324\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700128#WRRRR02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that glyphosate has been linked to non-Hodgkins lymphoma, is a suspected endocrine disrupter and that it is banned in 11 countries, including France and the Netherlands.","asker":"1345","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3723,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1361 and 1362 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is aware of the International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) report on glyphosate which had classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans.

The International Council of the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) considers sprat to be a data limited stock. In order to try and address that paucity of accurate information in respect of sprat stocks in the waters around Ireland, a three year research project, partially funded by industry, began in October 2014 under the auspices of the Marine Institute in cooperation with Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.<\/p>  <p>  This project aims to develop an accurate and detailed understanding of the stock structure of sprat around Ireland. It will determine whether the sprat in Irish coastal waters is one stock or several separate stocks and it aims to increase our understanding of their role in the broader marine ecosystem. This data will in turn contribute to the ICES assessment of the vulnerability or otherwise of sprat in the waters around Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0 The central objective of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term through the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and the management of fisheries and fleets exploiting such resources.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0 Available scientific information is that sprat in Ireland spawn from January to June with a fishery normally taking place from October to Christmas. This is a fortuitous situation, allowing some degree of reproductive output as the fishery takes place after the fish have been able to spawn.\u00a0 The Marine Institute advise that there is no evidence that spawning sprat are or ever have been targeted in Irish fisheries nor is there evidence that sprat actually spawn inshore.\u00a0 That of course is not to deny that they are easily targeted inshore when they occur there. <\/p>  <p>  I have also been informed that the Marine Institute is actively pursuing the addition of sprat to the species covered under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Marine Biodiversity Scheme, in 2017.

The annual EU Fisheries Council negotiations took place on 12th and 13th December\u00a0last year. Following two days of intensive negotiations, I secured 233,500 tonnes of quotas worth &euro;280 million for Irish fishermen for 2017. This represents an increase of 17,390 tonnes over 2016 and a 6% increase by value.<\/p>  <p>  The original set of proposals from the EU Commission was extremely worrying and would have resulted in cuts to a number of our\u00a0important\u00a0 stocks. These included a &ndash;9% cut to our vital prawn quota, a -68% cut to our Cod quota in the Celtic Sea and a -26% cut to our Celtic Sea Whiting fishery. \u00a0In total, the original Commission proposals would have resulted in an economic loss of almost &euro;30 million in direct and indirect losses. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  During the negotiations,\u00a0I succeeded in convincing the Commission to apply the appropriate scientific advice for prawns, resulting in a 9% increase. This was my number one priority heading into the negotiations and I was very happy with the outcome. I was also pleased to secure an increase in the Whiting quota in the Celtic Sea of 21%, which, again was fully in line with the scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES). <\/p>  <p>  The proposed cut of -68% for the Cod stock in the Celtic Sea was reduced to a -38%.\u00a0 The cut applicable to Ireland was reduced to -14%,\u00a0 through the application of the Hague Preferences. These are arrangements which benefit Ireland in circumstances where the Total Allowable Catch is set at a low level due to the situation of certain stocks, including Cod in the Celtic Sea. The Hague Preferences came under significant threat this year from a number of Member States but\u00a0I successfully argued for their application thereby ameliorating the significant cut to Cod in the Celtic Sea. <\/p>  <p>  A number of increases for Ireland&rsquo;s important Pelagic Fisheries for 2017 were also agreed through the Coastal States negotiations and confirmed at the December Council. These include a Mackerel quota for 2017 of 86,429 tonnes - an increase of over 10,500 tonnes (14%)\u00a0from 2016. This is worth over &euro;10million directly to our catching sector with further value to be added by our mackerel processing factories in Donegal, Galway, Kerry and Cork. Significant increases in Ireland&rsquo;s Blue Whiting and Atlanto Scandian Herring quotas were also achieved. Some cuts were agreed where they were justified by scientific evidence. These include a -36% cut to the Boarfish TAC and a -6% cut to Celtic Sea Herring, which is under a long term management plan.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the end result delivered a balanced package which has been broadly welcomed by the Irish fishing industry. I am also happy that it is a result which fully respects the scientific advice provided by the ICES ensuring the continued vibrancy of our industry and the long term sustainability of our stocks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700128#WRRRR05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Imports","counter":3754,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700128#WRRRR05800"},{"type":"question","counter":3755,"qnumday":1373,"qnumall":"[41483\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700128#WRRRR05900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will confirm that the European Commissioner has lifted the ban on horses from outside the EU entering the human food chain, provided they have a six months' withdrawal period from medication prior to slaughter.","asker":"1263","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3756,"content":"<p>There has not been a general ban\u00a0on horsemeat from outside the EU entering the human food chain in the EU, provided that\u00a0EU regulatory requirements are met.\u00a0Import of horsemeat\u00a0is\u00a0banned where Commission audits indicate that the regulatory requirements are not being\u00a0met, but\u00a0a number of\u00a0non-EU countries have continued to export horsemeat to the EU over recent years on the basis that they meet the EU regulatory requirements. <\/p>  <p>  In fact, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016\/1832 of 17 October 2016, relating to changes in health certification requirements due to take effect from 31 March 2017, tightens up the conditions applying to such import.

Forestry has many well-established advantages.  It provides a viable alternative land use and an additional income stream\u00a0for land owners, especially on less productive land.  It stimulates economic activity in rural areas.  Forestry now employs over 12,000 people and\u00a0is worth &euro;2.3 billion per annum to the Irish economy.  It contributes greatly to climate change by soaking up and storing carbon. It also \u00a0contributes to water quality and biodiversity.<\/p>  <p>  The State encourages land owners to plant their land with trees through various tax concessions and financial incentives which cover the full cost of establishment.  Although forestry brings many benefits, most of the financial benefits to land owners accrue\u00a0some \u00a030-40 years after planting when the forest reaches\u00a0its optimum financial rotation.  This time lag creates a difficulty for land owners who plant their land.<\/p>  <p>  It is in this context that grants and premiums along with tax incentives are regarded by the State as the most effective way to encourage land owners to plant their land with trees in respect of both broadleaves and conifers.  Without these incentives only a very small amount of land would be planted; this is borne out by the low level of planting that took place before the 1980s and before the introduction of the western package afforestation scheme (WPS).  In the ten years prior to the introduction of the WPS in the 1980s the average annual rate of private afforestation was 227 hectares per annum. In 2016, the area planted was just under 6,500 hectares.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the Forestry Programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 is to establish almost 43,410 hectares of new forests during the 6 year programme period.<\/p>  <p>  Forest area in Ireland is measured every five years as part of the national forest inventory.  The 2012 inventory recorded a total of 731,650 hectares\u00a0 or 10.5% of the total land area of Ireland under forestry.

GLAS\u00a0 is a 5 year scheme co-funded by the EU under the RDP 2014-2020 and participating farmers will be paid in full for their contracts over the period of the implementation of the RDP.<\/p><p>-  AEOS: A number of participants from AEOS transferring to the GLAS scheme for 2016-2020\u00a0 reduced expenditure in 2016.  Furthermore, in certain circumstances the processing of the final year payment of a multi-year AEOS contract is administratively complex and it was not possible to complete the necessary procedures in time for payment to issue in 2016 for a significant number of AEOS 2 participants.

The exchange with members which followed was both useful and informative.  During this exchange I outlined in some detail the response of my Department to the difficulties posed by harvest conditions in 2016.  I would like to take this opportunity to further address these issues as presented for consideration in the submission by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>  <p>  Following a meeting with the main stakeholders in the tillage sector in October of last year I addressed a particular difficulty that faces not just tillage farmers but all farmers: access to low-cost more flexible finance, by introducing a &euro;150 million Agri Cash Flow Loan Support Scheme.  This has been developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), by leveraging EU and Exchequer funding totalling &euro;25m from my Department, to deliver a total loan fund of &euro;150 million, which will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000.<\/p>  <p>  The interest rate applying is 2.95% and the product will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  Loans to tillage and horticulture farmers will be provided in line with the EU&rsquo;s Agriculture State Aid de minimis requirements.<\/p>  <p>  This is a cash flow support facility, to improve the working capital position of farmers and other viable primary agriculture SMEs.  The loans will be unsecured and are primarily to pay down expensive forms of credit such as merchant credit, and other short-term financing facilities such as overdrafts.  The SBCI is targeting that the loans will be available in the market by the end of January 2017.  Farmers are encouraged to consider their cash flow and borrowings situation now and, if appropriate to their circumstances, to be prepared to apply for these loans when they become available.<\/p>  <p>  The loan scheme is part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility announced in Budget 2017, along with additional tax measures and farm payments.  Among the tax measures is an adjustment to the current &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; system, which allows for an opt-out in an exceptional year.  This is available for 2016 tax liability, and will go some way towards addressing cash flow concerns.<\/p>  <p>  As an additional support to\u00a0cash flow on farms, including tillage farms, advance payments were made in 2016\u00a0in respect of the Basic Payment and Greening Payment schemes.  These advance payments commenced\u00a0on the 17th October last. To date\u00a0&euro;1,162 billion has been paid out to more than 122,465 farmers and payments are ongoing.  Payments in excess of &euro;195 million have been made to more than 91,000 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints scheme.<\/p>  <p>  It is my intention\u00a0that the\u00a0 new TAMS Scheme, specifically tailored to the tillage sector, will open shortly.  This scheme will support grain growers in achieving further economic efficiencies and details will be made available in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the proposal on medium to long-term actions to develop the sector, many of the actions identified are worthy of further consideration.  A Tillage Sector Development Plan was prepared and published by the Teagasc Tillage Crop Stakeholder Consultative Group.  This report was launched by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Simon Coveney TD and made a significant contribution towards implementation of the Food Harvest 2020 report.<\/p>  <p>  The Tillage Stakeholder Consultative Group made a further significant contribution to the development of the Food Wise 2025 chapter on priorities and actions for the tillage sector.  The group continued to refine and prioritise key objectives for the sector and on my invitation made a presentation to the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee in September of last year.  Indeed I understand that the group is already\u00a0looking at several of the proposed actions contained in the Committee&rsquo;s submission and I look forward to hearing from it on these points in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700130#WRTTT05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Eligibility","counter":3864,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700131#WRUUU00200"},{"type":"question","counter":3865,"qnumday":1416,"qnumall":"[1048\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700131#WRUUU00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the issues in relation to accepting a person (details supplied) into GLAS 2 related to internal problems with his Department's computer system; the reason his Department could not resolve these difficulties; if his Department accepts that the person should not be at a cashflow disadvantage in relation to 2016 payments due to these difficulties; if a request for a review has been received from the person; when a decision will be made on this request; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3866,"content":"<p>The person named was unable to submit an application for the second tranche of GLAS due to an issue with the designation of a parcel as a natura parcel.

At the time that the Programme was agreed, the budget was not available to plant 15,000ha; in any event it was unlikely that this level of planting could be achieved even if the budget did exist.  The reason why this is the case is because the scheme itself is demand driven and voluntary so landowners must want to plant in the first instance.  While this programme&rsquo;s targets may seem modest when compared to previous targets, all applicants who want to plant and who qualify for financial support under the afforestation scheme are approved.  In 2015 the targets set were exceeded by almost 300ha, in 2016 preliminary figures show that the Department fell short of its target by roughly 160ha.<\/p>  <p>  Total afforestation in 2012 was 6,652ha, in 2013 it was 6,252ha, in 2014 it was 6,156ha, in 2015 it was 6,293ha and in 2016 preliminary figures show that 6,500ha were planted.  Targets to 2020 are set out\u00a0in the forestry programme 2014 -2020 and further targets will be included in the following\u00a07 year programme.  It is difficult to see 20,000ha or even 15,000ha being achieved during this programme period given the planting levels currently being achieved.  As mentioned earlier landowners must want to plant and many do not see forestry as an option for their current farming enterprise.  In relation to long-term forestry planning periods in the context of afforestation this will continue to mirror the EU CAP programme period which typically covers 7 years.<\/p>  <p>  On the research side, the aim of the Department&rsquo;s forest research (CoFoRD) Programme is to develop a scientific foundation and support for a sustainable, competitive, market-orientated and innovative forest industry through support for research projects.  The Forest Research Ireland Report (FORI) drawn up by the COFORD Council and which informs the forestry aspects of my Department&rsquo;s research calls, identifies the importance of a long-term approach to aspects of forest research, because of the long-term nature of forestry.  As regards ring-fencing funding for forestry research separately from agriculture, it should be noted that the forestry research programme is managed as a separate budget line, kept under review and maintained at a level of approx. &euro;2 million annually.  In addition, my Department provides Grant-in-aid funding to Teagasc, whose research remit includes forest research.<\/p>  <p>  A new forestry promotion campaign is underway within my Department which aims to highlight the benefits of forestry amongst farmers and non-farmers alike.  A midterm review also begins early this year that will compare progress made against the original targets set.  In this context schemes may be improved or restructured to make them more attractive to potential applicants.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to make it clear that my\u00a0Department is committed to its goal of increasing forest cover to 18%.  This might take longer than previously estimated;\u00a0however we will continue to encourage land owners to plant in order to reach our programme targets and to make the necessary funding available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700131#WRUUU02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ash Dieback Threat","counter":3891,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700131#WRUUU02900"},{"type":"question","counter":3892,"qnumday":1425,"qnumall":"[1189\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700131#WRUUU03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding the continued removal of chalara-infected ash trees in view of the fact that the disease has been found in all 26 counties; his views on whether the current removal of young ash trees is curbing the spread of the disease; his further views on whether the continued expenditure of taxpayers' money is justified in view of the widespread nature of the disease; and his plans for the forest service to switch to advising forest owners on longer term solutions to this problem (details supplied) rather than the complete removal of their ash trees in the interests of forest sustainability and making the best use of taxpayers' money.","asker":"1274","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3893,"content":"<p>As the Deputy has noted there was a very significant increase in the incidence of Ash Dieback disease or Chalara in 2016, most notably in forest plantations.  By autumn 2016 there were also a significant number of additional findings along motorway and roadside plantings and in the wild on hedgerows, as well as a smaller number of new cases recorded in private gardens and in farm landscape plantings.  Furthermore, there is an increasing diversity in the types of sites where the disease has been identified, with over half the recent findings in forest plantations in ash trees of native Irish origin.  A detailed breakdown of these figures as well as a national distribution map of findings is accessible on the dedicated section of the Department&rsquo;s website.  Taken together these findings do indicate a continual widening distribution of the disease and that the disease is present, to a greater or lesser extent, in all 26 counties.<\/p>  <p>  In view of the increasing prevalence of the disease and further to feedback from affected forest owners and other forest sector stakeholders on aspects of the Department&rsquo;s Reconstitution Scheme, Department officials are currently in the process of updating the policies and procedures around it.  One area where there will be an increased focus going forward is on encouraging forest owners with older plantations with bigger trees to avail of the Woodland Improvement Scheme to finance a thinning operation to assist in bringing the plantation to a merchantable stage.  The requirements around sanitation action plans and for the complete destruction of both affected and unaffected ash trees which currently operate under the Scheme are also being re-considered.  A consultation document on proposed changes to the Scheme was circulated to a focus group of forestry stakeholder representatives in December and the technical submissions received are now being assessed by my officials.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is also actively supporting a number of research projects into the control and management of the disease, in particular projects with a key long-term focus of developing an ash tree breeding programme to identify trees that show strong tolerance and\/or resistance to the disease and the genetic basis for tolerance.

The continued expenditure of tax payers' money to these ends, where properly targeted and duly accounted for by the beneficiaries, in my view is justified and clearly is in the \u00a0interest of environmental sustainability, in particular the maintenance of our area of national forest cover, as well as helping to ensure that the fullest economic and social benefits accrue to Irish society through the productive management of our forests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700131#WRUUU03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":3894,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700131#WRUUU03200"},{"type":"question","counter":3895,"qnumday":1426,"qnumall":"[1218\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700131#WRUUU03300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of full-time equivalent Civil Service workers in gross income ranges (details supplied) in his Department for each of the years 2007 to 2015.","asker":"1258","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3896,"content":"<p>The number of full-time equivalent civil service workers in gross\u00a0salary ranges in my department for each of the years 2007-2015 is a follows:\u00a0<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>0-30,000<\/th><th>30,000-40,000<\/th><th>40,000-50,000<\/th><th>50000-60,000<\/th><th>60,000-70,000<\/th><th>70,000-80,000<\/th><th>80,000-90,000<\/th><th>90,000-100,000<\/th><th>100,000-125,000<\/th><th>125,000-150,000<\/th><th>Over 150,000<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>839.88<\/td><td>1067.64<\/td><td>1086.46<\/td><td>528.40<\/td><td>191.40<\/td><td>127.40<\/td><td>139.00<\/td><td>234.00<\/td><td>71.00<\/td><td>11.00<\/td><td>3.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>607.89<\/td><td>1150.86<\/td><td>1032.09<\/td><td>595.00<\/td><td>261.40<\/td><td>115.20<\/td><td>164.80<\/td><td>188.00<\/td><td>145.00<\/td><td>6.00<\/td><td>12.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>420.04<\/td><td>1103.34<\/td><td>935.55<\/td><td>612.13<\/td><td>261.60<\/td><td>98.00<\/td><td>172.40<\/td><td>183.00<\/td><td>141.00<\/td><td>6.00<\/td><td>8.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>435.07<\/td><td>949.31<\/td><td>995.69<\/td><td>570.06<\/td><td>109.20<\/td><td>147.10<\/td><td>183.00<\/td><td>140.00<\/td><td>27.00<\/td><td>7.00<\/td><td>3.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>383.48<\/td><td>890.51<\/td><td>930.66<\/td><td>610.80<\/td><td>104.53<\/td><td>137.90<\/td><td>175.00<\/td><td>155.00<\/td><td>34.00<\/td><td>7.00<\/td><td>2.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>349.71<\/td><td>819.31<\/td><td>838.29<\/td><td>569.30<\/td><td>115.93<\/td><td>141.80<\/td><td>155.00<\/td><td>174.00<\/td><td>33.00<\/td><td>8.00<\/td><td>2.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>321.89<\/td><td>705.24<\/td><td>851.26<\/td><td>560.53<\/td><td>163.00<\/td><td>160.40<\/td><td>223.00<\/td><td>68.00<\/td><td>18.00<\/td><td>6.00<\/td><td>1.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>310.11<\/td><td>647.84<\/td><td>842.21<\/td><td>538.03<\/td><td>170.40<\/td><td>150.40<\/td><td>201.00<\/td><td>74.00<\/td><td>18.00<\/td><td>5.00<\/td><td>1.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>304.94<\/td><td>802.25<\/td><td>670.81<\/td><td>537.19<\/td><td>174.80<\/td><td>132.10<\/td><td>202.00<\/td><td>72.00<\/td><td>18.00<\/td><td>4.00<\/td><td>1.00<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700131#WRUUU03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Harbours and Piers Development","counter":3897,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700131#WRUUU03500"},{"type":"question","counter":3898,"qnumday":1427,"qnumall":"[1235\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700131#WRUUU03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the real need to develop facilities at Greencastle Harbour and Leenan Pier in County Donegal;

This sector is a very important area in the agricultural economy and 2016 was a challenging year both in terms of market returns and variable weather conditions experienced during the harvest.  I wish to confirm that I have a number of key supports available to the tillage sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware that last October I chaired a meeting with the main stakeholders in the tillage sector.  As I said at the time and I wish to\u00a0repeat here again this meeting provided a platform for the stakeholders to express their views and concerns on the challenges they are facing but equally to discuss the opportunities that lie ahead for the industry.<\/p>  <p>  At that meeting and in direct response to the difficulties being experienced, I outlined that one of my chief priorities was to provide low-cost more flexible finance and in this regard I was happy to announce on Budget Day, my plans for a &euro;150 million Agri Cash Flow Loan Support Scheme.  This has been developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), by leveraging EU and Exchequer funding totalling &euro;25m from my Department, to deliver a total loan fund of &euro;150 million, which will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000.  The interest rate applying is 2.95% and the product will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  Loans to tillage and horticulture farmers will be provided in line with the EU&rsquo;s agriculture State Aid de minimis requirements.<\/p>  <p>  This is a cashflow support facility, to improve the working capital position of farmers and other viable primary agriculture SMEs.  The loans will be unsecured and are primarily to pay down expensive forms of credit such as merchant credit and other short-term financing facilities such as overdrafts.  I recently welcomed the SBCI &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial intermediaries to deliver the Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The SBCI is targeting that the loans will be available in the market by the end of this month.<\/p>  <p>  I am encouraging farmers to consider their cash flow and borrowings situation now and, if appropriate to their circumstances, to be prepared to apply for these loans when they become available.<\/p>  <p>  The loan scheme is part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility that I announced in the Budget, along with additional tax measures and farm payments.  Among the tax measures, I agreed with my colleague the Minister for Finance, for an adjustment to the current &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; system, which will allow for an opt-out in an exceptional year.  This is available for 2016 tax liability, and will go some way towards addressing cashflow concerns.<\/p>  <p>  As an additional support to\u00a0cashflow on farms, including Tillage farms, I also confirmed that advance payments would be made this year\u00a0in respect of the Basic Payment and Greening Payment schemes.  Advance payments commenced\u00a0on the 17th October last, the earliest possible date by which payments can begin under the governing EU Regulations, with the addition of balancing payments from the 1st\u00a0December.<\/p>  <p>  To date\u00a0&euro;1,162 billion has been paid out to more than 122,465 farmers and payments are ongoing.  Payments in excess of &euro;195 million have been made to more than 91,000 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints scheme.  Also a TAMS Scheme specifically tailored to the tillage sector is due to open\u00a0shortly.  This scheme will support grain growers in achieving further economic efficiencies and details will be made available in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, &euro;3M\u00a0was\u00a0paid in December under the Protein Aid Scheme to over 1,000 farmers growing in\u00a0excess of 12,000 ha of beans, peas and lupins.  This coupled scheme was introduced in 2015 as part of the implementation of the reformed CAP package in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I also stressed at the Tillage stakeholders meeting and I want to restate my view that in this changing landscape we need to take a fresh look at our tillage industry to ensure that it is best positioned to withstand possible future threats and to avail of the new opportunities which may present themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700131#WRUUU04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme","counter":3903,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700131#WRUUU04100"},{"type":"question","counter":3904,"qnumday":1429,"qnumall":"[1245\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700131#WRUUU04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to review the current area of natural constraint payment system to ensure that those farmers, predominantly based in the west of Ireland and farming in areas of natural constraint, receive the level of financial support that they are entitled to.","asker":"1288","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3905,"content":"<p>Article 32 of EU Regulation 1305\/2013 requires all member states to implement a new system for designating eligible areas under the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) scheme from 2018 at the latest.

The Forum is a key aspect of this and has met on\u00a0nine occasions in total and has been a useful vehicle for engagement for all those involved in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  As a strategic forum the Roundtable is focused on the sector's challenges and opportunities, and many of these have been discussed at previous fora such as for example\u00a0Brexit, Animal Health changes in other EU member states, opening of new markets and commercial customer requirements.  In addition\u00a0Bord Bia is always present to give stakeholders an overview of the sector\u00a0including prevailing market conditions, forecast supply data for coming months and years as well as updating on the marketing and promotion activity they are involved in.<\/p>  <p>  A specific key achievement of the Roundtable were the outcomes of the November 2014 forum.  Following\u00a0lengthy discussions and negotiations\u00a0all attendees unanimously agreed to a set of outcomes for the sector\u00a0covering\u00a0many aspects of the production and processing of beef as well as live exports, price transparency and producer organisations to name but a few.  The forum has also led to the legal recognition, for the first time in Ireland, of producer organisations in the Beef sector.<\/p>  <p>  With regards to price I must re-emphasise that I can have\u00a0no role in the influencing of prices for commodities.  Questions of price and market specifications are matters to be determined solely between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle.  Prices paid for cattle are determined by supply and demand market dynamics and a range of other factors such as currency fluctuations,\u00a0disposable income, consumer preferences and competition from other meats and sources of protein.  However, my Department is playing an active part in the EU's \u00a0High Level Group on the Functioning of the Food Supply chain and I look forward to engaging at EU level on the issue of unfair trading practices along the supply chain.<\/p>  <p>  With regards to Brexit, the forum has discussed this issue on both occasions it has met since the UK vote to leave the EU.  Brexit will remain an item for discussion for\u00a0future meetings as its potential impact on the Irish beef sector cannot be underestimated but it must also be said that until a deal is reached between Britain and the EU its final impact will not be clear.  There is also  a separate stakeholder forum for the discussion of the potential impacts of Brexit which I have established and which includes representatives of the beef sector at farming and processing level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700132#WRVVV02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme","counter":3943,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700132#WRVVV02300"},{"type":"question","counter":3944,"qnumday":1442,"qnumall":"[1397\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700132#WRVVV02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of the ANC review; when it is intended to publish the relevant maps; the 2017 timescale for other review milestones; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3945,"content":"<p>Article 32 of EU Regulation 1305\/2013 requires all member states to implement a new system for designating eligible areas under the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) scheme from 2018 at the latest.

The strategy for broadband rollout, the National Broadband Plan (NBP), aims to deliver high speed broadband services\u00a0to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  <\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can\u00a0get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:<\/p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services;<\/p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will\u00a0have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network\u00a0rolled out.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Department is actively monitoring the commercial deployment\u00a0plans in the BLUE areas\u00a0to ensure that all premises can get access to services.  In this regard, direct feedback from consumers is important and\u00a0if customers\u00a0in these areas cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.\u00a0<\/p><p>The area referred to by the Deputy falls within an AMBER area and\u00a0will therefore be included in the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP.\u00a0Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by\u00a0accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p><p>A formal procurement process is now in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The Department will also shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise this Intervention Area for bidders, taking into account any industry investments that have not materialised and potential other new investments. <\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the\u00a0 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home\u00a0solution\u00a0means that householders and businesses may\u00a0get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The timeframe for\u00a0the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<\/p><p>EU State Aid Guidelines requires Member States to assess the plans of telecoms operators, so that the State only intervenes in areas where plans for commercial investment are not forthcoming. <\/p><p>In October 2015 the Department published the process it proposed to adopt in order to assess commercial high speed broadband investment plans available at mapping assessment criteria.  Plans received from commercial operators were subsequently assessed under technical, deployment and financial criteria,\u00a0in line with the\u00a0EU\u00a0State Aid requirements.  This resulted in the publication of the High Speed Broadband Map\u00a0in December 2015. <\/p><p>The Map is\u00a0a\u00a0critical aspect\u00a0of\u00a0EU\u00a0State Aid compliance and the mapping process remains open, in accordance with terms that have been published on the\u00a0Department's website (<i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>) so as to ensure that existing plans are realised and that any new developments\u00a0can be managed.<\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can\u00a0access high speed broadband of at least 30 Megabits per second from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>A formal procurement process is now in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides a future proofed solution for the\u00a0 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home\u00a0solution\u00a0means that householders and businesses may\u00a0get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.\u00a0<\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention Area:<\/p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services of at least 30 Megabits per second.<\/p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will\u00a0have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network\u00a0rolled out.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Department is actively monitoring the commercial deployment\u00a0plans in the BLUE areas\u00a0to ensure that all premises can get access to services.

The regulation of telecommunications operators is the statutory responsibility of the ComReg, which is independent in its functions. <\/p>  <p>  Both policy and regulation have contributed substantially to the rollout of high speed broadband networks in the last number of years.  ComReg's NGA decisions in 2013 created the framework to drive accelerated investment in high speed broadband, which is now available to approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland.  ComReg's multiband spectrum auction in 2012 has also allowed the extensive rollout of 4G networks with at least one operator now having in excess of 90% population coverage.  From a policy perspective the National Broadband Plan is also driving investment, and legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas to allow ESB to use its network to deliver high speed broadband services, has resulted in fibre-to-the-home services being rolled out currently in 17 regional towns. <\/p>  <p>  In October 2016, I signed Regulations which will allow ComReg to allocate\u00a0spectrum in the 3.6GHz band (Wireless telegraphy (3.6GHz Band Licences) Regulations, 2016 (S.I.\u00a0 532 of 2016)).  The\u00a0liberalisation of this band is an EU\u00a0requirement and the adoption of the 3.6 GHz EC Decision is mandatory for all EU Member States, including Ireland.  This Decision is service-neutral, technology-neutral and expressly obliges Member States to allow the use of the entire 3.6GHz band fixed and mobile services.  The release of spectrum in this band will provide an 86% increase in total\u00a0spectrum available for mobile and\/or fixed wireless services, leading to\u00a0better quality voice and data services to customers across Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  ComReg is independent in its functions and I have no role in the process for allocating the spectrum which is now underway.  Having regard to the independence of ComReg in the matter and the fact that a process is underway, it would not be appropriate for me to\u00a0comment further on the matter at this time.  I would note however that the allocation process followed extensive public consultation by ComReg over almost a two year period.  I have no reason to believe that the process being currently undertaken by ComReg will not result in the fair allocation of any future spectrum assignment and\u00a0I expect the outcome of the process to provide a level of certainty and transparency for all stakeholders.  A policy direction is neither\u00a0necessary nor appropriate in the circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Investment decisions by the commercial telecommunications networks providers in the\u00a0electronic communications market, including investment decisions on the rollout of Next Generation Access (NGA) are taken purely on commercial grounds by each network operator, having regard to the predicted investment cost and the anticipated revenue returns from any such investment.  The State can only intervene in this market in cases of clear market failure.  In this regard the National Broadband Plan aims to bring competitively priced quality services to rural areas, through a State intervention to build a new high speed broadband network.  It is envisaged that this network will offer wholesale services to multiple retailers, who can in turn offer competitive,\u00a0affordable and\u00a0high speed broadband\u00a0to users. <\/p>  <p>  The Plan aims to deliver high speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  <\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can\u00a0get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:<\/p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.

The Agreement is designed to meet this objective through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)\u00a0submitted by all Parties to the agreement.  In this regard, the European Union submitted an NDC committing to a reduction of at least 40% in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels which will be met through reductions of 43% in the Emission Trading System (ETS)\u00a0and 30% in the non-ETS sector compared with 2005 levels.  A proposal on the non-ETS targets for individual Member States (i.e. the effort sharing regulation)\u00a0was\u00a0published\u00a0by the European Commission in\u00a0July 2016.  Targets have been proposed for Member States based on GDP which have then been adjusted to reflect cost effectiveness.  Flexibilities have also been included in the Commission proposal to cover Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) and the ETS.  In the case of\u00a0Ireland a target of 39% has been proposed, which has been adjusted down to 30% to reflect cost-effectiveness.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008 -2010.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.  The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005. <\/p>  <p>  According to the latest data prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and as set out in its bulletin on Ireland&rsquo;s Provisional Greenhouse Gas Emissions in 2015 (November 2016), Ireland is in compliance with its annual targets under the ESD for the years 2013 and 2014.

Decisions on the transport elements of the Capital Plan 2016-2021 were framed by the conclusions reached in my Department&rsquo;s Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport. Based on the findings in that report it is envisaged that maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the roads capital budget, approximately &euro;4.4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway.

This is being done to make public transport more reliable and efficient, thereby attracting more people out of their cars and onto buses, and so reducing congestion and pollution.  Aside from buses, we already allow cyclists to use bus lanes, as they are inherently vulnerable road-users, and a concession was made shortly after they were introduced to allow taxis to use them, as they are a form of transport available to the public for on-street hire.  Finally, the emergency services may of course also use bus lanes.  Since the introduction of bus lanes, there have been numerous requests to open them to other classes of traffic.  These have included motorcycles, mutli-occupancy vehicles, limousines, hackneys, electric vehicles, and animal ambulances, among others.  These requests\u00a0are consistently\u00a0rejected, both by my predecessors and by myself.  The principal reason is the carrying capacity of the lanes.  Any addition to the classes of traffic permitted to use them would inevitably reduce the efficiency of the lanes for their original purpose.

I am firmly of the belief that difficult issues such as this can only be resolved through open, constructive and realistic engagement between the company and its employees and I\u00a0encourage both sides to engage\u00a0constructively on the matter.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Separately I also met with the National Transport Authority who outlined to me their powers and responsibilities in relation to the provision of public transport services. I was assured by the NTA that it will work with local communities\u00a0to maintain\u00a0an appropriate level of public transport connectivity in the event of any reconfiguration of existing services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700141#WREEEEE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":4473,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700141#WREEEEE02900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Site Visits","counter":4472,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700141#WREEEEE02850"},{"type":"question","counter":4473,"qnumday":1629,"qnumall":"[41064\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700141#WREEEEE02900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"to provide details of all IDA visits to sites in individual counties in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

This work can be split into two main areas: technical assistance and advice on the administration and proposed revisions to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), and cross-Departmental work on the non-ETS climate change mitigation policies that will assist in achieving Ireland&rsquo;s climate change targets for 2020 and the forthcoming EU Effort Sharing Regulation governing 2030 emissions targets. <\/p>  <p>  On EU ETS, my Department has been involved in intensive discussions at EU Council, Parliament and Commission in recent months. These discussions relate to Phase IV of the EU ETS, due to commence in 2021. The proposed revisions to EU ETS from 2021 will require a substantial increase in ambition on the part of participating companies, as well as likely increased compliance costs. DJEI has been assessing the various technical proposals for the revised EU ETS, their impact on the competitiveness position of the sectors engaged in ETS in Ireland, and advising on Ireland&rsquo;s negotiating stance for the various proposed amendments to the Scheme. Of particular interest to DJEI is ensuring that vulnerable sectors continue to receive support through the carbon leakage provisions of EU ETS to ameliorate adverse competitiveness impacts.<\/p>  <p>  DJEI has been involved in the development of Ireland&rsquo;s forthcoming National Mitigation Plan which is soon to be open for public consultation and will itemise all relevant cross-sectoral policies, measures and programmes to achieve Ireland&rsquo;s EU emissions targets and those referred to in the Climate Action &amp;amp; Low Carbon Development Bill (2015). This will include measures aimed at improving energy efficiency in industry, the commercial sector and wider enterprise. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland plays a key role in assisting businesses in Ireland to improve their energy efficiency and to decarbonise their production processes towards a more sustainable trajectory. This important work reaps benefits in terms of cost savings and competitiveness as well as the associated environmental benefits which are key to Ireland&rsquo;s national mitigation effort to 2020 and 2030.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to mitigation, DJEI has also contributed in an advisory capacity to Ireland&rsquo;s National Adaptation Framework which is due for publication in early 2017. Similar to the National Mitigation Plan, the National Adaptation Framework will provide a comprehensive inventory of all measures and programmes, planned and in-train, aimed at adapting to climate change in Ireland in the coming decades. This Plan will lay out the critical infrastructure required by the Irish enterprise sector, as well as wider society, to adapt to the threats posed by our changing climate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700141#WREEEEE03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":4479,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700141#WREEEEE03350"},{"type":"question","counter":4480,"qnumday":1631,"qnumall":"[41314\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700141#WREEEEE03400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of requests her Department has received from either IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland since Brexit for permission to employ additional staff; the number of requests approved, pending or refused; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In its judgment delivered in May 2013, (in McGowan and others v The Labour Court, Ireland and the Attorney General), the Supreme Court held that Part III of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 was invalid having regard to Article 15.2.1 of the Constitution. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  That Article provided, in effect, that the exclusive power to make laws is vested in the Oireachtas. The Supreme Court took the view that REAs were instruments having the status of laws made by private individuals. While the Constitution allows for the limited delegation of law making functions, the provisions of the 1946 Act went beyond what is permissible under the Constitution. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The effect of that decision was to invalidate the registration of employment agreements previously registered under Part III of the 1946 Act. In consequence the Labour Court no longer had jurisdiction to enforce, interpret or otherwise apply these agreements. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Existing contractual rights of workers in sectors covered by REAs were unaffected by the ruling. Contractual rights can be altered only by agreement between the parties involved.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, the striking down of the REAs meant that new employees into the Sectors previously covered by REAs could be hired at any rate agreeable between workers and their employers, subject only to the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Acts.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Legal advice provided to the Labour Court following the Supreme Court judgment stated that while the decision had immediate effect on REAs registered pursuant to the 1946 Act it did not mean for example that monies paid by employers to employees pursuant to those REAs having been incorporated into contracts of employment could be recouped. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 provides a replacement for Registered Employment Agreements in individual enterprises and a new mechanism whereby pay and pension and sick pay provisions in a particular sector can be established and enforced. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This new framework contains a mechanism whereby, at the request, separately or jointly from organisations substantially representative of employers and\/or of workers, the Labour Court can initiate a review of the pay and pension and sick pay entitlements of workers in a particular sector and, if it deems it appropriate, make a recommendation to the Minister on the matter, who in turn, if satisfied that the process provided in the new legislation for the Labour Court to follow has been complied with, shall make the Order. Such an Order will be binding across the sector to which it relates and will be enforceable by the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Since the Act came into effect on 1st August 2015, three such applications have been made to the Labour Court, one of which was from the TEEU and which was subsequently withdrawn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700141#WREEEEE03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Enterprise Offices","counter":4485,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700141#WREEEEE03750"},{"type":"question","counter":4486,"qnumday":1633,"qnumall":"[41539\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700141#WREEEEE03800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of persons that accessed local enterprise offices, LEOs, for their services in all locations nationwide in each of the years 2014 to 2016; the number of staff employed in each location; the amount of funding each location has drawn down in each of the years 2014 to 2016; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Section 433 of the Companies Act 2014 sets out the categories of persons who are disqualified to act as the receiver of a company e.g. an undischarged bankrupt; an employee or an officer of the company concerned or a person who was such within the period of 12 months before the date of the commencement of the receivership; and certain specified family members of an officer of the company concerned.<\/p>  <p>  A receiver has specific statutory duties under section 439 which provides that: <\/p>  <p>  - receivers must achieve the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of sale; and<\/p>  <p>  - the receiver must not sell by private contract a non-cash asset of a company to a person who is or who, within three years prior to the date of appointment of the receiver, has been an officer of the company unless the Receiver has given 14 days&rsquo; notice of his or her intention to do so to all creditors of the company who are known to him or her or who have been intimated to him or her.<\/p>  <p>  These statutory duties make it imperative that the receiver obtains expert legal and valuation advice in relation to the sale of property, consistent with the duty &ldquo;to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable&rdquo;.  Breach of a receiver&rsquo;s statutory duties may result in the receiver being held personally liable for any loss incurred.<\/p>  <p>  The need for strengthening the regulation of receivers will be kept under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700143#WRGGGG02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits Applications","counter":4562,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700143#WRGGGG02450"},{"type":"question","counter":4563,"qnumday":1664,"qnumall":"[1632\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700143#WRGGGG02500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the position regarding an application for a work permit by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":4564,"content":"<p>The Employment Permits Section of my Department received an application for a General Employment Permit on 5th January 2017 for the foreign national as detailed in the attachment.

Competition to attract FDI has intensified significantly, and all FDI is hard won.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 was published just over a year ago and sets a roadmap for longer term enterprise development.  Our vision for Ireland is to be the best place to succeed in business, delivering sustainable employment and higher standards of living for all.

Part 5 of the draft Scheme proposes to strengthen consumer protection against unfair terms, including removing the exemption for negotiated terms, narrowing the scope of the terms exempt from assessment for unfairness, and expanding the list of contract terms presumed to be unfair. While I am anxious to progress the Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill, I have to take account of current European Union legislative proposals for Directives on consumer contracts for the supply of digital content and consumer contracts for the online and other distance sale of goods.  These proposals which were announced in May 2015 and published in December 2015 overlap very substantially with two of the main parts of the draft Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill.  Discussions on the digital content proposal at working party level have proceeded rapidly with a first reading of the proposal completed by April 2016 and agreement reached at the June Justice and Home Affairs Council on the basic principles of the proposal and on political guidelines for future work on it. The principles and guidelines endorsed by the Council provided the basis for a revised text of the proposal prepared by the Dutch and Slovak Presidencies. Working Party discussions over 12 meeting days during the Slovak Presidency in 2016 examined the revised text in detail.  In the view of the Presidency, these discussions made good progress and provided the basis for a policy debate on a number of aspects of the proposal at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 8-9 December. <\/p>  <p>  The incoming Maltese Presidency has indicated that it aims to achieve agreement on a general approach to the digital content proposal in the first half of 2017.  In this situation, I have to consider the advisability of bringing forward a legislative proposal to the Oireachtas when a directly related and fully harmonised legislative proposal may be at an advanced stage of the European Union legislative process.  The wisdom of introducing legislation in the Oireachtas in 2017, if large parts of that legislation would have to be repealed or substantially amended within a relatively short space of time, is obviously open to question.  I will continue to review the progress of the two European Union proposals in 2017 with a view to deciding the best course of action to take with regard to the Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of unfair contract terms, EU legislation already exists in this area.  The European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, which gave effect to the corresponding European Council Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, applies to any term in a contract concluded between a seller of goods or supplier of services and a consumer which has not been individually negotiated. Whilst contracts for financial services such as mortgages may indeed come within the scope of the Regulations, certain terms within such contracts are excluded from the scope of the Regulations. While these Regulations are enforced by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, ComReg and the Central Bank, it is ultimately a matter for the Courts to determine whether a specific term of a contract is unfair having regard to the features of the contract and the particular provisions of the Regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700144#WRHHH00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":4582,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700144#WRHHH00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commissions of Investigation","counter":4581,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700144#WRHHH00400"},{"type":"question","counter":4582,"qnumday":1670,"qnumall":"[41885\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700144#WRHHH00500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the progress made to date with the investigation into the mother and baby home in Tuam, County Galway; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that soil has been removed from the site by the investigation team; the steps taken to secure the safety of this soil in view of the sensitive nature of the investigation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":4583,"content":"<p>At the outset, it is important to stress that the statutory Commission of Investigation is independent in the conduct of its investigations.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the Mother and Baby Homes Commission has undertaken test excavations at the site of the Children's Burial Ground\/Memorial Garden located in the Dublin Road Housing Estate, Tuam, Co.

In the autumn of 2014, the childcare sector was advised that an exemption from the qualification requirement would be available for those staff who intended to retire from the sector within the next few years, and who did not wish to engage in a course of study leading to the required minimum qualification.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this cohort, there are a number of childcare staff who, because of the absence until late 2015 of an official list of approved qualifications for the early years sector, thought they already held the required qualifications and only found out that they did not when my Department published the reference list of qualifications for staff working in the early years sector on 25th September 2015.  A number of such staff applied to my Department for recognition of their qualifications and any person&rsquo;s qualification found not to meet the requirements of the Regulations could have availed of the exemption. <\/p>  <p>  However, applications for exemption were only  permitted up to the date of commencement of  the Regulations (30th June 2016).  The exemption from the qualifications requirement for the purpose of the Regulations will expire on 1st September 2021.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is aware of the issues faced by the childcare sector in sourcing suitably qualified persons and is currently working on initiatives to address this issue in order to ensure that there is a sufficient number of people available to work in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  One of those initiatives, the Learner Fund, was introduced in 2014 in order to provide support for existing childcare staff to achieve the minimum NFQ level 5 qualification requirement in the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016.  This Fund has also been expanded to support existing pre-school leaders to up-skill to NFQ Level 6, given that it is now the minimum requirement for pre-school leaders delivering the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme to have a NFQ level 6 qualification.<\/p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;1.5m will be available in 2017 to continue to Level 6 support in the context of the expansion of the ECCE programme. In addition, my Department also hopes to extend the Learner Fund to support childcare staff to achieve higher level qualifications in childcare, i.e. NFQ Level 7 and Level 8. In this regard, my Department intends to commence work as soon as possible on the development of an approved panel of Level 7 and Level 8 training providers, and a new Learner Fund application process.<\/p>  <p>  I have recently made funding available to provide a bursary to childcare staff who have undertaken higher level courses at their own expense.  My Department hopes to focus now on higher level childcare qualifications, and providing some support to staff who have undertaken such courses of study on their own initiative is the first step in this process.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, my Department will continue to monitor the situation with regard to staffing in the childcare sector. However, in the meantime I would urge childcare providers to continue to engage on the matter with their local City\/County Childcare Committee (CCC).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700144#WRHHH01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting Applications","counter":4596,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700144#WRHHH01900"},{"type":"question","counter":4597,"qnumday":1675,"qnumall":"[41236\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700144#WRHHH02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to address the length of time it takes early years services to get Garda clearance for hiring new staff; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that it often has little to do with the actual process and is in fact more to do with a backlog; and if her Department is researching any new options that will relieve this backlog and speed up the process in order that services are not left with a shortage of staff which in turn affects the sustainability of the whole service and the children in it.","asker":"1266","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":4598,"qnumday":1697,"qnumall":"[1271\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700144#WRHHH02100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on the fact that Garda vetting of early childhood practitioners can take more than ten weeks; if consideration will be given to centralising the vetting process in one organisation in order to speed up the process; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":4599,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1675 and 1697 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there have been difficulties in relation to obtaining vetting disclosures for staff.

Tusla is currently reviewing the National Leaving and Aftercare Policy in line with the <i>Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015<\/i>.  Tusla welcomes this new legislation which will place the provision of an aftercare plan on a statutory footing.  Tusla will continue to work in partnership with other state agencies to ensure that care leavers are provided with a robust and comprehensive aftercare plan.<\/p><p>The transition to independent adulthood can be challenging for many young people and a key factor in achieving success is ensuring that assessment, preparation and planning for leaving care begins in the years prior to leaving care and continues as part of the care planning process. This work is based on collaboration with the young person, their carers and partner agencies to generate an aftercare plan that is specific to the individual young person's needs.<\/p><p>The supports provided to the young person will be based on their assessed needs which can vary widely. Advice, guidance, support and signposting are key elements of this service and these supports are available to all care leavers. For those young people who are not in training or education, aftercare services have a key role in providing support to them in liaising with the relevant departments and agencies in accessing financial assistance, employment opportunities, training or supporting them to return to education<\/p><p>In addition to the aftercare planning and supports provided by Tusla, <i>Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness<\/i>commits to ensuring that young people leaving State care and at risk of homelessness are identified and catered for through appropriate housing and other supports. For the first time, the provision of accommodation for those leaving State care may be funded under the Capital Assistance Scheme of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700145#WRJJJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":4647,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700145#WRJJJ01600"},{"type":"question","counter":4648,"qnumday":1692,"qnumall":"[1054\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700145#WRJJJ01700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will outline all funding announcements made by her or by her Department for projects in County Mayo since January 2015, in tabular form; the details of each project; the status of the project at 31 December 2016; the amount of funding drawn down at 31 December 2016; and the reason for the delay in the project or funding draw down.","asker":"1335","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":4649,"content":"<p>Details in respect of the programmes from which projects in County Mayo were funded by my Department since January 2015 are set out in the following table:<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Programme\/Scheme<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Allocation<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Amounts paid at end 2016<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Number of payments to Service Providers<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Childcare Programmes<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Community Childcare Subvention Programme<\/td><td><div>&euro;3,787,931<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;3,185,829<\/div><\/td><td><div>162<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Early Childhood Care and Education Programme (ECCE)<\/td><td><div>&euro;14,553,917<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;11,452,420<\/div><\/td><td><div>352<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Early Years Capital Funding Scheme<\/td><td><div>&euro;669,444<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;654,213<\/div><\/td><td><div>75<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TEC After-School Childcare Programme<\/td><td><div>&euro;81,006<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;57,297<\/div><\/td><td><div>18<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TEC Childcare Education &amp;amp; Training Support<\/td><td><div>&euro;750,186<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;631,195<\/div><\/td><td><div>62<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TEC Community Employment Childcare Programme<\/td><td><div>&euro;388,792<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;345,312<\/div><\/td><td><div>73<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Other Programmes<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Comhairle na n&Oacute;g<\/td><td><div>&euro;36,843<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;36,843<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Play Day<\/td><td><div>&euro;650<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;650<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Recreation Week<\/td><td><div>&euro;1,700<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,700<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Play and Recreation Capital Scheme<\/td><td><div>&euro;20,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;20,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Youth Capital Funding Scheme<\/td><td><div>&euro;52,320<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;52,320<\/div><\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Special Projects for Youth Scheme<\/td><td><div>&euro;311,564<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;311,564<\/div><\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>Grand Total<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div><b>&euro;20,654,356<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div><b>&euro;16,749,343<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div><b>754<\/b><\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The Deputy might note that a variation arises between the allocations and payments in respect of the Childcare Programmes.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, Budget 2017 has provided an additional &euro;5.5m in current funding to my Department to support the provision of youth services. This will bring the total youth funding in 2017 to &euro;57.4m.  This additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.  My Department has commenced the process with national organisations and local services to identify service development needs for 2017 and to agree the 2017 allocations. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 also provided &euro;2.6m to my Department for a capital funding scheme for youth projects and services. Work on the development of a new capital funding scheme for 2017 is underway and my Department is engaging with each Education and Training Board Youth Officer to identify the capital needs of the youth sector.  I hope to announce details of this new capital scheme in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a number of funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of the impact youth service provision has on young people&rsquo;s lives.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. This includes the development of a new youth funding scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Work on the development of this scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review over the coming years.  My Department has embarked on an exercise, in conjunction with Pobal and each Education and Training Board (ETB) Youth Officer, which will map youth service provision across the State.  This mapping exercise will assist my Department and the relevant ETB in developing a detailed socio-demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  It is my intention that the mapping exercise will inform future development and investment in youth services and will inform the establishment of a small number of new sample projects, to be commenced during 2017.  In addition, my Department has already provided funding for the commencement of five new &ldquo;Sample Value for Money and Policy Review&rdquo; youth projects in 2016.  These projects are based in South East Cavan, West Wicklow, Drogheda, County Louth, in Cahir, County Tipperary and in the Fethard\/Killenaule area of Tipperary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700146#WRKKKK00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":4684,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700146#WRKKKK00600"},{"type":"question","counter":4685,"qnumday":1706,"qnumall":"[1637\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700146#WRKKKK00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the plans in place to advertise the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes in Ireland in print, radio and electronic media outlets; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1239","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":4686,"qnumday":1707,"qnumall":"[1638\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700146#WRKKKK00800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the plans in place to advertise the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes overseas in print, radio and electronic media outlets and to ensure members of the diaspora have an opportunity to share their testimony with the Commission (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1239","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":4687,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1706 and 1707 together.<\/p><p>At the outset it is important to state that the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes (and Certain related matters) is independent in its conduct.

This embraces the large number of support roles under the Framework for Major Emergency Management which includes providing assisting in dealing with a wide range of emergencies at national and local level, including severe weather, flooding and searches for missing persons.<\/p>  <p>  There is no prohibition on Civil Defence Units engaging in community support activities.  The day-to-day operational management of local Civil Defence units is the responsibility of the relevant local authority in which the unit is based.  In this context, it is a matter for each local authority to determine the type of community events that can be supported and the level of support that can be provided.  In making this determination, the local authority will take a wide range of factors into consideration including the availability of volunteers, whether those volunteers are trained and equipped to safely undertake the task, competing demands for Civil Defence support, etc.  As such, there are limits to the community support that can be provided.<\/p>  <p>  Civil Defence Units throughout the country perform excellent work in supporting the Principal Response Agencies and their communities including during adverse circumstances such as the severe weather we have seen over recent years. I very much appreciate the efforts of all the volunteers and it is my intention that Civil Defence will continue to receive the necessary funding and supports to further develop its capacity to support the Principal Response Agencies, particularly in emergency situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700146#WRKKKK02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Remuneration","counter":4708,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700146#WRKKKK03000"},{"type":"question","counter":4709,"qnumday":1718,"qnumall":"[41061\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700146#WRKKKK03100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the position in relation to the payment of an Army Ranger Wing allowance which was the subject of arbitration in 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":4710,"content":"<p>On 27 September 2010 the Adjudicator under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force awarded an increase in the Army Ranger Wing allowance.

The Defence Forces Climate Survey was published in 2016, its purpose being to inform consideration of the ongoing human resource and strategic needs of the Defence Forces. The Survey was commissioned on foot of a recommendation contained in the third and most recent Report of the Independent Monitoring Group (IMG). A similar survey was conducted in 2008. In line with the 2008 Survey, approximately 11% of Defence Forces personnel were sampled on this occasion.  The key findings of the Survey are grouped under topics such as Work Life Balance, Peer Support, Organisational Justice (within the Organisation), Procedural Justice, Organisational Fairness, Defence Forces Integrity and Supervisory Justice. I have reviewed the Report in detail and have also received a briefing from the University of Limerick (UL) researchers who undertook the project. <\/p>  <p>  The Survey findings clearly point to challenges for the Defence Forces, particularly in the areas of leadership, communication, organisational culture, the working environment and active management of personal expectations. However, many positives emanated from the Survey, especially in relation to the commitment of personnel to the values and mission of the Organisation, high levels of work satisfaction, pride in the Organisation and positive views on culture and work support. Indeed, the UL researchers point out that the findings of the Report and the recommendations are interconnected and caution should apply to reading any one particular finding in isolation. <\/p>  <p>  The responses to the issues raised in the Report of the Climate Survey will be led by the Chief of Staff by way of an Action Plan which involves the engagement of all levels of management within the Organisation. Both RACO and PDFORRA were briefed by the UL researchers on their findings and conclusions. Following that briefing, I met with the Representative Associations to hear their views and listen to their concerns in relation to the Report. It was agreed at the meeting that the Representative Associations would be fully engaged in the response to the Report and proposed Action Plan through the IMG framework, where they could put forward their views on appropriate responses. <\/p>  <p>  Follow up work to the initial findings in the Survey is being conducted by the UL researchers via focus groups. This is with a view to establishing qualitative elements behind the quantitative findings of the Climate Survey.  The Representative Associations were involved in the preparatory phase for the Focus Groups.  The conduct of the Focus Groups is due to conclude by the end of January with further feedback from the Researchers scheduled to be delivered in Q2 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700147#WRLLLL03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commemorative Events","counter":4758,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700147#WRLLLL03900"},{"type":"question","counter":4759,"qnumday":1735,"qnumall":"[1848\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011700147#WRLLLL04000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the extent of supports offered to members of the Defence Forces on leaving or retiring from the Forces; the length of time any support is extended to the persons involved; the amount of money allocated annually to such supports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":4760,"content":"<p>The Programme for a Partnership Government reaffirms my Department&rsquo;s commitment to providing support to ex-service personnel for the public service and contribution they have made to the State.<\/p>  <p>  Training is an important element of a person&rsquo;s military career.
