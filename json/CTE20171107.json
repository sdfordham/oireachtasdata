I was very impressed and could really see the excellent co-operation between the home-school liaison scheme and the strengthening families programme.  As such, I thought it would be very useful in the context of the work of the joint committee to deal with this as one of our subject items.

Also in attendance are Ms Aisling Browne and Ms Jenny Gannon, who are home school community liaison teachers in a junior and primary school on the same campus.  They are accompanied by Ms Mary Lenihan, a former home school community liaison teacher from whose positive experience and enthusiasm Ms Browne and Ms Gannon have learned a great deal.  From the Department of Education and Skills, I welcome Mr. Martin Shiel, assistant principal officer in the special education unit, and Ms Chris Kelly, assistant principal officer in the social inclusion unit.  I also welcome Mr. P&aacute;draig O'Donovan and Mr. Andy Leeson of For&oacute;ige, who will address the strengthening families programme.

It propelled me on a different route in my career and I have not been back in a classroom since.  One could say that is probably for the good of children.<\/p> <p>  The scheme was set up in 1990 under the auspices of the Department of Education and Skills.  It is now a central component of Tusla's education welfare services and is used as a means of reaching out to and engaging families in the education of their children.  It has continued to expand and remains central to the Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools, DEIS, programme and is a main policy intervention from the Department of Education and Skills to address educational disadvantage.  Together with the school completion programme and the statutory educational welfare services, the home school community liaison scheme is working to deliver a fully integrated, streamlined and cost-effective service in schools serving designated areas of disadvantage.<\/p> <p>  The overall aim of the integrated services is to improve school attendance and participation, as well as the retention of children in education, thus improving their life chances.  The strategic goals of Tusla, namely, keeping children safe, enabling families to make good decisions about their health and lifestyles, helping children engage with education and develop as active citizens, capable of economic independence, imply that partnership with communities, agencies and families is central to its work.  This model of partnership working continues to be central to the home school community liaison scheme.  This approach is about building positive and trusting relationships with communities and families, particularly reaching out to the most marginalised families and developing and maintaining high levels of skills and motivation.<\/p> <p>  Together with social work and educational welfare services, the home school community liaison scheme is uniquely placed to deliver a comprehensive range of services, along a continuum of care to marginalised children and families, utilising international best practice and evidence-based interventions.

The scheme is particularly close to my heart and I am delighted to present to the committee on it today.<\/p> <p>  The goals which underpin all work of the home school community liaison scheme are to maximise the active participation of children in the learning process, in particular, those who might be at risk of failure; and to promote active co-operation between home, school and relevant community agencies in promoting the educational interests of children.  Prior to the home school community liaison scheme, schools may not have been linking in as much as they do now with community networks.  The scheme aims to raise parents' awareness of their own capacity to enhance their children's progress and to assist them in developing relevant skills.<\/p><p>It aims to enhance children's uptake from education, their retention in the system and their continuation to post-compulsory education, as well as to enhance children's attitudes to life-long learning and to disseminate the positive outcomes from the scheme throughout the school system.<\/p><p> Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has responsibility for the operational management of the home school community liaison, HSCL, scheme through an integrated services strategy.  One national integrated services manager employed by Tusla and four senior managers, who are teachers seconded by the Department of Education and Skills to Tusla, have overall responsibility for the implementation and development of both DEIS policy and planning strategies with HSCL and for Tusla&rsquo;s strategic goals regarding educational welfare.  The 416 full-time HSCL co-ordinators are all teachers in the designated schools and are assigned for a five-year term to HSCL duties.  As teachers, they have a unique understanding of pedagogy and of strategies that help parents to support the education of their children.  At school level, there is a clear focus on targeting in a planned and cohesive manner, improved planning and evidence-based interventions and measurement of outcomes.  To this end, all HSCL co-ordinators are undergoing a comprehensive programme of continuous professional development, CPD, in order that they are better equipped to deliver a streamlined, coherent and consistent service.  As members of their school staffs, co-ordinators are to the forefront of promoting a school-wide approach to addressing issues of educational disadvantage, as well as of cultural change.<\/p><p> Home school community liaison co-ordinators run several initiatives to improve literacy and numeracy in line with national strategies.  They facilitate the active involvement of parents at curricular and policy level in schools and they train parents to become a resource to one other, to their school and above all, to their own children.  Furthermore, as part of their integrated work with the other two strands of the educational welfare service, namely, the school completion programme and statutory educational welfare service, Home school community liaison co-ordinators ensure that all possible supports and initiatives will have been attempted prior to formal referrals being made to the statutory arm of the service.  At local level, co-ordinators operate a cluster model of support where co-ordinators in a close geographical area come together to formulate action plans, share best practice, provide mutual support and develop effective interventions in their own schools.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Tobin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510070400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>It is interesting that both Mr. Kelly and Ms Tobin come from the background of being on the ground.

The INTO recognises that the HSCL scheme has enhanced pupils' learning opportunities and promoted retention in the education system through a partnership approach between parents and teachers.  Often parents of pupils who attend DEIS schools have had a poor experience of education themselves and find it difficult to engage in parental involvement at school level.  The HSCL teacher works closely with parents to enable them to better support and encourage their own children in education.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding the success of the scheme, in recent years HSCL teachers have been over-stretched and under-resourced as a consequence of recessionary cutbacks.  The scheme needs continued commitment to investment and a renewed vision to ensure it responds to the increasing needs of pupils and families living in challenging contexts.  The INTO is hopeful that the educational welfare service within Tusla will offer a renewed commitment to safeguarding and progressing the very valuable HSCL scheme.<\/p> <p>  The ambitions set out for the HSCL scheme can only be realised when accompanied by targeted and sustainable funding.  The HSCL portion of the annual DEIS grant currently stands at 10% and is allocated for the implementation of activities that are consistent with the principles and practices of the HSCL scheme.<\/p><p>However, in order to provide meaningful and targeted supports, more funding should be assigned to DEIS schools to support such worthwhile initiatives.<\/p><p> Since the recessionary cutbacks, professional development opportunities for HSCL teachers have been minimal.  The preventative role of the HSCL encompasses a broad remit, including courses, transfer programmes, integration with community groups, policy formation at school level, literacy and numeracy development and staff development to name but a few.  Due to the broad and ever-evolving nature of the HSCL role, a commitment to ongoing professional development and opportunities for networking within clusters is required.  Professional induction support is also required for newly appointed HSCLs as there is increasing turnover due to the five-year limit on the deployment of HSCL teachers.  Adequate induction is important to ensure that consistency, experience and expertise are harnessed.  The INTO acknowledges and welcomes the recent commitment by the educational welfare services to a comprehensive CPD programme that is under way.  However, in light of the developing nature of the role and the staff turnover within HSCL, the INTO reiterates the need for professional development to be ongoing.  While there is some rationale for introducing a five-year limit on the deployment of HSCL teachers, a balance must be achieved to ensure the five-year limit does not result in schools losing experienced teachers who have invested time in establishing strong relationships with families.<\/p><p> While acknowledging the need to enable all teachers to experience the role of the HSCL, the INTO is of the view that schools should be granted the autonomy and flexibility at local level to deploy the best placed teacher to the role of HSCL rather than be confined by a five-year limit.  Staff deployment is a function of the school principal as set out in the Education Acts.<\/p><p> The cut to rural DEIS HSCL support is regrettable.  Rural DEIS schools have specific needs and would benefit from improved home school links.  Arguably, there is a role for HSCL support to build home school relations in all primary schools.  The HSCL scheme should be reassigned to all schools recognised as having educational disadvantage status and consideration should be given to extending the scheme to special schools who have particular needs in terms of home school relations.<\/p><p> The level of engagement required to support Travellers needs intervention beyond that which can be incorporated into the current remit of the HSCL role.  In an attempt to counteract the loss of resources to Travellers, the INTO proposes that consideration should be given to expanding the allocation of HSCL teachers in areas that have a high concentration of Traveller pupils, including non-DEIS schools.  Extending the capacity of HSCL to support Traveller pupils and their families would require specific CPD opportunities for HSCL teachers that would enhance their understanding of Traveller culture and the specific barriers faced by Travellers in education.<\/p><p> Home visitation is an integral part of the HSCL scheme.  The nature of home visits has evolved in recent years and HSCL teachers sometimes find it problematic fulfilling the requirement for home visits.  Some parents are reluctant to accommodate HSCL visits in the home and prefer school-based visits as the practice of home visits does not always align with their culture.  Interactions with parents should be about the contact irrespective of the context.  Schools and HSCL teachers need to be trusted with the flexibility and discretion to determine locally whether home or school interactions are most appropriate at any given time.<\/p><p> While the INTO supports the integrated, cross-agency approach to supporting children and their families, it is important to state that HSCL teachers are not social workers or welfare officers and do not want to take on roles for which they are not qualified.  Participation of HSCL teachers in Meitheal should not be obligatory.  In the event that teachers are involved, they should have the opportunity to do so with the relevant supports in place, such as substitution cover.  Any involvement in Meitheal or similar programmes should not involve excessive paperwork for teachers and schools.   The INTO is strongly of the view that the role of the HSCL teacher in building lasting relationships between the home and the school is essential in tackling educational disadvantage.  Parental involvement, especially in areas at risk of social exclusion, does not just benefit the child and the school; it is a crucial aspect of lifelong learning.<\/p><p>Parental involvement, especially in areas at risk of social exclusion, does not just benefit the children and the school, but is a crucial aspect of lifelong learning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McCafferty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510070400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I now call Ms Browne and Ms Gannon, who I presume will split the time between them.

The HSCL scheme in schools is an extensive one that enhances the life of the school and the lives of families where HSCL is involved.  When children enrol in Scoil Mhuire S&oacute;isearach, HSCL is part of the admission team that identifies and refers families who may be in need of extra support.<\/p> <p>  Home visits help to break down existing barriers, offering supports to parents, and are crucial to bridging the gap between home and school.  Sitting at a kitchen table with a father or a mother hearing their deepest concerns and desires for their family is challenging work, but a privilege gifted to us in the role.  It is a privilege to be able to listen in a non-judgmental way and offer support.  We can offer educational guidance when helping parents accessing extra supports if their child has learning difficulties or behavioural needs.<\/p> <p>  The dedicated space of a parents' room enables us to chat informally with parents to further create and build open supportive relationships between home and school.  This space also lends a hand to creating communities, encouraging relationships between parents to grow so that they can then, as Ms Tobin mentioned, support each other.<\/p> <p>  Being a parent is a difficult job, especially being a parent who is at home all day as it can be extremely isolating.  Many times parents tell us that without the parents' room they would not speak to another adult all day and that their engagement in the parents' room has changed their lives and may have helped them make their first friend in many years.<\/p> <p>  We offer courses for parents from personal development to literacy and numeracy initiatives, and parenting programmes to increase parental confidence in supporting their child with homework.  Engagement in the parents' room has led to a new positive outlook on education.  It builds parents' confidence and many return to VTOS or the ETB for classes or courses.  This is very positive for parents and children alike.<\/p> <p>  We organise day trips with parents and they are always thoroughly enjoyable.  The Chairman kindly invited us to Leinster House last December.  Some of the parents commented that they never thought they would ever be in this building.  It is wonderful to be able to facilitate that.  In September of this year we brought a group of parents to the National Ploughing Championships.  Off we went with our wellies and everything, and we had a wonderful day.<\/p> <p>  Senator Ruane kindly accepted our invitation to visit us in Scoil Mhuire.  She sat for an hour and chatted with the parents, and shared her inspirational life story with them.  That was another wonderful opportunity for parents to engage.<\/p> <p>  Parental engagement with the HSCL increases motivation and encourages desire in parents to become part of their community, building self-confidence and self-esteem.  Ultimately all our interventions aim to promote and nurture positive mental health of the adults in our school family.  This, in turn, has a positive effect in the home.  Parents are the primary educators of their children and their own personal development impacts greatly on a household.<\/p><p>Parents are encouraged, through the HSCL scheme, to engage in classroom activities and initiatives in school: Maths for Fun, Science for Fun, Literacy Lift-off.<\/p><p> Regarding shared reading with the children, children delight in seeing their parents involved in school activities and in their education.  Parents engaging positively with school reiterates the benefit of education and encourages the children to engage more and to believe in the power of education.  Parents and teachers share a common goal, wanting what is best for our children.  Working side by side with parents strengthens our efforts to provide the best we can for them.  HSCL enables us to achieve our goals for each child, striving to break the cycle of educational disadvantage.  Working collaboratively in an integrated service with schools completion programme and educational welfare officer, we aim to ensure the child, parents and, ultimately, the family engage in a positive manner with education.  It remains of paramount importance that it is a qualified teacher who fulfils the role because of the complex nature of individual educational needs and the need to fully understand the curriculum methodologies, etc.<\/p><p> Working in this role in recent years has led me to a deeper understanding of children's situations and what they may have to deal with before they arrive in school at all.  I am certain that I will return to the classroom a very different teacher with more realistic aims, though continuing to challenge children to reach their full potential.  My time in HSCL has enriched my professional career, deepened my belief in the power of education as well as guiding me to do my best for others when I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Aisling Browne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510070400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Oftentimes, HSCL is the only support going into a house and sometimes for families who have been engaged in other support services, we are the only support that is left in a house.  Isolation is detrimental, and it is critical and crucial that we are all linked to our communities, so one of the great jobs of HSCL is to encourage that engagement and that openness to other community agencies, whether statutory or voluntary, whether it is their children becoming involved in the local family resource centre or taking part in the strengthening families programme or going through the process of the meitheal with Tusla or facilitating parenting courses and self-esteem programmes for children.  All of these encourage them to do what is ultimately the most difficult job in the world, and that is to parent children.  As a senior school, moving from primary to secondary school is one area of particular stress and difficulties for many families in our schools.  We run a transition programme that supports families through the entire process, from discussing which secondary school setting may suit their child best to enrolling in the school, attending the open nights.  In our local community college, St. Conleth's, we are lucky enough to have a HSCL teacher there who we liaise with to ensure a smooth transition.  We facilitate the stepping stones programme, which is run by the local Kildare youth project workers, which are also then informed by our SCP and HSCL teams to support the children's transitions through and on to secondary school.  My role in that is very much to support the parents to get their children to engage, to discuss how to set up good habits for secondary school and to investigate ways to help keep their children in school.  Because of the position of trust that we hold with families, we know their stories.  Their stories informs their children's stories, and their children's stories inform the stories of the classroom.  As a teacher, I know that helpful small snippets of information can support and be a huge support to a child within a classroom, so oftentimes it will be my job to share, with the permission of the parent, a story that is relevant specifically to the child in the room.  It is because of this shared information that behaviours will be sorted out, relationships will be built and children will ultimately positively engage in the classroom and in the school.  Ultimately, we are working on a cultural change, a long-term effect.  We need to do that, completing all of the paperwork and monitoring and everything else that is required of us, without impinging on the dignity of the families who are part of our service.  Having been in the school now for 18 years since the home school liaison was set up in the school, I now can see the long-lasting effect of that.<\/p><p>I can see the rewards because parents who initially engaged in the parent's room all the way back then now bring their children to school themselves.  They regularly stop me or Ms Browne in the yard and tell us they remember when their mother was in with us and did a course and that they cannot wait to start their course, or that they were involved in the classroom with Maths for Fun and ask whether it is still done and whether they can get involved.  For all of us who work and who want our children to progress through education positively, the HSCL scheme impacts very positively on everybody involved in the education process, including the parents, teachers, pupils, community and, at the end of the day, our whole society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jenny Gannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510070400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I will now call the witnesses from the Department, but before I do I must inform them that I must excuse myself in a few moments and I will ask Deputy Martin to take the Chair.

DEIS Plan 2017, published earlier this year, represents a renewal of the DEIS programme and sets out a vision for future intervention in the area of social inclusion in educational policy.  DEIS focuses on addressing and prioritising the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from pre-school through second level education, three to 18 years, through the school support programme, which includes a suite of interventions, comprising in school and out of school supports.<\/p> <p>  The HSCL scheme is a key support for DEIS urban primary and post-primary schools, which operates as part of the integrated educational welfare service of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  Tusla, which is the dedicated State agency responsible for improving well-being and outcomes for children, has responsibility for the management of the HSCL scheme, together with the school completion programme and the statutory educational welfare service.  Tusla's educational welfare service works collaboratively with our Department and schools to ensure that children&rsquo;s participation in the education system is maximised.  The HSCL scheme is in existence since 1990.  The underlying vision and thrust of the HSCL scheme is preventative; therefore, it seeks to promote and develop real partnership between parents, schools and communities, in order to enhance pupils' outcomes and learning opportunities, through improved attendance, participation and retention in the education system.<\/p> <p>  The role of the HSCL co-ordinator is to work primarily with the salient adults in the child's life, in order to empower them, so that they can better support their children to attend school, participate in education and develop positive attitudes to life-long learning.  Central to the HSCL initiative is the identification of educational needs and the provision of a tailored and proportionate response to those needs, through a range of interventions, which are evidence-based, focused and structured.<\/p> <p>  All DEIS urban primary and DEIS post-primary schools are included in the HSCL scheme, which serves 539 schools.  The scheme is delivered by 416 full-time HSCL co-ordinators, with 235 at primary and 181 at post-primary level, who are teachers in these schools and assigned to HSCL duties either in individual schools or clusters of schools, catering for approximately 156,000 pupils.  The current cost of this provision to our Department is &euro;25 million.  For DEIS schools included in the HSCL scheme, it is a requirement that at least 10% of the annual DEIS grant to each school should be allocated for use on HSCL activities and made available to the HSCL co-ordinator.  The total allocation for the DEIS grant from our Department is approximately &euro;16 million.<\/p> <p>  The post of HSCL co-ordinator is required to be rotated at least every five years in order to provide greater opportunities to gain experience for teachers in the area of educational disadvantage, and, in turn, to bring experience gained in the role back into the school to complement teaching and learning in the classroom.<\/p><p>This arrangement serves to develop experience and build capacity within the teaching staff in the important area of parental engagement and identification of the challenges in the home background of particular pupils.  HSCL co-ordinators, as agents of change in schools, work in an integrated way with all other support services, particularly school completion, SCP, staff and educational welfare officers, to implement a whole-school approach to improving attendance, participation and retention in education for the most marginalised and educationally disadvantaged pupils.  They also have a critical role in supporting the development, implementation, evaluation and review of the school&rsquo;s DEIS plan, particularly through parental involvement interventions that are designed to improve literacy, numeracy and positive engagement.<\/p><p> HSCL co-ordinators also play a key role in effecting successful transitions through the education continuum: from preschool to primary school; from primary school to second level; within second level from junior to senior cycle; and onwards through appropriate pathways to further and higher education.  The role of the HSCL coordinator is to empower parents to support their child&rsquo;s education and to ensure parents are linked in with the various stages of the education continuum by facilitating engagement between teaching and other staff and parents.<\/p><p> I thank the members for the opportunity to address the committee today.

For&oacute;ige provides a broad range of services and programmes to young people, families and communities across Ireland.  For&oacute;ige engages with young people aged from ten to18 to enable them to achieve their full potential regardless of their backgrounds or the challenges that they face.  We achieve this through the provision of universal and targeted youth services and education programmes that are proven to deliver positive outcomes for young people.  For&oacute;ige works with more than 50,000 young people, helping them to build the skills, resilience and belief in their own individual ability to reach their full potential.  For&oacute;ige&rsquo;s work is embedded in communities across Ireland and is a unique partnership between young people, parents, volunteers, and the community.<\/p> <p>  Involvement in youth work benefits all young people.  It is a strong preventative factor in delaying young people&rsquo;s experimentation with substances and also helps develop their skills to reduce the harms associated with alcohol and substance misuse.  For&oacute;ige operates a number of drug prevention and education projects around the country which work with young people, parents and families in delivering a range of evidence-based educational and awareness programmes along with providing support and training to schools and others in the community.  The aim of all of these programmes is to reduce or delay drug and alcohol use among young people.  This is achieved through the delivery of primary and secondary drug prevention programmes for young people as well as training and support for parents, schools and community-based organisations.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. P&aacute;draig O'Donovan, will now tell the committee more about the strengthening families programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Leeson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510070400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The strengthening families programme is an evidence-based family skills training programme that involves parents and young people for three hours once a week over 14 weeks.  This programme aims to reduce risk factors around alcohol and drug use, mental health challenges and criminal behaviour.  It does this by increasing family strengths, developing young people&rsquo;s social competencies and improving positive parenting skills.  The SFP has been identified as a programme that delivers a range of proven benefits for families and young people because of the unique way in which it engages parents and young people together.<\/p><p>The programme structure is that families enjoy a meal for the first hour of each weekly session and then separate into their respective groups - parents, teen or child - for the next hour for a skills based workshop.  The family are brought back together for the final hour to practise some of the skills they have learned.  Transport and child care for young people are provided where practicable and financially possible in order to reduce barriers and enable families to fully participate in the programme.<\/p><p> The strengthening famiilies programme was introduced to Ireland in 2007.  The National strengthening famiilies programme Council of Ireland was established to ensure adherence to the fidelity of the programme and best practice guidelines, to provide training and to bring together co-ordinators and trainers to share their knowledge and experience.  Since 2007, in excess of 1,500 families have graduated from the programme.  This is the number of families who have linked in with the council.  There are other programmes but these numbers are not recorded.  The council is not funded and exists only because a number of key agencies support it with staff and time.<\/p><p> The strengthening famiilies programme, SFP, has been delivered in County Kildare since 2008 and is co-ordinated by the For&oacute;ige drug prevention and education initiative.  Delivery involves a number of statutory, community and voluntary partners, including social work, drugs education, youth and probation services, family resource centres and the County Kildare Leader partnership.  This year, the first independent evaluation of SFP in Kildare was commissioned with a particular focus on 2014-2016.  The results of the evaluation highlighted significant improvements in family communication and relationships, child behaviour, parental competencies and confidence.  This also leads to reduced service utilisation by families.  Families reported being better able to deal with problems and to spend more time together as a family.  Some parents also reported increased trust, self-esteem and social skills among children.  Parents indicated an improvement in school attendance and behaviour in school.  The following is a quotation from one parent interviewed for the evaluation: \"The teachers couldn't get over the change in him.  Before, he had to sit on his own.....but now he's interacting back in the class.\"<\/p><p> The strengthening famiilies programme has been identified as a fit for families in cases where schools are facing challenges with young people who have very little structure in their lives, which may be due to inconsistent parenting and family experiences.  SFP has the ability to bring about positive change for whole families rather than just focusing on the one identified problem child.  Parents relationships with schools also improves as they gain useful skills and confidence to engage better with teachers allowing for a unified approach to working with the young person.  Schools are very enthusiastic about the programme, which is highly regarded by principals and teaching staff who see first-hand the benefits to pupils and parents of engagement in the programme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig O'Donovan","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510070400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Deputy Catherine Martin took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510070400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Home school sommunity liaisons and education welfare officers are among our many referrers, with almost one third of this year's participants having been referred by them to the strengthening famiilies programme in Kildare.

It relies on the support and involvement of link workers and facilitators whose time is given by statutory and community agencies to support and implement the delivery of the programme. Co-ordination of the programme is a significant undertaking in terms of the time and resources required to oversee all of the elements of the programme from referrals and home visits to co-ordinating the steering group and weekly programme sessions.  Given the success of the model, the proven outcomes and the demand for places on the programme, our ambition for the programme in County Kildare and elsewhere is that a role be funded to oversee the delivery of the strengthening famiilies programme.<\/p> <p>  The strengthening famiilies programme has been shown to reduce risk factors and increase protective factors for families and for young people.

We were this small group of people who were not actually in a classroom teaching.  It was quite a challenge to convince colleagues that we were actually doing a real job because people had this impression that one was drinking tea with parents all the time.  It took a while to establish oneself.  Building a profile in the community I found was the first challenge.  One had to become known in the community, be visible around the community and be accepted in the community because back in the early 1990s, communities such as Darndale, which were quite new, were very suspicious of people in authority.  The initial assumption was that we were social workers and that we were there to spy on families and to interfere in the family home and get information.  Building comfort and assuring people that one was there to support them and not to obstruct or interfere was very important.<\/p> <p>  At present, the scheme is widely accepted because we now have 416 people.  Over 27 years, many people who have been through the scheme are now school principals or are back in the classroom, or, like myself and Ms Tobin, have gone on to do other things.  The scheme is very well received.  Recently, I attended a European Union seminar at which representatives of the European Union's countries were impressed with this concept where teachers were released from the classroom to work in the community.  We are unique in that.  The scheme has gone from strength to strength and is an extremely effective scheme.  It is also staffed by really positive people, as the committee has gathered from our colleagues here, who are enthused about the work and who bring energy to their work every day.  It is fantastic that we have the five-year rotation, even though there may be objections to it.  The more teachers who experience this, the more those teachers learn about what is happening for families and the more realistic they become in their expectations.  <\/p> <p>  Certainly, the first message I brought back to teachers in my school was to not start the day demanding homework from kids who come from really challenging homes because straightaway one is setting up conflict.  One should welcome in the children and do positive things to make them feel at home in school, rather than creating a problem before they even get in the door.  It is about enabling people to understand what is going on and enabling people to understand the reality of family life.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1510070400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly.

The kind of work that is done in this area and that is not necessarily seen is hugely important.  One of the big difficulties in areas where DEIS schools operate relates to parents engaging with those schools.  This is because many of them had bad experiences at school and they literally do not want to come in the door of the school.  In that regard, our guests' role is really important.<\/p><p>Following on from that, I want to ask whether those of our guests who have that experience have recommendations on how schools might engage with parents a bit more.  In my constituency, Corpus Christi primary school in Moyross<b><\/b>brings parents in by means of encouraging them - mothers and fathers - to attend cooking classes there.  In that way, they are made to feel comfortable in the school.  Ms Tobin will be familiar with this.  I know other schools do that sort of thing.  Is there something more that schools can do to bring the families into schools as well as bringing the schools to the families by means of the work our guests do?<\/p><p>The principals of primary and post-primary DEIS schools in Limerick have a really good clustering system whereby they meet and work together.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on clustering.<\/p><p>Ms Tobin and Deputy Madigan referred to measuring outcomes.  Does this happen?  Perhaps that is a question for the officials from the Department.<\/p><p>Does Tusla engage with the area-based childhood, ABC, programmes, which also come under the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and which involve zoning in on really deprived communities and working with families from the birth of children onwards.  Is there some involvement with the ABC programmes, which are really good?<\/p><p>I have a final question.  I apologise to the Chair for asking so many.  A previous speaker referred to Traveller children.  Obviously, not all Traveller children and not all homeless children attend DEIS schools.  Are there children who are falling through the cracks?  Again, perhaps this is more a question for the Department.  I know of Traveller children who attend schools in an area that would be considered quite well-off generally.  They are not in DEIS schools but they do come from a very needy family.  Children in homeless accommodation would sometimes find themselves in a similar situation.  That may not always be the case because they might be able to continue to go to school in their own communities even though they are currently living in hotels or hubs.  Perhaps one of the witnesses could comment on how we can get to those children who are often the most vulnerable - by definition, they are the most vulnerable in many cases - and not allow them to fall through the cracks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#Q00300","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1510070400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

What can be done in schools is all about leadership.  If the leadership in the school is open and welcomes and embraces parents, then all kinds of things are possible.  Unfortunately, the opposite can be the case and the leadership might be fearful of parents or reluctant to engage.  There are many schools that make it quite difficult for parents to actually enter their premises.  We put up all kinds of barriers and buzzers and that makes it quite challenging.  Obviously, schools have to operate and function but there is room for interaction.  It is about accessibility and creating a welcoming atmosphere whereby all the adults on the school staff, if they see a parent, will pop over, say hello, and ask how they are and who they are looking for.  It is about creating that positive atmosphere.  My colleagues might have more to say about that.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the ABC programmes.  I am fortunate enough to have come from there.  I have been managing an ABC programme for the past ten years.  When one has been around as long as I have, one can dip one's toe into lots of different things.  Certainly, we are now embracing some of the really good, evidence-based work that is happening there, particularly through our school completion programme.  We have the opportunity to embed some of the evidence-based approaches in that programme.  We have also worked very closely with the home school community liaison scheme and the school completion programme.  Educational welfare officers are involved in quite a few of the ABC programmes.   We would absolutely see the benefits in this regard, particularly in the context of early intervention.<\/p> <p>  Another really good development is that it is now part of the home school liaison's role to engage with the children in preschool.  While many people would have been doing that already, it is now a part of the role that they have to embrace and manage the transition and support families before the children even arrive in a school.<\/p><p>Regarding Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's question about Traveller children and homeless children, the reality is that we know that approximately 50% of children who come from DEIS primary schools migrate to non-DEIS post-primary schools, which is a real challenge.  From our point of view, the one aspect of our service that serves all schools is the statutory education welfare services.  Where we find the need for support or where families come to our attention, we will support them but, again, we are quite a thin service.  We have one welfare officer for every 50 schools, so it is not a very comprehensive service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510070400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>The home school community liaison teachers might take the final question - we were chatting about it earlier - but I am happy to address the question about outcomes and their measurement.  Through our CPD programme we deliver training in logic modelling to home schools.  We are working very hard at present to develop a culture of being outcomes-focused - in other words, looking at the desired outcome around attendance, participation and retention and then working backwards, looking at the initiatives we can use to improve these outcomes for children.  As one home school co-ordinator said in one of our CPD sessions once: \"I work with parents but my job is not to fill the school with parents, but with children.\"  While the home school community liaison programme focuses on the adults in the child's life, our CPD programme is all about improving educational outcomes for children.  The logic model looks at those educational outcomes and the initiatives that would best serve those outcomes in the short, medium and long term.  The process is reviewed, a baseline is taken and, at the end of a term, the question is asked whether this initiative improved outcomes.  For example, did more of the marginalised parents attend the parent-teacher meeting?  If so, this is something we can do again and build on.  If not, we need to look at another initiative and another way of reaching those families.  That is very much on the top of our agenda at present.

To come in on the point about bringing parents into the school, we have heard back from many of our HSCL teachers that the increased demands for Garda vetting within schools are becoming a real challenge.  They are becoming somewhat of a barrier for some parents, particularly in socio-economically disadvantaged areas.  It is about getting the balance right, without compromising child protection and so on, obviously, in order that parents are comfortable, are welcome to come into the school and are not met with that additional barrier.  Some of them may have had experience in prison and so on, which is obviously a challenge.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Travellers, I reiterate that we propose that there would be possibly even a shared HSCL teacher in areas of high concentration of Travellers.  This might be not just for DEIS schools, but also for non-DEIS schools.  Another big gap is in special schools, where there is a very vulnerable group of children as well and a real need to link up the home and the school.  Given it has been such a successful scheme, consideration should be given to its expansion to those parents in order that they could have more involvement in the school and more interaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McCafferty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510070400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Regarding bringing parents into the school, in my role - and Ms Gannon and I work very closely together - the building of relationships, specifically the building up of that trusting relationship with parents, is so important.  We have been in a very good position; we have had a parents' room.  Actually, at present it is a building site as we are in the middle of a new build, but we will have a new parents' room, I hope, in September 2018.  Our parents' room is open first thing in the morning.  It is a welcoming space.  It is a space for parents.  We facilitate the activities in that parents' room.<\/p><p>Ms Gannon and I, like previous HSCL teachers, make sure the parents have ownership of that room.  Parents come into the room, they feel welcome there, they talk to one another, and there is a space where they can talk in private if they need to talk to one of the HSCL teachers, but it is their room, their space.  It is there that they can talk to one another, share ideas, share problems and find solutions, working together.<\/p><p> Facilitating and providing courses for parents is also of huge importance.  These courses can be very simple - Ms Tobin referred to classes in sewing and painting and so on - but we have experienced in Newbridge that many target parents have many talents.  We have run many parent-led classes.  A dad came to do cookery classes with a group of parents over a number of weeks.  A mum came to work on cooking with parents as well.  That kind of parental engagement is super.  One does not always get it, but it is a big success.<\/p><p> Another thing in HSCL is that it is so difficult to measure one's success.  However, I remember two years ago speaking with my principal, Brian O'Reilly, while looking out the window at a group of parents whom we had encouraged to paint the yard for the kids.  There were times we drove around town calling out the windows at them.  I looked out the school window with my principal, Brian, and said: \"That is success.\"  There was a mum who had had a terrible time, had been in prison and so on and had defied all the odds.  Her child was in school that day, and she was kneeling down painting a snake or something in the junior infants' yard.  That is huge success.  If we can offer that to a family or to one person, we are reaching our goal and we are getting there.  It is also a matter of opportunities to work with the classroom teachers.  We involve parents in science week and maths week, and parents come to work with groups of children for maths trails.  To get the parents into the school, we want them to feel they are part of this too and that it is not just the children and not just those teachers up there.  They are as much a part of the school as their children are.  We want them to feel it is a safe space for them to come to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Aisling Browne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510070400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>The Deputy's point about some children in some families falling through the cracks, or the potential for this, is definitely something we must consider as a whole.

If there is a separation of if there has been a bereavement or even a diagnosis of a special educational need within a family, we can step in, support the family and then step back out again, whereas in other schools that do not have the HSCL service, what started out as a small problem can escalate and have a huge detrimental effect on the overall education of the children involved.

I am a big advocate of that programme and I believe that it does not get enough recognition.

I know the programme has had many funding cuts over the last years and it has already been operating on a shoestring budget.  What plans, if any, has Tusla for expanding or enhancing that service or is there any way of increasing funding to that programme? What can this committee do to support it? I believe that the school completion programme does not get enough recognition and it does a lot of valuable work.<\/p> <p>  My next query is similar to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's question.  What role can schools play in helping children who suffer from anxiety, even at primary school level?  There is a huge increase in this and, with all due respect to teachers, I do not believe they understand the level of worry that some children have when coming in to school.  It could be considered a minor thing, but it is a major deal to the children.  The school where my own two children go, for example, does a lot of work on mindfulness.  The school has mindfulness Tuesdays when there is no homework and pupils have to do an activity that is not related to technology.  It is a small thing but those kinds of steps get children talking about it.

There are 124 school completion programmes around the State serving 700 schools.  These are predominantly DEIS schools but we also have some non-DEIS schools that feed in to DEIS schools.  This scheme has been in place since 2002.  It followed on from its predecessors the 8-15 early school leaver initiative and the stay in school initiative.  The school completion programme currently has funding of &euro;24.7 million per annum - and as the Deputy has correctly said, between 2010 and 2011 when the austerity cuts hit there was a 25% cutback in budget - so it has come from a budget of some &euro;32 million.  There has been stability and since it came in to Tusla we have managed to stop the gap so the funding has remained stable.<\/p> <p>  We are very fortunate that our parent department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, has managed to generate a fairly significant funding increase for Tusla.  There are multiple demands on that funding, but as part of our budget bid this year one of our demands was for an increase of 5% of funding towards school completion.  The budget has arrived in Tusla now and we are working on it internally.  I am confident that we will get an increased allocation for next year.  We have to recognise that a commitment has been made to the new schools that have come in to the DEIS programme and that they must be included in the school completion programme from September 2018.  Some of the increase in our funding will have to go towards including those schools but I am certainly optimistic.  It is a very small increase in funding, but it is a start.  It is one of the matters we spoke about with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.<\/p> <p>  There is significant reform underway in terms of school completion, such as a very significant continuing professional development programme, similar to the home school liaison programme CPD, because there had not been CPD within school completion for some time.<\/p><p>School completion staff had six days of continuing professional development, CPD, last year.  There are also some significant issues around governance that we must address.  That is under way at the moment and I am confident in that regard.  Tusla is 100% committed to the programme.  This sounds like a broken record, but I will say it again, I spent six years working in school completion and I can see the benefit of the programme.  All of the programmes working seamlessly together really do make a difference to children.  School completion is primarily targeted at children who are most at risk, or children who may have dropped out of the school system.  It makes a real difference to children who are right on the margins.  Our commitment is definitely to grow the scheme and, over the coming years, to try restore some of the funding that has been lost, especially as the State is now in a better economic situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510070400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I will address the Deputy's question regarding the social work concern.  This is something that comes up, and has come up more in the past, especially in Meitheal.  We are responsible for induction CPD to newly appointed home school community liaison, HSCL, co-ordinators.  As part of that induction we make it very clear to HSCL co-ordinators that they are experts in education.  This is why the Department of Education and Skills invests this money to ensure that teachers who are released from teaching duty can reach out to families to give them guidance and support, around the parents' own education and their child's education.  When Meitheal was set up as part of Tusla's partnership and family support network we saw this as an opportunity to support the community aspect of the HSCL co-ordinator role.  They have always had a role around linking parents to supports within the community.  In the CPD for newly appointed co-ordinators we say that their role is to refer, refer, refer - unless it is an educational issue.  Then the co-ordinator has the expertise to offer the support.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Meitheal, sometimes the school may be the first place where additional needs are identified.  With educational needs, be they behavioural or learning support, sometimes there are additional needs and particularly with behavioural issues in school or with school refusal.  Additional support may be needed in these cases and they need a wraparound support service within the community.  From this point of view, Meitheal is a vehicle for co-ordinators to actually access that support so that the group of professionals who can best support that family can be brought around the table.  This is with complete consultation with the parent because the parent must agree to this process.  It cannot happen without the permission of the parent.  The professionals can then engage.  The HSCL co-ordinator is part of that team, but only part of the team with regard to educational support.  If the primary need is an educational one, the HSCL co-ordinator may take the lead on the plan to support the family.  If the primary need is not an educational one they will be part of the Meitheal team but certainly not as social workers.  It is important the HSCL co-ordinators maintain their role as educators and experts in that area.  We support that and we would always fight to maintain it.  It is, however, very much a co-operative approach.  Meitheal is about co-operation, linking and engaging, with support from other family support services in the community.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Tobin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510070400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I will further explain how teachers and HSCL teachers are addressing well-being, social and emotional difficulties in children.

In addition, teachers are doing yoga, mindfulness and meditation with their pupils in the classroom.  Deputy Funchion is correct that it is one of the key issues we hear about from all teachers, not just from HSCL teachers, around the increasing anxiety and mental health issues in very young children.  Together with that, test anxiety is a particular issue and it is not helped that there is an increasing emphasis on standardised testing, and that standardised tests are being used to determine resources.

This service came into Tusla in 2014 when the National Educational Welfare Board ceased to exist.  The service struggled during the time of the National Educational Welfare Board because of the recruitment embargo and when staff left, they were not replaced.  When the service came into Tusla in January 2016, we had just over 60 educational welfare officers, EWOs.  By the end of 2017, we will have 90 - an increase of 50% - which is not massive but which is significant.  We have approximately 4,000 schools so members can do the maths themselves.  We were working at an average of 70 schools per EWO.  By the end of this year, however, it will be down to below 50 and our intention is to reduce it incrementally in the coming years.  By the end of 2018, I would like it to be, at most, 40 per EWO.<\/p> <p>  We work across a large expanse of schools and we are not meeting needs early enough.  We work through a referrals system but we are not able to get to referrals quickly enough.  We have to give priority to students who do not have places in schools, who have been expelled from school or who have special needs that prevent them from accessing places in schools.  I would like to get to children before the 20 days from when they are referred but, unfortunately, we do not have the capacity to do that.  There are 120 education welfare officers in Northern Ireland and, using that figure as a comparison, we would need 300 to really run the service.  I am pleased with the support within Tusla.  We are getting the support and the extra staff to grow the team incrementally.  We are gathering good data and are able to identify the areas in which new staff are needed.  In north Dublin, for example, particularly the area around Balbriggan, we are allocating extra staff because the population there is growing and there are different needs and, as the Acting Chairman noted, different cultures.<\/p> <p>  The Acting Chairman also asked about apprenticeships.  I attended school in the 1960s and 1970s.  When one finished primary school, one was guided to the academic school or the vocational school.  People made a choice at that stage and many of my friends went to vocational schools.  They have done a lot better than I have because they learned trades and have set up their own businesses.  We have to value different forms of education and there is too much emphasis on the academic element.  It has been said that the Irish workforce is overly qualified and that people with third-level degrees are working in McDonalds or Tesco.  This is not necessary so we have to value different approaches.  The FETAC scheme has been a fantastic development in that young people can now get into third-level education through multiple routes.  I refer, for example to plc courses, by means of which they work their way up to degree level.  We have to have multiple points of entry but if a young person wants to make a choice, the alternatives - as is the case in many other countries - should be available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#W00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510070400,"counter":69,"content":"<p>There was a question on the number of HSCL co-ordinators.  There are clustering arrangements between schools.  At a national level, we look at feeder primary schools for local post-primary schools.  If they exist, we would have one HSCL co-ordinator shared between two primary schools and these would link with the co-ordinator in the post-primary school.  These decisions are based on the level of disadvantage and the enrolment numbers for the schools in question.  The Department of Education and Skills looks at the deprivation index in determining the allocation of supports for schools.  Nevertheless, we would certainly welcome the allocation of additional HSCL co-ordinators because it would be wonderful to see, particularly if the funding permitted.  Not all children in DEIS primary schools will transition to a DEIS post-primary school.  As a result, there is every chance that a child who has been supported in primary school will go into a large school aged 12 and there will be no HSCL or support to follow the child and ensure that he or she makes a successful transition.  I am a former guidance counsellor and I believe that successful transition involves a full year, not just getting a child from one school to another.  It would involve giving continual support to the family and the child throughout the first year because children are very vulnerable at this time.<\/p><p>As Tusla education and welfare services, we have concerns about attendance and dropout in first year.

I have been in homes where I have used Google to try to communicate something important.<\/p> <p>  However, there is no provision to employ interpreters.  In our school, interpreters are paid to be there.

We are lucky in the junior school in that we have an English as an additional language, EAL, teacher.  That is Ms Mary Lenihan, who is here with us today.  In the senior school they do not but we run international days and work together to involve those parents in the school as well.

Consequently, in some schools where there are smaller enrolments, one will cluster the schools in order that they meet that level.  We would normally say 100 targeted pupils per HSCL.  At present, there is no plan to increase that but under the delivery of equal opportunity in schools, DEIS, action plan, various provisions, including the HSCL, are being looked at.  We are looking at re-clustering HSCL as well, for better alignment with the school completion programme, SCP, and other school clustering arrangements.<\/p> <p>  As for supporting transitions, a key goal under the DEIS plan is supporting transitions at every level, including from post-primary to third level and further education.

That is really a key issue, because often in the same town we have schools that have DEIS status and schools that do not, but they are both dealing with levels of disadvantage.  Moreover, we should not forget that in every single school there are levels of disadvantage, and there are children and families who really need those extra supports through the HSCL scheme and the strengthening families programme.  <\/p> <p>  That came out very clearly in the presentation that I saw with Mr. O'Donovan and Mr. Leeson, and among the teachers and schools that were involved.

Two thirds of the principal's time was taken up with issues that need to be addressed by the HSCL.

Every one of the competitors should be very proud and I have no doubt that they and their colleges, families and workplaces are very proud.<\/p> <p>  We are very interested to hear about the witnesses' experiences as both apprentices and as competitors at the competition.

You will get the opportunity to reply.<br\/><br\/>Before we begin, there are some formalities that I need to get out of the way.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by myself as Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br\/><br\/>I wish to advise that any opening statements made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting, and I remind committee members of the same.<br\/><br\/>I now call on Mr. Paul O'Toole, who will make the opening statement on behalf of SOLAS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#CC00200","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510070400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chair.  On behalf of SOLAS I would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to attend today, and in particular for your support for the team over the past few months.  At the outset, I would like to congratulate the Chair of WorldSkills Ireland, Mr. John Twohig, the organising committee and in particular the team for their fantastic achievement at the WorldSkills Competition 2017 in Abu Dhabi.  I wish to add that Mr. Twohig and the support team from the Cork Institute of Technology and the Education and Training Board go above and beyond in their support for the team.  It is something very special to them, and they demonstrate that all of the time.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Twohig and the team members will speak to you in detail about the WorldSkills Competition itself.  I would like to concentrate on how the WorldSkills Competition and the great ambassadors we have here today are helping to promote the standing of apprenticeship and traineeship.  However, I would like to first mention the role of SOLAS and the relationship with the WorldSkills team. <br\/><br\/>SOLAS is a funder of the Irish WorldSkills team.  The other organisations that contributed to the 2017 WorldSkills budget are the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Cork Institute of Technology, the Technological Higher Education Association, the Higher Education Authority and the Education and Training Boards.  SOLAS is a member of the WorldSkills Ireland organising committee, and a member of SOLAS attended the competition as an official observer.  As the committee will be aware, SOLAS has also provided communications support to the team. <br\/><br\/>As members will recall, when we met earlier this year to discuss apprenticeship, this committee emphasised a number of areas that should be addressed to support the development of apprenticeship in Ireland.  These included running a promotional campaign through social media, expanding the range of apprenticeships and encouraging employers to participate in apprenticeship programmes.  It is important to acknowledge that the vast majority of the WorldSkills team are apprentices and therefore employed.  The team has received huge support from their respective employers throughout the competition.  Without this support, the team would not have achieved the level of success it did.<br\/><br\/>A number of promotional activities for apprenticeship are under way.  We have developed a central website called <i>apprenticeship.ie<\/i>which is a one-stop shop for information on apprenticeship.  This has been welcomed by career guidance councillors in particular.  We have been running a social media campaign across Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram.  Our WorldSkills team has featured extensively in this campaign.<\/p><p>The level of engagement has increased exponentially over recent months, particularly regarding any posts about the team.  For example, the post announcing the results reached almost 100,000 people on Facebook alone.<\/p><p> I believe that in Ireland we are beginning to recognise the valuable career options that apprenticeships, traineeships, and further education and training can offer young people.  It was encouraging to see these options feature prominently in discussions and commentary about the leaving certificate this year.  This was also reflected in the level of media coverage for the team across national and local print, broadcast and online platforms, including RT&Eacute; news.  This not only built a bank of support for the team and recognised their fantastic achievement, it also created an opportunity to showcase Irish skills and contribute to the national dialogue about apprenticeships.<\/p><p> I will now hand over to Mr. Twohig and the team.  I am sure the committee will find it fascinating and valuable to hear about their experience representing Ireland on the world stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Toole","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510070400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Toole.

I would like to provide a short overview of the steps that occur in Ireland ahead of every WorldSkills Competition and how our team is selected.  The Department of Education and Skills introduced national and international skills competitions to Ireland in 1957.  Ireland has participated in all competitions since, with approximately 20,000 apprentices and technicians participating.  Since 1957, Ireland has hosted the competition twice, in Dublin in 1963 and in Cork in 1971.<\/p> <p>  The competitions were originally known as the National Apprentice Competitions but are now called WorldSkills Competitions.  The WorldSkills Ireland Council runs 26 national competitions each year and the Irish WorldSkills team is selected from our national competitions.  Competitors who take part in the WorldSkills Ireland and WorldSkills competitions are selected from their respective skills and trades, based on their competence and ability to complete test projects to the highest international standards, under pressure from fixed time schedules and requirements for precise dimensions and control.  During the period from 1957 to 2017, 37 competitions have been held and we have sent a total of 698 competitors.  Some 193 medals have been won; 61 gold, 53 silver and 79 bronze.<\/p> <p>  Up to 1961, the competing countries were mainly European, with the exception of Morocco in 1953 and 1955, which at that time was a north African Spanish protectorate.  In 1962, Japan participated in the competition for the first time and the International Vocation Training Organisation, IVTO, now evolved into a world organisation.  The organisation has grown over the years, and is now known as WorldSkills International.  With a membership of 79 countries, it holds biennial skill competitions and is engaged in other skill promotion activities around the world.<\/p> <p>  Last year we were delighted to have 140 competitors from all over Ireland compete for the Department of Education and Skills silver medal in their respective skills.  Institutes of technology and education and training boards facilitated this competition, along with the highly skilled competitors who represent the very best in Irish industry and education.  A team of 14 competitors were chosen to compete in the 44th WorldSkills competition which was held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates from 14 to 19 October 2017.  The competitors were selected from the 2016 and 2017 National Skills finalists.  The selection process started in early 2017.<\/p> <p>  The team travelled to Abu Dhabi to showcase their skills and talents in the following areas: aircraft maintenance, automobile technology, beauty therapy, cabinetmaking, heavy vehicle maintenance, construction metal work, electrical installations, industrial control, joinery, plastering and dry wall systems, plastic die engineering, plumbing and heating, restaurant service, and welding.  Each member of the Irish team, all of whom are under 25 years of age, has proven expertise in their chosen field, having competed against their peers to secure their places at the competition. <\/p> <p>  We were very proud to have the team come home with a total of seven medallions for excellence and a Best of Nation award. Medallions for excellence are awarded to those competitors who achieve above-average scores in their contest areas and the Best of Nation is awarded to the competitor who gains the highest points or highest medal in the team of their country or region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017110700002#EE00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Twohig"},{"type":"speech","time":1510070400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Twohig.

The thing that we need to do as Members of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad is ensure we get a lot more people into apprenticeships and traineeships, and learning skills.  We must ensure that people see that as a viable opportunity, both in the types of craft skills our witnesses are involved in and in other types of apprenticeships that are coming on stream.  I know that good work is being done, and we are going to have to do a whole lot more about it.  The witnesses have demonstrated that we can be among the best in the world and that we can do these things not through the traditional educational system, but through the apprenticeship route.  Someone asked one of my colleagues on a doorstep where apprenticeships have gone.  People feel they are not as available.  Our witnesses are showing that apprenticeships are available, that they are a real option for people, that learning skills is real, and that we can beat and be with the best in the world, so comhghairdeas.

These changes are a continuation of a process of progressively reducing the marginal tax rate on low and middle income earners in a manner that maintains the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system.  My aim is to make it more attractive for people to return to work and stay in work while preserving a broad and stable income tax base to ensure our personal taxation system is both competitive and resilient.  The section reduces the 2.5% USC rate to 2% and increases the ceiling for this new rate from &euro;18,772 to &euro;19,372 to ensure that full-time workers on the increased national minimum wage of &euro;9.55 per hour do not pay the upper rates of USC.  The 5% rate of USC is being reduced to 4.75%.  This reduces the top marginal rate of tax on income up to &euro;70,044 to 48.75%.  This is the fourth budget in a row in which this marginal rate has decreased.  I have also extended for a further two years the relief from the higher rates of USC which is available to medical card holders with incomes up to &euro;60,000.  In the longer term, I noted in my budget speech that I am establishing a working group to plan over the coming year the process of amalgamating USC and PRSI in the medium term.

Obviously, stamp duty made up the shortfall.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about the sustainability of the tax code.  We need to look at data, instead of talking about middle-income earners.  In the OECD, we have the 29th lowest tax wedge among the 35 member states.  How will the Minister convince me that we should actually reduce the tax wedge further?  For the average single worker, the tax wedge decreased by 1.8% from 28.9% to 27.1% between 2000 and 2016.  In the same period across the OECD, half of the reduction was recognised, almost 1%.  We have one of the lowest tax wedges in the OECD.

In other words, I do not want to find myself embarked on a policy course that narrows our tax base in terms of income tax and USC.<\/p> <p>  That is why I have identified putting a particular focus on marginal rates of taxation.  Marginal rates of taxation for somebody on a middle income of in excess of 45% are high and are out of keeping with many of the economies with which we will compare ourselves.

Let me read out a comment from a representative of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI:  <\/p><blockquote>[As] with all policies, where possible evidence should be used to assess proposals and alternative approaches to achieving the same goal should be considered.  I will use the USC [case] as an example [again].  It is sometimes argued that high tax rates are a disincentive to work.  At some point this is probably true but we can ask if is there evidence to suggest that the current tax rates are leading to widespread withdrawals from the labour market.  The most recent figures show that employment increased by 56,000 in the year ending quarter 2, 2016, or almost 3%.  Evidence on this issue should be gathered in a more sophisticated manner but even this simple approach raises the question of whether tax is acting as a significant disincentive to work.  It could be the case that child care is a [bigger] disincentive.  If this is true, then a greater effect on labour supply could be achieved through child care subsidies as opposed to income tax cuts, including USC cuts.<\/blockquote><p>We can have our ideological debate for as long as we want but this committee has to consider the evidence and the statistics.  The ESRI tells us there that we do not have evidence to suggest that, as a result of the job growth in the economy, marginal tax rates are a drag on employment.  The Minister should show me the report that says otherwise.  The ESRI is saying, and this is what I want to push the Minister on, that we need to assess proposals and consider them and that assessment needs to be evidence-based.  Despite all the problems in our society the Minister is saying middle-income earners earn twice the average wage and we need to reduce marginal tax rates because they are a drag on employment yet there is no evidence to suggest or support either of those proposals.  This is Fine Gael on a tax-cutting agenda despite the fact that in recent weeks, people died on the streets of our capital city because of the homelessness crisis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#C01100","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>If the Deputy considers the budget in its totality he will see that the tax reform and reduction we deliver in respect of personal taxation is by and large offset by revenue-raising measures elsewhere.

This is why I have tried to prioritise resources that are available to me on the standard-rate cut-off point as opposed to what we would do with the percentage reduction in the higher rate of income tax.  It gives me the opportunity to be able to concentrate resources on particular income cohorts and bands.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's second question, I accept the income tax or personal tax gain is quite low for people on low income.  As he will know, when people are paying very little personal taxation in the first place, it is very difficult for me to reduce it further without taking them out of the tax net entirely.  Because of the changes that have been made to the entry point for liability for USC and income tax, the aggregate amount of personal taxation that people on low income are paying is now at a relatively low level.  The only way I can reduce it further is by taking those people entirely out of the tax net and I do not believe that is a path we should take.  We are getting to a point - it is a policy background to the point I just made - that personal income tax and USC changes will be tools of increasingly less significance for income distribution for people who are on low income because the total amount of USC or personal tax they are paying in the first place is quite low in comparison with what it was in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#E01000","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":181,"content":"<p>The Government often likes to make much of the fact that Ireland has a progressive income tax system.

They feel that at a point in the future, they will get a benefit back from their social insurance.  I would like to see how we could move more of our tax collection code into that space.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of the difficulties that I would have to deal with, which is why I am being careful about saying how long it would take, the most significant ones of which I am aware are how and to where the revenues would accrue.  As the Deputy will know, from a tax point of view revenue that is generated through tax accrues to the Exchequer and revenue that is generated through PRSI accrues to the Social Insurance Fund.  On operational matters, such as a pensioner not being liable to PRSI but being liable to USC, we collect them in a very different way.  PRSI is done on a week-by-week basis while USC is done on a cumulative basis.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#F00800","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>To recap, the working group will be established after the enactment of the Finance Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#F00900","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>That is my objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#F01000","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>The Minister envisages that full implementation would be over a span of three to five budgets?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#F01100","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Yes, three to five budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#F01200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":196,"content":"<p>The new combined charge or contribution, call it what one may, will determine one's benefits.

When the ESRI first produced papers on the USC back before the crash, it was intended that it would become contributory, that is, a universal social contribution.  When it was brought in by the then Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government during the first years of the collapse, however, it then became a charge.  It was, in fact, a very effective form of taxation.  If the Minister is agreeing to merge or blend the two systems, will whatever portion of the USC that is transferred to be joined with PRSI then count as a contribution for those who have paid it?  As the Minister mentioned himself, it is clear from the data we have on life expectancy, population growth and so forth that unless workers and their employers have adequate contributions - many employers nowadays do not provide private pensions-  people could themselves wholly reliant on a retirement pension when they reach retirement age.  If that funding is to be augmented by transferring USC to it over a period, I assume that whatever remains of the USC will then become a contribution as opposed to a tax.  This means, in other words, that it will move into the category of PRSI.<\/p> <p>  There are certain things that worry people as they approach pensionable age that may not have bothered them when they were much younger.  The first of these is the issue of medical expenses.  Does the Minister have a model that includes, for instance, the hypothecation of some of the joint PRSI-USC contribution so as to be targeted to provide people with certain levels of medical cover?  This would amount, in other words, to a contribution towards people's medical expenses based on an insurance model that would bring us closer to a universal medical system provision or some element thereof.  What does the Minister think about these issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#G00100","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>As I said to Deputy Michael McGrath, my early thinking on this is that it is a very complicated project and that I have yet to get to the point of even determining the terms of reference that would eventually lead to the paper I mentioned earlier.  I want to deepen the contributory principle.  From my experience of these systems in other jurisdictions, however, I want to evaluate whether such a system should be entirely contributory.  I do not want to get to a point where we put in place a system that deepens some of our present difficulties whereby people are aware of benefits to which they believe they are entitled, only to subsequently find out that their contributions are simply nowhere near enough to allow them to get access to those benefits.  I want to think through this issue carefully if we are looking to have a broader, more resilient form of social insurance.  I aim to do this through setting the terms of reference for this paper and then having the work completed across next year.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Burton's point about medical expenses, I think that system could possibly include such a provision.  At this early point, however, I am looking more at services and at benefits that we could deliver to people.  Looking at some of the changes that we are beginning to make to dental and optical benefits for the self-employed, for example, I am aware that people have been articulating similar needs for invalidity and sickness benefits for such people.  This, then, is also one of the areas that I want my Department to work through for me.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#G00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Life patterns have changed considerably and we now have many people studying or training until the age of 22 or up to 28 perhaps.  We also have people who might take one college course but who then go on to retrain, as primary teachers perhaps.  This, again, means that these people may enter the workforce relatively late in life.  There are others who go abroad for a period and then come back.  One element absent from our current system as it recovers is the facility to allow people to purchase contributions, as is also possible in some pension systems.  This might apply where somebody, due to force of circumstance, has missed out on relatively small numbers of contributions.  Would the Minister include this in the template?  Looking at how life patterns are changing, this facility might be particularly necessary for people who stay in education for a prolonged period of time, which is of course what we want them to do.  Under a total contributions approach - which does of course have much in its favour - I believe that we have to include provisions for people, particularly younger people, in this situation.  By and large people do not think about pensions in their 20s and 30s.  If they have in fact spent a prolonged period in full-time education or in non-remunerated training of some kind, they will not have contributions for this period and will not be entitled to credits.  It is necessary that we provide for them.<\/p> <p>  The Minister also mentioned the self-employed.  I do not know if the Minister intends to take this into account but one of the problems here is that we have vast additional numbers of self-employed in the economy at present.  What is very obvious is that quite a large number of those self-employed are in fact only designated as such because in order to gain employment they have to agree to identify as self-employed.  This applies both to contractors in sectors like construction and IT, who may in some instances be very well-paid, but also to a large number of people in very low-paid jobs.  Notwithstanding the Minister's proposal to expand benefits for the self-employed, it will be a long time, if ever, before the system can provide the same level of cover for self-employed people of any category, but particularly those on low incomes, as it does for employees because the employer's contribution of 10.5% does not apply to the self-employed.  The Minister should comment on this issue.<\/p> <p>  My final question concerns the Minister's working group.  What is the format of that group?  Is it an internal Civil Service working group based on co-operation between the Departments of Finance and Employment and Social Protection, for example?  Is it a commission?  If so, which groups are likely to be represented on that commission?  A commission-type structure would obviously include broad groups of society.  I assume that both employers and workers' representatives - such as trade unions - would be part of such a structure because both groups have extensive practical experience of the system.  If the working group is entirely drawn from the public service, however, public service experience of PRSI is rather different to that of either employers or employees in the private sector.<\/p><p>If the employers are no longer funding private pensions in the way they used to, those people could be left extremely exposed with their particular interests not being addressed.  I would like to know if the Minister will consult with the D&aacute;il on the composition of this working group.  It is absolutely essential that it includes people from different kinds of employment and in different types of situation, as well as employers who employ people in different ways and for different times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#G00300","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":206,"content":"<p>What I am thinking at the moment is that it would be a working group rather than a commission and would consist of the Departments and Government bodies that will be affected by this such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Finance.

I am looking forward to receiving it and then seeing it published.  She also put a point to me regarding the fact that the benefits somebody who is self-employed can get are very different to those who are employed for the key reason that the employer's rate of PRSI is missing.  That is why I am careful about saying, even at an early stage, that this system should move to a purely contributory system.  If it moves to a purely contributory system, I will exercise great caution to make sure we do not, at a time in which we are trying to perhaps expand benefits in a number of areas, deepen the inability of people actually to access them.

I will tell the Minister why.  In 1992, in a previous Government, I was a Minister of State at the then Department of Social Welfare.  At that point, it was on the menu to try to have more integration and interface between PRSI and taxation.  The Minister is at risk of just taking into account public service employees in terms of how the system operates, and not fully including people who are operating on the other side of the system.  The system is so varied because of employment and self-employment situations nowadays.<\/p> <p>  I look forward to that report being published.  Neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection indicated today that it was going to be any time soon.  I think it is an awful pity.  It is one area of the system where a lot of the people in this room, particularly those on the official and the tax side, know that we are being taken to the cleaners by employers who are creating structures where people have to opt in to self-employment.  No matter how much the Government expands benefits for the self-employed, on a cost basis it will not be able to expand them to the point where somebody gets the same level of benefits as if they were in employment, particularly if that employment turns out to be sporadic, maybe for three or five years, and there are breaks in it because of ups and downs in the economy and so on.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the working group, might the Minister agree down the line, when the Finance Bill has been passed, to publish a paper laying out his thoughts on that?  This kind of change is very important.  I am conscious of the fact that quite a number of countries have moved from what was in effect a contributory system with a lot of benefits which are relatively clear - although they are not always clear.  We might follow other jurisdictions and actually move to a much more means tested system, which would mean that a lot of people would not get the contributions for the principal retirement pension to which they felt they had contributed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#H00300","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>That is exactly why I am taking such care in committing to a purely contributory system.

My view is that there has been a deliberate classification of \"middle income\" in this State which bears no relationship with the reality of the levels at which incomes are actually earned.  For example, the Minister gave a figure of &euro;30,000 but more than 50% of people have an income of less than &euro;30,000.  If I asked my 11 year-old son P&aacute;draig where was the middle, he would say somewhere around 50%, yet the Minister's middle starts above that mark and goes right up to 85%.  That is done deliberately.  When the Government then says it is reducing taxes for the middle-income earners, it is a different message.  I am sure Leo's strategic communications unit would not be too happy if it was going out saying, \"We are reducing taxes for the top 15% of income earners.\"  Indeed, it is probably actually worse.  We will come to that later in respect of another amendment, when I will talk about the way Revenue is collecting statistics.  What we do know is that someone on &euro;70,000 at present is in the top 15%, but that is taxpayer units.  Such a unit might comprise a husband and wife, where one individual has an income of &euro;40,000 and the other an income of &euro;30,000.<\/p><p>However, that is taxpayer units.  As such, those individual units may consist of a husband and wife of &euro;40,000 and &euro;30,000.  If we have individual incomes, it is likely that they are closer to the top 10% of income earners in the State.  I do not take away from the fact that someone on &euro;70,000 finds it difficult to put a child through college, meet mortgage payments or deal with high child care fees or as to the pressure in their lives, but let us have an honest debate on finances.  The Minister cannot square the circle where he said somebody on &euro;70,000 is on the higher end while still believing that is somebody who is on a middle income.  A middle income must be somewhere in the middle.  The Minister cannot redefine the middle; it is not possible.

We cannot, however, as such an amendment would be ruled out of order.  What we have instead, then, is this amendment calling for a report on the costs and the implications of such a move.  The argument in favour of an abolition is that the USC is a tax hated by workers.  It was introduced as an emergency tax during the economic crisis but has instead become a permanent feature of our tax landscape.  It hits ordinary workers, including low and middle-income earners, as well as high earners.  Our figures suggest that approximately 7% of tax units earn more than &euro;90,000 a year.  In the Solidarity-People Before Profit budget statement, we proposed the abolition of the USC for those earning under &euro;90,000 per annum and the conversion of the USC into a high-income social charge for those earning more than that sum.  Part of the reason for this proposal is to counter the notion that the left stands for increased taxation on ordinary workers.  We do not, in fact, as we think that there would be sufficient potential tax revenue from the wealth and profits held by the top 7% earners at the very top of society.  Rather than hitting ordinary workers, this is the section of society that should be targeted.  It is not a choice between tax increases and ongoing high taxes for ordinary workers on the one hand and public services on the other.  Public services should be paid for instead through increased taxation on very high earners and particularly through a significant increase in corporation tax and the introduction of a millionaires' tax.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#M00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I understand that it is the Deputy's intention to propose a tax system under which all of those earning up to &euro;1,731 per week would be exempt from USC entirely.  The current exemption threshold for USC stands at &euro;13,000 per annum and it is now estimated that from next year, 29% of all income earners will no longer be liable for USC.  To further increase this entry threshold to &euro;90,000 would exempt 95% of income earners from USC and increase the number of taxpayers exempt from personal tax entirely to 37%.  This would therefore considerably narrow the income tax base and expose our economy to significant risk in the event of a future economic downturn.<\/p> <p>  Deputies will recall that during the economic crisis, we reached a point where 45% of all income earners were exempt from income tax.  That was unsustainable as it placed an unfair burden on those earners who were contributing to the income tax base, and exposed the vulnerability of our income tax system to economic shocks.  It is my view that a broad-based, progressive income tax system, where the majority of income earners make some contribution according to their means, is the fairest and most sustainable income tax system in the long term.  The Deputies will be aware that in this budget I have retained the current USC threshold of &euro;13,000 to maintain the existing USC base, and that I have also expressed my commitment to retaining that figure as the entry point to taxation in future.  <\/p> <p>  I also note that the abolition of the USC for those earning less than &euro;90,000, assuming that those earning above &euro;90,000 would pay USC on all their income at the new 2018 rates, would have an Exchequer cost in the region of &euro;2 billion on a full-year basis.  Significant expenditure cuts or alternative tax raising measures would therefore be required in conjunction with such a measure.  Taking these considerations into account, I am not minded to support the precise terms of the amendment put forward by the Deputy and cannot accept the amendment.<\/p><p>I can, however, agree to the proposition that a report should be prepared which presents the analysis relating to the amalgamation of the USC and PRSI, and it is my intention that this report will be made available to the D&aacute;il in advance of budget 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#M00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":224,"content":"<p>That is a different report.

I am not sure if the Minister has seen the budgetary committee's report on the budget.  This is one of the proposals the committee agreed to include in that report.  It is something I argued for and am thankful it was included.  In the present scenario, we do not have a clear breakdown of individual incomes in terms of taxpayers.  We are dealing with taxpayer units.  That is the point I made earlier today about those earning &euro;70,000.  Are they in the top 15%?  Yes and no.  Some of them are combined incomes.  There is no way of knowing how many people in the State are paying tax on a single income of &euro;70,000 because we use taxpayer units.  For USC, we use a different method because it is individualised.  We are a good bit of the way there with USC, yet we are using taxpayer units in terms of income tax.<\/p><p>The other issue was referred to earlier by Deputy Michael McGrath when he alluded to the fact that there are 2.6 million taxpayer units in the State.  In terms of employees and self-employed people, the number is a lot less than that.  That is because some of those incomes are pensions and so on.  They are taxable and are therefore counted by Revenue.<\/p><p>We need far more granular detail in how we collect data.  I have huge regard for the Revenue Commissioners.  I think their systems are very good.  The Revenue online service, ROS, is among the best that is out there.  It is very easily usable and so on.  The Revenue Commissioners collect a great amount of data.  Like other members of the committee, I submit a lot of parliamentary questions and we get great, valuable data from Revenue.  However, still in 2017 we do not have very simple data on individual incomes.<\/p><p>This throws up problems in terms of policy development.  I will talk about a proposal that is in the Government's own papers, about tapering out tax credits.  This is something we examined and for which we have argued for some time.  We cannot progress it because it cannot be costed.  It cannot be costed because we are dealing with taxpayer units.  For this reason, it is decided to taper tax credits out at a starting point of &euro;80,000.  We do not know if we are hitting a couple with two incomes of &euro;40,000 or an individual on &euro;80,000.  Obviously, if the Government is doing the tapering out of tax credits - a possibility it is proposing - it needs that type of data.<\/p><p>The proposed amendment provides that within six months of the enactment of this Bill, the Minister will prepare and lay before the D&aacute;il an analysis of individual taxpayers in the State in light of the current reporting deficit.  I think it is time that we moved on this and got the detail.  I hope it is not a huge amount of work for the Revenue Commissioners.  They do have all of this detail.  They just do not have it in such a form that the model or programme they are using can spit out the information we are looking for in terms of individual income.  We are talking about 2.6 million taxpayer units.  In respect of each taxpayer unit, Revenue knows that Mr. A is on &euro;30,000 and Mrs B is on &euro;50,000 but it cannot give us that detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#N00600","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":229,"content":"<p>The Deputy&rsquo;s amendment refers to the current system of reporting data based on taxpayer units, whereby jointly or separately assessed couples are recorded as a single tax unit.  This is an inevitable consequence of a tax system which allows for the assessment of married couples and civil partners based on the joint income of the couple.  It is not possible at the moment for Revenue to provide an analysis on an individual basis as the tax liability of these individuals is not separately recorded, assessed or determined.<\/p> <p>  Under the Irish tax system there are three options for assessment of married couples or civil partners which form the basis of assessment for tax purposes: joint assessment, separate assessment and separate treatment.  Under joint assessment, one spouse or partner is chargeable to tax on the total income of both members of the couple and can avail of the allowances, credits and reliefs available to both partners.  Jointly assessed spouses can transfer certain tax credits, standard rate bands, losses and tax reliefs between them.  Under separate assessment, each spouse is assessed separately but where one spouse&rsquo;s allowances, reliefs or rate bands are not fully used they may be transferred over.  These tax units cannot be disaggregated into two separate individuals for reporting purposes as it is likely that, in many cases, the taxable income and tax payable by the tax unit is not equivalent to the sum of the income and tax figures for the two spouses had they been assessed to tax on an individualised basis.  In 2015, jointly assessed and separately assessed taxpayer units accounted for approximately 34% of all taxpayer units &ndash; that is, approximately 787,000 taxpayer units, comprising 1.57 million individuals, amounting in total to over half of the individuals in the tax system.<\/p> <p>  I would, however, note that my officials also have an interest in obtaining data, to the extent possible, on an individualised basis, and are working with colleagues in Revenue to investigate how we can do it.  If robust aggregate data can be produced on an individualised basis, this data will be made available to Members of the Oireachtas.  However I must note that the scope for individualised analysis will always be subject to limitations while joint assessment is a feature of our tax system.  Taking these technical limitations into account, I cannot accept the amendment proposed by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#N00700","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>How stands the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#N00800","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>It stands that we are going to discuss it a wee bit further.

I know if the Minister were to come forward with a proposal on tax tapering, for example, Revenue would give him its best guesstimate on the costs and effects of that.  As Members of the Opposition, Revenue will not give us those guesstimates, and I understand why it will not.  The Government is going to enact it in legislation whereas we are using it as an alternative, as such.<\/p> <p>  In today's world, there must be a way to look deeper into joint and separate assessment.  With everything we have and all the data we are looking at, in terms of the number of income earners in the State, a certain proportion of that information is false.

I am open to ideas.  Looking to international standards, we fall short here in terms of employee and employers' PRSI.

The policy has taken a number of years to bring about the equalisation and there is no reason not to go beyond the increase to &euro;1,150 upon which the Minister has decided this year.  The amendment proposes an increase to &euro;1,400.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#R00600","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>In the Finance Bill, I have provided for an increase of &euro;200 in the earned income credit to bring it up to a value of &euro;1,150 per year.  The &euro;200 increase provides a significant benefit to small business owners across the country, including small retailers, publicans, farmers and tradesmen.  It is estimated that the credit will be of benefit to approximately 151,600 individuals and business interests in 2018.  In view of the limited resources available to me in budget 2018 and in light of the competing demands for amendments to the tax system, it is not possible to increase the earned income credit by &euro;450 to &euro;1,400 as proposed by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  Such an increase would cost over &euro;37 million in 2018 as compared to the &euro;17 million first-year cost of the &euro;200 increase, which was achievable within the resources available to me.  It would have given a disproportionate benefit from the budget to the self-employed as compared to all other individuals, including PAYE workers, pensioners and welfare recipients.<\/p> <p>  I accept that differences remain between the taxation of employees and the self-employed.  However it must be acknowledged that some of the differences are to the benefit of the self-employed.  For example, the self-employed continue to benefit from a broader expense deduction regime than that available to employees and there are significant timing benefits regarding the payment of tax liabilities which are available to the self-assessed but which are not available to PAYE workers, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer.  Deputies will also be aware that the overall contribution to the Social Insurance Fund by the self-employed is significantly less than that of employees because, as Deputy Burton pointed out earlier, no equivalent to the employer PRSI contribution is payable.  However, Deputies will be aware that A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to increase the earned income credit to &euro;1,650.  The budget 2018 increase of &euro;200 is a significant further step in that direction and it is my intention to make further progress on increasing this credit in budget 2019, subject to the available resources.<\/p> <p>  For the reasons outlined, I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#R00700","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>The Minister may have already clarified this but is he committed, as was his predecessor, to full equalisation of the credit with PAYE workers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#R00800","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I am.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#R00900","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Does he have a view as to when we can expect there to be full equalisation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#R01000","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":265,"content":"<p>That will depend on the resources that are available to me next year and beyond.

It is now November and I am sure the Minister's officials are having a close look at the self-employed tax returns.<\/p> <p>  To go back to a point I made earlier, it is important to understand that the current number of self-employed and the extraordinary growth in self-employment figures in the economy are both somewhat false in a certain sense because, particularly at lower income levels and in large parts of the construction sector, people on relatively low incomes are being forced into self-employment.  Their choice and that of those who administer the tax system would be for them to be employees.  However, as evidenced by the Paradise Papers, there will always be those who play the system and that is what is being done in this case.<\/p><p>The Minister's Cabinet colleagues have been holding back in addressing what is an abuse of the tax system.  The logic of it is that if people are being abused and being forced into self-employment, then some of the anomalies, such as the self-employed tax credit, should be of equal status with the tax credit for people on PAYE.  Looking at the figures, there would probably be a surge of up to &euro;400 million to &euro;500 million because of the extraordinary growth in self-employment.<\/p><p> There is a view of the self-employed as being somehow or other well-off.  The trades where people are effectively forced into self-employment can range from the building industry to labour-intensive areas such as personal services of different kinds.  Their take-home pay is relatively small, however.  Giving them the same tax breaks as PAYE workers makes a lot of sense in fairness and in economic terms.<\/p><p> I understand the die is cast for this year.  However, it is a wrong decision but, clearly, the Government decided it had a particular framework for spending.  I noted a confidence survey published last weekend stated people did not feel anything from the budget.  I am sure the Minister's officials brought it to his attention.  The reason for this is simple.  If the Minister had just indexed the bands and the allowances at whatever level - certainly for inflation - people would have done better than the notional &euro;5 a week, as previous speakers have suggested.  I am disappointed he has failed to give self-employed people parity, when so many of them are in forced self-employment.  I do not know what economic sense it makes.  The Minister can talk about balancing the books but when he is close to eliminating the deficit, this kind of balance does not really say much.<\/p><p> Will the Minister share with us how the returns from the self-employed are actually going?  I am sure the Department is looking at it constantly.  Are they up to expectations or, as I expect, exceeding expectations?  Unless, somehow or other, there has been a flight of self-employed people out of the country, it is hard not to see there being a surge, particularly as the big return to employment and self-employment started four years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#R01200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>October is the first month in the tax year so far in which our tax collection has moved into line with our profile and what we expected to do.  While there is much focus from the Deputy and others as to where we will end up in November, it has to be seen in the context of a year in which, up until October, we were behind profile.  While we were ahead of where we were a year ago, we were behind the targets set.  Anything that happens in November will be seen by me in that context.<\/p> <p>  On the point on how people felt after the budget, we went through several budgets where people felt significantly better the day after.  However, we saw the cumulative cost of those budgets.  I was clear in the run-up to budget 2018 that I wanted to make steady progress.  If we end up in a situation where people feel dramatically better off the day after the budget, it is a sign to me that we are going down a path which will bring us back to where we were in the past.  That is not a journey on which I intend to go.<\/p> <p>  The cost of indexing our income tax system for a full year would be &euro;550 million, money which is not available to me.  That is why I had to make choices with the smaller amount of funding available.<\/p> <p>  If I had made the choice to move to full parity in a single budget, it would have meant a move to &euro;1,650, which would mean an increase of &euro;700.  This would have meant that a single self-employed individual earning &euro;25,000 would have gained &euro;15 per week, while a PAYE employee on the same income would have gained &euro;1 per week.  That is why I am looking to do it over several budgets.  I am looking to make a bigger move on it next year than this year.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe anybody should be forced into self-employment.  That is not to say there are issues which will have to be addressed.  I am aware of the Deputy's point and wider concerns about the nature of employment contracts in different occupations.  It is a matter on which I have indirect experience.  I want to see the Minister for Employment and Social Protection's work on this conclude and report.  It is a matter about which I have questions.

I hope he will pass on that thought to his colleague, the Minister for Employment and Social Protection.<\/p> <p>  The Revenue Commissioners know there is a significant loss to the Exchequer through what is happening with bogus self-employment.  Much of that may be contained in the report whenever it is published.  Essentially, we are getting 4.5% as opposed to 14.75% plus from next year through the increase for certain employers in the training levy.  It is a loss of 10.5% in PRSI which could be utilised both to make the system fairer, but also to improve it.  I accept the Minister's bona fides in that he cares about people's cover for when circumstances change and how they may require social protection.  It makes no sense, however, from the point of view of the overall economy to allow what is effectively a fraudulent system of bogus self-employment to grow.<\/p> <p>  People are devising more and more ways in which to push people into the path of self-employment.  The consequence for the Social Insurance Fund and for the Revenue Commissioners, the collectors of income tax, PRSI and USC, is a significant loss of income.  It particularly affects many young self-employed people who are struggling on lower salaries and wages and reduced terms and conditions than their employed colleagues.  It is fundamentally unfair and destructive in terms of social justice.<\/p> <p>  The report in question has been ready for quite some time.  I have no idea whether it is being revisited in some way or redacted because there are problems with some sectors or companies.  However, it is unfair to those working, many working extremely hard, and this is what they get.<\/p><p>They are comparing their situation to that of their brother, sister or spouse who is an employee and has an income tax credit.  Notwithstanding promises this could and would be done within a three year period, it does not seem that it will be looked after next year because the Minister has said the bar is so high.  How was it that at a time when the economy was in a very early stage of recovery it was possible to increase the credit by a third?  That was possible because a choice was made to give it to those who required it.  There is a need to start eliminating some of the phoney stuff in the system in regard to self employment that does not play to people's advantage but, rather, to that of certain employers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110700002#S00300","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510077600,"counter":271,"content":"<p>The scale of the overall package of budget day announcements was smaller than some of the budgets to which the Deputy is referring, which, therefore, meant the resources available for measures such as the earned income credit were smaller.

What the Deputy said is correct and it does not just apply to those at the lower levels.  There are some very high profile people in this country who are apparently self employed.  The Revenue checklist to determine if one is an employee states that, &quot;While all of the following factors may not apply, an individual is normally your employee if: you control how, when and where the work is carried out; they supply labour only;&quot; they are on a fixed payment; they cannot sub-contract their work, etc.  The report will make for interesting reading.  What work is the Revenue doing on this issue and the differentiation between those who are in a contract of employment and a contract for service?  It seems to me that there are many instances where the<i>de facto<\/i>employer determines all of the issues such as the place and time of work and the payment, yet those working for them are deemed to be self employed.

Transport is the second biggest producer of greenhouse gases in Ireland.  The way to reduce greenhouse emissions by the transport sector is to change the entire mode of transport and to get people from individual vehicles into public transport.  That is the way that there will be a serious impact on the problem as opposed to just incentivising and pushing electric cars in particular.  The problem is that the Government's approach on public transport is to slash and burn.  The subvention has been drastically reduced by &euro;67 million since 2008.  That is a cut of 70%.

It is at least flat on where it was a year ago, if not an increase.  Deputy Murphy's approach of describing the Government's attitude to public transport as being slash and burn would come as a bit of a surprise to all those commuters I am looking forward to seeing getting on Luas cross-city in the second week of December, which is an investment in public transport of many hundreds of millions of euro.  Investment is under way in respect of how we improve public transport both at a capital and current level.  It needs to be accompanied, however, by encouraging the roll-out of electric vehicles.  This is on top of what we have at the moment.  We have VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000 per vehicle.

This amendment calls for a report on the introduction of a different series of higher bands of income tax.  They are listed in the amendment, although the rate for earnings over &euro;250,000 should be 65%.  This forms part of our overall tax proposal, including the abolition of USC for income under &euro;90,000, shifting the tax burden onto very high-income earners and making income tax more progressive.<\/p><p>In Spain, for example, there is an income tax band from &euro;175,000 to &euro;300,000 and another band over &euro;300,000.

Marginal tax rates of this level would have consequences.  My intention is to focus on encouraging work.<\/p> <p>  For the Deputy's information, I have been informed by Revenue that the estimated annual yield from the increased tax rates that he proposes, on a tax unit basis, would be &euro;1.9 billion if a rate of 60% were to apply on income over &euro;250,000 and &euro;2.2 billion if an increased rate of 65% were contemplated.<\/p> <p>  For the policy reasons that I have outlined in the course of this debate, I am not inclined to commit further resources to the analysis of the proposal outlined by the Deputy.

It expands the definition of &quot;qualifying company&quot; to include a company resident in Ireland and incorporated in an EEA state other than Ireland.  It also allows for companies with a listing on similar or comparable markets to the enterprise securities market in an EEA state or a tax treaty country.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 12 ensures that a double relief cannot be claimed by providing that relief under the employment and investment incentive, EII, cannot also be claimed where relief applies under KEEP.
