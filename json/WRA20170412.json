Both Governments agreed on the need for intensive engagement to address outstanding issues and commitments to ensure the early establishment of an Executive.  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments have a role to play in supporting the effective operation of the devolved institutions, and in upholding both the letter and the spirit of the Agreement as a whole, in the interests of all in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In this context I am representing the Government in the intensive talks in Belfast.  These talks have two objectives.  Firstly, to allow the political parties to reach an agreement on the formation of a new Executive.  Secondly, to address the implementation of outstanding issues from previous Agreements.  The discussions are structured around a shared approach put forward by both Governments following on from talks last month where it did not prove possible for the political parties in Northern Ireland to reach agreement on the establishment of a power-sharing Executive before the statutory deadline of 27 March.<\/p>  <p>  Overall there is encouraging progress being made in this renewed phase but I am under no illusions about the challenge of resolving the core issues that remain outstanding.  Serious issues remain to be resolved - including those which were to the fore before the collapse of the last Executive and during the election campaign.  However with resolve and determination from all the parties, and support and encouragement from the two Governments, I believe a successful outcome is possible.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to legacy issues, I have been closely involved in the ongoing discussions in Belfast with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties to seek a way forward for the early establishment of the Stormont House framework.  In the discussions, I have been very clear on the urgent need to achieve progress, so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and to support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  I have also emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties, the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced, and urged all with responsibilities in relation to the legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible to implement the helpful proposals of the Lord Chief Justice.<\/p>  <p>  Also, as part of my engagement with the Secretary of State and with each of the parties in the discussions in recent weeks, I have strongly emphasised the critical importance of forming a new Executive so that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests can be effectively represented, as part of the process of the EU-UK negotiations which are about to commence.  I very much hope that the necessary agreement between the parties will be reached on formation of the Executive as soon as possible, so that it can directly represent the interests of the people of Northern Ireland in these negotiations which are of major significance.<\/p>  <p>  As the formal talks pause briefly for Easter, I encourage everyone to maintain informal contacts and to reflect on what can be achieved if, in the weeks ahead, an Executive is established that operates effectively and sustainably.  I am convinced that all parties are willing to play their part in reaching such a sustainable agreement which will provide for stable power-sharing government in Northern Ireland underpinned by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Government as a co-guarantor of that Agreement and the peace process will continue to play its part in facilitating these ongoing talks, working with the British Government and encouraging all parties to reach agreement on the formation of a new Executive that is demonstrably in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200071#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 31 to 36, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Facilities","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200071#WRA01000"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[18231\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200071#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has had discussions recently with the British and Northern Ireland authorities regarding unresolved issues for prisoners in a prison (details supplied); and the way he could progress these issue as a matter of urgency.","asker":"1291","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>I wish to reiterate my ongoing concerns about conditions in Maghaberry Prison, Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Maghaberry Prison was identified by the Criminal Justice Inspector, Brendan McGuigan, in a 2015 report as needing work to make the prison safer and to improve conditions for staff.  Since publication of that report, the Criminal Justice Inspectorate has continued with a programme of announced, low impact, visits to the prison which find that the situation has stabilised and that some progress has been achieved.  More work remains to be done.  In making the desired progress in Maghaberry, the cooperation of both the Northern Ireland Prison Service and the prisoners themselves is required.  I would encourage all with influence to move forward in the right spirit.<\/p>  <p>  The Northern Ireland Executive last summer agreed to implement the recommendation of the Fresh Start Paramilitary Panel that a review of the separated regime in Maghaberry be established.  I look forward to the review panel being appointed following agreement on the formation of a new Executive and to seeing their work completed.  I believe that the review opens up an opportunity to address genuine concerns regarding separation, including such issues as association on the landings and access to education.  My Department engaged fully in the Paramilitary Panel&rsquo;s consultation process.<\/p>  <p>  Complicating matters has been the sense of threat which prison officers and their families perceive.

Daesh and other terrorist groups have attacked and murdered many communities and groups of people for their religious beliefs and\/or way of life.  The only means of securing the protection of Christian communities and other minorities across the Middle East is through the promotion of sustainable political solutions to the conflicts which have for so long destabilised the region and have been the key factor in the promotion of radical and extremist ideologies.  Ireland has consistently called for inclusive, democratic solutions to the unrest in the Middle East and North Africa region.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians and other minorities in the Middle East.  Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur or who the victims are.  We attach great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland consistently raises the issues of racism and intolerance and advocates for inclusive societies at the UN Human Rights Council, during the Council&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review of the human rights records of UN Member States, as well as at the Council of Europe and the OSCE.  The promotion of inclusive societies where the human rights of all individuals are respected is a core objective of our engagement on issues such as the promotion of freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief.<\/p>  <p>  During our Presidency of the Council of Ministers in 2013, Ireland played a key role in the development and adoption of the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief.  These Guidelines provide a framework for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief in the EU&rsquo;s external human rights policy.  They emphasise the universality of this right and acknowledge its centrality to safeguarding diversity.  In 2015 Ireland also pressed for the inclusion of a reference to the promotion of freedom of religion or belief in the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has made freedom of religion and belief a priority of our engagement at the UN General Assembly.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have condemned all forms of persecution, intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief on a number of occasions, most recently on 24 September 2016 at the 71st Session of the UNGA.  Ireland has consistently supported resolutions on freedom of religion or belief at the UN Human Rights Council, including co-sponsorship of the Resolution at the most recent session of the HRC in March.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland frequently raises and will continue to raise the issue of the persecution of Christians through its official bilateral contacts, stressing the responsibility of governments to protect all citizens and minorities, irrespective of their religion or belief.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to actively support freedom of religion or belief across our foreign policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200072#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200072#WRB01500"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[18295\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200072#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if during his discussions with his European counterparts he has requested that Ireland receive a veto on the EU-Britain deal on Brexit similar to that received by Spain; if so, and if he did not receive support, the basis on which Ireland is being treated differently to Spain; and if he has not requested such a veto, the reason therefor.","asker":"1309","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>A central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s response to last year&rsquo;s UK referendum on EU membership has been strategic outreach to EU partners and Institutions to ensure that the unique Irish perspective on Brexit is understood before negotiations begin.

To date, there have been over 400 engagements across government at either political or senior official level.  For my part, since the UK referendum, I have had in excess of 70 meetings or conversations, including with each of my EU counterparts.

In addition, over 200 persons and 70 entities are targeted by a travel ban and an asset freeze over the violent repression against the civilian population in Syria.  Last month the EU added four high-ranking Syrian military officials to the sanctions list for their role in the use of chemical weapons against civilians.<\/p><p>Ireland has also supported calls for sanctions at UN level also and very much regrets that a draft UN Security Council resolution that would have established a sanctions regime, a committee and an expert panel to hold accountable those using and producing chemical weapons in Syria was not passed on 28 February.<\/p><p>Ireland is not currently a member of the Security Council but is a member of the cross-regional Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT) group at the UN, which has framed a Code of Conduct, now supported by 112 Member States, regarding Security Council action against genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  Last week, we joined with our ACT partners in calling on all members of the Security Council to apply the Code by supporting timely and decisive action against the use of chemical weapons in Syria and not to vote against a credible draft resolution to that effect.  Ireland will continue to support all efforts to ensure a lasting peace and full accountability for war crimes in Syria.<\/p><p>The principles and values underlining this support are important motivating factors for Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for election to the Security Council for the 2021-2022 term when we hope to bring Ireland&rsquo;s voice to the Council&rsquo;s table.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200072#WRB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UN Resolutions","counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200073#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[18233\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200073#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if Ireland supports the UN resolution calling for a referendum to decide the fate of the western Sahara area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":75,"content":"<p>Ireland supports the United Nations Security Council Resolution 690 (1991) which established a United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, and our EU partners, categorise Western Sahara as a non-self-governing Territory.

Indeed, our analysis and contingency planning have been under way ever since late 2014. This has included comprehensive analysis involving all Government Departments of the implications of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU on a range of sectors and policy areas. There has also been extensive consultation, including through the all-island Civic Dialogue, and with a range of stakeholders. This work has been led by the Cabinet Committee on Brexit, chaired by the Taoiseach and involving all relevant Ministers, including myself.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from this extensive work, which continues, four headline challenges have been identified and prioritised by the Government as major political issues that will need to be addressed in the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU and with regard to the EU-UK future relationship.  These are: to protect our economic interests and minimise the impact on our economy and trade; to protect the Northern Ireland Peace Process and the Good Friday Agreement, including the need to maintain the invisible border on the island of Ireland; to maintain the Common Travel Area with the UK; and to secure Ireland&rsquo;s future in a strong European Union.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think it is helpful in a negotiation such as this to talk of red lines.  That said, it is vital that all efforts are made to avoid anything which might undermine stability in Northern Ireland, and relations between North and South. This is an objective that is not only in the interests of Ireland and the UK, but of the EU as a whole.  It is the Government&rsquo;s priority to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is fully respected and that the overall integrity of settlement is not disturbed. The open border that exists between North and South has been one of the central achievements of the peace process. We are pleased that the EU&rsquo;s draft negotiating guidelines, as circulated by President Tusk on 31 March and to be considered by the European Council on 29 April, make reference to the importance of protecting the peace process in Northern Ireland and to avoiding a &ldquo;hard border&rdquo; on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Common Travel Area is also an important feature of the close relationship between Ireland and the UK with long-established benefits for our people and well-being of our two countries. It is an arrangement that is valued on both islands and continuation of this arrangement is a stated objective of both the Irish and the UK Governments. I therefore welcome both Prime Minister May&rsquo;s reaffirmation in the Article 50 notification letter of the UK&rsquo;s intention to maintain the Common Travel Area after the UK withdraws from the EU, and the recognition in the draft European Council guidelines of existing bilateral agreements and arrangements between Ireland and the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the Article 50 negotiations and the subsequent negotiations on the future relationship between the EU and the UK, we will be working hard to ensure that key sectors of the economy, as well as our overall trading relationship with the UK, are protected to the greatest extent possible. For this reason, we have, within the context of the Article 50 negotiations, argued strongly for transitional arrangements to ensure certainty and continuity for our people and businesses in the period between the finalisation of the withdrawal agreement and the conclusion of an agreement on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  I am therefore satisfied with the phased approach to negotiations that has been set out in the draft European Council guidelines. This seeks to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK and includes the possibility of a transitional arrangement with the objective of providing certainty and minimising economic disruption.<\/p>  <p>  Before discussions on the future relationship begin, following the achievement of sufficient progress in the Article 50 negotiations proper, the European Council will adopt additional guidelines on the Union&rsquo;s approach.  Ireland will be supporting the closest possible partnership between the Union and the UK, taking account of the need for a level playing field and the fact that the UK outside the Union will not have the same full set of rights and responsibilities as before.<\/p>  <p>  The strong acknowledgement of Ireland&rsquo;s unique circumstances in the draft EU negotiating guidelines, the UK Government&rsquo;s letter of notification and the resolution on the Brexit negotiations that was adopted by the European Parliament on 5 April is clear evidence that the extensive political, diplomatic and official campaign of recent months has been effective in ensuring understanding and recognition of our unique circumstances and specific issues. It reinforces our strong view that these will be resolved satisfactorily.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will produce a position paper on the Article 50 negotiations in advance of the meeting of the European Council on 29 April.  This will provide more detail on the Government&rsquo;s approach to the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, as governed by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This paper will build on the four priorities and will make clear that Ireland is ready for these negotiations in which the Government will be focused on getting the best deal for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200073#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid Provision","counter":86,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200073#WRC01050"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[18299\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200073#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the international community can be mobilised to address the humanitarian crisis arising from war, oppression and starvation in the Horn of Africa, with particular reference to Yemen, Sudan and Somalia; if, in view of the warnings from humanitarian aid organisations, provisions can now be put in place to address the emerging situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":88,"content":"<p>The Government shares the deep concern internationally at the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Horn of Africa and Yemen.

These talks have two objectives. Firstly, to allow the political parties to reach an agreement on the formation of a new Executive. Secondly, to address the implementation of outstanding issues from previous Agreements.

The details supplied relate to ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.<\/p><p>Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and since then, successive Governments have emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met. This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention. <\/p><p>It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.<\/p><p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights. <\/p><p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible. <\/p><p>I should make the point that the Convention creates no new rights, but rather requires that people with disabilities be treated on an equal basis with others.  In particular, service standards and funding are subject to what the Convention describes as &lsquo;progressive realisation&rsquo; and are subject to the budgetary decisions of the Government of the day.  Issues around the allocation of resources are matters for each annual Budget and are for the individual Departments involved.<\/p><p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of Deprivation of Liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.<\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains an extremely high priority for me as Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200073#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200073#WRC01750"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[18510\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200073#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps she will take to curb the use of mobile phones by drivers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":98,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.

In regard to sentencing, the approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. <\/p>  <p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Committee website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  This system is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much support the initiative led by the judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information on sentencing via the website.  <\/p>  <p>  The report of the Working Group on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy, published in July 2014, considered the issue of developing sentencing guidelines.  However, the majority of the Review Group took the view that the primary role of developing sentencing guidelines is the responsibility of the judiciary and does not lie in bringing forward detailed statutory based guidelines.  It might also be noted that a Sentencing Council was not advocated by the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Mandatory Sentencing which was published in June 2013. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that, in 2014, the Court of Criminal Appeal issued a number of judgments which addressed the question of sentencing and which acknowledged the many factors that can be considered in individual cases which undermine the usefulness of direct comparisons between one case and another. Nonetheless, every effort to promote consistency should be made and in this respect it is appropriate for the courts to provide guidance on sentencing matters. <\/p>  <p>  A Judicial Council Bill is included in the current legislative programme which provides for a range of matters including matters relating to developing schemes for judicial education and training.  It is envisaged that the Judicial Council, once established, will put in place a Sentencing Information Committee, a function of which will be to collate and disseminate information on sentencing in respect of criminal offences.  Any costs incurred in the operation of that Committee, which have yet to be determined, will be met from monies allocated in respect of the Judicial Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200074#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Probation and Welfare Service Data","counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200074#WRD01800"},{"type":"question","counter":129,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[18415\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200074#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of staff employed by the Probation Service and their salary scales; and the full cost of salaries for each of the past five years.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":130,"content":"<p>The following table outlines the staffing of the Probation Service as of 31 December broken down by year 2012 to 2016:<table><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Grade and<br \/><br \/>current ppc salary scale<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Director <\/td><td>&euro;123,946<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deputy Director <\/td><td>&euro;80,646 - &euro;100,333<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal Probation &amp;amp; Welfare Officer<\/td><td>&euro;66,777 - &euro;82,538<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Assistant Director of Probation &amp;amp; Welfare Service <\/td><td>&euro;72,108 - &euro;88,476<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal Officer <\/td><td>&euro;65,093 - &euro;78,451<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Probation Officer <\/td><td>&euro;30,376 - &euro;63,702<\/td><td>227<\/td><td>227<\/td><td>229<\/td><td>219<\/td><td>209<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Senior Probation Officer <\/td><td>&euro;59,765 - &euro;70,645<\/td><td>48<\/td><td>48<\/td><td>47<\/td><td>47<\/td><td>46<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Statistician <\/td><td>&euro;31,520 - &euro;78,451<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Service Officers <\/td><td>&euro;21,509 - &euro;30,473<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Professional Accountant <\/td><td>&euro;66,777 - &euro;82538<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Higher Executive Officers <\/td><td>&euro;47,081 - &euro;59,294<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Executive Officers <\/td><td>&euro;28,739 - &euro;48,975<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Community Service Supervisors <\/td><td>&euro;32,511 - &euro;37,474<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>43<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clerical Officers <\/td><td>&euro;22,879 - &euro;38,341<\/td><td>64<\/td><td>62<\/td><td>60<\/td><td>56<\/td><td>50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Staff<\/td><td><\/td><td>384<\/td><td>387<\/td><td>391<\/td><td>395<\/td><td>379<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total salary spend<\/td><td><\/td><td>&euro;23,006,645.50<\/td><td>&euro;22,782,640.97<\/td><td>&euro;22,645,123.52<\/td><td>&euro;22,661,267.96<\/td><td>&euro;21,480,311.99<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200074#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200074#WRD02100"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[18417\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200074#WRD02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when she will introduce the family court Bill; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to significant reform of the courts, including the establishment of a family law court structure that is streamlined, more efficient, and less costly.<\/p><p>My Department is working on the General Scheme of a Family Court Bill which will aim to streamline family law court processes, clarify jurisdictional issues and provide for a set of guiding principles to help ensure that the Family Court will operate in a user-friendly and efficient manner.

The Disciplinary Tribunal, whose members will be appointed by the President of the High Court on the nomination of the Minister for Justice and Equality, will have thirty-three members.  One of those nominated will also be appointed Chairperson of the Tribunal by the President of the High Court. Its membership under section 75 of the 2015 Act will include at least six members from each of the two legal professions and a lay majority.  The Tribunal will sit in uneven divisions of at least three members with each division to be chaired by a lay member.  The Tribunal will be empowered to make its own regulations under section 79 of the 2015 Act in relation to the making of applications to it and the conduct of its proceedings.  Section 83 of the 2015 Act also sets out how, and by whom, findings of the Disciplinary Tribunal may be appealed to the High Court.  The Tribunal will, over time, replace both the existing Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and Barristers' Professional Conduct Tribunal who will wind-down their existing caseloads. <\/p>  <p>  However, the functioning of the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal is also contingent on the related public complaints and misconduct provisions also found in Part 6 of the 2015 Act and which will have to be brought into operation at the same time.  These are the procedures through which complaints about alleged professional misconduct by solicitors or barristers will be received, given preliminary assessment and processed including, as may be considered appropriate, by their referral for determination by the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal.  Once these new procedures are commenced, all complaints by members of the public relating to alleged misconduct by barristers or solicitors, including those that may end up before the Disciplinary Tribunal, will be made initially through the Legal Services Regulatory Authority and its Complaints Committee rather than through the legal professional bodies or directly to a Tribunal as happens at present.<\/p>  <p>  In processing these complaints the Regulatory Authority will, therefore, also have to appoint the Complaints Committee.  This Committee, which will have 27 members, will sit in divisional committees of three or five members, each with a lay Chair, to consider complaints within its remit.  It will be appointed under the specified criteria of section 69 of the 2015 Act.  It should also be noted that under section 55 of the Act the Legal Services Regulatory Authority can make regulations regarding the making of complaints to it and the proceedings to be followed by it and the Complaints Committee in investigating complaints.  Under section 67 the Regulatory Authority will also issue guidelines for the possible alternative resolution of complaints by mediation or informal means. Extensive preparations have to be made by the Authority, therefore, by way of ensuring that the new public complaints and disciplinary architecture of the 2015 Act are set-up with the required membership, supporting staff, regulations and expertise in place to function in a legally robust manner upon commencement of the provisions concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The setting-up of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, whose establishment day was set by Order of the T&aacute;naiste for 1 October 2016, has been underway since July 2016 when Parts 1 and 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 were commenced as necessary to get the new Authority underway, particularly in terms of its nomination and appointment.  In December 2016 sections 118 to 120 of the 2015 Act were commenced to enable the conduct of public consultations and reports by the new Regulatory Authority within the statutory periods concerned.  These relate to Legal Partnerships, Multi-Disciplinary Practices and certain restrictions on the work of barristers.  The Authority, for which initial office accommodation has been provided by my Department along with the secondment of an officer at Assistant Principal level, also appointed an Interim Chief Executive on 1 January 2016 and has just last week publicly advertised for the recruitment of a long-term Chief Executive.  On 31 March 2016, the Regulatory Authority presented respective reports under sections 118 and 119 to me as Minister for Justice and Equality and these will soon be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the required manner.  On 6 April 2016 the Authority commenced its public consultations process under section 120 of the Act about certain restrictions on the work of barristers. <\/p>  <p>  Alongside these developments, the working focus right now is on the managed roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions.  Current areas of focus include the introduction of a more transparent legal costs regime and the parallel transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicators under Part 10 of the 2015 Act; the establishment of a Roll of Practising Barristers under Part 9; and the separate introduction by my Department of Pre-Action Protocols in medical negligence cases under Part 15.  Following these steps the key structural reforms of Part 6 of the Act which the Deputy has raised, including the appointment of the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced.  The Chairperson and members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its Interim Chief Executive and my Department are working closely to ensure that we can successfully coordinate the identification of the necessary steps and commencements by the Department, and the delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various remaining provisions concerned.  While it remains the intention that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will be in substantive regulatory mode later this year, the phased start-up of its various functions along the lines expressed will need careful project management and the identification over coming weeks, and in conjunction with the Authority, of more specific delivery dates for the respective functions involved. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200075#WRE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda College","counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200075#WRE00950"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[18511\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200075#WRE01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason the use of the swimming pool at the Templemore Garda Training College has been withdrawn from members of the community in Templemore despite the fact that this has been the practice for many years and helped to foster good relations between the community and the Garda college; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":170,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[18512\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200075#WRE01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason the use of the playing fields at the Templemore Garda Training College has been withdrawn from members of the community in Templemore despite the fact that this has been the practice for many years and helped to foster good relations between the community and the Garda college; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":171,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 91 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the College and its facilities and I, as Minister, have no role in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the College is in the ownership of the Office of Public Works which has responsibility for the maintenance of the College and its facilities.

It places particular emphasis on the management of high-volume offenders, sex offenders and perpetrators of domestic violence, combined with a strong focus on the rights and protection of crime victims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200076#WRF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200076#WRF01500"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[18662\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200076#WRF01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when she commissioned the annual study on court efficiency and sitting times benchmarked against international standards to provide accurate measurements for improving access to justice; and when it will be published.","asker":"1296","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to commission an annual study on court efficiency and sitting times as outlined by the Deputy and my Department has examined options to develop the most effective approach to implementing this commitment.

My Department has received a number of such proposals from both the Irish League of Credit Unions\u00a0(ILCU) and from the Credit Union\u00a0Development Association (CUDA).  Proposals from both representative bodies, in relation to the funding of social housing, are at\u00a0various stages of development.  While the Department of Housing, Planning,\u00a0Community and Local Government is the Department primarily responsible for the formulation and implementation of policy and for the preparation of legislation in relation to housing, any such proposal would require approval of the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank before it\u00a0could be implemented.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it has received information regarding proposals for credit unions to provide funding for social housing and is currently engaging with the sector on those proposals.  It further stated that while it\u00a0does not comment on specific proposals, such investments could be facilitated by future regulations made by the Central Bank, where appropriate.  The Central Bank also stated that it is willing to consider the type of regulations that would be required to facilitate such proposals.  However, the Central Bank's key consideration in evaluating such proposals is its statutory mandate to ensure the protection of members' savings by credit unions and to ensure the wellbeing of the sector generally.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from both my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government have met with\u00a0the representative\u00a0bodies on a number of occasions to examine how credit unions can assist in the area of social housing.  Officials from both Departments have also met with the Central Bank.  Separately, communication is\u00a0ongoing between the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and my Department.<\/p>  <p>  On 1\u00a0January 2016, I commenced the final sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012\u00a0(2012 Act) following\u00a0discussions with credit union representative bodies.  Following\u00a0commencement of the legislation, the Central Bank introduced\u00a0the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016,\u00a0regarding a number of\u00a0areas including savings, borrowing, lending, investments and liquidity. <\/p>  <p>  Investment regulations made\u00a0specific reference to section 43 of the Act and to\u00a0further classes of investments in which a credit union may invest its funds.  The regulations provide that investments in projects of a public nature include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.  The Central Bank\u00a0are currently\u00a0reviewing the investment regulations for credit unions and on completion of their review will undertake\u00a0a public consultation in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding any potential changes that may be made to the regulations, the legislative requirement for credit unions to ensure investments do not involve undue risk to members' savings will remain the overriding factor which must inform all credit union investment decisions.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the\u00a0 Central Bank has informed me that credit unions are permitted to provide commercial loans to their members.  Commercial loans are subject to concentration, maturity and large exposure limits as outlined in the 2016 Regulations.  In addition, where a credit union is considering granting a commercial loan, a comprehensive business plan and detailed financial projections (supported by evidence based assumptions), appropriate for the scale and complexity of the loan, should be provided and in place before such a loan is granted.  This should enable the credit union to ensure that it is satisfied that the borrowing business has the capacity to generate sufficient income to repay the commercial loan.  The Central Bank has further\u00a0informed me\u00a0that lending to SMEs is a specialist form of lending that requires specific skills and expertise.  In general,\u00a0this type of lending is viewed as high risk which may not be appropriate for all credit unions. <\/p>  <p>  Currently credit unions can and some do provide mortgages to members.  These types of loans are subject to\u00a0certain maturity limits contained in the 2016 Regulations.  The 2016 Regulations\u00a0set out the percentage of a credit union's loan book that can be outstanding for periods exceeding both five years and ten years, as well as limits on the maximum outstanding liability to an individual member.  Under the 2016 Regulations credit unions continue to be allowed to lend up to 30% of their loan book over five years and up to 10% of their loan book over 10 years, subject to a maximum maturity of 25 years.  In addition, credit unions can\u00a0apply to the Central Bank for an extension to their longer term lending limits (up to 40% of their loan book over 5 years and up to 15% of their loan book over 10 years).  Approval is subject to conditions set by the Central Bank.  There are currently 11 credit unions approved to avail of increased longer term lending limits.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank informs me that the December 2016 Prudential Return indicates that for the sector overall, total gross loans over 10 years amount to c. 2.7% of total loans in the credit union sector compared to the limit of 10% (and\u00a0in some cases 15%).<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated that while it can see longer term lending, including mortgages,\u00a0being part of a balanced portfolio of total lending, in their analyses, credit unions need to consider the impact of longer term lending on interest margins, return on assets and on balance sheet structure  the issue of funding longer term lending with short term funding is a challenge for the credit union business model.  The Central Bank further informs me that consumer mortgage lending is an activity that has its own unique risk profile, and proposals to become involved in mortgage lending in a significant way must be supported by an evidenced based business case.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Credit Union Advisory Committee's (CUAC) recent report provides a number of recommendations, one of which is to conduct a full review of lending limits and concentration limits.  I have established an Implementation Group which is due to meet for the third time later this month.  The Implementation Group is currently assessing each of\u00a0CUAC's recommendations\u00a0with a view to implementation as appropriate.  Central to its work\u00a0is ensuring\u00a0a full\u00a0examination of\u00a0lending limits and concentration limits as recommended.  I look forward to regular progress reports from the Implementation Group as these recommendations are developed and implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200077#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Meetings","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200077#WRG00450"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[18497\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200077#WRG00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the national economic dialogue will be held in 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, the provision of insurance is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and then\u00a0ensuring that they have\u00a0adequate provisioning to meet those risks.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, neither the Government nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to any specific individuals.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.<\/p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.  This in turn should lead to the increased availability of and lower cost for flood insurance.  To achieve this aim, there is a focus on:<\/p>  <p>  -  prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,<\/p>  <p>  -  development and implementation of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and<\/p>  <p>  -  improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.<\/p>  <p>  The National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme entailed a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and the development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk.  Under this Programme, 29 draft Flood Risk Management Plans were published for public consultation with feasible flood prevention measures identified to provide protection to at risk properties in 300 assessed areas.  These draft Plans are expected to be finalised in the coming weeks when submissions from the public consultation process have been fully considered.  The Government remains committed to funding this programme, as a core element of flood management strategy, over the next several years.<\/p>  <p>  This commitment is underpinned by a significant capital works investment programme with in the region\u00a0of &euro;250 million spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016.  The Capital Programme covering the period 2016 to 2021 will see the current annual allocation for flood risk schemes increased from &euro;45 million to &euro;100 million by 2021, representing a total investment of &euro;430 million.  These works will be completed on a prioritised basis.<\/p>  <p>  This strategy is also complemented by the Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance companies in Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes, which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.  In this regard, the Insurance Ireland\/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.  A further meeting of this working group is scheduled this month.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent Insurance Ireland survey of approximately 85% of the property insurance market in Ireland indicates that of the 16 completed defence schemes, 90% of policies in areas benefitting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while there has been an increase from 66% to 77% of policies in areas benefitting from demountable defences including flood cover.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint\u00a0to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.

Within this approach, there is capacity to allow religious schools to require parents or students to indicate some support or respect for the ethos of the school.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0am mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences with each of these approaches, including possible impacts on minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.<\/p>  <p>  Other possible consequences to be avoided include possible breaches of the constitution, technical and administrative difficulties impacting on the capacity to effectively run the system of over 4000 schools and the possibility of creating &lsquo;postcode lotteries&rsquo;, such as other countries have experienced, resulting in pronounced divergence in the quality of schools in more advantaged compared to less advantaged areas. <\/p>  <p>  The 8 week phase of receiving written submissions is part of\u00a0the broader 12 week consultation process which will include additional steps, including any follow-up consultation that is required, collation of\u00a0responses and development of next steps. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has begun the process of examining the submissions, which includes\u00a0a submission\u00a0from the board of management of the school in question,\u00a0and formulating next steps.

In this regard, I note that the Census 2016 figures indicate that those with no religion account for 9.8% of the population. <\/p>  <p>  In the Consultation paper I set out four possible approaches for dealing with the issue, in primary schools in the first instance, including:<\/p>  <p>  A catchment area approach, prohibiting religious schools from giving preference to children of their own religion who live outside the catchment area ahead of non-religious children who live inside the catchment;<\/p>  <p>  A &lsquo;nearest school rule&rsquo;, allowing religious schools to give preference to a religious child only where it is that child&rsquo;s nearest school of that particular religion;<\/p>  <p>  A quota system, which would allow a religious school give preference to children of its own religion in respect of only a certain proportion of places, meaning that the remaining places would be allocated based on other admissions criteria &ndash; proximity to the school, lottery etc.;<\/p>  <p>  An outright prohibition on religious schools using religion as a factor in admissions, meaning that all places would be allocated based on other factors.  Within this approach, there is capacity to allow religious schools to require parents or students to indicate some support or respect for the ethos of the school.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0am mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences with each of these approaches, including possible impacts on minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.<\/p>  <p>  Other possible consequences to be avoided include possible breaches of the constitution, technical and administrative difficulties impacting on the capacity to effectively run the system of over 4000 schools and the possibility of creating &lsquo;postcode lotteries&rsquo;, such as other countries have experienced, resulting in pronounced divergence in the quality of schools in more advantaged compared to less advantaged areas. <\/p>  <p>  The 8 week phase of receiving written submissions has now closed and this is part of\u00a0the broader 12 week consultation process which will include additional steps, including any follow-up consultation that is required, collation of\u00a0responses and development of next steps. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has begun the process of examining the submissions and formulating next steps.

The\u00a0scheme provides for the allocation of a quantum of SNA support to schools, taking into account the assessed care needs of individual children with disabilities, or severe medical needs.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates SNA support to schools, in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0030\/2014,\u00a0which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support individual pupils rests with the NCSE.

A robust external evaluation of the scheme conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants in 2016 found that it is one of the most effective labour market programmes &ndash; increasing participants&rsquo; employment outcomes by 32%.  It also found that while participants rated the scheme positively on 18 out of 20 aspects measured, most were dissatisfied with the level of payment and a sizable minority rated the scheme negatively on some aspects, for example the quality of training offered.  Based on the findings, and taking account of the improvement in labour market conditions, Indecon recommended that JobBridge be discontinued in its current form and replaced with a new scheme.  A copy of the full evaluation can be found at: <i><\/i>. <\/p><p>The Labour Market Council welcomed the report and noted the positive employment impact of the scheme.  A majority of the Council similarly recommended that JobBridge be replaced.<\/p><p>Having considered the evidence and the suggestions put forward by Indecon and the Labour Market Council, I announced the closure of JobBridge to new applications from 27thOctober 2016 and my intention to replace it later this year with a new work experience programme better suited to the much improved labour market and that addresses criticisms of the scheme. I proposed that any new scheme should:<\/p><p>-  Be voluntary for both participants and host organisations.<\/p><p>-  Offer unemployed people the opportunity to break the cycle of &ldquo;no work, no experience; no experience, no work&rdquo;.<\/p><p>-  Place greater emphasis on skills development and aim to help participants to develop skills through workplace learning.<\/p><p>I also proposed that all participants should receive a payment equivalent to the net minimum wage and that host organisations should make a contribution towards its cost.<\/p><p>I am very conscious that any new scheme would need the support, trust and confidence of employers, jobseekers and the public.  That is why I instructed my officials to consult with key stakeholders on these design principles.

There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  <\/p><p>In Budget 2017, it was announced that there would be a further increase in the rate of State pensions, by &euro;5, which increased the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory) to &euro;238.30.  <\/p><p>Therefore, over the past two Budgets, the maximum weekly rate for State Pensions has increased by &euro;8 per week, which is the equivalent of over &euro;34 per month.  The value of these increases is in excess of the value of the telephone allowance previously provided.<\/p><p>Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  On this occasion, the Government has concentrated resources on increasing the rate of the pension, rather than on the Household Benefits package.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200085#WRP00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Applications","counter":527,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200085#WRP00350"},{"type":"question","counter":528,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[18603\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200085#WRP00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a decision has been made on an application for invalidity pension by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":529,"content":"<p>The lady referred to has been awarded invalidity pension with effect from 9 March 2017.

Participants also have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing valuable work in their local communities.

The scheme was established as a supplementary income support scheme and is not designed as an employment activation scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate my support, and that of the Government, for the RSS.  In recognition of the important work undertaken in rural communities under the Scheme, I announced, as part of budget 2017, an additional 500 places to be made available under the scheme in 2017.  These additional places were rolled out with effect from1st Feb 2017 increasing the overall number of places to 3,100.

The programme was run as a trial in 2016 and this was made clear at the time.  It was always our intention to review the pilot this year, to evaluate it and other pilot initiatives and to draw guidance from this for our future engagement with our diaspora.  If it is to be dynamic and meaningful, our diaspora programme has to be willing to test and evaluate new initiatives and new forms of engagement.  But because our funding and resources are finite, we also have a responsibility to evaluate them carefully to ensure that they are both effective in achieving the desired outcomes and efficient in their use of resources.  That process is now underway &ndash; not behind closed doors but in close consultation with the communities abroad whose interests we serve.<\/p><p>Central to this review process and to the Government&rsquo;s broader engagement with the diaspora is the upcoming Second Global Irish Civic Forum, which will bring together Irish community leaders and members from around the world.  Some 200 individuals working with or on behalf of Irish communities worldwide are scheduled to attend at Dublin Castle on 4-5 May.

These discussions will include the extremely important question of how best to engage with the next generation, and future generations, of our communities abroad.

In this respect the United Nations has recently been loudly sounding the alarm call.  Its warning last month of its need for assistance in reducing the risk of starvation and famine in South Sudan, Yemen, Somalia and northeast Nigeria was a stark reminder of the problems confronting civilian populations in many parts of the world.  And last week the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, speaking at the Brussels Conference on supporting Syrians and the region, reminded us that the need for humanitarian aid and the protection of Syrian civilians has never been greater.  Mr. Guterres added that the UN is determined to reach everyone in need through all possible means.  He has made it clear more generally that conflict prevention and protection of civilians will be his priority during his term of office that started in January.<\/p>  <p>  The UN has a vital role in promoting the resolution of armed conflicts which cause so much of the misery faced by civilian populations.  It does this primarily through the UN Security Council which has, under the UN Charter, primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.  Ireland remains a strong supporter of the rules-based international system, with the UN at its centre.  At the same time, we recognise that it must work better for the people whose lives it has been designed to protect and improve.  It is clear that the Security Council must work with greater unity.  It is also clear, as Ireland has consistently stated, that the Council needs to become more representative, more transparent and more efficient.    <\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the former UN Secretary General initiated three major review exercises which were aimed at improving the overall effectiveness of the UN&rsquo;s response to conflict.  The findings from the high level policy reviews on (1) UN Peace Operations, (2) Peacebuilding Architecture and (3) Women, Peace and Security were published and are in the process of being implemented.  Each of these reviews offer recommendations on how the UN can improve and reform its functions and structures particularly in relation to the global challenge presented by conflict and war.  Ireland engaged fully with all three reviews, calling for the recommendations to be discussed and implemented as part of our broader calls for UN reform. <\/p>  <p>  Other efforts to increase the UN&rsquo;s effectiveness in meeting its current challenges are ongoing.  These include the development of a Global Compact on Refugees, arising from the High-Level Summit on large movements of refugees and migrants which took place at the UN in New York in September 2016, and which was co-facilitated by Ireland.  The Global Compact will set out a framework to improve the way in which the international community responds to large movements of refugees and migrants, as well as to protracted refugee situations.  <\/p>  <p>  Discussions on improvements to the effectiveness and accountability of UN peacekeeping missions are also taking place at the UN, most recently in a UN Security Council thematic debate on 6 April at which UN Secretary General Guterres set out plans for a review process which will make recommendations on improvements to the UN&rsquo;s peace and security architecture by June of this year.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a consistent and strong contributor to the UN&rsquo;s peacekeeping operations.  It is in our interest for peacekeeping operations to receive clear, realistic and up-to-date mandates from the Security Council.  We support the establishment by Mr. Guterres of a small Executive Committee at UNHQ to provide more coordinated planning, control and leadership of the UN&rsquo;s operations and strategy.  Progress in these areas can only help to address the humanitarian crises we currently face.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to participating in the ongoing discussions and reviews, Ireland will continue to advocate for reform of the UN&rsquo;s structures and systems to ensure that it is equipped to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first century and fulfil its critical role in the maintenance of international peace and security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200086#WRQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid Provision","counter":574,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200086#WRQ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":575,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[18641\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200086#WRQ02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the efforts being made to address the refugee crisis in Syria and Iraq; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":576,"content":"<p>Ireland continues to respond to the unprecedented levels of humanitarian need resulting from ongoing conflict and violence in Syria and Iraq, including through support to neighbouring countries, which are hosting huge numbers of refugees.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, we have provided a total of &euro;76.5 million in humanitarian assistance for the Syria crisis.

Ireland will continue to work to ensure that our assistance is targeted at and reaches those in greatest need, in the most efficient and effective way possible.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200087#WRR01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Peace Process","counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200087#WRR01100"},{"type":"question","counter":597,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[18648\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200087#WRR01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the efforts being made to encourage reengagement in the peace process in the Middle East; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":598,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding other concurrent crises in the Middle East region, the resolution of the Israeli and Palestinian conflict remains a priority for the Government and for the European Union, and one to which I have devoted a lot of time at EU level and in visits to the region.  Already the issue has been discussed at three of the four meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council held so far this year.<\/p>  <p>  The background is a very troubling one of stagnation in the political process and worsening developments on the ground.  The significant effort led by France last year, including the holding of two major conferences, was able to maintain an international focus on the issue but was not able to restore any momentum to the political process.  Regrettably, the Israeli Government refused to attend or to engage in any way with the French initiative.

Engagement with third countries to prevent violent extremism and to strengthen their capacity to detect and prevent terrorism, in full compliance with international law and human rights, is at the heart of the EU&rsquo;s strategy and is reflected in a substantial increase in assistance to third countries in this respect.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has placed considerable emphasis on its immediate neighbourhood: Western Balkans, Turkey, and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries.  Actions include finalising Counter-Terrorism action plans with Lebanon, Jordan, Tunisia and Turkey, expanding the EU Counter Terrorism experts&rsquo; network to the Sahel and Western Balkans, and focusing on preventive action on conflict and violent extremism prevention priorities identified through the EU Early Warning process.<\/p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s approach is guided by, and is consistent with, the approach taken by the UN to countering terrorism and by the principles and measures set out in relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, including UNSCR 2161 (2014) on freezing funds and other assets of terrorist groups, and UNSCR 2178 (2014) on measures to suppress the recruiting, organising, transporting or equipping of individuals who travel to another State to plan or carry out terrorist acts or training.<\/p>  <p>  The former UN Secretary General&rsquo;s comprehensive Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism, presented in January last year, and his related reports are an important and welcome contribution to addressing the threat posed by international terrorism, and to highlighting the need to address drivers of violent extremism through dialogue and conflict prevention, strengthening governance and the rule of law, gender equality and empowering women, community engagement and youth empowerment, and education and skills development. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports the comprehensive approach being taken at EU and UN levels level to preventing and countering terrorism.  At meetings of the Council, I have stressed the need to tackle underlying factors that contribute to radicalisation and terrorism and in particular the importance of the link between security and development.

Ireland provided over &euro;190 million in humanitarian funding in 2016 to assist people affected by crisis and conflict around the world, including refugees from war zones.  In addition, Ireland also contributes to the European Commission&rsquo;s humanitarian action outside the EU, which has an annual budget of some &euro;1 billion.<\/p>  <p>  The ability to deliver international aid to vulnerable populations according to their need is critical. Ireland works at EU and UN level to advocate for increased humanitarian access, more effective means of providing assistance, and respect for international humanitarian law.  In 2016, we provided &euro;7 million in core funding to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as well as &euro;4.8 million in humanitarian funding for its work in South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Chad. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the International Committee of the Red Cross, to which we provided &euro;14 million in 2016, reminds authorities and others of their legal obligations under international humanitarian law as part of their mission to protect and assist the victims of war. <\/p>  <p>  The ongoing crises in the Middle East and Africa illustrate clearly the need for the UN, in particular, to enhance its capacity to respond more effectively to conflict and the associated need for humanitarian protection.  Providing safe areas within conflict zones is extremely difficult, especially where civilian protection is not prioritised. Safe areas require UN mandates and robustly equipped peacekeeping personnel.  On my recent visit to Jordan and Lebanon, I witnessed for myself the important role played by UNIFL in ensuring the safety and protection of those affected by conflict, through its UN-mandated peacekeeping mission.    <\/p>  <p>  The blockages at the Security Council in recent years have prevented the international community from acting together in a way that would allow civilians in conflict zones to be afforded greater protection.  Ireland advocates strongly for reforms to the membership and working methods of the Security Council, and we will continue to do so to ensure that it is equipped to respond to the challenges arising from conflict situations worldwide.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200087#WRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":606,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200087#WRR02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Data","counter":605,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200087#WRR02000"},{"type":"question","counter":606,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[18374\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200087#WRR02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the flood relief works that have been completed by the OPW and other State or local bodies in Dublin 1, 3 and 7, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":607,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) has undertaken significant flood relief works, either by undertaking such works directly or by funding works undertaken by Dublin City Council, on the north side of Dublin City over the last 15 years. <\/p><p>The following major schemes have been carried out:<table><tr><th>Scheme\/Works<\/th><th>Year Completed<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>River Tolka (Dublin City Council Area)<\/td><td>2008<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Spencer Dock<\/td><td>2009<\/td><\/tr><\/table>Approximately &euro;11 million was expended on these projects.<\/p><p>Flood relief works were also carried out in the Clanmoyle area, Donnycarney on the River Wad which borders the area referred to in the question.

The approach taken to this review differs from the Comprehensive Spending Reviews undertaken in 2011 and 2014 in that it\u00a0does not cover total Government expenditure in a single year.  The 2011 and 2014 reviews were conducted at a time when Ireland was about to enter, or already in an Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) under the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).  Now under the preventative arm of the SGP, we find ourselves in a different fiscal and economic landscape where moderate, sustainable expenditure growth is planned over the medium term. <\/p><p>This year's review is the first in a planned series of 'rolling' selective reviews that will take place each year to 2019.  This review will systematically examine existing spending programmes to assess their effectiveness in meeting policy objectives and to identify scope for re-allocating funding to meet expenditure priorities.  This will allow Government to tackle any concerns identified in these areas while also potentially making some funding available for high-priority policies.  A significant portion of expenditure will be examined in 2017, with the remainder to be examined in 2018 and 2019.  Over the three year cycle, the totality of Government expenditure with the exception of pay rates will be reviewed in overall terms.\u00a0 Engagement is ongoing between officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and those in other Government Departments on the topics under review for this first year. <\/p><p>The chosen approach to the Spending Review has been informed by the Irish Government Economic Evaluation Service paper 'Spending Reviews in Ireland: Lessons for the Future' and has been tailored to reflect the changed context and lessons learned from previous reviews.  A copy of this paper is available at <i>igees.gov.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>This approach of ongoing examination and re-prioritisation of funding is standard international practice in public expenditure management.  It allows for an examination of the totality of Government spending on an ongoing basis, rather than focusing on the additional amount that may be available in a given year.  This is intended to ensure that the maximum efficiency and effectiveness is achieved for every euro of public funding and allows a focus on the medium-term sustainability, efficiency and effectiveness of public spending. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200087#WRR03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information","counter":623,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200087#WRR03800"},{"type":"question","counter":624,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[18557\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200087#WRR03900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the State agencies and semi-State bodies that are subject to the Freedom of Information Acts; his plans to extend the remit of this legislation to other such agencies and bodies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":625,"content":"<p>The Freedom of Information Act 2014 provides a very broad definition of public bodies at Section 6(1) and further provides that all new public bodies comprehended by this definition will automatically come under freedom of information (FOI) legislation, unless specifically exempted by order.

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF to dedicate &euro;5m to a daycase waiting list initiative with the aim of ensuring that no adult patient will be waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure by 30 June 2017.  In excess of 2000 daycases will be managed through this process and the NTPF has indicated that the initiative has commenced and patients will start to receive their appointments before Easter.  The focus of this initiative will be those lists with large numbers of long-waiting patients including ENT, Ophthalmology, General Surgery, Dental, Urology and Vascular surgery.<\/p>  <p>  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.

St. James&rsquo;s is Ireland&rsquo;s largest and leading adult teaching and research-intensive hospital, with the broadest range of national specialties of all acute hospitals. It has a strong and well-established research and education infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to be the adult co-location partner. Co-location with St James&rsquo;s, and ultimately tri-location with the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, is best practice internationally and will deliver the excellence in clinical care.<\/p>  <p>  In line with leading practice in children&rsquo;s hospital design, those who need to stay in hospital will have their own single room.  Each of the 380 single rooms, with the exception of critical care rooms, will have an en-suite bathroom and facilities for a parent to comfortably stay overnight.  The Ronald McDonald House Charity plans to build a new 53 bedroom Ronald McDonald House adjacent to the new children&rsquo;s hospital allowing parents and other children to stay as necessary.<\/p>  <p>  A dedicated school will be provided, incorporating a range of educational services, including artwork and pottery, in a stimulating environment that is conducive to learning and is medically equipped to cater for children on ventilators and other mobile electronic medical equipment. It will be fully wheelchair and disability compliant.  Dedicated schoolrooms will be provided on three of the inpatient units to cater for children unable to attend the main school due to clinical treatments (including oncology\/ haematology and renal dialysis). <\/p>  <p>  Children who cannot attend the school due to disease processes or infection control issues will also be provided with alternative educational support in their room or via appropriate online facilities managed by the school principal.  The main hospital school will be located in a central area with direct horizontal and vertical links to the inpatient units and will incorporate four large classrooms for primary and post primary schooling; two specialist classrooms which may include wet areas for arts and crafts.  Children and adolescents will be educated separately in age-appropriate accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  The therapeutic benefits of the outdoors will be catered for in the rooftop garden which will offer opportunities for learning, play and distraction.  The garden's play decks and terraces will offer a range of outdoor spaces that are rarely found in most hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The design of the hospital has recognised the need of most parents to access the hospital by car, and 675 car parking spaces have been provided for families based on current and projected future demand, and a further 325 for staff (1000 in total, three times the current number of parking spaces for existing paediatric hospitals).  The parking system will also allow families to reserve spaces ahead of arriving to the hospital, and emergency drop-off spaces are also being provided. <\/p>  <p>  The needs of children, young people, their families and those who will work in paediatrics are being taken into account throughout this project.  The Youth Advisory Council, (a group of children and young people), amongst others, has provided input, advice and feedback on the development of the new hospital and its future services at regular meetings with the project directors. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200089#WRT02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":698,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200089#WRT02700"},{"type":"question","counter":699,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[18439\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200089#WRT02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a medical card application was closed in view of the fact that contact was made with the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, in March 2017 (details supplied) and was informed that the application was in progress; if he will take into consideration the medical conditions involved and reopen the case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":700,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The proposal includes permanent contracts for future graduates with scope for a career break and extensive education and personal development opportunities for nurses and midwives to upskill.

The HSE is also offering full time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts and is also focused on converting posts filled by agency staffing to permanent posts.

Addressing the Forum, I took the opportunity to highlight that one of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore I was pleased to facilitate the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo;, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, it provides tillage farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.  The loans are for amounts up to &euro;150,000 for up to six years and are flexible with interest only facilities of up to three years.  Although no official returns have been made to my Department as yet, the banks have confirmed that they have applications up to the amounts available under the Scheme. I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low-cost flexible finance.  I hope that the commercial banks will respond positively to this demand by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.  I am meeting with the Chief Executives of the banks shortly to discuss this and other issues relating to access to finance in the agri-food sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017. The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). All applications must be made on-line, either by the farmer or by an adviser authorised to act on his or her behalf.  The closing date for applications under the first tranche of the new scheme will be Friday 30 June 2017.<\/p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, I am pleased to record that to date &euro;1.183 billion has been paid out under the 2016\/17 Basic Payment Scheme to 123,929 farmers and these payments are ongoing.  Furthermore, payments of &euro;201.38 million have also been made to 94,101 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  I can also confirm to the Deputy that a wide ranging discussion took place among all the stakeholders who attended the recent session of the Tillage Forum, including on the issue of crop losses as a result of the poor harvest conditions of last autumn.  My officials have since then had some further meetings with stakeholders and I will consider further the outcome of those deliberations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200092#WRW01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Young Farmers Scheme Eligibility","counter":818,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200092#WRW02000"},{"type":"question","counter":819,"qnumday":309,"qnumall":"[18372\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200092#WRW02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on a matter (detail supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":820,"content":"<p>In order to qualify for the 2017 Young Farmers Scheme, applicants must have successfully completed a recognised course of education in agriculture giving rise to an award at FETAC Level 6 or its equivalent by the 15th May 2017. <\/p><p>There is no restriction on the date of award of the relevant educational qualification from previous years.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.<\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint.<\/p><p>On the 4 April, I\u00a0signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to their plans to provide broadband to \u00a0an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  Eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over the next 90 weeks, an average of 500 premises passed per day.  The rollout plan has been agreed with my Department and this along with the\u00a0tight deadline will be monitored closely by my Department to ensure that they meet their obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website www.dccae.gov.ie.<\/p><p>On the same day I\u00a0published\u00a0 an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie which\u00a0finalises the\u00a0State Intervention area.

The remaining 1.8m \u00a0premises are located in the BLUE area and will \u00a0be served by commercial operators.  Of the 1.8m premises, some 300,000 \u00a0premises fall within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver high speed broadband by end of 2018.  Further information of eir's planned rural deployment is available at a .<\/p><p>Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie.<\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.

The first phase of the project, which is currently being finalised, estimates the annual value of time lost to road users due to aggravated congestion in the greater Dublin area.  The study uses data from a variety of sources to estimate activity on the network including census travel to work data, NTA GDA surveys, car ownership data and CSO small area population statistics.  The project has been carried out in conjunction with the National Transport Authority, NTA, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and Dublin City Council, DCC, with particular support from the NTA's modelling team in producing the modelled outputs.<\/p>  <p>  A final project report will be published on my Department's website in the coming weeks.

The Directive on alternative dispute resolution (ADR) caters for business to consumer (B2C) transactions only and is intended to offer a simple, fast and low-cost alternative to civil litigation for consumers in order to resolve disputes between consumers and traders.  The scheme is voluntary for traders and there is no obligation on them to participate in ADR procedures which are offered by ADR entities, if they choose not to do so.

The Scheme provides therapeutic supports in the community for children who are subject to bail conditions.  Extern have been contracted to operate the scheme by providing a &lsquo;wraparound&rsquo; service to the young person and their family with a prescribed reporting system back to the courts through the appropriate statutory bodies; Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Oberstown.  The scheme offers greater options to the courts in the knowledge that close monitoring will take place through interaction with the young people, their families and communities.  It works with young people aged 12-17 years old who have initially been denied bail and remanded in detention.  A Multisystemic Therapy [MST] treatment model is used to support the young person and their parent\/caregivers to increase compliance with bail conditions if the young person is released from detention back into the community.  MST is a family and community based treatment programme that addresses the multiple determinants of serious antisocial behaviour in young offenders.  It empowers parents and caregivers to support their child to make positive changes across the individual, home, community, peer and school systems.  Each family is assigned an MST therapist who will work intensively with them, including multiple contacts with family and other participants every week and &lsquo;On Call&rsquo; support available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Treatment lasts between three and five months with the overarching goals of the Bail Supervision Scheme to support the young person to be at home, in education\/training\/employment and constructively engaged.<\/p><p>The Scheme aims to reduce the number of young people on remand in detention.  On conclusion of the pilot phase of the Scheme, a formal review will be undertaken with the intention thereafter of putting in place a managed roll out of the Scheme nationwide.<\/p><p>To date the scheme has worked with 11 young people and their families.  The level of support offered is very high with sessions taking place both in the family home and in the community.
