I would like to begin by highlighting the main objectives of this Bill.  First, it provides for several key changes to bankruptcy law in Ireland.  These are that the normal duration of bankruptcy is reduced from three years to one year; the normal duration of a bankruptcy payment order, which concerns the payments a court may direct the bankrupt person to make towards his or her creditors, is reduced from five to three years; and a bankrupt person's legal interest in his or her home will revest in him or her after three years, subject to certain exceptions.  These significant changes will ease the impact of bankruptcy on the large majority of bankruptcy cases who did not seek to go bankrupt and who have co-operated in an open manner with the bankruptcy process and handed over income and assets towards repayment of debts.  In such a situation, the bankrupt person will be able to exit bankruptcy and return to normal economic activity much more quickly in line with the position in England, Wales or Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Second, the Bill provides for significant sanctions to deter and penalise any bankrupt person who do not co-operate with the bankruptcy or who tries to conceal his or her income or assets from creditors.  In such cases, the High Court will retain the power to extend the bankruptcy term to up to eight years and to extend the duration of a bankruptcy payment order to up to five years.  In addition, a new provision will allow the High Court to extend the bankruptcy term to up to 15 years where it is satisfied that there has been particularly serious non-co-operation or concealment.<\/p>  <p>  Third, the Bill modernises key aspects of bankruptcy procedures.  It will abolish the outdated requirement for a statutory sitting of the court in all bankruptcy cases, provide an effective power for the official assignee to disclaim onerous properties and ensure that the official assignee has clear powers to demand and investigate electronic records relating to a bankrupt's assets and affairs.  While these changes are procedural, they are nevertheless vital as they will remove unnecessary costs and delays, free up court time and resources and allow more efficient and effective bankruptcy administration.  Fourth, the Bill sets out appropriate transitional arrangements so that people already in bankruptcy will also be able to avail of these reforms subject at maximum to a six-month transitional period.  <\/p>  <p>  Before I set out the Bill's provisions in more detail, I would like to note that the overall thinking behind the Bill has been influenced in particular by the Private Members' Bill on reducing the bankruptcy term to one year sponsored by Deputy Penrose, which was published in March this year and whose provisions have been incorporated into this Bill, and by the report on bankruptcy reform completed last summer at my request by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality chaired by Deputy Stanton.  I thank him for the work done by him and members of the committee.  The joint committee held a public consultation and examined more than 100 submissions before providing me with its report in July which likewise recommended reducing the bankruptcy term to one year.  I thank Deputy Penrose for his interest and work on this matter and once again express my appreciation to the joint committee for its detailed work and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the many stakeholders and individuals who made very valuable submissions.<\/p>  <p>  I think Deputies will agree that this Bill represents an important milestone.  It comes at the right time as it complements the significant reforms that we have already introduced since 2012, including the enactment earlier this year of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act and the commencement in recent weeks of the new independent court review of the so-called \"bank veto\", that is, where creditors reject a personal insolvency proposal.  Other recent developments include the waiver of court and Insolvency Service of Ireland fees for insolvency cases, a substantial reduction in bankruptcy costs and the putting in place a nationwide network of dedicated mortgage arrears Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service centres, including provision of information and support at all repossession hearings.  This is happening at all repossession hearings and I urge people to avail of those services.  <\/p>  <p>  I will now turn to outlining the thematic provisions of this Bill.  Under the Bill, the normal duration of bankruptcy will be reduced from three years to one year, as recommended by the joint committee in its report.  This will also correspond to the position in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  The report of the joint committee expressed concern that reducing the bankruptcy term should not benefit bankruptcies which appeared to be deliberate or fraudulent.  The Bill responds to that concern by retaining provision for a considerably longer bankruptcy term - up to eight years and, in particularly serious cases, up to 15 years - where the court is satisfied that the bankrupt is not co-operating with the bankruptcy or has tried to conceal assets or income.<\/p>  <p>  Bankruptcy payment orders are court orders made on the application of the official assignee which require a bankrupt to make payments for the benefit of his or her creditors from any surplus income or assets after reasonable living expenses for the bankrupt and any dependants.  The Bill will reduce the normal maximum duration of a bankruptcy payment order from five to three years.  However, the maximum five-year duration will still apply in cases where the court is satisfied that the bankrupt has not co-operated with the bankruptcy or has tried to conceal assets or income.<\/p>  <p>  When a person becomes bankrupt, his or her interest in any property he or she owns, including his or her home, passes automatically to the official assignee whose duty is to sell it, if feasible, to repay his or her creditors.  Section 61 of the Bankruptcy Act protects any spouse or civil partner of the bankrupt by requiring the official assignee to apply to court for leave to sell the home if it is a family home under the Family Home Protection Act 1976 or a shared home under the Civil Partnership Act 2010.  The official assignee will try to dispose of the bankrupt's interest in the property, preferably to the spouse or civil partner.  However, in many cases and particularly where the property is in negative equity, no purchaser can be found.  The Bill proposes a practical solution in such cases by providing that the bankrupt's interest in the home will automatically revest in him or her three years after the bankruptcy adjudication unless the court orders otherwise, the bankrupt and the official assignee agree otherwise or the official assignee has sold it or applied for a court order authorising sale before that date.<\/p><p>A similar provision already applies in England and Wales.  This applies to the bankrupt's home at the date of bankruptcy adjudication, whether it is the family home, shared civil partnership home or principal private residence as a single person.  This will also allow for more efficient and cost-effective administration of bankruptcy cases, particularly those with very limited resources.  It is important to note that the bankrupt's interest in the home remains subject to any mortgage so the position of the mortgage lender is not affected.<\/p> <p> The Bill introduces a new power for the court to extend the bankruptcy term up to a total of 15 years on application by the official assignee where the court considers it just to do so in cases of particularly serious non-cooperation or concealment by the bankrupt.  The reason is that a relatively small number of bankruptcy cases feature particularly serious and flagrant levels of such conduct by the bankrupt, for which there is currently no adequate deterrent.<\/p> <p> The new 15 year maximum term is modelled on the approach in the US and UK.  In the US, a bankrupt's debts are only discharged if he or she has cooperated with the bankruptcy trustee, equivalent to our official assignee.  In the UK, legislation allows the bankrupt to remain subject to continuing bankruptcy restrictions for up to 15 years in case of non-cooperation, a \"bankruptcy restriction order\".<\/p> <p> The Bill will abolish the requirement under the Bankruptcy Act to hold a \"statutory sitting\" of the court in every bankruptcy case, some weeks after adjudication, which must be attended by the bankrupt, the creditors and the official assignee.  The original purposes of the statutory sitting are now superseded and it is widely seen as an outdated formality which creates unnecessary legal costs and workload for debtors, creditors and the official assignee, and is a major strain on court bankruptcy resources.  Its abolition will free up considerable time for the courts and the official assignee and will also benefit the parties.<\/p> <p> The Bill will clarify the wording of several provisions in the Bankruptcy Act to put it beyond doubt that electronic as well as paper records are covered by the powers of the court or the official assignee to demand accounts and records for the purposes of investigating a bankrupt's affairs.  This arises in only a few high-asset cases but is important to assist the official assignee in investigations where a bankrupt may have concealed assets.<\/p> <p> The Bill will allow the official assignee an effective power to refuse to accept responsibility for any property of the bankrupt which is likely to generate substantial costs and where there are no funds in the bankruptcy estate to cover these costs.  This is an important provision.  When the official assignee takes over a bankrupt's property, he becomes legally responsible for any costs and liabilities arising from it.  These may include unpaid rates, property tax, management charges, essential repairs, ongoing security and insurance of properties which may not be generating any revenue.  At the same time, the official assignee has no power to compel any contribution from the secured lender who is entitled to receive any proceeds of sale of the properties.  Consequently, these costs risk being imposed on the State and the taxpayer.<\/p> <p> The current provision for disclaimer in the Bankruptcy Act effectively only applies to liabilities arising under a lease, which does not cover the many sorts of liability I have mentioned.  In the UK this problem has been addressed by the Insolvency Act 1986, which gives the official assignee a broad power to disclaim any onerous property, meaning that such costs are, more appropriately, the responsibility of the secured creditor who will receive the benefit of the property concerned.  The proposed amendment in this Bill follows the same approach and will generate considerable savings for the State and the taxpayer as well as improving the efficiency of bankruptcy administration.<\/p> <p> Any bankruptcy already existing when the Bill comes into effect will also benefit from the changes introduced by this Bill subject to a six-month transitional period.  This reflects the six month transition period provided previously when the bankruptcy term was reduced from 12 years to three years by the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  It is needed to ensure sufficient time is available to ensure a smooth transition and to make any necessary applications to court for extension of time in cases which raise possible issues of non-cooperation or attempted concealment.<\/p> <p> Under the transitional provisions, and assuming that there are no grounds for extension, an existing bankruptcy, which was due to terminate three years after adjudication, if it is already due to terminate less than six months after the commencement date will terminate on its due date, otherwise it will now terminate one year after adjudication or six months after commencement if that is the later date; an existing bankruptcy payment order which was due to expire five years after it was made by the court, if it is already due to expire less than six months after the commencement date will terminate on its due date, otherwise it will now expire three years after it was made or six months after commencement if that is a later date.<\/p> <p> The provision for re-vesting of the bankrupt's interest in the family home applies to a bankruptcy which exists at the date the Bill comes into effect.  Re-vesting takes place, subject to the usual exceptions, either on the third anniversary of adjudication or six months after the commencement date, whichever is the later.<\/p> <p> The technical content and effect of each section in the Bill is set out in the Explanatory Memorandum.  Sections 3 to 5 deal with the \"statutory sitting\", and sections 6 and 7 relate to electronic records as I have explained.  Section 8 is an important provision, which amends section 56 of the Bankruptcy Act to ensure that the official assignee has a strong and effective power to disclaim property of a bankrupt which is subject to costly liabilities.  Section 9 deals with issues regarding the family home.  Section 10 is another important provision which amends section 85 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 to provide for two of the main purposes of the Bill, reduction of the bankruptcy term and re-vesting of the bankrupt person's home.  Subsection 10(a) reduces the normal duration of bankruptcy from three years to one year and provides transitional arrangements for bankruptcies already in existence at the commencement of this section.  Subsection 10(b) concerns the re-vesting.  Section 85(3F) is a transitional provision which I have detailed.  Section 11 deals with the extension of time when somebody does not cooperate.  Section 12 reduces the normal duration of a bankruptcy payment order.  Electronic records are also dealt with in section 15. <\/p> <p> In conclusion the background of our economic crisis means that many of those now entering bankruptcy, or already in bankruptcy, have been struggling with intractable debt for several years.  The measures in this Bill will give people in serious debt who have no disposable income an earlier return to normal economic activity.  As the Small Firms Association has underlined they will particularly help small entrepreneurs.  At the same time the Bill includes strong provisions to ensure that any bankrupt who tries to conceal resources from creditors or evade their obligations will end up with a longer bankruptcy term and a longer bankruptcy payment order.  It also makes important changes to modernise bankruptcy procedures, reduce unnecessary costs and ensure that the official assignee has effective powers to focus on the small minority of bankrupts where there may be issues of fraud and concealment.<\/p> <p> This Bill provides a further example of this Government's commitment to bringing forward practical reforms to ensure a more enlightened, less punitive, less costly approach to help people struggling with debt to return to solvency.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500003#A00500","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450177800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this Bill.  The legislation reduces the bankruptcy term from three years to 12 months which is a very short period.  It will not go unnoticed that less than three years after reducing the bankruptcy term to three years we are reducing it further.  While it brings us into line with Northern Ireland and Britain it does mean that our bankruptcy laws will be out of line with most other jurisdictions.  We hope there are enough protections in the Bill to prevent abuse by rogue business people.  We have to learn from the past when some individuals got away scot free with reckless activity.  The need to match this Bill with stronger legislation on white collar crime cannot be understated.  On balance, however, we accept the Bill and will support it.<\/p>  <p>  Last week the Cabinet rushed to get this bankruptcy Bill approved with a meeting taking place over the phone to approve the new legislation.  Approval was required by Wednesday of last week to ensure the legislation would be enacted by Christmas.<\/p><p>Earlier this year in the D&aacute;il the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, poured cold water on proposals to reduce the current term for discharge from bankruptcy from three years to one.  In response to questions from Deputy Michael McGrath he stated:<\/p><blockquote>Currently there is a lack of analysis of unintended consequences around further reducing the bankruptcy term to one year.  I would be concerned that if we act in haste on this issue, without having conducted rigorous analysis of the objectives and impacts of such a change, we may not achieve the best outcomes for entrepreneurs or private individuals.<\/blockquote><p>Despite his warning about acting in haste, the Attorney General was told just two weeks ago to draft a Bill.<br\/><br\/>On the aims of the Bill, it includes five key provisions: it reduces the automatic period for discharge from bankruptcy from three years to one; it reduces the term of bankruptcy payment orders from five years to three; it provides that where the family home has not been sold by the official assignee after a three-year period, it will revest in the bankrupt person; to increase the sanctions for those who fail to adequately co-operate with the official assignee during the bankruptcy process; and to abolish the practice of the statutory sitting, whereby a bankrupt person was obliged to attend court after the adjudication of bankruptcy and make a full disclosure of his or her property.<br\/><br\/>Section 85 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988, as amended by the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, provides for automatic discharge after three years.  The change to the bankruptcy term smacks of a last minute attempt to create a semblance of something being done.  Families who are struggling to repay their mortgage need far more done to help them to stay in their homes.<br\/><br\/>For four years the Government resisted taking action to remove the bank veto.  Following further questioning in the past month by Fianna F&aacute;il, the Minister for Justice and Equality signed the commencement order this week for all remaining provisions of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act.  Not one family has, as yet, benefited from this provision owing to the delay in signing the commencement order. <br\/><br\/>There is the prospect of EU harmonisation of bankruptcy arrangements.  The European Commission, in its recommendation, dated 12 March 2014, on a new approach to business failure and insolvency, suggested entrepreneurs should be discharged after three years.  The cornerstone of any bankruptcy system should be fairness, not only to debtors who become bankrupt but also to creditors who have had their debts included in a bankruptcy.  It should also be proportionate in striking a balance between the rights of creditors and the needs of debtors to seek relief from their unmanageable debts.<br\/><br\/>According to the Association of Personal Insolvency Practitioners:<\/p><blockquote>The financial failure of some consumers is an inevitable part of any modern credit-based society and can arise for a number of different reasons: economic downturn, unemployment or illness.  Often the media highlight the irresponsible or feckless behaviour of some debtors, but in our experience these examples are the exceptions to the rule and are unrepresentative of the majority of debtors.<\/blockquote><p>I will now deal with the arguments in favour of reduced bankruptcy terms.  A one-year term would make the financial institutions engage more with debtors in reaching meaningful solutions and encourage further engagement with the debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement processes.  It would pass on the benefits of economic recovery to all citizens by allowing people with crippling levels of debt associated with credit obtained during the economic boom to move on from that debt.  This would allow the debtor to return to economic normality much faster.  It is necessary to aid the economic recovery of the State and enable many of those caught up in bankruptcy to become positive contributors to the economy as quickly as possible.  Commercial and consumer debts running to billions of euro have been sold to various funds and further sales are due to take place.  It is difficult to predict how tough these funds will be on debtors in the future.  Changing the bankruptcy term to one year would generate a more level playing field.  It is important that appropriate safeguards be put in place to address situations where the bankrupt is not co-operative or acts in bad faith.<br\/><br\/>There are arguments against reducing the bankruptcy period to one year, as follows.  The view was expressed to the justice committee that looked at this issue that the reduced time period of one year would make it too easy for the bankrupt to defer asset and income acquisition until after the expiry date.  In addition, newer debt solutions such as the PIA or debt settlement arrangement would become less attractive.  An alternative would be that the official assignee be given the right to apply to the High Court to discharge the bankrupt earlier.  This would occur where the bankrupt had co-operated with the process and there was nothing further to be gained by enforcing the full period of three years.  The official assignee is concerned that if a change to one year was made, Dublin could become the bankruptcy tourism capital of Europe and that the Insolvency Service of Ireland would not have adequate resources to handle the extra work arising therefrom.  However, if the Irish courts were to adopt the same robust approach as in Northern Ireland, Dublin would not be as attractive to Europeans seeking bankruptcy.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Brendan Burgess of <i>www.askaboutmoney.com <\/i>was quoted as saying:<\/p><blockquote>There is a danger in reducing the bankruptcy period to a fixed one year that people may game the system as the term is so short ... The current widespread existence of deep negative equity is temporary and will not persist forever.  With house prices recovering and with more conservative lending, it will probably be rare in a few years' time to find a borrower in deep negative equity.  It's important to design legislation for the long term and not just for today's problem.<\/blockquote><p>I also wish to quote Lisduggan District Credit Union which has stated the one-year term:<\/p><blockquote>would constitute too easy a channel for individuals to enter in order to avoid having to take reasonable responsibility for debt incurred.  In the case of a credit union, such a debt represents other members' savings and it is only equitable that there should be some level of endurance undergone before such funds have to be written off.<\/blockquote><p>From a debtor perspective, while a reduction in the bankruptcy discharge term to one year might seem attractive, bankruptcy retains some severe disadvantages and restrictions and is not to be entered  into lightly.  Proponents of a reduced discharge period cite the increased probability of the bankrupted person retaining the family home, but this flies in the face of the following facts:some 75% of bankrupts end up losing the family home; the bankrupt is a <i>persona non grata<\/i>with banks, will lose his or her bank account and credit cards and is disbarred from seeking credit in excess of &euro;600; the bankrupt's credit rating is effectively destroyed; the bankrupt may lose his or her job due to bankruptcy status and may well be disbarred from seeking certain forms of employment; and the bankrupt may not become a company director for the period of the bankruptcy.  It is clear, however, that reducing the bankruptcy term would not solve the mortgage arrears crisis, despite the impression one might get in listening to some commentators.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Reducing the bankruptcy term is one element of a far wider programme of measures needed to deal with families and businesses in financial difficulty.  Over 38,000 families have been in mortgage arrears for more than two years.  The reality is that bankruptcy will not be a silver bullet for most of them.<br\/><br\/>Earlier this year the Minister for Finance said that of those who had a family home and were declared bankrupt, approximately 70% would lose their home.  They become homeless and have to seek social housing from their local authority as a result.  Bankruptcy may be suitable in certain circumstances, but it is not a solution for the vast majority of households whose primary financial difficulty relates to being in arrears on a mortgage.  What is really needed are proposals to reduce the number of home repossessions to a minimum.  Fianna F&aacute;il provided the Government with a template in the Family Home Mortgage Settlement Arrangement Bill 2014 which would have adapted the under-utilised insolvency service to allow a dedicated mechanism for dealing with the family home.  For four years the Government resisted taking action to remove the bank veto.  The change to the bankruptcy term is a last minute attempt to create a semblance that something is being done.  Families who are struggling to repay their mortgage need far more done to help them to stay in their homes.<br\/><br\/>A new Central Bank report which looks at the causes of long-term mortgage arrears shows that, for those in long-term arrears, the amount by which they have fallen behind in their repayments is increasing in over 80% of cases.  This indicates that there is a large cohort of mortgage borrowers who have not had an adequate payment restructuring plan put in place.  This timely research from the Central Bank clearly highlights that the current approach being taken to dealing with serious arrears cases has not worked and is never going to work.  It is completely unsurprising that high variable interest rates have driven many families into long-term arrears, as they typically end up with a mortgage repayment several hundred euro higher each month.<br\/><br\/>It is also notable that thousands of long-term arrears cases involve a situation where a job loss has occurred or the household has been reduced to a single income since the loan was taken out.  Long-term arrears are also more common in households with three or more children.<\/p><p> Bankruptcy is not a solution for most people in this situation as it could involve the loss of the family home.  The Government should be forcing the banks to put in place revised repayment terms to give a family a reasonable prospect of paying off their mortgage over an extended period of time.<\/p> <p> In particular, permanent interest rate reduction should be used so the monthly repayment is brought down to a manageable level.  The Bill is not a substitute, nor does it deal with the wider issue of rip-off mortgage rates, but it can certainly help families in arrears.<\/p> <p> Split mortgages, where repayment of a portion of the loan is typically deferred for a number of years, have proven to be far more effective in dealing with arrears situations than simply adding the amount of arrears to the outstanding balance.  The Government should force the banks to use this on a far more widespread basis and legislate accordingly if they fail to do so.<\/p> <p> Last month the mortgage repossession figures provided another indication of how the Government is ignoring the escalating home repossession crisis.  Figures show that up to November a shocking 4,440 repossession orders were lodged in the courts.  The banks ramped up their repossession efforts over the past year, with 188 homes repossessed in July to September alone, a 92% increase on the same period in 2013.<\/p> <p> The Government introduced the mortgage-to-rent scheme with the view to keeping people in their homes.  However, the scheme has been a complete failure with only 2.9% of the 98,137 mortgage holders in arrears actually applying to use the scheme.  The success rate of mortgage holders who have applied to the scheme is equally abysmal, with a mere 3% getting through the application process successfully.<\/p> <p> More than 15% of mortgage accounts for family homes are now in arrears, which is more than three times higher than the figure at the end of December 2010.  The most recent statistics from the Central Bank show that a staggering 117,000 principal dwelling house mortgage accounts are in arrears with almost 60,000 of these in arrears of a year or more.  The country is potentially facing up to 25,000 home repossessions next year alone.<\/p> <p> Homeless figures for families have risen fivefold since January alone.  Three families are becoming homeless every single day and 1,570 children are currently sleeping in emergency accommodation.  The crisis will get much worse unless the Government shakes itself out of its slumber and develops coherent policies for keeping families in their homes.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il is supporting the Bill.  I compliment Deputy Penrose who took the initiative and introduced a Private Members' Bill.  I congratulate him on his success in getting the Bill sponsored by the Government in here.  Many other Private Members Bills, which the Government did not oppose on First or Second Stage, have unfortunately been parked and not brought any further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500004#B00200","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500006#D00200","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>While I congratulate Deputy Penrose on his initiative, the Government is playing both sides on many other Private Members' Bills.

This chaotic Government tried to kick this issue to touch for as long as it could in asking the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to look at the issue.  Both committees were emphatic that we had to move to one-year bankruptcy but still months were allowed pass.  Eventually the Government had to accept the demand for a one-year rule.  In its last weeks it has struck the Government that maybe those in debt needed some more protection when struggling against the banks.  This was a novel thought for the Government, but a blindingly obvious one for those of us working with people in debt in the real world day-in and day-out.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that from the day of commencement a one-year bankruptcy term will be available for everybody in the county, North and South.  The use of the boat to Britain to exploit the one-year bankrupt terms there will hopefully come to an end and debtors in Ireland will be able to face up to bankruptcy in our own court systems.  I welcome that a businessman facing bankruptcy in Donegal now has the same rights and responsibilities broadly speaking as a businessman in Derry.<\/p>  <p>  Regardless of any wishful thinking expressed here today, I am under no illusion that this change will be a panacea to the country&rsquo;s still huge debt problem.  Those most likely to benefit are those with larger, more diverse debts.  This is a solution more for the businessperson with many debts, business and personal, rather than for the homeowner whose debt is concentrated in a mortgage on the family home or even in a buy-to-let arrangement.  For those people this move will be of limited use as the Government decided a long time ago that they were for the wolves or even the vultures.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider the facts.  There were 206 repossessions during the most recent quarter, but that does not include so-called voluntary surrenders.  In truth, 422 families lost their homes during this period which was identical to the previous quarter.  That means four families a day are losing their homes.  When these figures were first published in March 2012 the figure was 165 homes for the first quarter in 2012.  Even when arrangements are made with homeowners they are more often than not the most unsustainable kind, such as arrears capitalisation or split mortgages.<\/p>  <p>  Despite recent falls, the number of family homes in arrears of over 90 days stands at 8.7% of the total number of homes.  In March 2011, the number was 6.7%.  That shows the scale of the Government's failure.  The idea of a tough Government making the banks act reasonably is well and truly dead.  We have a walkover Government that has chosen the banks over homeowners and does not care about the social and economic consequences.<\/p>  <p>  My party supports the Bill as a pragmatic step but it is no cure for five years of bad decisions.  It is in fact an admission of failure.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland has failed to be an effective remedy for tens of thousands of families who found themselves in debt after previous Governments and the banks had ruined the economy.  It was supposed to an alternative to bankruptcy.  That we are liberalising our bankruptcy laws here today shows that did not happen.  Like every other measure taken by this Government to tackle the debt crisis it has not fulfilled its role.  The former Minister, Deputy Shatter, told my colleague Deputy Pearse Doherty that 18,000 people would use the insolvency service in its first year.  Even now only 3,000 have made applications.  That is a spectacular failure to deliver on one of the Government&rsquo;s key initiatives to tackle the debt crisis.<\/p>  <p>  In case Government spinners get carried away, the impact even for those who qualify for this new arrangement is likely to be the loss of the family home for many.  That is how bankruptcy works.  A person's assets are evaluated and stripped away leaving the bare minimum.  It does not have to be that way of course.  There should be legal protections for the family home and solutions short of bankruptcy which protect the family home.  However, that is beyond the imagination of the Government.  The banks had to come first.  The law had to be changed to let banks off the leash so they could repossess at will.<\/p>  <p>  Some will suggest the Bill creates a moral hazard.  Some of them will have legitimate concerns about the future operations of our insolvency laws, but many of those shouting about moral hazard are perfectly happy to ignore the greatest moral hazard of the banks the people bailed out now repossessing the family homes of those same people.<\/p>  <p>  The mortgage crisis rages on with four families a day now losing their home.  I hope this step helps prevent some evictions, but the overall pattern is clear.  After five years of belated initiatives and failed pet projects we are now in the dying days of this Government tampering with bankruptcy rules.<\/p>  <p>  We had the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  By October 2015, four years after the scheme was launched only 246 homes had been purchased under the scheme.  Only 7% of the number of families Labour claimed would avail of the scheme have been able to use the scheme successfully.  A &euro;20 million fund set up to help local authorities access the scheme has seen only &euro;6 million drawn down to date.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste set up an independent financial service.  Up to &euro;10 million would be paid by the banks in a scheme where we were told more than 2,000 accountants gave financial advice to people in mortgage distress.  The banks would pay for each consultation with an accountant, which costs &euro;250.  The scheme failed miserably.<\/p> <p> I hope this Bill does help.  My party will support anything that helps struggling homeowners and other stand up to the banks.  It is far too late for thousands, unfortunately, and probably in a lot of cases far too little for thousands of others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500006#D00400","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450179600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I support the Bill.  I do not suppose anybody in this House will say they welcome the fact that we are talking about bankruptcy, several years after the crash, but this is an important initiative.  However, much more is needed.  It is extraordinary that moral hazard did not extend to some of the very large debtors in this country that are visibly back in action without having to go through bankruptcy because a different approach was taken depending on the scale of the debts.  Moral hazard appears to be for the little people.<\/p>  <p>  Many people who got into debt did so because they took risks based on a false premise in the early years of the noughties.  Many businesses took extra credit to upscale and then found when the economy fell off a cliff that the payments could not be sustained.  I spoke to one business person who told me the bank called the company in to talk about how it might put the business back on track.  The bank insisted on getting in an expert to examine the technical arrangements that might improve the income of the business.  The individual was forced to spend &euro;12,000 on that process.  A number of initiatives were identified to improve the business but when the individual went to the bank they were told the bank would not provide funding.  The way back is the problem for many people.  In the case I outlined the business is just about keeping its head above water but the bank was not there to help and support it to grow out of trouble.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the same bankruptcy regime now applies both North and South.  The time difference was important.  It was offensive to see people availing of the opportunity where they could, going to England, Wales and other places where a different regime prevailed.<\/p>  <p>  The main area on which I wish to focus is mortgage arrears.  Approximately 350,000 men, women and children in families in the country are in mortgage arrears and approximately 55,000 of those are in arrears for more than two years.  That does not account for local authority housing arrears, which are also sizeable.  Mortgage arrears in this country are out of kilter with the rest of the European Union, including countries such as Spain, Greece and Portugal.  In part, that has to do with the only options that are available for people to house themselves.  Traditionally, people only had two options; first, to get a mortgage and buy a house and, second, to go on a housing waiting list.  Housing waiting lists have been growing in recent decades so that has not been an option for many, and the option of renting in the private sector has come to the fore as a consequence.  Ironically, it is the least secure and most expensive form of housing at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  What is needed, in addition to a one year bankruptcy for those who, unfortunately, find themselves in that position, because it is not an easy process for anyone, is more than just that &ndash; we need a higher level of intervention if we are to get to the endgame for the families that are affected.  What is necessary is to create a one-stop-shop for borrowers in distress that is free at the point of use and provides expert financial and legal advice and representation.  The last thing people in debt need is to be told to pay for advice.  They are the very people who cannot afford it.  Among the measures we advocate is to equip the courts to refuse possession orders based on the sustainability of the proposed restructure, mandating a set of restructuring options to be considered in all cases and improving access to the mortgage to rent scheme.  Having been involved in a small number of such cases, it is like pulling hen&rsquo;s teeth to try to get them over the line.  One could spend eight or nine months with a family engaged in very dedicated work trying to get it across the line, which is very difficult.  We must increase the sustainability of restructures by redefining them to include consideration of the total debts, including residual debt and payments post-retirement.  Many people in the pre-crash era took out mortgages at a later point in their life than they would otherwise have done.  When their income was reduced, the prospect of going into retirement with a reduced income becomes problematic where there is no prospect of additional income.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that one way or another there will be a cost to the State.  There were seven families in the courts yesterday facing repossession orders.  That happens on a daily basis in the courts in each county.  Some cases are at the end of the process while other people are involved in one hearing after another until they reach the point of no return if their mortgage is not sustainable and other options are not brought into play.  By definition, when a family is made homeless due to repossession they will be quite impoverished anyway or else they would have been paying the mortgage in order to avoid repossession.  Most likely, they will end up getting rent assistance.  In my area, rent assistance is way below the market rent but negotiations take place in order to prevent people becoming homeless.  The typical amount provided in rent assistance is approximately &euro;1,300 a month.  Such families go on a housing list and if the HAP arrangement is in place, they can work, but if it is not they cannot work.  It is stupid not to count the cost of stress because if people do not function optimally one takes away their ability to go back to work and thrive as individuals or as a family.  That is an important element of what needs to be done.  A more comprehensive arrangement must be put in place, in particular for those in mortgage debt because on its own the bankruptcy will not resolve the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform listed six principles in terms of dealing with the mortgage crisis.  They were transparency, sustainability, dignity, equity, protection of Exchequer funds and stimulation of economic growth.  Protection of Exchequer funds means that one does not count the cost, for example, of housing somebody if they end up losing the family home or becoming bankrupt because they will require to be assisted by the State.<\/p><p>In terms of respecting dignity, some of the pressures imposed on home owners by the lending institutions, with respect to their constant rounds of demands, have practically broken home owners' spirits.   Home owners participating in the money arrears resolution process, MARP, got respite, to some degree, from the constant chasing by the banks where those home owners were under pressure and could not meet the costs involved but that is not a principle that was followed by some banks.<\/p> <p> With respect to the sustainability aspect, all of a person's debts must be taken into account rather than, for example, only the mortgage issue.  The totality of people's debts must be examined to ascertain how they can be helped to get to a point where they can have a sustainable future.  <\/p> <p> This is important legislation and I welcome that it is being taken today.  It was initiated, as a Private Members' Bill, by Deputy Willie Penrose.   I echo Deputy Mac Lochlainn's point regarding other legislation.  I introduced a planning Bill, which I considered to be reasonable legislation.  It was not opposed by the Government and was referred to a committee, of which I am a member.  I was persuaded to take that Bill off the agenda on the basis that some of the issues in it would be included in planning legislation to be introduced at a future date.  Not one further i was dotted nor t was crossed in that legislation following its referral to the committee.  That was a waste of everybody's time.  The Government either takes a Bill forward or it does not.  It would be interesting if an analysis was carried out of the Private Members' Bills that have been put forward, into the preparation of which Members have devoted much time.  Those Bills often contain very good ideas - I am not referring particularly to my Bill - that have not been picked up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500007#E00200","speaker":"1202","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450180200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500008#F00200","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1450180200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>On the first day of this D&aacute;il, the point was made that the Government would not have a monopoly on wisdom-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500008#F00300","speaker":"1202"},{"type":"speech","time":1450180200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500008#F00400","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1450180200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>-----but that is the way it has proceeded, pretty much right through this D&aacute;il, when it comes to Opposition legislation.

That dates back to when people were lodged in debtors' prisons for not being able to discharge their bankruptcy.  That stigma still prevails.  One of the submissions suggested that we should stop using the word \"bankruptcy\" and should use a word such as some form of debt relief or something like that.  We all know people and families who have been impacted by bankruptcy.  I know one family which lost their home and are now renting a house.  That family are three years in bankruptcy and it will take another five years to for them to pay off their debts, so they will have a term of eight years.  That period is now being reduced to a total of four years.  A certain amount of that family's income has to go to pay their debt.  Families such as that family will be impacted in a positive way by this legislation in that they will also benefit from the reductions, even though there are currently in the system, with the giving of a six-month lead-in time or that of one year, whichever is the longer period.  I understand that the gross incomes of such families are taken into account when it comes to issues such as the granting of approval for social housing.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, check that with his colleagues because that is not very fair?  I know an individual who went into bankruptcy; he has a good job but his gross income is taken into account, even though his net income is quite low because he has to give so much to pay the debt every month.  Also, where medical cards are concerned, the same applies.  We should examine this aspect of the legislation and examine the impact of bankruptcy on other payments and supports that families have.  Bankruptcy is not easy, whether it is for a term of one year or three years.  One virtually loses everything.  There is a provision in the legislation to safeguard the family home, which I welcome.  It reassigns the home back to the person after a period of time. That is a new provision and many people have not picked up on it.<\/p>  <p>  I note Deputy Niall Collins said that we should not rush into this, that we should take our time and that there should be more debate on it but we have debated this issue.  Two committees - the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality -  have examined it.  We sought submissions on it and received 122.  We held hearings and we prepared an official report on it.  This issue has been examined in detail and at length.  Not everybody who wrote to us was in favour of reducing the bankruptcy term to one year but, on balance, the committee unanimously felt we should reduce it.  We presented our report to the Minister at the start of the summer.  The legislation was produced quite quickly and we are processing it today.  From what I gather, nobody is opposing it, which is welcome.  <\/p>  <p>  My good friend and colleague from Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, said we were not proceeding as quickly as we should be on this.  I have been a Member of this House for quite a while and I think this legislation has been produced quite quickly.  What is proposed in this legislation is not trivial, rather it is quite serious.  Some people have major reservations about what this legislation proposes but the safeguards built into it are quite good.  They go beyond what the joint committee sought.  For instance, in extreme cases, people can have their period of bankruptcy extended by the High Court to 15 years where they do not divulge their full assets and so forth.  That should act as a major deterrent to people who might try to blackguard the legislation in some way or other.<\/p>  <p>  The joint committee observed that a one-year term would encourage the financial institutions to engage more with debtors in reaching meaningful solutions and would encourage further engagement with debt settlement arrangement, DSA, or personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, processes.  We also recommended in our initial report a number of years ago that there should be an appeals mechanism.  At the time, it was felt that we should try it without one but I note that there is now an appeals mechanism involved where the financial institutions veto the arrangements.  I welcome that mechanism.  <\/p>  <p>  The reduced bankruptcy term would pass on the benefits of an economic recovery to all citizens by allowing people with crippling debt associated with credit obtained during the economic boom to move on from that debt.  I note from some observations - I think a previous speaker made this point - that people like Henry Ford, Walt Disney and others went bankrupt at one stage, came out of it and contributed very positively to society.  We want to see people return to economic activity faster than they can at present.  A particular context for this would be the issue of negative equity.  This would bring us in line with Northern Ireland and other common law jurisdictions, which is quite important.<\/p>  <p>  We were told that a family home should be offered a certain element of protection and that is included in this legislation, which is good.  One submission expressed the view that banks may be willing to offer forbearance on mortgage debt for one year while the bankrupt goes through the process.<\/p><p>That is good.  Credit unions said the debt \"represents other members' savings and the debtor undertaking a level of endurance before it can be written off is argued as equitable\".  Bankruptcy is hard, whether it is one or three years.  Once one is in it, one is in it.  We are giving people an opportunity to emerge from bankruptcy in a faster time than in the past, when it was 12 years.<\/p> <p> We are moving away from bankruptcy being seen as a thing of shame.  In the US, people try and fail and then try again.  Others say at least the person tried, had a go, is back again and is benefitting his or her family, himself or herself and the economy and perhaps is employing people as well.  We want to move away from the notion of bankrupts being seen somehow as crooks.<\/p> <p> Many people were caught through no fault of their own because of the economic downturn and ended up facing bankruptcy or other major financial difficulties.  I concur with the Minister's call on people to engage with financial institutions and to seek help early if they are under financial pressure.  We are trying to make it easier for people to do that in the legislation.<\/p> <p> The argument was made to my committee that the official assignee should be given the right to apply to the High Court to discharge the bankrupt earlier and this would occur where he or she had co-operated with the process and there was nothing further to be gained from enforcing the full three-year term.  I am also happy about the appeals mechanism.  There was overwhelming support for reducing the term from three years to one and reducing the associated income payments order from five years to three, which is important and which is also provided for in the legislation.<\/p> <p> On behalf of colleagues on the committee, I am happy to welcome the Bill and to recognise the fact that there was detailed discussion and consultation with experts in the area.  We invited people to make submissions and we received 122 detailed submissions, many of which were personal stories, which we could not use because of the confidentiality involved.  People found themselves in bankruptcy and they had struggled for three years or more.  This is good legislation, which is being introduced at a good time.  I am delighted it will be enacted.  The moral hazard issue has been dealt with as well and I am delighted this recommendation from the committee has been taken on board.<\/p> <p> I congratulate Deputy Penrose on initiating this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500008#F01900","speaker":"978","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450180800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I compliment my constituency colleague for ensuring this legislation was brought forward.

One of the greatest challenges faced by our people from the onset of the global economic and financial crisis was the significant debt that many found themselves engulfed in when the economic tsunami hit the country.  Many people, who had been in a position to repay money borrowed from financial institutions in previous years, found that their income had reduced or disappeared altogether as a result of unemployment.  Unfortunately, the legislative instruments of the State had not developed any capacity since Independence to deal with the kind of debt crisis we all witnessed.<\/p>  <p>  There have been a number of false dawns in the Government's actions to deal with the personal debt crisis, including the utterly impotent Personal Insolvency Act 2012, which left the banks with a veto on proposed settlements by the debtor.

The committee received a significant number of submissions in the area and published a report, which stated there was &quot;overwhelming support for reducing the term&quot;.  I was struck by two submissions by the Association of Personal Insolvency Practitioners, APIP, and the Free Legal Advice Centre, FLAC.  APIP stated:<\/p><blockquote>We believe that where debtors have fully cooperated with the Official Assignee and make a full and honest disclosure of all their assets and liabilities, there is no public good served by delaying a debtor's discharge beyond one year... [T]he stigma of bankruptcy and the restrictions associated with it are onerous and harsh and where the bankruptcy arises from no fault of the debtor or through their misfortune, we believe providing a discharge for the bankruptcy after one year is proportionate.<\/blockquote><p>In a similar vein, FLAC stated: &quot;For consumers, unexpectedly faced with massive, unexpected over-indebtedness, the three year term of being bankrupt is a long one and the label and connotation of bankruptcy can be a heavy burden for them and their families to face.&quot;  It was clear that many stakeholders who made submissions to the committee felt the current regime was too onerous.  It was also pointed out by a number of them that a reduction in the bankruptcy period, as well as a reduction in the terms of income payment orders, would bring Ireland into line with the United Kingdom and, therefore, make our debt restructuring system more competitive.  The legislation, thankfully, follows that line, which is significant.<\/p><p>One of the reasons for Ireland's economic success and for our thriving cultural and social life is the fact that we are a small, flexible and open society and economy acting as a bridge between the US and the EU.  There are many benefits to this.  However, this model also shines a bright and intense light on weaknesses within our economy.  One of those weaknesses includes our outdated legislative instruments for dealing with debt, which place too onerous a burden on those seeking a fresh start.  As a result of the weaknesses in how we dealt with debt, many Irish debtors opted to file for bankruptcy in England instead of the state in which they had most of their business dealings.  European legislation facilitated this easy reorganising of affairs to qualify for UK bankruptcy, often putting businesses here at a loss.  By reforming our laws, we, as a country, will become competitive in how we deal with the business people who find themselves in this tough position and, hopefully, will provide a solution to the problems many people still face here.<\/p><p>It is important, however, to ensure that the new debt restructuring system is not left open to abuse by individuals who are simply seeking to game the system and leave other businesses at a loss.  After all, bankruptcy often leaves other functioning businesses facing bills left unpaid by those granted bankruptcy.  There is a need for the new legislation to ensure those who decide to opt for bankruptcy to show the utmost good faith.  Failure to do so should disqualify them from any settlement under these proposals.  It is up to both the courts and the executive to guard against any abuses which may become apparent following the enactment of this Bill.<\/p><p> We have a duty to all citizens, not only those in debt.  We must offer a path forward for those who find themselves engulfed in debt, while at the same time protect the interests of those hard-working people who engage in businesses across the country and pay their way.  There is a need for a balance to be struck and one area where a balance has not been struck is dealing with the mortgage and housing crisis.  It is unlikely that the Bill will significantly address this problem, yet it appears that the Government is seeking to declare that the mortgage arrears crisis will be resolved through bankruptcy, but nothing could be further from the truth.  The shocking reality is that more than 38,000 families have been in mortgage arrears for more than two years and bankruptcy will not be an effective remedy for them.  In a significant admission, the Minister for Finance stated earlier in 2015 that approximately 70% of those who were declared bankrupt would lose their family home.  They become homeless and as a result have to seek social housing from their local authority.  That policy does not make sense to me or other Members in the Chamber.  By repossessing homes, the banks are simply shifting the problem from their balance sheets to social housing lists, which causes massive distress and trauma for families across the country.<\/p> <p> While there are many things for which the Government can be lauded, its failure in dealing with the problem of housing and homelessness and in the health service will be a black mark against any of the achievements it tries to claim.  While listening to the radio today, I heard that 1,000 children would spend Christmas in a hotel because of the failure of the Government which has prevented the construction of affordable houses in cities in order to drive up NAMA's revenues.  It has slashed local authority budgets, resulting in full social housing waiting lists.  It has sold off thousands of housing units to US vulture funds as citizens sleep rough on the streets.  It has ended the dream of home ownership for many generations with its rules for mortgages and caused many families across the country to be evicted because of its repossession rules.  Its legacy in the area of housing will be to its great shame.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500009#G00400","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450181400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I am glad to make a contribution to this debate.  I welcome the main thrust of the Bill which is to reduce the period of discharge for bankruptcy from three years to one.  I commend Deputy Willie Penrose who has pursued this issue relentlessly in the past few months and also the valuable contribution of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality which is chaired by Deputy David Stanton.  I also commend the Minister for Finance for listening to what needed to be done and bringing the Bill to the floor of the House.  It will bring Ireland into line with many other countries and provides for enough checks and balances to allow those who are totally overburdened by debt to see some light at the end of the tunnel.  At the same time it provides for extended bankruptcy and bankruptcy payment orders where someone is unco-operative or fraudulent.  It will give a break to those who are genuinely trying to make a new start and has the capacity to increase the sanctions for those who fail to co-operate.  It will also abolish the statutory setting whereby a bankrupt person was obliged to attend court after the adjudication of bankruptcy.  Many saw this as a public humiliation.  The net effect will be to allow more families to stay in the family home.  <\/p>  <p>  I have illustrated some of the positive outcomes that will flow from the passing of the Bill.  However, there are a number of anomalies for those who have taken the bankruptcy route under the old system.  I have spoken to a person who has been in the bankruptcy process for five months and will have an 18-month term with three years income payments.  This, effectively, only reduces his term by six months and he believes he is being penalised for being courageous enough to take the bankruptcy route before the term was reduced.  Under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, the ceiling for the debt relief notice has been increased to &euro;35,000 in recent times, but the criteria for access to debt relief notices are too restrictive.  MABS deals with people in this category.  If one has disposable income of more than &euro;60, assets worth more than &euro;400 or a car with a value greater than &euro;2,000, one is not eligible.  These thresholds need to be looked at urgently and increased.  Only 500 debt settlement arrangements were made in 2015, which is too low and strongly suggests banks are vetoing many proposed settlements.  Some 65% of creditors have to approve the settlement.  This figure needs to be looked at again or banks will continue to have a veto.  I welcome the commencement in recent weeks of independent court reviews of the so-called bank veto which allows creditors to reject a personal insolvency proposal.  That issue is being looked at and not before time.<\/p>  <p>  Insolvency was the result of financial madness, not only on the part of consumers but also because of reckless lending.  When the legislation to deal with insolvency was introduced, it was at a time when the banks were insolvent and loss-making.  The legislation was balanced in favour of the banks, which is no longer the case.  There has been substantial recovery in property prices, but it has been confined mainly to urban areas.  Provincial Ireland still has a long way to go to catch up.  Banks lent vast sums of money on an interest-only basis to individuals on the basis of providing security only to purchase rental property.  Unless a financial institution can prove it established the capacity of the borrower to service the debt over a 25-year period and by the age of 70 years, the borrower should be given the option of selling the property and repaying the bank with the proceeds.  In such a case, a large percentage of any shortfall should be written off by the bank as it was clearly caused by poor lending practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500010#H00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1450181400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I welcome the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015 which is being introduced as a result of the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on bankruptcy reform.  The Bill will further improve and modernise bankruptcy law and take into account the changes to bankruptcy law proposed by Deputy Willie Penrose in a Private Members' Bill published in March.  I thank the Deputy for the work he has carried out on bankruptcy law and congratulate him on the amendments and improvements he has made to this very important legislation.  I have no doubt that his contributions have enhanced the Bill.  <\/p>  <p>  The Bill will make many changes to existing bankruptcy law, including the reduction of the bankruptcy term from three years to one in all new bankruptcy cases.  It will provide for those already in bankruptcy for one year when it comes into force to be discharged from bankruptcy after a six-month transitional period.  It will reduce the maximum duration of bankruptcy payment orders from five years to three.  These orders require a bankrupt person to pay specified amounts from their income or assets to the official assignee for the benefit of creditors.  The Bill will enable the bankruptcy term to be extended to up to eight years in cases where the bankrupt person is concealing income or assets or refusing to co-operate with the official assignees.  In such cases a bankruptcy payment order can still be made for up to five years.  In very serious cases of non-co-operation or concealment, it will give the court power to extend the bankruptcy term up to a maximum of 15 years.  It will provide for the bankrupt person's interest in his or her home to be revested in him or her three years after adjudication if the official assignee has not applied to court within the period for its sale.  It will give the official assignee power to disclaim onerous assets.  Under Irish law, he or she is obliged to take over legal liabilities on assets owned by the bankrupt person.  This can result in the official assignee having to cover expensive costs of urgent repairs and make safe unfinished sites at the taxpayer's expense, while the profits from these assets go exclusively to a small number of creditors.  The change will reflect the position in the United Kingdom in order that the beneficiary of the asset will, effectively, take over the liabilities.<\/p><p>As a result of our economic crisis many of those now entering bankruptcy, or already in bankruptcy, have been struggling with unsustainable debt for the past six or seven years.  The background to the economic crisis is the disastrous economic policies of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  A reduced bankruptcy term and shorter duration for bankruptcy payment orders will provide people in serious debt and no disposable income with an early return to normal economic activity.  These changes also constitute a practical boost for entrepreneurs, particularly small entrepreneurs.  At the same time, the proposals include strong measures to ensure that a bankrupt who tries to conceal resources from creditors, or to evade his or her obligations, will be liable to a longer bankruptcy term and a longer bankruptcy payment order.<\/p> <p> Other changes to the legislation will streamline and modernise key bankruptcy procedures and strengthen the powers of the official assignee.  These changes will free up the resources of the official assignee to focus on the small minority of bankrupts in respect of whom there are issues of fraud and concealment.  The changes will also save unnecessary bankruptcy administration costs to the State, creditors and debtors and will free up court time.  The provisions in the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015 complement the reforms which the Government has already introduced, from enactment of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 onwards.  They represent a more modern, less costly, and better balanced approach to a return to solvency for people in debt.<\/p> <p> Before entering politics, I ran an electrical wholesale business.  More than most, I understand the difficulties faced by people who run into financial difficulties, in many cases through no fault of their own.  During my time in business and more recently as a Deputy, I have dealt with many people who have run into financial difficulties.  The amendments being made to the Bankruptcy Act 2015 will help those who cannot free themselves from unsustainable debt.  The changes being introduced will allow those people make a fresh start from the unsustainable debt that up to now has been a noose around their necks.<\/p> <p> I would like to put on the record of the House my support for the amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, which I believe will be a great assistance to those whose debt is unsustainable and want to make a real and genuine effort to break free from that debt.  I also welcome that this legislation will act as deterrent to those who do not want to honour their debts or believe that by hiding their assets they can get away with paying those debts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500010#H00300","speaker":"1068","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450182000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I welcome the introduction of the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015, the central core of which contains the objectives which together with my party colleagues I sought to achieve when I published the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Bill 2015.

I also thank all Deputies who engaged in a synchronised advocacy of the Bill on the floor of this House, led by the redoubtable and knowledgeable, from a financial perspective, Deputy Peter Mathews.<\/p>  <p>  The genesis of this Bill is a conversation at the kitchen table in my home in Ballynacargy one Friday evening with my two daughters, Aisling, who is a solicitor and, Niamh, who is training to be an accountant, both of whom, having listened to me speak about this issue on many occasions, urged me to do something to address it.  <\/p>  <p>  Bankruptcy is no walk in the park.  Nobody who makes the decision to invest money or purchase a property does so with the deliberate intention of going bankrupt.  That is a misconception.  When a person is declared bankrupt the official assignee takes over responsibility for the administration of all of his or her assets and income, leaving that person paralysed in that regard.  The official assignee also takes over responsibility for payment of creditors.  However, security over an asset, namely, a mortgage on a home, is not impaired by the bankruptcy.  Were it taken into account in regard to the bankruptcy, then peculiarly this would be for the better because under section 61(4) of the Bankruptcy Act the official assignee cannot dispose of a bankrupt's home without the permission of the High Court, which court has wide discretion in coming to a decision in that regard and has regard to the requirements and needs of the bankrupt and his or her dependants.<\/p>  <p>  I detest the argument of moral hazard.

Bankruptcy is a matter of public record and it affects a person's future credit rating.

This Government is proud to have overhauled Ireland's bankruptcy legislation, thereby leapfrogging the 20th century and replacing harsh and unforgiving Victorian attitudes - debtors prisons - with the principles of welfare and equal treatment that are the bedrock of the modern Republic that Connolly and Pearse gifted to us with their lives.  The aim of this Bill is to give people a second chance so that they can return to normal economic activity as soon as possible.  We have to move on from the idea of punishing people who engaged in normal economic activity but suffered economic misfortune due to adverse economic circumstances which nobody could predict.  It is vindictiveness at its basic level if we continue down that road.  Had other countries continued down that road, people such as Henry Ford, Abraham Lincoln and Walt Disney would have been denied an opportunity to return to economic activity.  Northern Ireland has not fallen apart because it introduced a one-year bankruptcy rule.  <\/p>  <p>  We have achieved a lot but we need now to address some minor technical amendments, which are self-explanatory, including the re-vesting of ownership in the family home, which proposal my daughters were instrumental in bringing to the fore and which is essential to the psyche of the nation's mental health and self-esteem.  We need to eliminate the wholly unnecessary and embarrassing statutory court sitting and, most importantly, reduce the bankruptcy period to 12 months.  Today, we have the opportunity to stimulate the recovery of the forgotten.  In reducing the bankruptcy period from three years to 12 months we do so not only to align ourselves with modern nations but because it is the right and proper thing to do.  As parliamentarians, it is our obligation to ensure this is done.  <\/p>  <p>  The wording of the The 1916 Proclamation come to mind at this point.  I am reminded that Connolly and Pearse pledged themselves not only to the obvious cause of Ireland's freedom but, as they seized their moment to declare Ireland a Republic and a sovereign State, so, too, did they proclaim and pledge themselves to the cause of the welfare of the Irish people.  This is the cause of the Labour Party also.  It is on the subject of the welfare of the Irish people that I particularly address this House today.  The heroes of 1916 declared the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, to the unfettered control of Irish destinies and, as a nation, to free us from the yoke of usurpation of a foreign government and people.  In that great endeavour, they largely succeeded.<\/p>  <p>  However, for a great many of Irish people - not just anonymous statistics but real families in real communities in real homes across this land - the yoke of usurpation by foreign people weighs heavily upon real people.  That usurpation has worsened with the mass sale of the worth of people's lives to hedge funds and other unregulated entities owned by the very foreigners from whom Connolly and Pearse tried to free us.  I speak today not of foreign governments, because that usurpation has been consigned to history, but about the usurpation of the lives of the people of Ireland by invading hedge funds and unregulated entities who have landed on our shores in fleets of private jets.  I am not here today to make apologies for real people who followed the trusted advice heaped upon them by banks and financial institutions, who while insolvent, pushed money on the people.  As Deputy Mathews has often said they knew what they were doing was wrong. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500011#J01000","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1450182000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500011#J01100","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1450182000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I want to help protect those people from the consequences of the bad decisions and bad advice for which not one of the myriad people who ought to be accountable has ever been held to account.

Perhaps, they are in the wrong sector.  We have allowed ourselves languish in the belief - indeed we have allowed ourselves to be deceived yet again by bankers into believing - that unresolved legacy debt was being addressed.  Through the fog of public relations and spin it seems that little has been resolved.  The bucket has been kicked down the road while banks have strengthened their balance sheets with public moneys and Government support.

Notwithstanding the improvements in the insolvency process and in legislation, this bucket of unresolved legacy debt is now very much full.  The debt has gone nowhere.

Now those distressed people have to start all over again and deal with the new owner of this toxic bucket except this time the owner of the bucket is foreign, alien, unregulated, mercenary and merciless.  <\/p> <p> When we listen to the people involved at the coalface dealing with debt and mortgage distress, we hear their despair at the intransigence of financial institutions that continually fail to face up to reality.

He is right logically, in his mind and in his heart.  He has analysed the situation as it is.  What is meant by bankruptcy?  The banks ruptured this country.  Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to the lending institutions.  They are not lending institutions.  They get a licence to take deposits.  Only when they know how to lend properly can they use those deposits to generate activity and commerce in the economy.<\/p><p>Our banks are measurably guilty at a level of 80% for the asset price bubble on a credit pyramid that went out of control in the seven years from 2001 to 2008 and the &euro;5 million banking inquiry has not even touched on it.  That is how pathetic the inquiry was.  Boards of directors of the domestic banks in this country went way out of control.  They lent all the deposits - the savings of businesses and households - and ramped things up further on a cocaine-fuelled credit pyramid.  They more than doubled the size of the domestic banking economy in five years.  That is woefully guilty conduct.  It left the people victims of the crash and we are now trying to bandage them with a sticky plaster one year bankruptcy term and a hesitancy in clearing the mess up in a manly sort of way.  There is a suspicion that most of them are trying to hide things and are perhaps not being honest.  It is laughable.<\/p><p>I read of the sanctions for non-co-operation or concealment by the bankrupt but the banks concealed everything.  They concealed their balance sheets to such an extent, the last Government gave a blanket liabilities guarantee.  This guarantee now has an easily identifiable residual of &euro;25 billion in the Governor of the Central Bank's office desk.  It is the so-called genius trick of our Minister for Finance to extend the promissory note of ten to 12 years into a long-dated promissory bond.  He had no business doing that.  On 18 February next, I hope Deputy Joan Collins will be vindicated in the Supreme Court.  The Minister for Finance put the people on the line for &euro;31 billion, at the time, without even legislation being passed in this Parliament.  Some &euro;25 billion is still outstanding.  Let us think about that &euro;25 billion.  We should cancel it because there is no validity in it whatsoever.  It has zero validity.

The fact is that they are not well and one brings all the assistance to make them well again.  One does not make them a little well or give them Lucozade when they need surgery.<\/p><p>The Minister stated: <\/p><blockquote>I think Deputies will agree that this Bill represents an important milestone.  [The Bill] comes at the right time.<\/blockquote><p>What a load of nonsense.  That is utterly pathetic.  If the medicine or the surgery does not arrive at the time it is needed, it is a waste of time.  The Government had five years and massive numbers to do certain things.  It did not listen to some of the good ideas on this side of the House.  It did not even listen to its own backbenchers.  I had that experience because I was once in the Fine Gael party.  It did not want to know some good ideas.  It had the monopoly on wisdom.<\/p><p>If the Government really was compassionate for the Irish people, it would take on board those ideas.

The number of people waiting for hospital elective surgeries and procedures stands at 400,000.  I appeal to God almighty.  It is more than the population of Cork.  Schools and universities are threadbare and our universities' rankings are slipping.  We have homelessness.  We have mortgage debt, with 38,000 people in arrears of two years or more.  These are the realities.<\/p><p> It is argued that a relatively small number of bankruptcy cases feature particularly serious and flagrant levels of concealment by the bankrupt, for which there is currently no adequate deterrent.  However, the banks fooled the last Government and are currently fooling this one.  Does the Government believe there has been any serious or meaningful restructuring by the banks?  There has been very little and I know this because I have been involved with a number of cases.  It is a farce.  The banks are out of operational control and do not know what is happening.  The legal divisions of banks are sending correspondence, as are the arrears divisions.  The people who are trying to arrange restructuring do not know where they are.  That is the reality.  I know because I am dealing with it.  <\/p> <p> Bank of Ireland, when it was lining up assets for transfer into NAMA, mysteriously reduced the prospective bill of lading, or transfer, of &euro;16 billion into NAMA to &euro;12 billion.  How in the name of God, back in 2009, could one have a reduction in toxic loan portfolios to be transferred into NAMA?  Anyone with even half a brain or half a day's experience in loan ledger management would know that it is impossible but the bank did it.  Why?  It was done because &euro;4 billion at the then prospective discount rate of 30% amounts to &euro;1.2 billion and that was the reduction of the requirement for recapitalisation which kept Bank of Ireland out of State majority control.  The bank fooled us.  It fooled us again when a consortium of five investors bought 35% of the bank for &euro;1.1 billion.  That was stupid.  I told the Taoiseach at the time not to proceed but to pause.  Wilbur Ross, who was a genius in his own interests, made &euro;0.5 billion profit on his little proportion of that consortium.  It was a one-way bet; he could not have lost.  What genius allowed that to happen?<\/p> <p> The Government should reorder its priorities and put the people of Ireland first rather than the establishment and the vested interests.  However, it must do its homework because it has not done it yet.  If the Government had done its homework, it would know what to do.  The Government has failed, for instance, to send notices of assessment to the multi-national corporations on their profits which have been increasing since 2008.  That would have been pushing an open door but the Government did not do it.  It was afraid of its own shadow and was pathetic.  It was prepared to allow banks to beat up small family businesses while shivering at the prospect of the multinational corporations leaving.  Those corporations are now paying that money and the Government is scratching its head and asking where the extra corporation tax is coming from.  The corporations know the game is up and that they have to pay it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500012#K01200","speaker":"1183","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450183200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Your time is up Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500013#L00200","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1450183200,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Penrose on bringing forward this Bill  It is a great achievement but it is just-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500013#L00300","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1450183200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Deputy Mathews, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500013#L00400","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1450183200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>What a waste of time.

He is determined and is like an elephant who digs himself in and refuses to move.  In that, he has taught me a great deal about what one has to do to achieve anything in this House.  Deputy Penrose is driven by the Labour Party ideal that people should be treated fairly and equally and with the support of our parliamentary party, he was determined that he would progress matters for people who are in the unfortunate position of being bankrupt.  As I observed the situation in the past few months, I began to wonder if he would succeed because for a long time Deputy Penrose and the parliamentary party seemed to be knocking their heads against a brick wall.  That brick wall is in the Department of Finance and in the permanent government's unwillingness to accept change.<\/p>  <p>  A critical element in moving this Bill forward was the fact that Fine Gael backbenchers, through their involvement with their constituents also realised that a serious issue had to be addressed.  It took a great deal of pressure from the Labour Party's parliamentary party and the Fine Gael backbenchers to move the issue forward.  It is so important that this Bill is before us now, for the reasons outlined by Deputy Penrose earlier.  It will put people in a situation where they can begin to live their lives again.  It also demonstrates the importance of backbenchers in this Parliament.  We have our ears to the ground in a way that the permanent government does not.  We know and understand the situation that many people are facing.  In that context, it is important that more space be given to backbenchers to promote bills of their own.  While I welcome the Bill before us, it should have Deputy Penrose's name on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500013#L01400","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speech","time":1450183200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500013#L01500","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1450183200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>The Chief Whip has admitted the need for further parliamentary reform so that backbenchers, whether on the Government or Opposition benches, who bring Bills forward can progress them in their own name.

We must reach a point where it is accepted that a backbencher with a good idea can progress a bill through this House on its own merits.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is designed to alleviate the hardship and suffering of thousands and families in this country who, in most case through no fault of their own, got themselves into financial difficulty, egged on by the banking institutions.  It is very important that this Bill be enacted as soon as possible.  The fact that it has been so difficult to deliver points to the need for greater influence from the floor of this Chamber.  It also points to the very important role that the Labour Party plays in this institution.  It is important that a party driven by an ideology which demands equality for people is well represented in this Parliament, both now and in the future.<\/p>  <p>  I congratulate Deputy Penrose and thank the Minister for Justice and Equality for bringing forward this legislation and I hope that the lives of many people - this Christmas and thereafter - will be greatly eased by it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500013#L01600","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speech","time":1450183200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Joe O'Reilly, who is sharing time with Deputies Se&aacute;n Kyne and Regina Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500013#L01700","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1450183800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I congratulate my good friend and colleague, Deputy Willie Penrose, on his courageous and far-seeing work.  He pioneered the Bill which is his achievement.  He has been working on it for a long time and brought all of his professional skills to it.  Well done to him for this reforming and excellent legislation.<\/p>  <p>  There are three reasons the Bill is good.  First, it will encourage creditors and banks to engage more with debtors in voluntary arrangements.  This will be its greatest achievement in that the banks, faced with the prospect of having to allow bankruptcy, will engage with people in a meaningful and proactive way and people will have a chance to restructure loans and work them out.  Second, it will reduce bankruptcy tourism.  Where I live along the Border there are many people who travel to Northern Ireland to be declared bankrupt.  There are also many people who travel abroad.  Third, the Bill will allow people a second start.  This is very much part of the culture in America and other countries in that people who fail once are not deemed to be a lifelong failure.  The likelihood is that their failure will educate and give them the wherewithal to succeed a second or third time.  The risk is that the Bill will make bankruptcy an attractive option, but it never will be.  In a small country like Ireland people will for trading purposes try to avoid bankruptcy and the opprobrium that goes with it.  The disincentive to enter into bankruptcy remains but the advantages to be gained in getting people out of it quickly will be achieved.  <\/p>  <p>  It is a great achievement on the part of Deputy Willie Penrose to pioneer the Bill which will have massive advantages for the economy in future years.  I support it and applaud my colleague for his pioneering work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500014#M00100","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1450183800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm cupla focal a r&aacute; maidir leis an mBille seo.

Some 80% of the 135,000 jobs created by entrepreneurs were created in small Irish SMEs.  Fostering entrepreneurship is a very important part of job creation, as is acknowledging failure.  People can sometimes make mistakes and things do not always work out.  My old accountancy teacher used to say we should never be ashamed to fail in business.  A punitive bankruptcy regime does not foster job creation.  The Bill provides sanctions for those who evade their responsibilities and do not co-operate in the bankruptcy or conceal income or assets from creditors.  It is important that it not be an easy process and that it be monitored.  Entrepreneurs will be encouraged to develop new and existing businesses and the Bill may also help in dealing with the psychological issues and stress caused by the process of indebtedness.  We have all come across this in our constituencies in dealing with the problems faced by homeowners.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation is certainly very welcome.  I commend all those involved, including the Government, for bringing it to this stage.  In particular, I acknowledge Deputy Willie Penrose for the work he has done on it.

I have to say how genuinely I admire my the stubborn colleague in the House because, for me, this is probably the most significant legislation we will have passed in the past five years and there has been some powerful legislation enacted in that time.  I am very grateful to Deputy Willie Penrose for tenacity and stubbornness which have ensured the Bill is before us in order that we can vote on it.<\/p>  <p>  We have had discussions on this issue before.  As a Deputy for the past five years, one of the most difficult things I have had to do on behalf of constituents is deal with banks, the left arm of which does not know what the right arm is doing.  I am being gracious in saying this because some of the more sinister elements of the activities of banks in some cases are tantamount to illegality.  One State-owned bank will be before the Circuit Court on 26 January to deal with allegations that it hired private investigators and illegally bought information from State bodies.  Some of their activities are despicable.  The Bill will give people an opportunity to have some breathing space to take care of their debts.  They are probably in debt through no fault of their own.  I do not often agree with Deputy Peter Mathews, but I agree with what he said today.  It does not matter what the cause of the debt is; what matters is that the outcome for everybody and what is wanted by Members of this House is recovery.  This legislation will give tens of thousands of people an opportunity to seek recovery and I wholeheartedly commend it.  I say, \"Well done,\" to Deputy Willie Penrose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500014#M00300","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1450183800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I, too, commend Deputy Willie Penrose on the work he has done on this Bill, about which we had very long conversations at different stages.  In his contribution he mentioned the kitchen table.  Very good ideas often come from it and often some very strong family decisions are made at it.  The ideas expressed in the conversations that took place at that kitchen table found their way into the legislation, for which  I commend the Deputy, as well as for his hard work.<\/p>  <p>  I also thank the justice committee for the work it has done in this regard.  It reviewed a significant number of submissions in a very speedy manner.  I thank all Members of the House.  It is a mark of the quality of the Bill and the co-operation received from Independent Members and all of the major political parties that the legislation has been dealt with in such a speedy manner.  That a sense of hope and relief will be given to those in bankruptcy will strengthen the hand of those individuals in financial distress.<\/p>  <p>  Many Members mentioned the element of stigma attached to bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy is always hard on the individual and his or her family.  It is always a hard decision to enter it.  Even with this Bill, no one will make a decision to be declared bankrupt easily.  It is a very stressful time.  Deputy Willie Penrose has mentioned the impact it has on families.  There is no shame in it because the only shame is in not trying.  We should ensure those who try to set up a small business will have an opportunity to try again if they are unfortunate enough to go bankrupt.  We have to make sure we develop an economy that assists entrepreneurs.  If they are unfortunate enough to go bankrupt or run into economic problems, they should be in a position to try again.  Deputy Willie Penrose and many other Members of the House have reminded us about the many people who went bankrupt in other societies but came back and built thriving businesses that employed many thousands.  I have no doubt that unfortunate investors and entrepreneurs who have gone bankrupt will come back, reinvest in the economy and once again give great hope.<\/p>  <p>  The reduction in the bankruptcy term from three years to one is very significant.  It is a fundamental change which follows the recommendation of the Joint Committee of Justice, Defence and Equality.  I again pay tribute to it for its work under its Chairman.  The change will ease the impact of bankruptcy on individuals who have been struggling with unsustainable debt on a much reduced income for several years.  The provision for the revesting of the family home where it has not been sold within three years is another practical and humane solution. on which Deputy Willie Penrose and other Members remarked in their contributions.<\/p>  <p>  While I do not have time to deal with all of the contributions made, one point that is significant is that people - 135,000 - are going back to work.  This is where I disagree fundamentally with Deputy Peter Mathews.  It is not a fig-leaf for any family that a family member has gone back to work.  We inherited a situation where 500,000 people, or 15.1% of the working population, were unemployed, but the figure is now back below 9%, which is significant.  We have rebuilt a crashed economy.  Today we will launch 79 new social housing units.<\/p><p>Tonight, Dublin City Council will announce 1,300 new developments in the city alone.<\/p> <p> I agree society faces many challenges.  The provision of housing is a significant challenge, as is improving the health service.  However, the main challenge faced over the past five years has been the economy and the need to get people back to work.  That issue had to be addressed and the Government has done that.  I thank the Chair for allowing me this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500014#M00400","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450184400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1450184400,"counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500015#N00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450184400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 16, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450184400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1450184400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I wish to again thank all of the Deputies who have supported this Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500015#N00600","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450184400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450184400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 2 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions - Priority Questions","time":1450184700,"counter":99,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500016#T00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","time":1450184700,"counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500016#T00250"},{"type":"question","time":1450184700,"counter":101,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[44873\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500016#T00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the status of the timeline to connect all premises under the national broadband plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1450184700,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Before getting to this question, I am astonished that a priority question I submitted relating to mobile telephone coverage throughout the country was disallowed yesterday.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2014, I published a national high-speed coverage map for 2016.  The areas marked in blue on the map represent those areas that will have access to commercial high-speed broadband services.  Those marked in amber show the target areas for the State intervention.  All premises within the amber areas will be included in the State's intervention.  The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high-speed broadband services by the end of 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention.  The high-speed map contains a breakdown of premises covered per townland.  It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30 Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.  Consumers may also consult the websites of the various commercial operators to ascertain details of current and planned future deployment intentions.<\/p>  <p>  Over 40 responses were received following the publication of the national broadband plan proposed intervention strategy last July.  Non-confidential versions of these submissions are being published and can be accessed on the website.  In the meantime my Department continues to review the technical and financial detail relating to potential new commercial investment proposals.  I expect to proceed to formal procurement before the end of this month.  The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within three to five years of the contract award.  In this context, the national broadband plan proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high-speed services by 2018, with an ambition of 100% coverage by end of 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500016#T00700","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1450184700,"counter":106,"content":"<p>There are a number of issues relating to this.

The first was the publication of the map, splitting the country into areas that the commercial sectors would look after and the rest of the country, in which the State would have to intervene.  I said I would do that in November last year and it was done at that stage.  I stated at that stage that we would bring forward the full and detailed strategy, including technical, financial and legal aspects, that needed to be dealt with and it would be published in July 2015.

There was a document with the word \"strategy\" on it, but it was not really a strategy.  As a result, I fully supported the Government when it decided to come up with an energy strategy.  I am looking forward to seeing what is included in the White Paper tomorrow and would love to have a sneak preview of it tonight.  One essential feature of such a White Paper which sets out the Government's vision for the future is the role semi-State bodies such as Coillte, the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na might play in future energy policy because they have a great role to play in energy generation from renewables.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500016#T01500","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450185300,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500017#U00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1450185300,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I also thank the Deputy for his comments and wish him well.  My engagement with him has been always very satisfactory and I thank him for his unfailing courtesy.  He has always addressed the issue, not the man, for which I thank him.<\/p><p>The Government has supported a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy, many of which have been successful in encouraging a shift towards using more renewable energy by semi-State companies, including Coillte, ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na.  The renewable energy feed-in tariff schemes support the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies, including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind.  These schemes are open to all interested parties, including relevant semi-State companies. <\/p><p>The ESB has a long history of successfully delivering hydro power, made significant progress in divesting much of its older inefficient thermal plants, is building its renewables portfolio based primarily on wind energy and has established an investment fund tasked with sourcing, evaluating and executing appropriate investments in technologies with breakthrough potential in renewable energy generation.  I also welcome the company's commitment to decarbonise its generation activities by 2050.<\/p><p>Bord na M&oacute;na is also making good progress in the renewable energy space and I understand the company is aiming to develop wind farms on land that was previously used for peat production.  I was pleased to see in October this year that Bord na M&oacute;na published its Sustainability 2030 report, which outlined its plan to replace its use of large-scale peat production with alternative energy sources, including biomass, wind and solar energy by 2030.  Many of the technologies identified in the report will be eligible for support under the new renewable support schemes under development by my Department.  It is also important to note that EirGrid and the ESB are co-ordinating effectively to ensure the timely connection of increasing levels of renewable generation from all interested parties on the national electricity grid.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.  <\/i><\/p><p>My Department is in the process of designing a new renewable heat incentive scheme to encourage an uptake of renewable energy in the heat sector and also working on the introduction of a new renewable electricity support scheme.  Both new schemes are expected to go live at the end of 2016, subject to Government approval and state aid clearance, and will be open to all interested parties. <\/p><p>In the transport sector it is my intention to continue to support the deployment of sustainable biofuels through increases to the biofuels obligation scheme.  The first such increase will take effect on 1 January 2016.  The scheme has successfully incentivised an uptake in the use of biofuels in Ireland in both the semi-State sector and the private sector and will continue to do so.<\/p><p>In October 2014 my Department published a draft bioenergy plan in which a number of actions were outlined specifically designed to support the uptake of renewable energy.  The draft plan contains measures to stimulate and support the supply of Irish biomass in the coming decade.  In this regard, the key recommendations include continued support for the afforestation programme, the continuation of the bioenergy scheme for energy crops and the establishment of Bioenergy Ireland, a joint venture between Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte.

I understand the contract for the unconventional gas exploration and extraction research programme was awarded following a robust evaluation process.  The evaluation panel included personnel with the capacity to make informed decisions on the six tenders received.  The constitution of the evaluation panel was approved by a broadly-based steering committee. <\/p>  <p>  The evaluation panel found that the tender led by CDM Smith Ireland Limited provided the best response and a contract was awarded to the consortium in August 2014.  The consortium includes commercial consultancies, academics, a geological research institution and a legal firm, each offering a particular specialism required by the project's scope, as was detailed in the terms of reference.<\/p>  <p>  The project team was expected to include members with a comprehensive understanding of geology and hydrology, as well as an in-depth knowledge of a range of legal, environmental, health, socio-economic and technical issues, with a knowledge of mineral and fossil fuels.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there has been some comment on the fact that, internationally, CDM Smith has provided expert advice for oil companies involved in the development of unconventional gas resources.  I should point out that it has also provided advice for State bodies and regulatory agencies across its area of expertise.  As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, it is common for a broad range of parties to seek to draw on the specialist expertise available from a firm such as CDM Smith.  The fact that disparate entities seek to draw on such expertise is generally seen as an indicator of a company's recognised experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500019#W00700","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1450186500,"counter":145,"content":"<p>One of the reasons I came to the D&aacute;il was to have fracking banned anywhere in Ireland.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<\/p>  <p>  Last November, I published a national high-speed coverage map for 2016.  This map is available at the broadband website.  The areas marked blue represent those areas that will have access to commercial high-speed broadband services.  The amber areas show the target areas for the State intervention.  All premises within the amber areas will be included in the State's intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high-speed broadband services by the end of 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention.  The high-speed map contains a breakdown of premises covered per townland.<\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that there will be speeds of at least 30 Mbps.  I emphasise that it is at least 30 Mbps because occasionally this is misreported or misunderstood as being up to 30 Mbps.  It is not up to 30 Mbps but speeds of a minimum of 30 Mbps will also be delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.  In other words, it will be future-proofed.  Consumers can also consult the websites of the various commercial operators to ascertain details of current and future deployment plans. <\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, my Department continues to review the technical and financial detail relating to potential new commercial investment proposals.  As I indicated earlier, I expect to proceed to formal procurement before the end of the year.  The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within three to five years of the contract award.

This is not without its challenges, as I have said, particularly in the areas of heat and transport.  The potential of the bioenergy sector to make a significant contribution in this regard is well recognised.  I published a draft bioenergy plan in 2014 which was, in part, designed to capture this potential through the development and introduction of measures to encourage the growth of Ireland&rsquo;s biomass and bioenergy sectors.  One key demand-side measure identified in the plan was the introduction of a renewable heat incentive, RHI.  Following analysis of various options, including increased carbon taxes, the option with the least modelled cost is an appropriately focused renewable heat incentive targeted at larger commercial and industrial heat users, at least in the first instance, and not at the domestic sector.<\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">  As part of the process to design an effective RHI scheme, my Department published the first of three consultations in July this year to identify a range of technologies in the heating sector.

It is clear that the contribution will be solely driven by the commercial sector and the large industrial users and it seems that those are the sectors the Department is targeting in terms of incentivising production.  It is vitally important that we meet the heat targets set.  The Minister pointed out that we are only reaching 6.6% of renewable energy production through the heat sector.  We need to target domestic users.  There are more than 2 million homes in this country, the vast majority of which are heated by fossil fuels - by oil and gas.  If we are serious about achieving the targets and getting buy-in from the public in terms of tackling climate change and meeting our renewable energy targets, the Government needs to incentivise domestic users.  There are organisations around the country, such as the Donegal woodland owners co-operative which are developing models and market streams for wood as a fuel for households, and they would benefit greatly from a domestic incentive that would encourage more farmers to go into the area of forestry, develop it and create jobs in the rural sector.

I understood that was the point the Deputy was making with respect to a cut at the larger users and I apologise if that is not what he meant.  He is right about the domestic sector in that we need to incentivise it.<\/p>  <p>  The analysis we carried out suggested that it would not be cost effective at this stage to include the domestic heating sector in the RHI scheme.  This is due to a number of factors, including the much higher support tariff per kilowatt hour of energy that would be required to incentivise households to change heating systems as well as the significantly greater cost associated with administering the scheme for a large number of households in what is an unregulated sector compared to the approximately 3,000 or so commercial and industrial installations envisaged for the scheme.  However, there is much we can do in the domestic sector.  Electricity has a role to play.  Traditionally, we have shunned the idea of electric heat, for reasons that we all understand, in that we regard it as expensive and so on.

On Friday, I visited Carrick-on-Shannon in County Leitrim and Cortober in County Roscommon to witness the devastating effects of the Shannon floods on homes and businesses.  I met with representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, local hoteliers, shopkeepers, publicans, householders and visited a number of local businesses.  I commend all of those people, including the local council, who made a huge effort to put up sand bag defences and other preventative measures.  One man whose business, the cineplex, has been closed as a result of the floods pays &euro;23,500 yearly in rates and provides much needed local jobs.  He cannot obtain flood insurance, neither can other business, many of which are also closed.  I met with residents from St. Patrick's Park who are penned in by flood water.<\/p>  <p>  The people I met are deeply upset by the lack of strategic planning by the Government on a problem which they say is entirely predictable and preventable.  Some of the issues raised with me include the urgent need to fast-track the catchment flood risk assessment and management programme.  The need for consultation with local people who have knowledge and expertise of flood patterns is a critical and often neglected part of this.  They raised the abolition of the regional drainage boards which means the responsibility for cleaning Shannon tributaries is now left to underfunded local councils, which has resulted in an absence of sustainable draining systems.  Despite various appeals, the Government has refused to allocate funds for land drainage schemes in the Shannon regions which should include the utilisation of callow and natural floodplains.  No single agency is responsible for the management of the River Shannon.  Will the Taoiseach give full responsibility to the OPW for management of the Shannon?  Will he establish a State-funded insurance scheme for households and businesses that are affected by flooding and cannot get flood insurance, which they have not been able to get for some time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500024#BB01600","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1450189500,"counter":239,"content":"<p>With all the people Deputy Adams met in Carrick-on-Shannon, it looked to me as though he was canvassing but I understand that is not the case.  In any event, it does not take from the stress and pressure on people in private houses or businesses when floodwaters come.<\/p><p>Last week the Government reactivated the &euro;10 million humanitarian fund for private house owners.  It is now available through the community welfare office system.  The Government has also put together a &euro;5 million compensation fund for small businesses with fewer than 20 employees.  The requirements in terms of access to this funding are that the dates during which the premises were flooded and the rateable valuation of the property must be authenticated by a local authority engineer.  An initial sum of &euro;5,000 can be sought and paid before Christmas, with the opportunity, if the flooding is really bad, to claim a further &euro;15,000 in compensation duly authenticated and validated by way of invoices and so on.  That is the immediate response.  I agree with Deputy Gerry Adams's remarks on the services and volunteers who have slaved day and night.  I saw first-hand during a visit last Sunday to Foxford, Ballina and Crossmolina the full impact of the flood waters.  <\/p> <p> The Deputy's proposal regarding a single authority for the River Shannon has been around for many years.  It is not possible to do it, given that statutory authority for the River Shannon rests with a number of bodies, including the ESB, the OPW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and many fisheries, tourism, commercial and local authority interests.  While the proposal may sound wonderful, in public discussion the co-ordination required has thus far proved to be exceptionally difficult.  I agree with the Deputy that the Shannon is a slow moving river and that it drains 40% of the country.  The implications for people living below the Parteen weir in terms of the efforts being made to minimise flood damage speak for themselves.  The Government has set out a ten year strategy.  There are 300 locations included in the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, in respect of which flood defences need to be provided, 66 of which are located along the River Shannon.  While there is no single authority with responsibility for it, it will be possible to identify under the CFRAM programme which authority bears responsibility and what should be done, bearing in mind that in some instances there will be an overlap of responsibility between authorities.  <\/p> <p> The arterial drainage programme of the 1950s and late 1960s is finished.  There is no longer a need for arterial drainage.  The system was put in place for agri-purposes, based on three to five year projections.  Flood defences are supposed to last 100 years.  I refer the Deputy to what happened in Carlisle where almost &euro;40 million was spent on flood defences that did not work.  It is important, therefore, that we get it right.  I commend the practicality of the OPW, for instance, in Clonmel where it raised the barriers under the flood relief scheme, which has proved very successful.  I sympathise with people on the damage done to their houses and businesses.  The Government has, at least, responded quickly by providing some immediate relief.  The the longer term plan, under which almost &euro;500 mill be spent in the next six years on the putting in place of, I hope, flood defences that will address any future issue, is being drawn up by the OPW.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500024#BB01700","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450190100,"counter":241,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has said it is not possible to set up a single authority with responsibility for the management of the River Shannon.

The problem is that successive Governments, rather than being proactive or strategic, have been reactive.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has mentioned that a &euro;10 million humanitarian fund and another emergency fund of &euro;5 million have been provided.  However, as a result of cuts to the OPW's flood risk management programme, flood relief has been reduced by &euro;15.6 million, which means what the Government is giving by way of the funds mentioned amounts to only &euro;6,000.  As a result of climate change, extreme weather events will get worse.  Events which may have occurred only every 30 or 40 years will now happen every five years.  The Government needs to face up to this and plan for it in a strategic way.  Many of us have seen first-hand the serious problems with which people have to deal.

Those whose homes and businesses are flooded cannot wait because the river continues to rise and the current defences are inadequate.  The Deputy has seen the pictures of the thousands of acres of areas under water.  While some flexibility is provided for in the farming sector in terms of the movement of animals, flooded slurry pits and so on, the main issue concerns how we are going to deal with the flooded areas in a pragmatic fashion.

The Taoiseach will probably have seen for himself the many family farms, slatted sheds and fodder damaged by flooding.  Septic tanks, on which people had to pay a &euro;5 levy following the introduction of legislation in January 2011, have also been damaged.  I have learned in the past few days that the cost of repairs to damaged septic tanks which are registered but outside the 5% required to be inspected annually will not be met by the council or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The people concerned who abided by the law introduced by the Government in 2011 will have to meet the cost of repairs to their septic tanks, only because they are not included in the 5% of septic tanks required to be inspected annually under EU law.<\/p><p> Will the Taoiseach clarify if a family farm which is affected, whether it is its slatted shed or fodder, is considered a business?

The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is sitting next to the Taoiseach.  We have the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Each organisation is blocking the other and the OPW, with the best will in the world, is going around in circles.  It is trying to play happy families with everyone but it is being blocked.  For once and for all, can we take the bull by the horns?  Will one body with the authority to carry out relief works for flooding, dredging or whatever, without every obstacle possible being put in its way, be made responsible for the rivers?  Will family farms receive payment under the SME scheme?  Given the septic tank legislation, will a payment be made to those who are not in the 5% category?

This includes all 11,500 km of channel, 700 km of various embankments and associated scheme bridges, sluices, weirs, pumping stations and so on.  Deputy Fitzmaurice is well aware that the suitably equipped hydraulic equipment does not gouge out new channels but removes, where maintenance is carried out, silted-up areas and sediment that becomes lodged due to currents in rivers.<\/p>  <p>  It is obvious that farming is a business.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his Department recognise that fact, which is why particular flexibility has been shown in respect of the agrisector in this regard.  Deputy Fitzmaurice knows that farmers are the first to come to each other's rescue.  All over the country, where farmers get into trouble, their neighbours and community come to assist in terms of fodder, moving of animals and other issues such as flooded houses.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy knows from his previous existence the difficulties that can arise when one gets tangled with a Department or State authority.  I am not saying that to the Deputy's detriment as he is entitled to his opinion.  However, when one multiplies it by a plethora of statutory authorities, the important point is that the Office of Public Works, instead of glad-handling everyone, as described by Deputy Fitzmaurice, has identified 300 areas, 66 of which are on the Shannon.  It will identify who is responsible and who should carry out the works required.  This might be more effective than hoping to find a single entity, which would take years in court hearings and legal challenges from one statutory authority to another, some of which have been around since before the State was founded.  The situation is not as simple as is suggested.  The problem is that rivers rise when rainfall increases and the Shannon is a slow river-riser in that sense.  People are now in dread of bad weather over the next week or so and I hope it does not happen, but there is a serious ongoing programme in place.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice will also appreciate that when flood defences have to go into Athlone, Galway, Ennis, Fermoy or elsewhere, they have to be done right.  There is no point in putting up something that is haphazard or ill-thought out.  The hydrological surveys will also have to have been carried out.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that many older people have great experience of drainage patterns and that experience should be called into account when the Office of Public Works or anyone else looks at land or tributaries that should be drained.  Older people and farmers will say that for 50 years an area did or did not flood.  In so many cases, commercial developers said they knew how to drain an area but that is not how it turned out.  All that experience should, in our common interest, be used and applied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500026#DD00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1450190700,"counter":253,"content":"<p>We are coming to the season of goodwill so I ask the Taoiseach to clarify two simple issues for me.

Over the past 12 months we have probably heard more about rural crime than we have ever heard before although an analysis of the figures shows that crime is a problem in our urban areas as well.  It is good to hear the Taoiseach proposes to convene a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform to look at the Garda Inspectorate report.  The report throws up hugely significant issues which go to the heart of our decades old policing system.  The issues are implicitly critical of the current and previous justice Ministers, including justice Ministers from my party, in so far as they presided over a bureaucratisation of the policing service.<\/p><p>The public, to some extent, is way ahead of politicians in terms of how it views the policing service.  If one talks to people in Mayo, Kildare or Dublin, one will hear that they want garda&iacute; to be highly visible on their streets, housing estates and country roads.  If there is an incident in their home or business, they want to be sure that when they lift the phone there will be an expeditious response from garda&iacute;.  The reality is, however, that we have allowed a system to develop whereby large numbers of garda&iacute; are tied down by office duties, bureaucracy, court attendances and a multitude of other duties, many of which could be taken on by civilian staff, thereby allowing garda&iacute; to go back on the beat, to work in communities and to be more visible than they have been in recent years.  The Garda Inspectorate in its recent report estimated that 1,500 garda&iacute; could be freed up for this type of duty, with 250 identifiable straight away.  In that context, the report is making a point with which many members of the public would concur.  Does the Taoiseach envisage the Cabinet sub-committee on justice addressing this particular issue and being in a position to do something about it?  <\/p> <p> A report on recidivism published by the CSO in recent days highlighted a recurring problem with young male offenders in particular, who return again and again to a life of crime.  It is quite clear these people are not gaining anything from their incarceration within the prison system, albeit that there is a training and education service available to them.  It must be noted that our prison service is particularly expensive.  It costs in the order of &euro;70,000 per annum to incarcerate a prisoner.  Many of those who have become involved in a life of crime can be identified at a very early stage in life.  Those involved in the education system, for example, are able to identify, at a very early age, children who are at risk of ending up in prison later on and yet we have not been investing as a State in the early intervention that is needed.  The home school liaison programme, the school completion programme and guidance counselling have all been negatively impacted by cuts made by this Government and previous Governments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500026#DD02200","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450191300,"counter":273,"content":"<p>The Deputy is straying a little now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500027#EE00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1450191300,"counter":274,"content":"<p>We are talking about crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500027#EE00300","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1450191300,"counter":275,"content":"<p>We are supposed to be talking about the Cabinet sub-committee on justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500027#EE00400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1450191300,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I will come back to the issue at hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500027#EE00500","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1450191300,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500027#EE00600","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1450191300,"counter":278,"content":"<p>We have seen the closure of 139 Garda stations.  We were told that this would allow greater flexibility and that garda&iacute; would be more visible, active and high profile but in reality, that has not happened.  One also wonders what is happening with those 139 stations.  The buildings were all of some importance in their local communities.  In Kildare, for example, we saw three Garda stations close and I heard a debate on local radio this morning about one such station in the village of Ballitore.  The local community has asked that the building be made available to be used as a community facility.  Are these the types of issues that can be discussed by the Cabinet sub-committee on justice?  Can the Taoiseach envisage the Government giving an instruction to the Garda authorities, the OPW or whatever body is responsible to bring these buildings back into use?  Given the current housing crisis, some might provide suitable accommodation to those in need of housing while others might be usefully converted into community centres.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to refer to the drugs problem, which the Taoiseach must accept is at crisis point in both rural and urban areas.  Often when we speak about drugs, we talk about our cities and large towns but we all know that the drugs problem is afflicting every town and village in rural Ireland.  I recently visited a small housing estate of about 40 houses in my constituency.  There are three heroin addicts living in the estate which is causing all manner of anti-social behaviour connected with the sale of drugs.  Dealers are trekking in and out of the estate, selling drugs and trying to recruit others into addiction.<\/p>  <p>  There is a host of issues on the justice agenda.  Will the Taoiseach give us some indication that they will be tackled in the period ahead?  I would like to see the Cabinet sub-committee on justice meeting on a more regular basis so that the recommendations in the report from the Garda Inspectorate and the findings of the report on the prison service could be acted on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500027#EE00700","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1450191300,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Crime is an issue for everybody and is always of concern.  I agree that it is important that garda&iacute; are visible in local areas.  Following a period of economic constraint, things have begun to move in a more positive direction.  The Garda training college in Templemore has reopened, with 600 recruits due to go through next year.  These new recruits come from a variety of backgrounds.  Some have worked in different jobs for a number of years while others are married with families.  Garda recruitment used to be confined to the younger age cohort but that is no longer the case.  This gives us a better mix of people wishing to serve in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of garda&iacute; on the beat is important.  People love to see garda&iacute; in their communities, on bicycles or walking around.  This is part and parcel of good connection with the community.  Why would we train garda&iacute; and remunerate them to do their job if they end up walking through communities, not knowing who people are?  That kind of connection and communication is really important for garda&iacute; and I am very glad to see that it is now happening all over the country.  I know of one location where garda&iacute; will drive their car to point X and then walk around within a couple of miles of that point.  They call to all of the houses in the area, identify themselves and obtain information on family members and so forth.  <\/p>  <p>  I will deal with the Garda Inspectorate report presently but as Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l knows, the Government set about putting in place an independent policing authority which represents the single greatest shake up in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the foundation of the State.  The legislation provides for the appointment of a new policing authority to oversee the police functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and has been dealt with.  The consultations that took place were very extensive and were generally in line with the general scheme of the Bill which was published in November 2014.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality considered the general scheme in the course of the pre-legislative scrutiny process and broadly welcomed its proposals.  Following its legal establishment, which the Government signed off on today, Ms Josephine Feehily, former chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners, will be the chairperson of the new policing authority.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is making arrangements for the eight ordinary members of the authority to be appointed and they will also be designated on an interim basis.  These posts were advertised through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  A total of 97 applications for the eight positions were received.  The PAS interviewed all applicants and then put forward 17 names for consideration.  The PAS has also run an open competition to fill the positions of chief executive and head of legal and governance affairs for the authority and those appointments will be announced shortly.<\/p><p>It will take effect on 1 January.<br\/><br\/>The Garda Inspectorate's report is to be considered by the committee very shortly.  At that meeting I expect to see both the Garda Commissioner and the head of the governance authority, Mr. Olsen.  There are issues in the report that need to be teased out and talked about openly and frankly and on which one hopes we can have clarity and agreement about the structure and the strategy.  <br\/><br\/>When I read a report that states there is a lack of confidence and trust among civilians working in the justice system, I want to know if this is true.  From my experience of local Garda stations in different places around the country, that is not the case.  They work very well with inspectors, superintendents and chief superintendents, as the case may be.  Civilians who have been properly trained free Garda personnel who have been trained to do a different job, an issue raised by Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l.<br\/><br\/>There is the question of how the amalgamation of districts would work.  Within the Garda, from the Commissioner down, there is openness and a willingness to engage in the interests of the community and the job garda&iacute; have to do, which, as we all know, can be fatal and difficult in many circumstances.  The committee would like to engage with Mr. Olsen and the Garda Commissioner to follow through on these issues.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l raised the question of Garda station closures.  Yesterday I attended a meeting with the chief superintendent for the western region which includes counties Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, Longford and Westmeath, as well as with all of the chief Garda personnel and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  It was a very open and frank discussion.  Where rural Garda stations were closed, many of the buildings were more than 100 years old and not even acceptable to the local community.  The important point is that while the station might close, garda&iacute; will still be <i>in situ<\/i>in the community.  However, rather than sitting there for two hours on a Tuesday or a Friday waiting for unemployment assistance forms to be signed, garda&iacute; have the capacity to move through the community to call on older people to give out their cards and so on.  In addition, garda&iacute; made the point that superintendents, the real powerhouse in the system, together with inspectors and sergeants, attended community councils on a regular basis to talk to them and ask what the issues were.<br\/><br\/>It is a point of fact that the incidence of burglaries and crime in the west has fallen, the result of greater visibility in the community.  It is also a fact that the Government, with meagre resources which are getting a little stronger, was able to provide vehicles and proper equipment for garda&iacute; and put &euro;200 million on the table for proper IT equipment in order that the TETRA system would work everywhere and the new communications systems would allow garda&iacute; to be available and receive information from communities at first hand.<br\/><br\/>I recentlyu attended a security presentation by garda&iacute; on the supply of different equipment for houses.  A well concentrated and well resourced community text alert scheme is very important in any community in order that information on person or vehicle X or Y can be communicated and responded to very quickly by a community which is alert and vigilant.<br\/><br\/>From what I heard yesterday from chief superintendents, superintendents and inspectors, the engagement of garda&iacute; with communities is up-front, which is to be commended.  That is another matter about which we would like to talk to the Garda Inspectorate in the context of putting together a structure fit for the 21st century, in particular the next ten, 15 or 20 years.  I said to the Garda members that it was not just about looking at the next two or five years but about the kind of Garda force we wanted to see in ten or 20 years to ensure it would be capable of meeting the new demands in dealing with criminality, drugs, burglaries and so on.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l referred to burglaries.  Operation Thor which has been introduced and provided for has been of great benefit to garda&iacute; who have actually been calling to the houses of criminals who have been convicted and released on bail and, if they are not available or not adhering to their bail conditions, are in difficulty.  Obviously, it is a multi-strand anti-crime campaign being conducted by the Garda.  It has been in planning for several months and was launched as a follow-on to recent announcements of investment in policing and to coincide with the advent of the long winter nights, which is always a cause of concern.  It includes a range of activities to deal with burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders.  I heard about one offender, a drug addict who had committed five or six burglaries, who had been put away having been apprehended because of the capacity of Operation Thor.<br\/><br\/>The measures include high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot spots.  It is not true to say all burglars come from one area of the country.  There are also, if one likes, home-grown individuals who get involved in burglaries in their own regions.  It is important that communities be aware of this and transmit information quickly to the Garda.  High-powered vehicles have been provided for garda&iacute; and there are the new regional response units.  I was very glad to hear the chief superintendent talk about the exceptional driving courses for garda&iacute; in order that they would be at a standard much higher than that of the normal driver.  There have been efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market and programmes to help reduce the level of reoffending by prolific offenders.  A high-powered national crime awareness campaign is also under way.  All of these measures are important.<br\/><br\/>Some &euro;34 million has been invested in Garda vehicles since 2012.  Some 640 new vans, cars and jeeps have become available this year, including some high-powered vehicles for armed Garda units.  There has been important investment in airborne surveillance under the capital programme for 2016 to 2021.  Garda&iacute; are, therefore, being equipped with the best technology and information systems.  Some &euro;205 million is to be spent over the lifetime of the plan.  This will give the Garda greater capacity to respond to this activity, about which we are as concerned as communities.<br\/><br\/>The moratorium on the recruitment of garda&iacute; has been ended.  Some 550 garda&iacute; have been taken in and a further 600 will commence training next year, all of whom are young people.  <br\/><br\/>The Garda works well with the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na T&iacute;re and other community organisations.  It is involved with alert programmes, in the ongoing work of the metal theft forum, the Crimestoppers campaign, the highlighting of the theft of livestock and animals, the new TheftStop initiative in respect of farm equipment and, of course, the highly successful Garda text alert schemes.  These are some of the things that are being done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500027#EE00800","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450191900,"counter":281,"content":"<p>First, let me extend best wishes to the newly appointed chairman of the Policing Authority and its soon to be appointed members.  However, I also express my concern that the new authority will not be truly as independent as it might be.  I welcome the Taoiseach's indication that the Cabinet sub-committee on justice reform will consider the Garda Inspectorate's report.<\/p><p>That report, Changing Policing in Ireland, is another wake-up call for the Government on the problems of policing in the State.  It has concluded that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is top heavy, inefficient, defensive, bureaucratic and resistant to change.<\/p> <p> Ten years ago the D&aacute;il passed legislation requiring the establishment of a Garda code of ethics, but that code remains in draft form.  It might be useful to discover whether the Cabinet sub-committee on justice reform has discussed this issue.  In recent years the Garda Inspectorate has made 11 recommendations on operational supervision, but only two have been implemented.  Again, it might be useful to discover whether this issue was discussed by the Cabinet sub-committee.  The new report proposes 81 changes and each recommendation is given a timeline to be implemented.  We are told many of these changes could be delivered on a low or no cost basis.  It is obvious reform is needed and the report's recommendations appear to be common sense.<\/p> <p> The inspectorate has also concluded that when resources are cut, front-line policing is adversely affected.  A series of public meetings have been held, mostly in rural Ireland, on the impact of burglaries and theft on farms.  There has been a huge public response to these meetings, nowhere more so than in County Louth where two brave garda&iacute;, Adrian Donohoe and Tony Golden, were recently murdered.  At a meeting I attended in Ballymascanlon the issues affecting people were raised.  They included fuel laundering and the dumping of toxic sludge, but burglaries and the theft of farm machinery and livestock were particular issues.  There is huge anger at the lack of Garda patrols and the closure or reduced opening hours of Garda stations.  This is a particular issue in Border regions because criminals use both the motorway network and the Border to make their escape.<\/p> <p> Following the murder of Garda Tony Golden, additional Garda resources have been allocated in County Louth.  This has had an immediate effect and I welcome the arms find in Jenkinstown.  The move has also had the effect of disrupting criminal behaviour in the region.  However, the additional resources are only temporary and have been provided from the resources provided for counties Cavan and Monaghan.  Therefore, the gain for the community in north Louth following the killing of Garda Tony Golden represents a loss for counties Cavan and Monaghan.<\/p> <p> In a previous discussion on the Cabinet sub-committee on justice reform here I suggested the new Garda authority should go into neighbourhoods and communities to listen to citizens as a means of building confidence.  I know from experience in the North that the Patten process did this and that it played a crucial part in winning support for policing proposals and a two-way understanding of policing with the community and the community's responsibility to support the police.  When I raised this issue previously, the Taoiseach said it seemed to be a good idea and that it would be discussed at a meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee.  Will he report back on what happened?  <\/p> <p> The 2007 inspectorate report recommended the devolution of greater autonomy to Garda regions, but that has not happened.  There was particular concern at the time about the provision of front-line services.  I note that front-line services have been undermined because of cuts made.<\/p> <p> The idea of policing with the community is at the core of the report and part of the mission statement of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, we do not have enough community garda&iacute;.  Of the 540 community garda&iacute; assigned across the State, some 328 are in the six Dublin metropolitan regions.  It is good that they are there and to be welcomed, but rural communities do not have a proportionate number of community garda&iacute; and some have none at all.  Im one third of the State there are no full-time community garda&iacute;, while in 14 rural divisions there are ten or fewer.  <\/p> <p> The report has also found that too many fully trained garda&iacute; are sitting behind desks.  It suggests at least 1,500 and possibly up to 2,000 fully trained garda&iacute;, at least 500 of whom are in Garda headquarters, could be taken out of offices to police the State. <\/p> <p> This is a comprehensive document and I commend the members of the inspectorate for their efforts.  The big test is whether the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will implement the recommendations made.  Also, when the Cabinet sub-committee on justice reform has had an opportunity to discuss the report, will the Taoiseach report back to the D&aacute;il on its deliberations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500028#FF00200","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450192500,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I will be very happy to do so and the D&aacute;il shall have an opportunity to discuss the report also, as it is of interest to everybody.<\/p>  <p>  The new Garda authority represents a radical break from what has applied for 80 or 90 years because it will be tasked with overseeing the performance of the Garda Commissioner in a wide range of policing services.  It will also develop a key role in the future appointment of senior Garda management.  It will have to approve a three-year strategy statement and the annual policing plan that are to be submitted to it by the Garda Commissioner.  Also, within 12 months, it will establish and publish a code of ethics that will include standards of conduct and practice for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Over and above this, it will hold a quarterly meeting in public to engage with the community.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the authority will be enabled to request the Garda Ombudsman, GSOC, to investigate any policing matter that gives rise to a concern that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings.  It may also request GSOC, subject to the consent of the Minister, to investigate any behaviour of the Garda Commissioner in the context of his or her functions in policing matters.  It may request GSOC to examine practices or procedures in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a policing matter and can request the Garda Inspectorate to initiate an inspection or inquiry into aspects of the operation or administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in so far as they pertain to policing powers.<\/p>  <p>  The question is often asked as to whether the Policing Authority will have real powers.  The answer to that question is yes, it will.  It will have the power to hold the Garda to account, with senior Garda management reporting to the authority, including at public meetings.  It will determine Garda priorities in policing services and nominate persons for appointment by the Government to the posts of Garda Commissioner and deputy Garda commissioner.  It will appoint persons to the rank of Garda superintendent, chief superintendent and assistant commissioner and be responsible for removing them for reasons related to policing services.  It will also appoint persons to senior positions within Garda civilian staff.  These are all important powers that the new, independent Policing Authority will have.<\/p>  <p>  These proposals have been prepared in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure they are entirely constitutional and take into account the full remit of the Constitution.  In particular, consideration has been given to Article 28.<\/p><p>Under Article 28, as interpreted by the courts, there are restrictions on the extent to which it is open to the Government to delegate important functions relating to the Executive power of the State to another body.  Overall, the proposals for the policing authority are designed to strike the right balance between on the one hand, the exercise by the authority of effective and meaningful oversight of the policing functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and on the other hand, the retention by the Government of essential residual powers in policing in accordance with what is appropriate under Article 28.  It took a deal of discussion and clarity before that could happen.<\/p> <p> An important issue to be dealt with in the Bill is national security, a vital component of government.  The Garda Commissioner of the day will continue to account fully to the Minister and to the Government on security matters.  The question was asked as to whether the Garda Commissioner will account to the policing authority on national security issues and the answer is \"No\".  As national security is a vital function of government, it is proposed that under the new oversight arrangements, the Garda Commissioner will report to the policing authority in respect of policing matters and to the Minister for Justice and Equality with regard to security matters.  These are important and serious areas of evolution for the new Garda authority.<\/p> <p> As Deputy Adams rightly points out, the Garda Inspectorate report makes 81 recommendations and is 380 pages long.  Five headings of the recommendations are under structure, operational deployment practices, enabling organisational change, effective use of human resources and financial, information technology and other resource practices.  Some of the key recommendations include, for example, changing the organisational structure to one that is leaner at senior management level, providing more garda&iacute; for front-line duties.  There is an idea that more garda&iacute; could be released for front-line duties if we provided for further civilianisation, and this goes back to my response to Deputy &Oacute; Feargh&aacute;il's question.  What is the level of trust and confidence between the structure and those who work as civilians in the system?  Personally, I find they appear to work very well but the report indicates that this is not the case in some instances.  That issue needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p> It also indicates that the number of Garda regions should be reduced from six to three.  That could be a difficult cultural issue to accept.  There is some residual evidence to suggest that where it was attempted to amalgamate regions or districts, there was still adherence to the old district boundaries, and those districts that were amalgamated might not be as effective as they should be.  Perhaps it takes a period for that culture to become fully understood.  There is a recommendation about the possibility of over 1,000 or 1,500 fully trained and experienced garda&iacute; going on front-line duties.  The same thing might apply in a different sector, with members of the nursing profession graduating after having done courses X and Y.  When they get promotion, they might not be involved with direct nursing, for which they were trained, and they could instead be on administrative duties.<\/p> <p> There are a number of recommendations in this designed to improve accountability, leadership and supervision.  There is a requirement to develop a new divisional policing model that would put communities first and more garda&iacute; on the front line.  That will probably be reflected in the report to be brought forward shortly by the Garda Commissioner.  She will present a report to the Minister on changing structure for the running of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That will be an important consideration from the Commissioner's perspective.  I hope the engagement between the inspectorate, the Commissioner and the Cabinet sub-committee will yield beneficial results.<\/p> <p> There has always been a question about rosters and whether there is more or less time to be able to deal with these issues.  It all points in the direction of having a strong economy that can provide the resources to deal with justice and policing issues in the time ahead.  That is all the more reason it is important that the recovery under way would be maintained in a competent and progressive fashion, so the strength of the economy can be released to deal with these issues, whether they relate to education, health, policing or defence, etc.  We live in a very different world than we used to and it is all moving at a very fast speed.  Our garda&iacute; need to be properly resourced and have all the facilities.  They need upskilling or training and they need communication systems that will be fit for purpose.  The structure, which is the subject of a major report, should be looked at and discussed openly and frankly in the interests of having it lean, effective, professional, competent and forward-looking.  As the Deputy states, it should engage with the community.<\/p> <p> It is always the fact that when people telephone the garda&iacute;, it is a question of who they know or who they will call.  Is there a number and is it manned?  Will there be a response?  In the recent fortnight, people in the communities have come out day and night to help their neighbours.  There is an enormous willingness to participate in the proper running of our country.  There are text alert schemes and engagement by superintendents and the inspectorate with the community councils and civilians.  People talk about the issues in the past month, the provision of closed-circuit television cameras or how people can be vigilant about what goes on in communities, whether urban or rural.  This is all in everybody's interest.  There is a fear of burglary and other crime that sends older people to bed at night very frightened, and clearly we do not want that.  There is a changing nature to burglaries, with farm equipment and livestock being targeted.  Farms have been open to everybody over the years but that has now changed.  There is confiscation or disruption of materials, including metals, from farms and isolated units.  This is part and parcel of the challenge of the world in which we now live.  GPS locators can be attached to equipment and material and if one is lucky enough, one might find out to where something is gone.<\/p> <p> I assume we will have an engagement and the report will be back here so we can have the D&aacute;il discuss it and people can give their views.  It will be a useful engagement and I look forward to hearing both how the inspectorate will present its report, how the Garda Commissioner will respond and how the political and departmental representatives on the committee reflect on it.  It is all in the interests of having a proper structure that is fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500029#GG00200","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450193100,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I wish to raise three justice issues that the justice sub-committee should seriously address, if it is not already considering them.

I have some questions about the Cabinet Committee on Health.  The Taoiseach told us some time ago that this committee was going to drive forward reform as identified in the Fine Gael manifesto and the programme for Government.<\/p><p>The universal health insurance process was the major plank of reform the Government identified, together with the abolition of the Health Service Executive but given that it has now abandoned the universal health insurance objective and while continuing to describe the HSE as a failure, it has failed to abolish it, what is the Cabinet Committee on Health achieving?  Does the Taoiseach accept that the reform programme has been exposed as nothing more than a recipe for massive charges to the public and worse services in many areas of the health service?  What are his views on the new idea of the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, that the health service should be run through health trusts and that management of health services might be privatised in circumstances where delivery does not meet his view of what it should be?<\/p> <p> The Minister for Health is generally regarded as a very talented member of the Cabinet and the public welcomed his appointment to the Department of Health, expecting that he would deliver radical reform.

The long-term view is to have a single universal health care system but I have to admit the method by which the Government was to do this is no longer accepted as valid because it was too costly, as identified by the report of the Economic and Social Research Institute.  The Government will not proceed with that particular model.  As I have said in response to previous questions on primary care, community care, the fair deal scheme and the provision of local facilities, we have followed through on those in a very big way, overseeing the introduction of general practitioner cards for children under the age of six and adults over the age of 70 and moving on to the children under 12 years of age of working families.  We have also focused on a healthy Ireland with initiatives in the preventive medicine area, activity levels, opportunity for so many people to have healthier lifestyles, be it in respect of food, drink or whatever.  The Deputy must have noticed the publication of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 last week in respect of advertising alcohol given the damage that can cause.  Changes will be made such that it will not appear around schools or children.<\/p>  <p>  We need more investment in the community primary care facilities.  That is another reason to ensure a continuation of the strong recovery taking place.  Most importantly, we need to invest in infrastructure, the recruitment of nurses and doctors and non-consultant hospital doctors.  I gave the Deputy figures on that today.  We also need to invest in the facilities.  Last week Deputy Martin asked about the accident and emergency unit in Galway.  The Minister for Health gave him a detailed reply.  It is part of a major expansion of the hospital facilities in Galway and the various pieces of equipment there.  While it is not as one would wish, it is part of a major reorganisation of the facilities at that hospital.  We need a strong economy to be able to drive continued investment in such areas.<\/p>  <p>  What questions did Deputy Adams ask?

Given the consistent and horrendous flooding families have been experiencing in recent times, will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government is investigating the implementation of a Bill similar to the UK Water Act 2014?  This matter was raised in the House last week by my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  As the Taoiseach knows, such legislation would allow home owners and businesses in areas prone to flooding to obtain insurance cover at a reasonable price.  It would also require the State to be directly involved in a joint approach.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that something is happening in that regard?  We heard some positive soundings on the matter from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney.  Will the Taoiseach also confirm the type of insurance model that will be introduced for persons who have been adversely affected by the floods?<\/p>  <p>  As regards the Constitutional Convention's outstanding reports, the Government has accepted recommendations on the holding of referenda on blasphemy, reducing the voting age and the setting up of an electoral commission.  For several months many Members have been raising these issues and we were given firm assurances that we would have an opportunity to debate the three outstanding reports before Christmas.  However, that has not come to pass.  Is there some prospect that these matters will be prioritised if we return in January?  All of us but particularly the citizen members were enormously proud to be given an opportunity to participate in the convention.  It is  a considerable disappointment, therefore, that the House has not adhered to the timelines the Taoiseach himself set for us to consider all of these reports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500033#LL01000","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1450194900,"counter":328,"content":"<p>To respond to the Deputy's first question, I have already said a memorandum of understanding has been signed for quite some time between the Office of Public Works and the insurance companies.  The purpose is to share information on flood risk and how it might be factored into the commercial assessments made by insurance companies.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has referred to the necessity to put in place a much more sophisticated weather forecasting and flood warning system which would be of benefit to everybody, including business premises, private dwellings and the agri-sector.  I have given a commitment that the issue will be looked at, but what was introduced in Britain would not be suitable here because houses completed since 2009 were left out, as were small businesses.  In Bandon, Athlone, Crossmolina and elsewhere most of those affected are small shopkeepers and other retailers.  One cannot have a situation where they would be left out.

I understand the public sector standards Bill and the planning Bill were brought before the Cabinet today.  The public sector standards Bill deals with the replacement of the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The objective of the planning Bill is to establish a so-called independent regulator, but, in this case, the regulator is to be answerable to the Minister.  An Teachta Brian Stanley has published a planning and development (amendment) Bill today to provide for genuinely independent planning regulation.  While I do not have any expectation that the Government will support the Bill, nonetheless, it highlights the serious flaws in the Government's Bill.  Were the public sector standards Bill and the planning Bill considered this morning and, if so, when will they be published?<\/p>  <p>  Last week I raised with the Taoiseach the Government's failure to publish a report on breaches of planning rules in six councils, a report which has been sitting on the desk of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government since July.  The review was set up almost three years ago after the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, had scrapped planned inquiries into planning irregularities.  When will the report be published?  If it is published before the Christmas recess which seems unlikely, may we have a debate on it, if not before Christmas then at the first available opportunity after the D&aacute;il resumes in January?<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the health information and patient safety Bill is to legislate for better governance in respect of health information and patient safety.  I recently met the mothers of a number of young women who had received the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil.  I understand that last night TV3 broadcast a distressing documentary on the health consequences for almost 140 young women who had received the vaccine.  The mothers I met had had great difficulty in obtaining information, which is why I am raising the issue.  The health information and patient safety Bill will make it easier for citizens to obtain all the knowledge they deserve to have.  I understand the European Medical Agency has cleared the vaccine for use, but it is equally clear that a substantial number of young women and their parents attribute their illness to it.<\/p>You have chosen to ignore me when I bring up valid-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500033#LL01400","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1450194900,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I am not ignoring the Deputy.

It was inspired by the battle of an exceptionally brave Irish woman, the late Marie Fleming, who while in the final stages of multiple sclerosis took a landmark challenge to the Supreme Court on Ireland's legal ban on assisted suicideShe lost that battle but the Chief Justice said in the case at that time there was nothing in the judgment to prevent the State from introducing legislative measures with appropriate safeguards to deal with such cases as hers.<\/p><p>This well thought-out Bill contains exactly those safeguards, setting out strictly monitored criteria to allow a person in abnormal suffering to choose a dignified pain-free death surrounded by loved ones, rather than to continue to endure their excruciating torture with no quality of life, often completely incapacitated and in an unconscious state and then to die an horrendous death.  We are talking about people who in their most desperate moment of life are being deprived of their humanitarian rights.<\/p><p>I know this issue is a taboo with many Deputies but it is already being debated throughout Europe.  Euthanasia or assisted suicide is already legal in Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland.  It is an ethical issue this country will have to address sooner or later.  People are living longer with the result that the rate of chronic illness is on the rise.  The need to legislate for dying with dignity, as proposed in the Bill, is also being widely debated in Irish society.  Various opinion polls during the current D&aacute;il estimate that approximately seven out of ten people would be in favour of assisted suicide for people suffering with a terminal illness.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann must enter the debate and when we do we must leave religious dogma at the door.<\/p><p>I anticipate concerns about the Bill from many Deputies and I wish to make clear that it proposes clear protection for vulnerable people.  Two separate medical practitioners are required to examine the qualifying person and sign a valid declaration that their decision is voluntary and they have an incurable and progressive illness which cannot be reversed by treatment and which is likely to lead to their death.  A third independent witness, who is not a beneficiary of their estate, must also testify that the person has a clear and settled intention to end their own life when their illness becomes too much to bear.  At all times safeguards must be met to show the terminally ill person has reached their decision on an informed basis and without coercion or duress.  Furthermore, no doctor will be obliged to participate in an assisted death if he or she has a conscientious objection.<\/p><p>This is a complex, not to mention contentious subject.  I welcome debate from all sides when the Bill comes up for discussion.  I have spoken to many Deputies on all sides of the House who have spoken about compassion and have told me that if there is a free vote they would consider voting for the Bill.  Every one of us strive for, require and desire a quality of life but we also strive for, require and desire a quality of death.  That is what the Bill is about.  We should not leave competent human beings to suffer intolerable and horrible pain if the person in question wants to exit this life.  Suicide has been decriminalised but we still criminalise a person who assists somebody who is terminally ill to die.  That is unfair, inhumane and against the human right of the person who wants to exit this life of their own free will because of immense and intolerable suffering.<\/p><p>If the Bill is debated in the new year I urge Members to show compassion when debating it.  As ever, I respect the views of everyone in this House.  Everyone has a right to a proper debate and to speak without abuse.  My father suffered a stroke eight years ago and had a terrible existence.  He was incontinent and he could not swallow.  Solid food had to be liquidised and liquids had to be solidified yet he fought to live.  People who fight to live and want to survive should be given the opportunity and all the help they require but a small percentage of people are unable to bear the suffering and they also should be allowed to have a dignified death.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500034#NN01300","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1450195500,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500034#NN01400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1450195500,"counter":378,"content":"<p>No.  Deputy Halligan's Bill is not opposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500034#NN01500","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450195500,"counter":379,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1450195500,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500034#NN01700","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1450195500,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500034#NN01800","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450195500,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1450195500,"counter":383,"content":"<p>When will the Bill be published?

It was inspired by the battle of an exceptionally brave Irish woman, the late Marie Fleming, who while in the final stages of multiple sclerosis took a landmark challenge to the Supreme Court on Ireland's legal ban on assisted suicideShe lost that battle but the Chief Justice said in the case at that time there was nothing in the judgment to prevent the State from introducing legislative measures with appropriate safeguards to deal with such cases as hers.<\/p><p>This well thought-out Bill contains exactly those safeguards, setting out strictly monitored criteria to allow a person in abnormal suffering to choose a dignified pain-free death surrounded by loved ones, rather than to continue to endure their excruciating torture with no quality of life, often completely incapacitated and in an unconscious state and then to die an horrendous death.  We are talking about people who in their most desperate moment of life are being deprived of their humanitarian rights.<\/p><p>I know this issue is a taboo with many Deputies but it is already being debated throughout Europe.  Euthanasia or assisted suicide is already legal in Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland.  It is an ethical issue this country will have to address sooner or later.  People are living longer with the result that the rate of chronic illness is on the rise.  The need to legislate for dying with dignity, as proposed in the Bill, is also being widely debated in Irish society.  Various opinion polls during the current D&aacute;il estimate that approximately seven out of ten people would be in favour of assisted suicide for people suffering with a terminal illness.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann must enter the debate and when we do we must leave religious dogma at the door.<\/p><p>I anticipate concerns about the Bill from many Deputies and I wish to make clear that it proposes clear protection for vulnerable people.  Two separate medical practitioners are required to examine the qualifying person and sign a valid declaration that their decision is voluntary and they have an incurable and progressive illness which cannot be reversed by treatment and which is likely to lead to their death.  A third independent witness, who is not a beneficiary of their estate, must also testify that the person has a clear and settled intention to end their own life when their illness becomes too much to bear.  At all times safeguards must be met to show the terminally ill person has reached their decision on an informed basis and without coercion or duress.  Furthermore, no doctor will be obliged to participate in an assisted death if he or she has a conscientious objection.<\/p><p>This is a complex, not to mention contentious subject.  I welcome debate from all sides when the Bill comes up for discussion.  I have spoken to many Deputies on all sides of the House who have spoken about compassion and have told me that if there is a free vote they would consider voting for the Bill.  Every one of us strive for, require and desire a quality of life but we also strive for, require and desire a quality of death.  That is what the Bill is about.  We should not leave competent human beings to suffer intolerable and horrible pain if the person in question wants to exit this life.  Suicide has been decriminalised but we still criminalise a person who assists somebody who is terminally ill to die.  That is unfair, inhumane and against the human right of the person who wants to exit this life of their own free will because of immense and intolerable suffering.<\/p><p>If the Bill is debated in the new year I urge Members to show compassion when debating it.

My father suffered a stroke eight years ago and had a terrible existence.  He was incontinent and he could not swallow.  Solid food had to be liquidised and liquids had to be solidified yet he fought to live.  People who fight to live and want to survive should be given the opportunity and all the help they require but a small percentage of people are unable to bear the suffering and they also should be allowed to have a dignified death.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500035#NN01300","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1450196100,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500035#NN01400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1450196100,"counter":461,"content":"<p>No.  Deputy Halligan's Bill is not opposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500035#NN01500","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450196100,"counter":462,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1450196100,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500035#NN01700","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1450196100,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500035#NN01800","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450196100,"counter":465,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Access to Public Services and Banking other than by Electronic Means Bill 2015: First Stage","time":1450196700,"counter":466,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500036#OO00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1450196700,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to ensure that services provided by public bodies and banking services are accessible by persons who are unable to access such services through information systems and to ensure that access to banking is provided to persons unable to operate an automatic teller machine.<\/blockquote><p>I seek to introduce a Bill to provide access to public services and banking other than by electronic means.  There was a good deal of controversy some time ago when a particular bank proposed to limit banking transactions of under &euro;700, which is quite a sum of money, to automatic teller machines, ATMs.  Thankfully, that bank has withdrawn its plan to do so in the short term but one would wonder if it was an expedition on its part to assess public reaction, wait a while and bring back the proposal.  That proposal would cause great distress, particularly if it was replicated by other banks.  <\/p><p>It is a time of the year when we think of the elderly, of people who are alone and people who may not be in a position to help themselves.  There is a large number of people, typically, but not only, elderly people, who are not able to use ATMs and bank cards, who find that the only way they can avail of banking services is over the counter and who rely on that personal touch.  They may simply be too old now to learn to use an ATM, the use of which, I presume, most Members of this House would take for granted.<\/p><p>Similarly, there is an increased movement towards providing public services through the Internet.  When people ask how to apply for a service, they are told they will find the relevant application form on the Internet.  People pay their local property tax online; it is very hard to pay it over a counter.  There is an increasing tendency to pay online.  This Bill proposes to ensure that people are able to avail of banking services over the counter and also to avail of public services over the counter.  <\/p><p>A Bill to provide for persons with a disability was introduced in 2005 to ensure persons with a disability could access public services, that there would be a person in every branch office who would ensure that persons with a disability could access public services.  Essentially, this Bill uses similar terminology and makes a similar proposal, namely, that all public services would ensure that persons who could not use or are unable to access the Internet would still be able to avail of public services, be they those provided by a Department, a county council, an organisation of the State or the Revenue Commissioners, and ensure that people are able to interact, for example, with the Revenue Commissioners over a counter, or pay bills as they fall due over a counter as opposed to having to use the Internet to make bank transfers because a large number of people cannot do that.<\/p><p>While I accept there is an additional cost involved for banks in providing banking services, face to face, and for public services to provide a service for people who cannot use the Internet, there is a reason they are trying to drive increasingly more business, more customers, more members of the public, in the case of public services, to the Internet.  Nevertheless, it is essential for this State to ensure such access for people, typically those who are elderly, people who are living alone and do not have a relative to help them.  I have discussed this issue with many parishioners and friends and they have told me that they have ended up doing increasingly more transactions for their parents who are elderly and who are not able to use the Internet.  They are happy to do so, as am I, but at this time of the year in particular, we should think of people who do not have a son or a daughter or a relative who can do transactions on the Internet or who they might not trust with a bank card to go an ATM and withdraw money or pay a bill on their behalf.  That is the purpose of this bill.  I thank the Acting Chairman for the time afforded me to introduce the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500036#OO00200","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1450196700,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500036#OO00300","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1450196700,"counter":469,"content":"<p>It is not being opposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500036#OO00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1450196700,"counter":470,"content":"<p>Good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500036#OO00500","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450196700,"counter":471,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1450196700,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500036#OO00700","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1450196700,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Assuming the Government will not sponsor the Bill, I have no alternative.

It provides for the appointment of an independent planning regulator.  The importance of having a planning regulator with real powers to regulate the planning sector was brought home to everybody in the past week.  The Mahon tribunal, a necessary but expensive one, recommended that we would have in place the office of an independent planning regulator to end and root out corruption, be it at local government level or at national government level.  We saw an example of people willing to engage in corruption last week, courtesy of RTE.  We saw Joe, Hugh and John who were more than will willing to accept bribes and money in return for dodgy planning.<\/p><p>Some would suggest we should take the power of zoning and other planning powers, such as the Part 8 provisions, from planners.  We, in Sinn F&eacute;in, would disagree with that and we would not support it.  That is a very simplistic view.  The majority of decisions taken by councillors are good ones.  They represent and are accountable to their local community.  The vast majority of the 949 councillors are decent men and women who represent their community and best interests of their locality and their county.  However, there will always be a few and the stopping of those few is what this Bill is about.<\/p><p>The Government pledged in 2011 that it would implement the recommendations of that tribunal and the key recommendation, to which I referred, has not been acted on.  I note that the Government brought a Bill to Cabinet today to provide for the establishment of a planning regulator.  However, there are key differences between what I and Sinn F&eacute;in are proposing in the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill and what the Government is proposing in its Bill.  If the proposed office of planning regulator does not have teeth or real powers, it will not be effective.  The Government's proposed Bill will provide that such an office would have the power to monitor and make recommendations and to give feedback to local authorities but does not go much further than that.  The difference between it and our proposed Bill is that such an office would not only have the power to make independent appraisal of local area plans, county development plans and guidelines but it would have the power to give directions to planning authorities, local authorities and regional authorities.  Such an office would have the power to investigate systemic problems and irregularities in the planning system and report back to this House.  Such an office would provide training for councillors, which is essential, because there is a big turnover of councillors at every local election.  It is good that there is a turnover of councillors but we must equip them.  Where there are instances of wrongdoing, people will be fined or imprisoned under our proposed Bill and it provides for sanctions to be imposed on those few people who are willing to engage in this type of practice.  Firm sanctions are required to stamp it out.  Crucially, such an office would have the power to bring proceedings for an offence under the planning regulations and that it could be prosecuted by the planning regulator. <\/p><p>I note that the Government side accepted or did not oppose the previous two Bills and it brought forward a planning Bill to Cabinet today but none of us in this House is as smart as all of us together.  We do not possess all the wisdom in this area nor does the Government.  In the spirit of co-operation, we should be all singing from the one hymn sheet on this issue.  We need to stamp out corruption because it is corrosive to local government and the body politic and it drags down the whole political system.  We should start 2016, the centenary of the 1916 Rising, by ensuring we do everything possible to stamp out corruption in that year.  Acceptance of this proposed Bill is a good way to start off that year.  The Taoiseach has his Bill and we have our one and there are sections of our Bill that would make his Bill stronger.  I ask him to accept this Bill and to let it progress to Committee Stage in order that we can stamp that type of corruption.  We have the opportunity with this proposed Bill to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500036#OO01100","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1450196700,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500036#OO01200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1450196700,"counter":478,"content":"<p>It can be moved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500036#OO01300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450196700,"counter":479,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1450196700,"counter":480,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500036#OO01500","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1450196700,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500036#OO01600","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450196700,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"International Protection Bill 2015: Financial Resolution","time":1450196700,"counter":483,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500036#OO01800"},{"type":"speech","time":1450196700,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>THAT provision be made in the Act giving effect to this Resolution for the charging, in accordance with the regulations made under  the Act, of fees (if any) as may be prescribed by the Minister for Justice and Equality, in respect of an application, in such form and accompanied by such information as may be prescribed, for a travel document by a person concerned.&rdquo;<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500036#OO01900","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450196700,"counter":485,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1450197300,"counter":486,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500037#PP00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Positive Ageing Strategy Implementation","time":1450197300,"counter":487,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500037#PP00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1450197300,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Time and time again, we hear in the media about a crisis coming down the tracks for which we must prepare.  This crisis will require our health service to be adequately resourced and equipped to deal with an influx of patients requiring timely and accessible treatment.  Furthermore, we also hear about the detonation of a time bomb, which is sure to have catastrophic consequences.  While one could be forgiven for thinking this crisis indicates a looming, dreadful tragedy, the reality is it is one of the great success stories of our time.  Irish people are living longer, they are living more healthily and they are living more active lives.  One of the consequences of this is that the proportion of our population over the age of 65 is set to increase steeply in the coming years.  This poses challenges in how we provide services to support older people to live the lives they choose, but it is also an opportunity to support positive ageing, to see older people as a group that contributes to our society and that benefits our communities.  We must prepare to deal with these demographic challenges.<\/p>  <p>  When we talk about planning for an ageing population, what we are talking about is developing an age-friendly society not only for those currently over the age of 65 but for all of us who hope and wish to grow old in the future.  Planning requires a whole-of-government approach and while the Departments of Health and Social Protection are the ones we first think of in the context of older people, programmes and initiatives are also run by the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment, Community and Local Government, which provide services and supports to older people.<\/p>  <p>  The national positive ageing strategy, NPAS, sets out a blueprint for how policies and services could be designed to protect the rights of older people.  The strategy was finally published in 2013 following six years of discussion.  It took the combined efforts of three governments, five political parties and three Ministers for older people simply to get it published.  The strategy provides a roadmap for Ireland to begin planning for the needs of older people now and in the decades to come, but more than two and a half years on, we are still awaiting for the implementation plan to set out how this ambitious strategy will be delivered an implemented.  It will transform the lives of older people today and the millions of us who hope to grow old.  I urge the Minister to prioritise the implementation of this transformative strategy.  We will all grow old and we should be able to do so safe in the knowledge that our Government will prioritise our needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500037#PP00300","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1450197300,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of the implementation of the NPAS.

The strategy was published in April 2013 and provides the blueprint for a whole-of-government and whole of society approach to planning for an ageing society.  The NPAS provides a vision for an age-friendly society and includes four national goals and underpinning objectives to provide direction on the issues that need to be addressed to promote positive ageing.  The strategy aims to promote the health, well-being and quality of life of older people by focusing on issues relevant to them across the policy development and service delivery process.  This a cross-departmental strategy.  Improving health, well-being and quality of life of older people will be a gradual and progressive process involving a shift in mindset by Government, policy makers, service providers, and, indeed, all of society.<\/p>  <p>  A healthy and positive ageing initiative has been established to implement the research objective of the NPAS.  It is a joint initiative between the Department of Health, the HSE's health and well-being programme and Atlantic Philanthropies.  The initiative will monitor changes in older people's health and well-being linked to the goals and objectives of the strategy.  This will be done primarily through the development of positive ageing indicators to be published every two years.  The HSE will also develop a physical activity communications campaign under the initiative.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that a great deal happening is across government that is of relevance and of benefit to older people.  My Department is currently considering how best to ensure that the objectives included in the strategy, which are mostly broad, will inform all policies that affect older people on an indefinite basis into the future.  We are still in the early stages of implementation, but the NPAS is a clear indication by Government of the importance that it attaches to older people.  The strategy is a commitment to ensuring Ireland will be a society that both celebrates and prepares for population ageing and the aim is to become a society in which the equality, independence, participation, care self-fulfilment and dignity of older people are pursued at all times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500037#PP00400","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1450197300,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's comment that the Government is in the early stages of implementation but I am looking for the strategy to be prioritised.

It has been discriminated against by Government after Government.  There are serious concerns throughout the hospital about the numbers of staff, the budget and the impact it has on waiting lists and trolley numbers.  As the Minister is probably aware, the number on trolleys in Letterkenny University Hospital continues to increase and in 2015 almost reached the peak of 2006-2007.  Management of the hospital, acting on behalf of the Saolta hospital group, has instructed consultant surgeons to scale back on elective surgeries during the month of January and early February to make beds available for additional people who present in accident and emergency.  The most recent figures on waiting lists at Letterkenny Hospital show there are 13,950 outpatients, 3,338 of which have been waiting for more than a year.  Those are citizens in Donegal who have been waiting more than a year for surgical procedures or appointments with consultants.  There are an additional 1,742 inpatients on the waiting list, which is a shocking waiting list.  It is well known in the hospital that this instruction will lead to the growth of those waiting lists.  It is my view, and that of my party, that the Minister will focus on not having patients on trolleys this winter because it will not look good in the mouth of an election and to achieve this he will sacrifice patients on the waiting list.  That belief was confirmed by comments made today by Liam Doran of the INMO.  What choices has the Minister made?  Will he intervene and send a clear message to the management of the Saolta hospital group asking why this instruction, which will result in the growth of the already shocking waiting lists in Donegal, has been issued?  Why can it not address the issues in accident and emergency departments without growing the waiting list even further?  <\/p> <p> I also want to bring to the Minister's attention the profound concerns of senior staff in the hospital about this instruction.  They have outlined those concerns to the management of the hospital which in my view is carrying out the instructions of its masters in the Saolta hospital group which in turn is carrying out the Minister's instructions.  It is a political imperative to sacrifice patients in order to have as few people on trolleys this winter as possible.  The Minister cannot rob Peter to pay Paul.

In preparation for the 2015-2016 winter period, hospital groups have provided comprehensive winter resilience plans to the HSE, outlining how they will implement an integrated approach across primary, community, social and acute services to manage winter pressures.  This approach is intended both to avoid unnecessary admissions to acute hospitals and expedite discharges from hospital.  If emergency department overcrowding occurs, all hospitals have escalation plans to manage patient flow and patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimal patient care.  In November, a national emergency department congestion escalation directive was issued on foot of discussions between the director general of the HSE and me on how best to reduce emergency department congestion with all of the available resources, both within and outside of acute hospitals.  This directive requires hospitals to implement their escalation plan whenever their emergency department experiences overcrowding.  As part of this, acute hospitals are now required to take specific steps to reduce overcrowding such as the postponement of non-urgent elective procedures.  During winter planning, Letterkenny University Hospital made a decision to scale back the number of scheduled inpatient admissions for approximately six weeks from 4 January to mid-February 2016.  This is primarily to manage the predicted increased number of patients who normally attend and are admitted to the hospital via the emergency department at this time of year.  This is already done in many other hospitals around the country and is considered to be good planning.  In the past, in January, procedures were often cancelled or deferred at short notice.  Rather than scheduling and then potentially deferring patients, the hospital has decided to reduce the number of inpatient procedures scheduled during this period to ensure that in so far as possible, patients who are scheduled are admitted and cancellations are therefore less frequent.<\/p>  <p>  This temporary reduction will ensure that each surgeon has a dedicated amount of theatre time in January and that emergency surgery, including cancer surgery, is prioritised.  The hospital regrets any inconvenience this situation may cause to patients and their families and I wish to echo that.  However, I have been assured by the HSE and Saolta that the effect of these arrangements will be kept under constant review and urgent patients, including cancer patients, will continue to be seen.

Neither Letterkenny University Hospital nor the Saolta hospital group has advertised for a replacement consultant urologist.  As a result, urology is in real crisis in the hospital.  I commend the Minister's officials for organising a meeting in February 2015.  It was a good meeting at which solutions were tabled to address another crisis that had emerged in breast cancer care which was raised by the consultant there, Michael Sugrue.  The meeting was attended by public representatives in Donegal and cancer campaign groups.  We understood these solutions had been implemented but as we see from correspondence from the consultant breast surgeon there, Michael Sugrue to the Minister's officials, they have not been implemented.  Letterkenny University Hospital is a hospital in crisis in Donegal.  The management of Saolta is in denial and is telling us it has the resources it needs, everything is hunky-dory, there is nothing to see here and to move along.  There are only two permanent consultant surgeons in the seventh largest hospital in the State serving 160,000 people.  The rest are locums.  Those surgeons are being told to pull back on elective surgeries to avoid the embarrassing spectacle of people on trolleys in winter.  It is not good enough.  The Minister is aware of the comments of the director general of the HSE, Tony O'Brien.  We have a real crisis in our health service and we need solutions, not commentary.  Will the Minister intervene in respect of the concerns of patients on the waiting lists in Donegal, which will continue to grow?

I am told they will be made available from this week.  This is a real action, not commentary or window dressing; it is ten additional beds for the hospital which represents a significant increase in capacity.  It is normal for hospitals around the country to flex up and down their elective surgical activity - to do less in January and February when the emergency department is very busy and many people are coming through it and do more in the summer period when the emergency departments are relatively quiet.  That makes sense and I hope the Deputy understands why that is.  It is not intended to apply to urgent and cancer surgeries, which it is unsafe to defer.  Budgets are not allocated based on inpatient numbers because hospitals do a lot more than treat inpatients - they have outpatients, day-cases, laboratories and, in some cases, specialties.  Where a hospital has very expensive specialties, such as cancer or spinal surgery, it will need a higher budget, so it is incorrect to compare budgets based solely on inpatient numbers.  <\/p>  <p>  The conversion year for activity based funding is 2016.  For the first time, hospitals will achieve a chunk of their budget based on their activity, which will benefit hospitals that are more efficient than others.

However, had there been a small bit of pre-planning once the heavy rain was anticipated a lot more properties could have been saved from the flooding.  Since the last serious flooding event in 2009, some remedial works, which are welcome and have been successful, were carried out in some towns but more were postponed upon completion of the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management report.  Delays in obtaining pumps and sandbags impacted on particular towns and communities.  There is need for a protocol to be put in place to ensure that this does not happen again.  We have experienced two 100-year flood events in the past six years.  The probability is that we are going to experience more 100-year flooding events in the not too distant future and we need to be prepared for them.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that businesses are eligible for funding under the humanitarian support scheme put in place by the Government.  However, funding under this scheme will be only in respect of returning a business to its state pre-flooding and not for any loss of earnings incurred.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, will be aware that this fund which is being administered through the Department of Social Protection does not facilitate the many businesspeople who do not have money to put bread and butter on the table because to be eligible for this funding their homes had to be flooded.  As such, these people have no current income and will be at a loss of income that would have been generated during the most profitable time of the year, which money would usually carry them through the lean months in the early part of next year.  Something needs to be done to assist these people.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to put a number of questions to the Minister of State in regard to the application form for this funding.  First, can a landlord who signs a form for a tenant in respect of a commercial premises also make an application under this scheme for structural damage to that premises?  Second, will consideration be given to inclusion under this scheme of landlords whose private residential properties have been damaged by flooding, which properties need to be repaired and returned to the market as quickly as possible?  Third, why must an applicant provide evidence that a property has been flooded?  We were told that no documentation would be required in respect of the initial &euro;5,000 claim.  It now transpires that the initial application must be verified by a local authority prior to its being forwarded to the Irish Red Cross Society, which creates an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy.  My concern is that this will discourage some people from availing of this funding.  There is also a need for engagement with the banks to ensure there is flexibility in relation to loans, including extension of same and so on.  A rates release scheme must also be put in place on behalf of victims of flooded commercial premises.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said earlier in the House that farming is a business but it is specifically excluded from the Irish Red Cross Society administered scheme.  A considerable amount of fodder has been damaged and destroyed.  While this not an issue now the unavailability of fodder in the early part of next year will be an animal welfare issue.  Financial provision needs to be made for farmers that have lost fodder as a result of the recent flooding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500039#RR00200","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1450198500,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I, too, acknowledge the contribution of all of the agencies, including the county councils, the Irish Red Cross Society, the Civil Defence, and volunteers from the local communities in terms of their efforts during the recent flooding.<\/p><p>The Government has approved an allocation of &euro;5 million to be distributed as emergency humanitarian support to small businesses, which through no fault of their own have been unable to secure flood insurance and were recently flooded.  The Irish Red Cross Society has agreed to administer the scheme.  The objective of the scheme is to provide a once-off <i>ex-gratia<\/i>contribution towards the costs of damage incurred by those small businesses which were unable to secure flood insurance and were flooded arising from the impact of Storm Desmond during the period 4 December 2015 to 17 December 2015.  The scheme is aimed at providing a contribution to the costs of returning business premises to their pre-flood condition, including the replacement of flooring, fixtures and fittings and damaged stock.  It applies only to rateable premises that have been flooded and it is intended as an emergency humanitarian assistance contribution rather than compensation for loss or a replacement for the cover provided by insurance.<\/p><p>The nature of the impact on businesses affected by the flooding required that as an emergency measure a speedy process be put in place to meet their needs.  In this regard, a two-step approach is being taken, involving an initial application which, if successful will lead to a quick payment to be capped at &euro;5,000 per property.  I am informed by the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, that there will be a five-day turnaround or less in this regard.  As such, the scheme is not overly bureaucratic.  There must be clarification in relation to whether a property was flooded and if at the time of the flooding it was a rateable premises.  To say that the application system is slow and laborious is untrue.  The Minister of State, Deputy Harris, was involved in the design of this scheme.  It has been designed in such a way as to ensure a quick turnaround of applications to assist businesspeople to resume business as soon as possible.<\/p><p>It is anticipated that some businesses will have incurred significant damages and will require a more detailed assessment of losses incurred.  In these cases, a second more detailed assessment of losses incurred will be required.  This will provide the scope for a further payment, with the total payment available capped at &euro;20,000.  However, this will be a more lengthy process requiring a detailed assessment.  The total level of support available under both stages will be capped at &euro;20,000.  The criteria for qualification for payment under the scheme are as follows: only those small businesses that could not secure flood insurance are eligible; for the purpose of this scheme, a small business will be defined as one with up to 20 employees;  the business premises must have been flooded during the period 4 December 2015 and 17 December 2015, with this verified by the relevant local authority; any location within the State that was flooded during the period in question is encompassed by the scheme and at the time of the flood, the business must have been trading and in a rateable premises.  Applications forms are available on the Irish Red Cross Society website.  The scheme is targeted at trading businesses rather than landlords.  It is anticipated that this will address the vast majority of businesses affected.  However, where particular circumstances arise, each case will be dealt with on an individual basis.<\/p><p>The emergency scheme does not apply to farmers.  Farmers in flooded areas can make contact with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine animal welfare helpline at Callsave 076 1064408 or 01 6072379 or Teagasc at 076 1113555.

One has to applaud the IFA.  In 2009, it stepped up to the mark and helped out all farmers on an individual basis by getting fodder from other parts of the country and bringing it to flood-risk areas.  I have no doubt farmers will not be left wanting when they have the likes of the IFA and other such organisations at their disposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500039#RR00300","speaker":"1098","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450199100,"counter":503,"content":"<p>One would nearly think I was pre-empting a flood when, on 1 December, I asked the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine if he would extend the TAMS II programme to allow for grant aid for flood defences for farm buildings to be put in place.

Will the Minister of State take the issue up with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and ask him to extend the criteria relating to it?<\/p>  <p>  While I am on the issue of flood prevention, I will raise a matter with the two Ministers of State present.  It would help if the criteria for the home renovation incentive scheme were amended to deal with the issue of flood prevention in domestic situations.  I earnestly ask both Ministers of State to examine if we can put a small, tight grant aid scheme in place for households outside the flood mitigation areas.

I ask that they would have access to financial assistance where practical solutions can be put in place to protect their homes. <\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed with the Minister of State's response that there is no specific provision for the agriculture industry but thank him for his commitment to take it up with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

It is not as simple as having a person show up at the Irish Red Cross office and say his or her property was flooded and needs &euro;5,000.

Their lives have been seriously disrupted through the flooding of their homes, the battle to keep water out of their homes, the total submergence of farmlands and the impact on livestock.  All this ultimately impacts on the profitability of those farms.  Business premises have been flooded and roads have been rendered impassable.  These roads have been inundated with water and this has impacted on the ability of some to get to work and their children to school.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with a number of the sites which have been flooded.  Around Scarriff Harbour, the MacNamaras have been flooded.  In O'Callaghansmills, a number of families have been cut off.  This is happening on an annual basis.  The Clonlara-Springfield area has been impacted by the increased flooding of the River Shannon and the levels maintained by the ESB have been of the greatest concern in the county.  This has impacted on the lives of many people.  In Mullagh, a bridge was swept away, cutting off four or five families.  In and around Ennis, the Tullow Road area is under pressure as is Kildysart Cross.  The Minister of State will have seen the iconic pictures of St. Flannan's College, which has been flooded again.  The Rowan Tree caf&eacute;, notwithstanding the flood defences in place, has again suffered some flooding.  Ballyvaughan and Kilkee and other places to a lesser extent have also suffered.  Roads and lands have been impacted and lives and livelihoods are affected.  <\/p>  <p>  I am sure the Minister of State is aware, if he has spoken to his predecessors, that it is customary for the Minister to visit the sites, review the damage, offer some complimentary words, talk to people and listen.  The Minister of State is always welcome in County Clare but I appeal to him on this occasion to hold off on his visit.  He should leave it a while - until he has concrete solutions in place - because this is not the first time for those who have been impacted on this occasion.

There is no doubt that dredging and drainage work must form part of any solution.  I am conscious that the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, study is in train and hope it will set out some solutions.  However, I am also conscious that some of the work will cost so much that it may not be possible to undertake it in the short term.  The notion of addressing this issue over a five year period with &euro;400 million or other sum of money is no good to the people affected.  They do not have five years to wait; they need action now.<\/p>  <p>  There is an opportunity to undertake some smaller flood defence works around a number of homes in a manner similar to the small works scheme.  If that scheme could be extended to private property and residences and people come together in a community effort, it might provide an opportunity to put an appropriate solution in place.  I know of one farmer in the Clonlara area who had the means to put a relatively inexpensive flood defence system in place and it worked on this occasion, even though his land was probably at the lowest point.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State's Department must give some consideration to the possibility of relocation for some families, some of whom will never be able to settle in their homes again.

I visited Bandon and Skibbereen yesterday because the county council had passed a motion calling on me to do so.  I also visited Ballinasloe and Crossmolina for similar reasons.  Where I have been asked to visit, I have done so, but I have no desire to travel the country visiting people when my time could be more practically spent to come up with solutions, as the Deputy correctly pointed out.  That said, where people want me to visit to hear the views of the community, I will do so.<\/p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the devastating impact flooding can have on people's lives and livelihoods.  I convey my deepest sympathy and that of all Members of the House to those who have been affected by recent flooding, including in County Clare, particularly in areas such as Springfield, Clonlara and wider rural communities.  I pay tribute to the resilience of local communities who have been responding for days to the flood alert issued by the local authority.  Community efforts are critical to preparing for and managing any flood event or other adverse event.  I understand approximately 20,000 sandbags have been distributed throughout County Clare to help to prevent and mitigate flood damage.  I also pay tribute to local authority staff, the almost 900 defence personnel - members of Civil Defence, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE - and all those who are working day and night to protect life and property and now also engaged in the recovery work.  <\/p>  <p>  Obviously, people must continue to heed safety messages until this flood event and flood risk have passed.  The Department of Social Protection has a &euro;10 million fund available for households, while the Irish Red Cross is administering a &euro;5 million fund for businesses that have been affected.  The Government has asked the Irish Red Cross to make every effort to have this &euro;5 million fund disbursed to businesses before Christmas and I know that it is doing so.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy suggested, the core strategy for addressing the significant flood risk in County Clare is the Office of Public Work's CFRAM programme.  There are 11 areas identified for further assessment in the county, namely, Bunratty, Ennis, Kilkee, Kilrush, Quin, Shannon, Sixmilebridge, Springfield Clonlara, Shannon Airport, O'Brien's Bridge and Killaloe.  These are being assessed within the Shannon CFRAM study.  The study is focused on assessing and putting in place solutions to manage areas at greatest risk and the impact of flooding along the River Shannon.  It is the only CFRAM study that is focusing on an entire river catchment.  The other five studies are focusing on geographic areas.  The River Shannon study covers some 17,800 sq. km or 20% of the island of Ireland.  It includes 17 counties, including the Deputy's own county of Clare.  <\/p>  <p>  The CFRAM programme which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW, working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood maps for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans.  The programme has and will continue to rely on extensive public engagement and consultation.  To date, it has included a public consultation to inform the designation of the 300 areas across Ireland at greatest risk from flooding and meet, in person, each of the 300 communities to explain the flood risks for and the impact on them and to obtain their local knowledge and insight.  One cannot beat local knowledge.  <\/p>  <p>  In County Clare the flood map meetings were held between November 2014 and March 2015.  In addition, the OPW is running a national public consultation until 23 December on the draft flood maps which will provide a further opportunity to share information and obtain as much local knowledge as possible.  Details are available at Clare County Council's offices in Ennis, Killaloe and Kilrush and on the OPW's website.  We are actively examining the options for feasible flood risk solutions for each of the areas and discussing, in person, with each community the possible options.  Of the 66 areas that are part of the Shannon CFRAM study, we have discussed options to manage the flood risk with 48 of the communities and the remainder will be done in early 2016.  The options for the areas in County Clare were discussed with the communities between October and early December this year.  <\/p>  <p>  By the middle of next year I expect to have the draft plans with feasible solutions for each of the 300 areas, including those in County Clare.  The recent flooding event and the possible impact of climate change will inform the flood risk management plan for each area.  There will be a further round of public consultations in the second half of 2016, again involving each of the communities to obtain their insight which will inform the final flood risk management plans.  I must stress that they will not just be empty plans or glossy reports but will come up with real solutions.  <\/p>  <p>  I will reflect on the points made by the Deputy, many of which were reasonable.  The issue of relocation may have to be considered in some areas where we are not able to come up with a viable solution.

The CFRAM study report can inform the management of flooding of the River Shannon at a later stage.  Minor flood defence works and the question of relocation must be considered first.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State has pointed out that tremendous work has been done by the Army and the county council and there a number of heroes who deserve a special mention.  Ms Bridget Kinsella and her three sons stayed up all night to try to protect their home.  Bridget is a widow with three teenage sons and thanks to their hard work, they managed to prevent their house from being flooded.  I also mention the Masons - Geraldine, her brother, husband and children - who did the same.  They managed to save their home, although Geraldine's mother's home was flooded, as was that of her brother, which is a pity.  <\/p>  <p>  I pay tribute to some great public servants, including Mr. Hugh McGrath, the area engineer, and Mr. Pat Henchy, who have done tremendous work on behalf of Clare County Council.  Mr. Adrian Kelly, the chief fire officer, has also done wonderful work, as have all of the staff who have been working around the clock to save people.

They are all great people and it is important to record our thanks for what they have done in the spirit of the community at such a difficult time.  It is an especially difficult time for those who will be out of their homes for Christmas.  I hope the floods will abate and that nobody else will have to face that prospect. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to make one final point, but, first, I stress that I do not distrust the ESB.  In fact, I have the height of respect and the highest regard for ESB engineers and what they have succeeded in doing over the generations.  That said, concern has been expressed about whether the ESB is managing the waterways in the best way possible.  Under statute, it has one primary concern - the generation of electricity at Ardnacrusha.  It is required by law to maintain certain water levels.  This is probably a good time to undertake an independent review of the management of the River Shannon in its entirety in the context of how we generate electricity now and will do so into the future.  We must determine if we need to maintain the levels deemed necessary in the past and whether we should continue generating electricity in the same way.<\/p><p>I pose the questions.  I am not an engineer, so I do not know.  People would certainly like to see that issue addressed.  If that could form part of the Government's mid-term analysis of all of this problem, it would be worthwhile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500041#TT00500","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450200300,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I join with Deputy Dooley in paying tribute to those people he has rightly highlighted as heroes in the response to the very bad weather.  I too was struck by the story of the huge ordeal the Kinsella family has gone through and I pay tribute to them for their major efforts.  It is important to note that the CFRAM process will reduce the time it takes to deliver a scheme by about two years.  Therefore, the work that is being done now, for example, the outline design and the consultation with the community, will reduce a scheme that normally takes about five years to complete to three years.  While three years is still a long time, we cannot be dishonest with people.  These are major capital schemes that we have to get right.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is on track to deliver its draft CFRAM plans by mid-2016 but we have not been sitting on our hands.  We have been moving ahead in delivering a number of schemes, including the scheme for Ennis.  The town of Ennis has been the focus of a number of flood relief schemes in recent years, with the completion of the River Fergus, Ennis upper and Ennis lower flood relief schemes.  Clare County Council has reported in the media that these schemes have significantly reduced the impact of flooding on the town in recent days.  Further works at Aughanteeroe and Fioruisce are currently being undertaken and Clare County Council is progressing a scheme for Ennis south which I expect to commence construction next year.  The investment in proactive planning through CFRAM during the past five years for these 300 areas will significantly reduce the delivery times of feasible schemes in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a lot of information about capital spend on flooding.  While I do not want to be partisan on this, I want to be clear that the issue of funding in regard to the delivery of these schemes is not a problem.  We have &euro;430 million set aside for the next five years under the capital plan.  That means we will be spending more on the delivery of these flood relief schemes over the next five years than in the past 20 years, which is right and proper considering the suffering that communities have experienced and the increased frequency of adverse weather events.  I want to assure this House and the public that there is, and will continue to be, sufficient funding available to meet all requirements for flood relief in any year.  I welcome the proposal by the Minister, Deputy Kelly, which was approved by Cabinet today, to make &euro;8 million available to local authorities, including Clare County Council, in terms of the clean-up costs that will be incurred by communities.<\/p>  <p>  I would also make the point that my office continues to run the minor flood works scheme.  Clare County Council may carry out flood mitigation works under this heading, whereby it can apply for funding of up to &euro;500,000 to carry out minor works that it may believe will be of benefit to its community.  Some &euro;1.56 million has been allocated to Clare County Council under this scheme since it was introduced in 2009 to the end of last year.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised a number of important issues, including, bravely if I may say so, the issue of relocation, which is a sensitive but important issue.  When we have concluded the CFRAM process, which will be by about the middle of next year, coupled with the report of the interdepartmental group on flooding to Cabinet, whoever is in government at that time, a range of options and issues, like relocation, flood forecasting and flood insurance, will have to be dealt with.  I look forward to debating those issues in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500042#UU00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Garda

(1)The Authority shall, by order within 12 months of the establishment<br \/><br \/>day of the Authority, establish a code of ethics that&mdash;<blockquote>(a) includes standards of conduct and practice for members,<br \/><br \/>(b) is fully consistent with the policing principles, and<br \/><br \/>(c) encourages and facilitates the reporting of wrongdoing in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by members.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>We discussed an aspect of the code of ethics earlier.  The section regarding the code of ethics was in the 2005 Act but no Minister ever drafted the code of ethics despite the section being framed with the mandatory &quot;shall&quot;.  The introduction of the trade unions among the bodies the authority is required to consult seems curious as the Minister would not be required to consult with the unions if she had ever drafted the code of ethics under the 2005 Act.  There is a requirement to consult the Garda Commissioner as the representative of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This we believe would have been sufficient.  It is also curious that there is a requirement to consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as setting standards of conduct and policing practice are hardly considered industrial relations issues.<\/p><p>There is a reference to the code of ethics being published but it appears that the Garda code is not available for public scrutiny.  This seems strange.  I noted in the report published last week that the Garda Inspectorate states: <\/p><blockquote>The Garda Code provides standard operating processes and procedures for all members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, garda staff and student garda&iacute;.  It is a comprehensive document and the two volumes extend to almost 1,000 pages.  The most recent edition of Volume I (5th) was published in 2005 and replaced a 1995 version.<br \/><br \/>The Code is intended as a mandatory guide for all work activities.  Within the Code, a section sets out the generic roles and responsibilities for supervisory ranks.  In particular, it highlights that supervisors have the responsibility for ensuring that all members under their supervision are made aware of and understand new policies and procedures.<br \/><br \/>The Code is not the single repository of information and is but one reference point.  It is now available in electronic format on the Garda Portal [an internal search engine that the garda members can use to find the most current policy, legal decision or information on a particular issue] and this should provide details of the most up-to-date version of a policy or instruction.<br \/><br \/>During field visits, the Inspectorate was informed that some parts of the Code are now very dated, such as student training and firearms licensing.  The Code does not contain details of the date that a particular section was last refreshed or when a section is due to be reviewed.  The Inspectorate was unclear as to the value added of retaining the Garda Code, without maintaining an up-to-date version.<\/blockquote><p>It is not maintained properly and I am not sure the Garda Inspectorate stated it at any stage but to the best of my knowledge, it is not accessible by the public which should know what the Garda code is.  One might say that if it contains 1,000 pages not many will read it but that is not an argument and it should be accessible to those who want to access it.  If the Garda Inspectorate states there is not much point in maintaining it unless it is updated, it is very important to maintain it but it also needs to be updated.  Hopefully, that will be dealt with in response to the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s report.<\/p><p>The biggest problem with the proposed legislation around the code of ethics is that there will be no sanction for breaching the code, which makes it a bit meaningless.  If any Minister had ever published the code of ethics, as allowed under the 2005 Act, there was the potential there to introduce disciplinary measures.  The position now is weaker than the 2005 legislation allowed.  It is good that the new code of ethics will be published but it is paramount that some form of disciplinary measures are attached to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500045#YY02900","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1450201800,"counter":610,"content":"<p>It frees up the canvas for a while.<\/p><p>I move amendment No. 26:<\/p><blockquote>In page 9, line 20, to delete &quot;, with the prior approval in writing of the Government,&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500045#XX00100","speaker":"998"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450201800,"counter":611,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1450201800,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 27:<\/p><blockquote>In page 9, line 23, to delete &quot;, with the approval of the Minister,&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500045#XX00300","speaker":"998"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450201800,"counter":613,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1450201800,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 28:<\/p><blockquote>In page 9, line 27, to delete &quot;nominated&quot;

The section regarding the code of ethics was in the 2005 Act but no Minister ever drafted the code of ethics despite the section being framed with the mandatory &quot;shall&quot;.  The introduction of the trade unions among the bodies the authority is required to consult seems curious as the Minister would not be required to consult with the unions if she had ever drafted the code of ethics under the 2005 Act.  There is a requirement to consult the Garda Commissioner as the representative of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This we believe would have been sufficient.  It is also curious that there is a requirement to consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as setting standards of conduct and policing practice are hardly considered industrial relations issues.<\/p><p>There is a reference to the code of ethics being published but it appears that the Garda code is not available for public scrutiny.  This seems strange.  I noted in the report published last week that the Garda Inspectorate states: <\/p><blockquote>The Garda Code provides standard operating processes and procedures for all members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, garda staff and student garda&iacute;.  It is a comprehensive document and the two volumes extend to almost 1,000 pages.  The most recent edition of Volume I (5th) was published in 2005 and replaced a 1995 version.<br \/><br \/>The Code is intended as a mandatory guide for all work activities.  Within the Code, a section sets out the generic roles and responsibilities for supervisory ranks.  In particular, it highlights that supervisors have the responsibility for ensuring that all members under their supervision are made aware of and understand new policies and procedures.<br \/><br \/>The Code is not the single repository of information and is but one reference point.  It is now available in electronic format on the Garda Portal [an internal search engine that the garda members can use to find the most current policy, legal decision or information on a particular issue] and this should provide details of the most up-to-date version of a policy or instruction.<br \/><br \/>During field visits, the Inspectorate was informed that some parts of the Code are now very dated, such as student training and firearms licensing.  The Code does not contain details of the date that a particular section was last refreshed or when a section is due to be reviewed.  The Inspectorate was unclear as to the value added of retaining the Garda Code, without maintaining an up-to-date version.<\/blockquote><p>It is not maintained properly and I am not sure the Garda Inspectorate stated it at any stage but to the best of my knowledge, it is not accessible by the public which should know what the Garda code is.  One might say that if it contains 1,000 pages not many will read it but that is not an argument and it should be accessible to those who want to access it.  If the Garda Inspectorate states there is not much point in maintaining it unless it is updated, it is very important to maintain it but it also needs to be updated.  Hopefully, that will be dealt with in response to the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s report.<\/p><p>The biggest problem with the proposed legislation around the code of ethics is that there will be no sanction for breaching the code, which makes it a bit meaningless.  If any Minister had ever published the code of ethics, as allowed under the 2005 Act, there was the potential there to introduce disciplinary measures.  The position now is weaker than the 2005 legislation allowed.  It is good that the new code of ethics will be published but it is paramount that some form of disciplinary measures are attached to it.<\/p><p>If there are none, I do not think it will change a whole lot.  I do not see why anyone should change his or her behaviour if he or she does not have to worry about any sanctions whatsoever.  Am I reading the legislation incorrectly?  Am I right in saying there is not a disciplinary measure for a breach of the legislation?  It would be good if the Minister could explain the rationale behind it.<\/p> <p> A few weeks ago in the House, the Minister was pretty upset when I suggested that the level of discipline and accountability among some senior garda&iacute;, although not all, left a lot to be desired.  I said it was leading to problems in the force.  I found it interesting that within days, the Garda Inspectorate report referred to much the same and did not disagree with what I said on the matter.<\/p> <p> It should be pointed out that the code of ethics in Northern Ireland has a much stronger status and is the standard against which police officers are measured when an allegation of misconduct is made.  The code of ethics there is drafted by its board but has a much stronger focus on human rights obligations - for example, the European Convention on Human Rights and UN codes - than the proposed one in this Government's Bill.<\/p> <p> The chief constable in the North is obliged to ensure that all officers have read and understand the code.  This requirement was in the heads regarding our authority but has been removed from the final draft.  Also, the policing principles in the North set out that when carrying out their functions, police must be guided by the code of ethics, giving the code added status.  The board also includes an assessment in its annual report as to the performance of the police in this regard, which is significant.<\/p> <p> It has been pointed out by one professor that the legislation removes a function of the authority published in the heads, back in November 2014, relating to human rights and policing.  In the Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's explanation was that human rights in policing are more properly addressed by the IHRC than by the proposed authority.  I do not really accept that stands up to much scrutiny, as the Northern Ireland Policing Board has a principal function of monitoring and supervising compliance with human rights standards in policing, which co-exists with the responsibilities of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.<\/p> <p> The Minister will recall that Professor Dermot Walsh was adamant that the failure to human rights proof all aspects of policing is a challenge to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a challenge to how we do policing in Ireland.  It is something the Minister should reconsider.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500046#YY02900","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450203000,"counter":707,"content":"<p>This is probably one of the key aspects of the Bill but it is a much watered down version of what we thought would be in the legislation.  It is in sharp contrast to the legislation Deputy Wallace published for a genuinely independent Garda authority, which was allowed to go to Second Stage.  That Bill proposed that the board and the Commissioner would be responsible for drafting a code of ethics for the Minister to establish by regulation, with the approval of the board.  In addition, a code of service would be drawn up setting out standards of efficiency and service that the public could expect from garda&iacute;.  This is important because complaints in that vein cannot currently be made to GSOC.<\/p>  <p>  This is a critical section of the Bill.  In the press releases the Minister sent out more than a year ago, it was lauded as a great step forward but as Deputy Wallace said, the code of ethics was always there under the 2005 Act.  It is just that successive Ministers chose not to implement it.  As regards this pre-existing code, the Minister is saying she will bring it in but no disciplinary sanction will be in place for violating it, which makes it utterly ludicrous.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill states that the authority will draw up a code of ethics that includes standards of conduct, practice for members and internal whistleblowing provisions.  However, these will have to be done with a range of bodies such as the unions, as Deputy Wallace pointed out earlier.  The problems that have got us to this stage mean the dogs on the street know we need an independent Garda authority.  One of the reasons for that was precisely due to the lack of adequate provision for, and measures concerning, Garda whistleblowers.  <\/p>  <p>  As recently as two weeks ago, Deputy Wallace put these questions to the Minister for Justice and Equality under the so-called new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with a new Minister and a new Garda Commissioner, albeit 18 months old so not really that new.  In fact, the current treatment of whistleblowers is absolutely dire.  Subsequently, the position of Garda Keith Harrison has been vindicated by the State pulling out of a High Court action it had taken against him at enormous personal and emotional cost, not to mind the cost to the taxpayer of a ludicrous, vindictive action.  It is worth saying that the judge in that case was the senior counsel during the Morris tribunal.  It is quite clear that from his stance, nothing has really changed in the sense that he awarded full costs to Garda Harrison.<\/p>  <p>  This is important because why else are we here discussing a policing authority?  It is to have independent scrutiny and accountability of the garda&iacute;.  Unfortunately, however, that is not something that we are getting in the present arrangement.  It was worrying to hear the reports on RTE radio on Sunday which referenced the fact that - subsequent to Deputy Wallace's intervention with the Minister the last time, when she could not say strongly enough how great the new Garda regime was - Garda whistleblowers were being frustrated, including by a lack of information being given to that garda's legal team.  It was only as a result of those matters being raised here that files were released by Garda and sent to GSOC.<\/p>  <p>  Given the current treatment of decent serving garda&iacute; by senior management, there is clear and indisputable evidence of harassment and demonisation undermining their position.  It is quite clear, therefore, ethics are lacking.  We need a system in place so that can be properly dealt with.  We also need to examine the whole area of human rights proofing.  It is ridiculous that the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, went to the Seanad and said that human rights stuff would be better off with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.<\/p>  <p>  That body, the Minister's own watchdog, contributed to this Bill.  In its observation, it said there should be disciplinary sanction.  It said the role of the authority should be to authorise disciplinary sanction over senior garda&iacute;.  If we do not have this system of ethics properly established, then we will have a serious problem.  <\/p>  <p>  It would be entirely appropriate for the Minister to comment on the Garda Inspectorate's report which has obviously shocked people.  It has also vindicated everything we have said - that nothing has changed inside the ranks of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, except the faces at the top.  I am surprised that people have not called for the current Garda Commissioner to resign because she is standing over a situation that is at least as bad, if not worse, than what the former Commissioner Callanan stood over.  It is worse because the scale of the knowledge that is in the public domain has not been addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The previous Garda Inspectorate's report gave a damning account of garda&iacute; massaging the crime figures, for example.  That resulted in the analysis of crime figures having to be withdrawn for a period.  It is a very serious matter.  We know for a fact that the massaging of the figures is still continuing.  In recent weeks, in Superintendent Pat Murray's station in the midlands and in Athlone, we have seen direct evidence of at least eight cases where crimes were written down so that the original crime was reclassified as a more minor matter.  There is clear evidence of massaging the figures - for example, changing burglaries to criminal damage, which is reclassification.<\/p><p>It is a very serious situation and the Garda Inspectorate was clear that there is a lawlessness out there that is not being addressed.  To do that, we need a strong code of ethics with strong human rights at its centre.  It is really regrettable that is not present in the Bill.  The board should assess these matters annually as well as sanction.  One of the reasons for such indiscipline at senior levels in the force, which is creating major demoralisation further down the ranks, is that nobody at senior management levels is being called to account for their actions.  The points we have made previously about how people get promoted jar very much with ordinary decent members of the force.<\/p> <p> We think this is a critical part of the Bill.  What we are getting under the Bill, far from being a beefed-up code of ethics, is a watering down of a provision the Minister decided not to act on previously and it is critical if we are to really reform this.  <\/p> <p> I would like to hear the Minister comment on the points made by Deputy Wallace about why there is a need to consult with the Garda representative bodies and even more curiously the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am not sure what his role in human rights proofing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is or where that fits in.<\/p> <p> This gets to the heart of much of what we are talking about.  Why are we discussing a Garda authority Bill?  It is because of the crisis in policing that occurred.  New evidence in the latest Garda Inspectorate report indicates that those problems are there.  As the Minister knows well, the hundreds of historical cases of Garda malpractice that had not been addressed and which landed on her desk show why we need a code of ethics.  In that context, I was utterly shocked to receive a copy of the letter her office sent to Cynthia Owens on her case, which had been through that review mechanism.  That review acknowledged deficiencies in Garda work.  Exhibits, including the DNA on her murdered baby, were destroyed and lost.  The internal review mechanism refers to a discredited review that was conducted into her case, a review which ignored and disagreed with the findings of the inquest which confirmed that she was the mother of baby Noeleen.  The Minister's independent review mechanism relied on the person who carried out that review to tell that woman that nothing further would be done in her case.  It is utter madness.<\/p> <p> We have now had two independent reviews into her case.  Neither of them bothered to interview the woman who was the victim of a paedophile ring, which she has alleged involved three garda&iacute; as participants, making it very strange but relevant that exhibits then later go missing in that case.  She was not even corresponded with.  This is a serious problem and it will not go away just because those people have been told their cases got nowhere.  These are the reasons a policing authority was put centre stage and they remain.  Sadly, the measures the Minister has introduced in the Bill will not address such behaviour.  If those who stand over these practices at the top are still there, why would a middle or lower ranking garda even bother to try to do their best?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500047#ZZ00200","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450203600,"counter":709,"content":"<p>I support the amendment.  I was also alarmed to learn from the Garda Inspectorate report that even though a code of ethics was signposted in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, it is still not in place ten years later.  I am sure the Minister will agree that report was a damning indictment of the repeated failure of the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement recommendations from, not just Garda Inspectorate reports, but also a range of other inquiries, reviews and investigations over recent years.  We are repeatedly told that they accept the recommendations in these reports but the recommendations are not being implemented.  It was a damning indictment of the failure of the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to act.<\/p>  <p>  The report was superb.  I am also conscious that the Garda Inspectorate published a report on penalty points.  In recent days, it has been brought to my attention that a considerable number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are still avoiding penalty points by utilising what is called a statutory exemption for emergency vehicles.  The Minister and I, along with all citizens, would agree this should apply for a garda driving a Garda vehicle or their own vehicle while pursuing somebody engaged in the act of criminality.  We can accept there are circumstances when garda&iacute; have to use either his or her own vehicle or more likely a Garda vehicle.  My understanding is that on none of the occasions when these members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had points terminated under statutory exemption for emergency vehicles measure did they prove they were using the vehicle in question for that reason.  They are beating the rap unlike every other citizen.<\/p>  <p>  It was brought to my attention that a senior member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has repeatedly had penalty points terminated, even including in the middle of this year, 2015.  I have seen the evidence with my own eyes.  This senior member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na claimed he was driving the vehicle under the statutory exemption for emergency vehicles.  He is a repeat offender, who, as far as I can see, has never had penalty points allocated.<\/p>  <p>  Here we are at the end of 2015 and the Minister has stood up in this Chamber and given us assurances that the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate, the Comptroller and Auditor General and others would be implemented by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On the basis of the information I have just given, will the Minister undertake an immediate review of all terminations of penalty points that are categorised a statutory exemption for emergency vehicles to ensure that they were genuinely using the vehicle to prevent a crime with paperwork to back it up?<\/p>  <p>  I also ask the Minister to implement the recommendations that came through the Garda professional standards unit.  There were two key recommendations.  One was an evader unit to be set up to track the PULSE system to look at people who had points repeatedly terminated, be they members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other citizens.  The second was to have the statutory exemption issue dealt with.  That is just one example and I could give the Minister many others where we have been assured that change is on the way and that recommendations will be implemented.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider the three-year investigation of crime work, a milestone examination by the Garda Inspectorate.  How many of those recommendations have been implemented?  The Garda Inspectorate report, Changing Policing in Ireland, made 12 key recommendations, only two of which have been implemented.  Unfortunately, there has been a refusal by management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement recommendations for change by the Garda Inspectorate and others.<\/p>  <p>  Here is my problem with all this.  With the guidance of her officials, the Minister has decided to disempower the new policing authority from being as independent as it could be.  I will give some examples.  The Commissioner and deputy commissioner will be appointed and removed by Government.  The Commissioner is accountable to Government.  It has been stated that the Commissioner will remain accountable to Government on matters of national security but I say respectfully that is not accurate.  The original provision on accountability is not altered.  The Commissioner will remain accountable to the Minister for the performance of the Commissioner's functions and those of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This concerns all aspects of policing and not just national security.<\/p>  <p>  Policing plans, strategies and priorities must be confirmed by Government.  Security priorities will be set by Government.  The budget is determined by Government.  The Minister can demand any documents of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Minister can issue written directives to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to the authority.  CCTV schemes must be approved by the Minister.  Ministerial consent is required for GSOC to investigate the Commissioner.  The Minister decides the number of senior rank positions.  The Minister gives consent on the number of civilian staff, the appointment of members to the audit committee and the appointment of the CEO of the authority.  The Minister decides what constitutes State security.  Government consent is required for garda to work with a police service in another state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500048#AAA00200","speaker":"998"}]
