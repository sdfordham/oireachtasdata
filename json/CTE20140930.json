We are here as representatives of the 92,000 people throughout Ireland who depend on the drinks industry for their livelihoods.  This industry generates a significant return for the Exchequer both through excise duty and value added tax, VAT.  We have been hit in recent times by two very significant budget increases in excise duty, which has had a large impact on jobs in the sector, on tourism and on the consumer.<\/p><p>  The issue that we want to address is the effect of excise as a policy option on the drinks industry.  It is fair to say that there are issues around the misuse of alcohol by a certain section of society.  We in the drinks industry do not want to see our product misused.  To that end, we signed a pledge earlier this year asking the Government to do three things: to address the issues of cheap alcohol; segregation and availability of alcohol; and price-based advertising.  The Government will have our full support in addressing those issues.  One of the proposals put forward to solve all those ills is to increase price.  Alcohol costs are 78% higher in this country than the European average, so clearly pricing is not addressing the problem.  The main reason prices here are higher is that we are in the top three in Europe in terms of excise duty on alcohol.<\/p> <p>We in Ireland are ahead by a mile.  The excise duty on a pint of beer is 55 cent whereas in Spain and Portugal, the countries with which we compete for tourists, the corresponding duty is between 5 cent and 8 cent.  The excise duty on a bottle of wine in Ireland is &euro;3.19, but there is no excise on wine in Spain and Portugal.  <\/p><p> We represent small businesses, some of which are very small, that create jobs.  In parts of the country these businesses are very important and some 92,000 jobs are dependent on the industry.  The value of inputs in these businesses is &euro;1.1 billion as they buy products from farmers, be it milk and cream, malting barley, apples and so on.<\/p><p> From the narrow perspective of the pubs I represent, excise increases are not something that these businesses can absorb but must pass them on to the public.  These pubs do not have a raft of other products that can absorb some of the increase, whereas those in the supermarket trade have between 4,000 or 5,000 other items on which they can spread the increase by putting 2 cent on the price of the nappies or 1 cent on the biscuits.  They can do this to absorb the excise increases.  That drives a further wedge in price between what is called the on-trade and the off-trade.<\/p><p> Eight or nine years ago, some 60% of the alcohol consumed in the country was consumed in the pub and 40% was sold outside of the pub.  The situation has now been reversed and the rate of change is growing at an alarming rate.  Alcohol is being sold below cost and is highly marketed in supermarkets.  This is portrayed as consumer friendly but is the opposite.  Leaving aside the effect that cheap alcohol has on the consumer, the consumer is paying more for stables because the prices of stable products have been increased to pay for the fact that the supermarkets are losing money on alcohol.<\/p><p> My colleague Mr. Adrian Cummins from the Restaurants Association of Ireland will give the viewpoint of the restaurant association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014093000004#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Cribben","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412080800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The drinks industry is a vital part of the economy with more than 92,000 jobs created in local communities throughout Ireland, be it in the local restaurant, pub, the farmer supplying products to breweries and distilleries, the local hotel and independent off-licence.  Let me put it into perspective, the reduction of VAT to 9% created 31,500 jobs in totality, and some 21,600 of these jobs were in food and accommodation.  Restaurateurs have been hit on two successive years by increases in duty on a bottle wine.  There was a 1 euro increase two years ago and the increase last year was 50 cent.  About 30% of the turnover in a restaurant is alcohol based.  While we benefited from the reduction in VAT to 9%, we lost out from the increase in excise duty.  Since 2012, the tax on 1,000 cases of wine, which is roughly 20 cases of wine each week, has increased by &euro;18,000, a cost that has to be borne upfront by Irish restaurants, and other businesses in the tourism and hospitality sector.  Given the situation with access to credit, the &euro;18,000 increase has to be soaked up in cash flow, leaving less money for small businesses to invest.<\/p><p>  What we can see from customer and tourism feedback, what tourists say when they are asked what they think about their trip to Ireland, we seem to have got it right with the value for money on food, but in the past two years when F&aacute;ilte Ireland look at the statistics, it sees a growing trend that tourists find the cost of having a drink in Ireland becoming more expensive.  We are trying to compete in the international market for people to visit Ireland.  There has been a low level growth in the past number of years.  We have a long way to go to recover our competitiveness.<\/p> <p>We had 1 million more tourists in 2007 than today and we have a long road ahead before recovering that lost competitiveness.  We understand that excise duty is central to budgetary issues within Government.  We would like excise duty reversed, however, to grow tourism and to assist the restaurant and hospitality industry in the forthcoming budget.  <\/p><p> The 9% VAT rate has proved that tax measures can stimulate jobs through improving our image as a tourist destination.  At the same time as the Government boosted the hospitality sector with this policy, it saw fit to take with the other hand through levying further excise increases and putting small businesses such as restaurants, pubs and hotels under severe pressure.<\/p><p> A reduction in excise can have the same job creating effect as the VAT cut.  The extra 50 cent increase on wine last year, according to customer feedback, meant that they were hit two years in a row.  This damages consumer confidence in the marketplace.  A reduction would give a boost to consumer confidence and, more than that, it would help curb cross-Border activity, which is in real danger of taking off once again.  It would also address one of the few negatives that tourists identify with holidaying in Ireland.<\/p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Donall O'Keeffe from the Licensed Vintners' Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014093000005#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Cummins","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412081100,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cummins.  I will cover just three points.  Given that we are speaking to the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, it is important to think about the job numbers.  There are 52,000 people employed in the on-trade, up and down Ireland, and they are located in every parish and village in every county.  Those jobs matter to those people.  They play a critical role in the local community, local business and local tourism.  There are seven jobs in the on-trade for every one job in the off sector.  Excise hits the on-trade disproportionately and hurts employment.<\/p><p>  According to CSO data, not our data, there has been a 36 cent increase in the national average price of a pint in three years.  The Government has taken 28 cent or 78% of the increase in tax.  The brewers have taken 4 cent and publicans have taken 4 cent.  We are operating in the discretionary part of the economy.  The industry is moving might and main to hold prices down.  We compete for customers and Government tax policy is hindering our competitiveness directly.  As a consequence, there is an impact on employment, turnover and the overall tax take.  We must always remember that the VAT intensity is in the on-trade.  If we sell a drink at &euro;5, the Government gets 23% of it.  If a can of beer is sold in an off-licence, the Government gets 23% of &euro;1 in the off sector.  Excise hurts the on-trade disproportionately.  Our key message to this committee is that as a policy instrument, taxation is directly damaging our competitiveness.<\/p><p>  The final factor on which I wish to focus is our role in tourism.  We represent publicans in Dublin and we benefit enormously from tourism.  We see a rapid recovery in the Dublin market with which we are delighted.  Obviously tourism is all over the country.  I am from north Clare, an area which has many tourists in the summer.  Publicans there need to compete the same as publicans in Dublin.  According to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, 80% of tourists rate visiting the pub as a core positive experience.  In our view, it is where they meet the people.  They meet Irish staff and other Irish customers.  That is where we generate much of our positive warm welcome for which we are rightly famous. <\/p><p>  The tax policy, which also hurts the businesses in the domestic economy, hurts our competitiveness from a tourism perspective.  While we have a very positive initiative on VAT to bring it to 9% to stimulate hospitality and tourism, at the time excise on alcohol goes through the roof.  Our key point is that taxation, principally through excise on alcohol in our sector, is damaging our competitiveness.  Our policy recommendation is around reversing the trends that have been apparent in the past two budgets in excise duty on alcohol.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014093000006#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donall O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1412081400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I invite Deputy Lyons to begin as he is the rapporteur for this report.

This is the conclusion of a report on how to sustain our towns and villages, keep them vibrant, keep them as places people want to come into, whether aesthetically by having nice civic places or places to have a nice experience.  We are all about the experience these days.<\/p><p>  I agree restaurants have become quite competitive.  People often think it is almost free to eat in the D&aacute;il but it is actually cheaper to go to a restaurant off Grafton Street and get an early bird for which a person could still have change out of &euro;20.  It is not possible to get that in the D&aacute;il restaurant. <\/p><p>  As a consumer, I have a particular pet hate.  In May, RT&Eacute;'s consumer show did a programme looking at the marked-up price of beer and soft drinks in pubs and restaurants.  It found that the average marked-up price of a pint of lager was 98% and the average marked-up price of a 200 ml soft drink was 407%.  It was cheaper to have a pint of beer than a rock shandy.  I ask for a comment on that.  That is a lot of money for a soft drink.  I recognise that there may be disparities throughout urban and rural areas but the reality is that if I go for a pint tonight in a street close enough to here I will pay close to &euro;6.  If I go to my local I might pay &euro;4.50 for it.  We are talking about how to get consumers into our towns and villages. Startling figures like that - paying &euro;5 for a rock shandy in a pub - to people who are finding it hard to make ends meet and maybe still want to live a little are ridiculous when they can go elsewhere.  It is the public that needs convincing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014093000007#K00400","speaker":"1023"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412081400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I took part in that programme.  If the Deputy recalls the detail, the research on which it was based was flimsy.  It appeared to be a quick \"phone around\" to certain sectors.  It appeared to me that very few long distance telephone calls were made.  I will not put the matter any further.  The reality is - the Deputy talks about towns and villages - the average price of a pint in the country is slightly more than &euro;4.  Soft drinks are a small percentage of the business for pubs.  Pubs - like any other business - have a range of products and a range of margins.  If the margins were excessive, the country would not be losing the thousand pubs lost in the last number of years.  We do not have an input on prices.  That would be illegal.  There are cases where some of the soft drinks prices may be excessive.  However, a person can go into a bar and get a soft drink for &euro;2 which is not a huge outlay in today's climate. A rock shandy can be obtained for a lot less than &euro;5 in a lot of pubs around the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014093000007#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Cribben"},{"type":"speech","time":1412081400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Lyons have any further questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014093000007#K00600","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412081400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>May I just point out, the Deputy added a second element to his question - on price range - and his accusations were generally levelled at the Dublin pub trade which I represent.

The publican has to offer value for that.  There are prime, centrally located, expensively kit-out, highly staffed pubs charging relatively high prices which people are happy to pay.  A quarter of a mile away are relatively cheap and cheerful pubs.  That is the market in operation.  The price in the suburbs is lower than the price in the city centre.

Public policy has resulted in a proliferation of alcohol on sale at petrol stations and supermarkets over recent years which has had a negative effect on the four elements I have mentioned.  More alcohol is consumed in private homes which reduces the social fabric and there is less control over the amount sold.  The Government needs to discriminate between the unit sold in the pub and that which is sold in the off-licence.  It needs to use taxation and excise policy to promote the pub sale. <\/p><p>  Do the witnesses agree that there is an opportunity in the North of Ireland for fiscal powers to be returned to Ireland by Westminster and that this could have a great effect in equalising tax and excise levels?  Would the witnesses&rsquo; organisations start to focus on that opportunity as those discussions are happening and the changes are concrete?<\/p> <p>Mr. Cummins gave a great presentation at this committee a year and a half or two years ago in which he stated that with the level of opportunity for work that exists in the restaurant industry, there was a complete lack of proper apprenticeships for trainee chefs.  Could he update us on any developments?<\/p><p> Although it is not the only organisation that is involved with this, I would like to see his organisation do more about under-age drinking.  There was a project in Belfast a number of years ago in which when a person bought a bottle or a can in an off-licence, the off-licence stamped its name and the time and date of purchase on the item and CCTV camera recorded the actual purchase. When a police officer found a person with a can of beer, they could then identify that it was sold at that time in a certain off-licence and go back to the CCTV footage to see if it was sold to an under-age person or an adult who then passed it on.  This meant that all of a sudden people were very unlikely to pass drink on to an under-age person, and a young person was less likely to be sold the item because the shop knew that there was some level of traceability.  A project like that would show great faith in trying to tackle the problem, although Mr. Cummins's organisation does not have sole responsibility for that.<\/p><p> Could Mr. Cummins also talk us through this bizarre situation where supermarkets get VAT back from the sale of below-cost products?

When high-profile supermarkets conduct that type of advertising and offer these price promotions, it is obvious it is going to affect my industry - the restaurant industry - and ultimately the hospitality industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014093000009#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Cummins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412082000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>There are two issues.  The VAT issue is a simple one.  When a retailer buys a product, he or she reclaims the VAT, and when the product is sold, the VAT is passed back to the Exchequer.  When the retailer buys at one price and sells at a lower one, he or she is passing back less VAT than he got back himself or herself.  In essence, below-cost selling is subsidised by the State.  It is as simple as that.<\/p><p>  Under-age drinking is a major problem.  Looking at the structure of the pub trade in Ireland, 93% of pubs are family owned and family run.  In most cases, the customers are friends as well as customers because it is very much in the local area.<\/p> <p>We have a responsible serving of alcohol programme, and at this point between 12,000 and 15,000 people in the on-trade have gone through it.<\/p><p> That is not to say there are not pubs in the country in which under-age drinking takes place.  It would be wrong to say that, but it is still the safest place to consume alcohol, by a mile.  There are measures in the pub but there are no measures at home, and there are controls on under-age drinking in the pub but none of those controls in the home.  Much alcohol is consumed outside of the home, be it in parks or wherever, where 14 or 15 year olds are more likely to consume it.  In 99.99% of such cases that alcohol does not come from the pub.  It is coming from supermarkets, in particular.  The way to solve that is to put alcohol in a segregated area in supermarkets.  It should be borne in mind that new legislation is not necessary.  This is provided for in section 9 of the 2008 Act which was introduced by the former Deputy Dermot Ahern when he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but it was never commenced.  All it requires is somebody with a pen to tick a box and off we go.  That will solve the problem.  I am not saying it will solve it totally, but it will solve most of it and very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014093000009#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Cribben","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412082300,"counter":37,"content":"<p>On the issue of under-age drinking, it is clear from a publican's perspective that it is illegal to sell to people under 18 years of age.

Publicans should not knowingly serve under-age people, and the majority do not.<\/p><p>  On one specific issue regarding under-age access to alcohol, we would support measures such as labelling of off-licence point of sale and closed circuit television, CCTV.  They make a modicum of sense, if not perfect sense.  We have legal opinion to suggest that labelling on the can or the bottle is of limited evidential value in court.  It highlights the origin of the product, and if there is a consistent pattern in that regard, it points the police in the right direction, but it will not, in itself, solve the main problem.  The LVA perspective is that the licensing regime of the off-licence sector has collapsed.  There has been more than a tripling in the number of off-licence outlets since 2000.  The State has lost control from a licensing perspective.  There is a far bigger issue here in terms of every convenience store, garage forecourt, corner shop, barber, department store, off-licence and multiple retailer selling alcohol.  Everybody says availability is a factor in alcohol abuse, and if there is an explosion in the number of outlets, a removal of the ban on below-cost selling and alcohol is used as a loss leader to price promote and drive footfall, it is inevitable that the issues we have with under-age drinking and the public health and public order concerns associated with alcohol abuse will explode.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014093000010#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donall O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1412082300,"counter":38,"content":"<p>What is the legal situation with barbers providing alcohol?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014093000010#N00300","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412082300,"counter":39,"content":"<p>One is legally required to have a licence to sell alcohol.

The Wild Atlantic Way has been a fantastic initiative and tourism in Dublin is growing at a fairly substantial rate but that is it.

We must support those local businesses and what they are seeking on the ground.  There is a tourism product in every county, and every county and local authority needs to be actively involved in tourism promotion.  The front-line businesses, including restaurants, hotels, pubs and so on, need to be part and parcel of that policy development.  There should be a bottom-up rather than a top-down approach.  When businesses want developments in their county, they should be listened to from the top down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014093000012#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Cummins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412082900,"counter":54,"content":"<p>The latter question concerns the involvement with local tourist organisations.

We come here with specific, achievable propositions that target growth in town centres and villages within a rural context.  I am accompanied by Mr. Jim Copeland, not least because I only joined the association two months ago and there may well be gaps in my knowledge of certain aspects of the industry.  I am also joined by two members of the association, Mr. Alex Taylor from Uppercross Enterprises Limited, a Dublin-based supplier of plumbing and heating products to the sector, and Ms Heather Graham, owner of Maurice Graham Limited, a merchant based in Monaghan town.<\/p><p>  I do not intend to read our submission word for word but rather to summarise the main points.  Following this I will ask the two members of the association to give the joint committee an insight into their experience of business growth and job creation outside of the main cities.<\/p><p>  Approximately 50% of the membership of Hardware Association Ireland is traditional merchants and purveyors of hardware, with the remainder comprising suppliers and manufacturers, 70% of whom operate outside the Dublin city and county area.  Our members are perfectly placed in the villages and town centres of Ireland to be a gauge of economic activity.<\/p> <p>The latest survey of our members' business performance shows that while confidence is improving in Dublin and most of Leinster, staffing and profitability levels outside of these areas have a negative balance.  To address this imbalance fundamentally, we are proposing rural investment, driven by implementation of the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, and the Construction 2020 strategy, with specific reference to recommendation No. 8 on State agencies strengthening their collaboration to bring small and niche foreign direct investment to rural areas; recommendation No. 5 on facilitating rural economic development zones; recommendation No. 14 on the introduction of a funding mechanism, either stand-alone or in partnership with other finance instruments, to incentivise and support the early stage development of social enterprises; and recommendation No. 15 on delivering broadband of a minimum of 30 MB minimum to all rural areas by the end of 2015.<\/p><p> Construction 2020 contains 75 specific actions.  While this is welcome, it will take some time for any benefit to accrue.  The change proposed in the strategy for the National Pensions Reserve Fund to become the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, with the ability to invest in commercial activities, is welcome.<\/p><p> We have been calling for an extension of the home renovation incentive scheme beyond 2015.  The latest Revenue information as of 15 September is that the value of the works registered to date is &euro;171 million - clearly, it has been a success - and an average job value of &euro;16,500.  The bulk of the work registered for the scheme to date, some 77%, is focused in the Dublin-Leinster area.  Hardware Association Ireland, HAI, believes that an extension of the scheme would allow time for it to be better promoted in more rural areas while also creating jobs and boosting business activity.  As an association, we are more than willing and perfectly placed to support Revenue in promoting the scheme should we achieve an extension.  We could combine promotion of the scheme with a drive to support the local independent merchant.  This would in no way disenfranchises our wider membership, as a buoyant local economy in towns and villages will help the overall sector to recover more quickly and support job creation.<\/p><p> We would support the introduction of a help-to-buy scheme, which should also be thought of as a help-to-build scheme.  We recommend that the threshold for an Irish scheme should be lower than its UK equivalent of &pound;600,000 and focus first on family-type homes in areas of need and disadvantage.  Nowhere has the collapse in the construction market been more obvious than on the fringes of towns and villages.  Adoption of such a scheme would support housing regeneration and stimulate commercial activity in town centres.<\/p><p> Regarding credit guarantee schemes, obtaining working capital through credit or loan facilities is a major problem for small builders and small to medium-sized enterprises in the building-construction industry.  In an effort to alleviate this problem in the UK, a pilot scheme is in operation whereby a trade customer can apply for a credit account in a builders' merchant of up to &pound;25,000 underwritten by the Government.  We appreciate that a review has been prepared for the Minister and is on his desk but we ask that consideration be given to the inclusion of this proposal on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> To support local entrepreneurship, the micro-enterprise loan fund scheme should be expanded and promoted.  Introduced in October 2012, this scheme was originally intended to provide more than &euro;90 million in extra lending to 5,500 businesses and create an estimated 7,700 jobs in a ten-year period.  It needs to be revamped.  The latest report, covering a period up to 31 March 2014 after one and a half years in operation, shows that only &euro;3 million in loans has been approved, with 437 net jobs created in 192 businesses.  Only 51% of applications were approved, with 83% of approvals for businesses employing three or fewer people.  These figures are so far off the original target that a revamp is clearly required.<\/p><p> In terms of social policy reform, we advocate the introduction of a fuel voucher system whereby those who receive the winter fuel allowance must use a dedicated fuel voucher or smartcard to purchase a fuel product from registered and tax compliant retail fuel outlets.  We also propose a revamp of the social welfare conditions to incentivise jobseekers to apply for seasonal, temporary employment.<\/p><p> HAI members, both suppliers and merchants, are directly affected by weaknesses in construction activity and the continued weakness in consumer demand generally.<\/p> <p>To ensure an equitable spread of the green shoots in consumer confidence and increase in commercial activity about which we have heard in recent months, we need to target our local town centres and villages with a proactive and realistic approach.  We hope our suggestions are practical and helpful and I thank the committee for its time.  One of our members, Ms Heather Graham, will now tell the committee about her experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014093000013#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Annemarie Harte","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412083800,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to come before the committee.  I work in a family business, which has been based on the outskirts of Monaghan town since 1988.  We saw the business grow and in 2008 it collapsed when the building trade and everything else in the country took a downward spiral.  My family business lost more than 50% of our turnover and we had to diversify.  We no longer had tradesmen coming through the door because many of them no longer had jobs and some of them were heading abroad.  We had to examine from where our customers came and we diversified into decor and home furnishings.  We believe the trade has hit the bottom and we are about to turn a corner.  My fear, and the fear of other merchants in the country, is that as we turn this corner we must learn from the lessons of the past six or seven years.<\/p><p>  I am very passionate about my views on credit.  Tradesmen and contractors are fighting hard for jobs.  Prices are still being driven through the floor because many contractors quote for one job.  They no longer have the same banking facilities and neither do we.  They tell home owners that they will supply the labour while the home owner pays for the goods.  We now deal with two parties.  To turn around our business we need to be able to facilitate credit, but we also need to be guaranteed that we will get paid or we will land back to where we were in 2007 and 2008.  The culture in the economy with regard to credit is not something about which we should be proud, and our Parliament should very much try to help us change this culture.  We would like to have an input into the credit guarantee scheme because if we are to grow businesses and jobs, credit will play a part in this.<\/p><p>  Our company created new jobs recently.  Many of the applicants did not want more than 20 hours work.  Costs are still increasing and while companies know they need more staff, they do not have the finances to pay large wages.  I am sure committee members hear about the tax system all the time.  This and the universal social charge need to be tackled.  I would love to see an incentive to encourage people back to work because men and women genuinely want to get back to doing a day's work.  This is for financial reasons and because they want to be in the workplace, among people and doing what they are good at.  People who knew nothing except work have been out of work for the past four to six years and for the sake of their mental health they should be able to return to work.  I would like to see such an initiative so we do not encourage people to stay at home.<\/p> <p>How do we reward people for going back to work?  I am sure members have been reading the articles on the living wage.  What I see coming down the tracks is the need to increase wages.  Our trade sector is a low margin business, with very high costs.  Any wage increase will be built into the price for the end user.  At present I believe it is inappropriate to increase prices at a time when we should be encouraging people to start jobs, be in at their home, on the farm or business.  <\/p><p> As we turn the corner, the issue that we see on the ground is the need for more staff in our shops and stores because our customer mix comprises DIY, the tradesman and women who do their own repairs and decorating.  We see a large increase in the footfall of female shoppers in our store.  This is greatly welcomed because they know what they want.  We are no longer wholesalers and the merchant on the ground is effectively a retailer.<\/p><p> I hope members will be able to take some of these issues on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014093000015#S00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Heather Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412084100,"counter":64,"content":"<p>We will now take questions.

It is the Government's intention to extend the capacity of that scheme to include more people.  We are very much aware that some employers may not be in a position to bridge the gap between taking somebody on but the &euro;10,000 subsidy might be what is needed to do so.<\/p><p>  I accept that broadband is not available everywhere.  I understand the situation, as Rush in County Dublin does not have broadband.  <\/p><p>  How many of the businesses in the hardware association are using IT to enhance their businesses?  Some people think that a website is enough but if one is running a shop, the website is another shop window and must be changed as often as a shop window changes.  Some companies do not see the need to tweak the website.  Have the members of the association gone down the route of trying to find out how IT can enhance the business of a SME?  Let me give an example.  I was getting things done in my house during the summer but as I work weird hours I do get the opportunity to go shopping.  I relied on the Internet to look up doors and lamps.  It was amazing to find how hard it was to find Irish suppliers and Irish suppliers who had a decent website that one would stay on long enough to want to buy something from them.<\/p><p>  Those who buy on the Internet comprise a growing market.  The Irish retailers are losing out to international retailers because they have the competitive advantage of IT to enhance their business.  We are often left with no other opportunity but to buy the lamp from a retailer outside of Ireland.  I met the former director of AOL Ireland, who now works for FIT, a body that upskills long-term unemployed people.  They train people who have done the Momentum course, that is those who have upskilled themselves from previous jobs such as construction and so on.<\/p> <p>Some of those with whom they work have a pilot scheme on how to help SMEs to develop their IT skills and make IT work for their business.  There is a market but Irish retailers are not hitting the bullet and are losing out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014093000016#T00300","speaker":"1023","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412084400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I agree totally with Deputy Lyons.

The latest statistics from the UK show that after what one would expect to be the big purchases online - music, videos, books and electricals, homeware and DIY is the fourth biggest sector.  It is a growing sector and, as Ms Graham said, there has been a great deal of change in recent years in the traditional business and how it has diversified.  The next step is to get much more bullish in the e-commerce market.  UK companies will come here and some are already in the market, and they will put will put the indigenous industry at a severe disadvantage if we do not have broadband up and running throughout Ireland.

The level of transfer from traditional retail to e-commerce on an annual basis is in the billions, and three out of every four of those euro land outside this jurisdiction.  As that is a major threat to retail and to retail jobs, the State needs to do more.  Perhaps the witnesses will outline some of their experiences with regard to State supports on e-commerce.

That is why we mentioned in our submission that even the home renovation tax incentive scheme has been a great boon to everyone.  That is not necessarily just on energy products, but on anything that goes into the fabric of the home.  When one considers that the scheme, which is not yet a year old, has brought in &euro;170 million, it is a great achievement.  It brings people into the legitimate trade as well, as one must be tax-compliant from a contractor's point of view and one must have one's property tax paid from a resident's point of view.<\/p><p>  The other schemes administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland are all of benefit but they need to be hammered home.  One of the biggest problems with the home renovation tax incentive scheme is that it has not been advertised enough.  Some &euro;170 million was generated without a great deal of promotion.  We advocate that the second phase of the scheme be promoted heavily because there is a pent-up demand.  People want to put money back into their homes and if they are going to do it, they will go for the energy-efficient option.  They will go for the insulation and the timer switches to save energy and power.  With water meters now being fitted, they will go for shower heads that will save on water, for rain butts, and for retention tanks.  There is a great opportunity for the Government to increase tax revenues by giving a bit of leeway as an incentive and promoting it as heavily as possible.  <\/p><p>  One of the downsides of the renovation scheme is that one must wait two years to get one's tax credit back.  Those operating in the shadow economy will give the consumer the money off straight away.  The delay in receiving the tax credit is a big disincentive and this is something we will ask the Government to reconsider.  As the recovery is happening in Dublin-Leinster, it has not had the chance to spread to the rest of the country so an extension of the scheme would allow the midlands, the west and the north and the south to avail of it.  I would be surprised if we do not get to &euro;500 million very quickly if it is extended, and there is no cost to the State.  To answer Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's question, whatever incentive we can give to put value back into our homes will be worthwhile.  Everyone knows the value an Irish person sees in their land and their home, so they will want to put value back into it.<\/p><p>  On Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's earlier question about LEOs, whatever they can do to help retailers on the ground to get business plans together and apply for credit, to help them with IT and digital marketing, should be encouraged.  The LEOs have so far been focused on areas other than retail, which is a huge employer.  There should be a dedicated officer in LEOs around the country looking at retail because that is where the economy will bounce back.

The National Concert Hall is one of nine national cultural institutions that operate under the aegis of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It is the most prestigious music venue in the State, as well as being a national venue for the performance of various genres of music.  The National Concert Hall is also responsible for the promotion and encouragement of the performance of music and of public knowledge, appreciation and enjoyment of music and the like arts.<\/p> <p>From its location on Earlsfort Terrace, it operated a busy programme of events that included 942 individual performances which attracted an aggregate of 315,508 patrons in 2013.  Access to the arts, culture and Ireland&rsquo;s rich heritage are vital for preserving our society and national identity and helping to promote Ireland&rsquo;s image abroad.  The arts, cultural heritage and creative industries also make a major contribution to our economy and to sustaining and creating jobs.  Cultural tourism, to which these sectors bring considerable value, also makes a significant contribution to economic well-being and the rebuilding of Ireland&rsquo;s reputation on the international stage.  The NCH occupies a valuable place in the Irish cultural life and is a key element of our artistic infrastructure. <\/p><p> The hall itself was opened to the public in 1981.  In tandem with the opening of the hall came the establishment of the National Concert Hall Company to run it.  Specifically, the National Concert Hall Company was established as a company limited by guarantee and has operated on this basis ever since.  It is now more than 30 years since the NCH was established.  During this period there has been an evolution in the thinking and policies surrounding corporate structures and governance, and members will be aware of the Government's public service reform programme, which has led to an examination of the structures of a range of public sector institutions, including the national cultural institutions.  In the context of that programme, among other things, the Department has sought to provide, or update where appropriate, the legislative underpinnings for various national cultural institutions to align them with modern corporate governance requirements.  As part of this process, the Government recently considered the governance position at the NCH and on 25 February 2014 approved the then Minister's proposal to place it on a statutory footing similar to other national cultural institutions, both existing and proposed.  <\/p><p> As stated previously, the NCH is structured as a company limited by guarantee.  Companies operating under the Companies Acts must comply with the corporate governance, reporting and accountability provisions of those Acts.  Reporting to a Minister or onwards to the Oireachtas is not normal practice for companies established under the Companies Acts.  The Minister considered it more appropriate that there would be a statutory based framework for the NCH to provide for reporting and accounting to the Minister and onwards to the Oireachtas.  The Minister also considered it essential that the board of the NCH should have absolute clarity in respect of the position on all governance and operational issues at the NCH.  As this would not normally be a feature of how companies operate, the Minister considered it appropriate that separate and tailored statutory governance arrangements should be introduced for the NCH.  As a statutory body, the NCH will be required to prepare and adopt a statement of strategy, submit progress reports and prepare an annual business plan, to be submitted as appropriate to the Minister and the Oireachtas.  This is in common with changes being proposed for other national cultural institutions.  Earlier this year, the then Minister put proposals to Cabinet, which approved the decision to introduced statutory governance arrangements for the NCH.  The outcome of these deliberations is the general scheme of the national cultural institutions (National Concert Hall) Bill, which is before the committee for the pre-legislative scrutiny process. <\/p><p> Prior to outlining the provisions of the general scheme, I would like to comment on the approach adopted by the Department in its initial drafting of the Bill.  In general terms, the purpose of the general scheme of the Bill is to establish the National Concert Hall as a statutory body and to put in place the necessary corporate and reporting structures and supports.  The approach of the Department towards the general scheme has been enabling rather than prescriptive in so far as that it is possible.  In addition, the Department has been conscious of the special position of the National Concert Hall, which has to operate with a commercial and public service remit, and the legislation endeavours to take account of that.  Finally, the Department has drawn from the experience of similar types of legislation enacted in recent years in relation to other public bodies here and abroad.<\/p><p> Part 1 of the general scheme contains standard heads, such as provision for a commencement day and expenses of the Minister.  Part 2 deals with matters such as the establishment of the NCH as a statutory body and the date on which that it will happen.  It also covers matters such as the functions of the NCH.  There is also a provision enabling the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to confer additional functions on the NCH.  The general scheme also contains a number of heads dealing with the production of a statement of strategy, business plan and annual report by the NCH, and the processes that should be undertaken in this regard.<\/p><p> The next section of the general scheme deals with the board and staff of the NCH, and associated provisions.<\/p> <p>Head 17 deals with the board of the hall and provides the size of the board shall be cut from 15, as it currently stands, to nine.  The Minister considers that the transition to a statute-based national cultural institution would best be managed by a focused expert board.  It is provided that appointments to the board should draw on a wide range of experience and skills to ensure the National Concert Hall board has all the necessary range of skills and experience.  Such a board might include experts in the fields of governance, accountability, law, music, marketing and venue management.  It is intended to rotate board membership to ensure greater continuity at board level.  This is a change from the current situation whereby the whole board is appointed at the same time and, accordingly, completes its term of office at the same time.  It is intended the chair and the board will operate <i>pro bono<\/i>.<br\/>The heads also contain a provision dealing with committees.  This will enable the board to include people who are not members of the board and is a useful way of widening the range of expertise available to the board for specific issues such as audit.<br\/>Head 23 provides an appropriate statutory underpinning for the position of the director and head 24 for the staff of the hall.  In particular, head 24 confirms the staff of the hall will transfer to the new statutory body on the same terms and conditions as they held before the dissolution of the National Concert Hall Company.<br\/>Heads 28 to 31, inclusive, contain standard provisions concerning, for example, the ability of the National Concert Hall to borrow moneys and the conditions under which they can do so.  Heads 32 to 37, inclusive, cover a variety of issues.  A head has been included to enable the National Concert Hall to establish subsidiaries and enter into joint ventures or partnerships.  In addition, head 36 deals with the establishment of foundations.  The Department is cognisant of the dual operations of the National Concert Hall in both the commercial and public sector.  Accordingly, it sees these heads as useful tools for the National Concert Hall.  As a statutory body, the National Concert Hall will have enhanced capacity to engage in fund-raising.  This, again, is common to other national cultural institutions which are already established as statutory bodies and which have strong fund-raising programmes.<br\/>Heads 38 to 44, inclusive, are directed at covering the transitional issues that may arise during the dissolution of the National Concert Hall Company and the establishment of the statutory National Concert Hall body.  The primary aim is to place the new statutory body in the shoes of the National Concert Hall Company.<br\/>The Department has consulted with the National Concert Hall to obtain the perspective of its board and executive.  This has been a useful exercise.  I envisage consultations will continue with the hall to ensure the legislation is fit for purpose.  In that regard, I would like to express my thanks to the chairperson, the board and the executive for their co-operation and assistance in that matter.  The Department also looks forward to receiving the input of the committee when it has had a chance to consider the heads of the Bill.<br\/>The National Concert Hall occupies a special place in the Irish cultural world.  The Department recognises that and wishes to ensure that the general scheme of the Bill will recognise the strengths of the concert hall and leave it fit for operating in this dynamic environment.  The coming period will be one of change at the National Concert Hall.  The legislative reforms planned for this institution will greatly enhance it for the performers, the staff and the public who visit the National Concert Hall each year.  I thank the committee for its attention.  My colleagues and I look forward to assisting the committee in its deliberations on the general scheme of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014093000004#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412084100,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; for his opening statement.

Significantly, we also believe the legislation offers the potential to strengthen the hall's mandate and organisational capacity.  It can further serve to secure its position as a cultural asset of national importance and considerable international standing, as well as providing a foundation for its further development as the national centre of excellence for the performance of music.<\/p><p>  The National Concert Hall has both a public service and commercial remit.<\/p> <p>This context is one in which we must seek to balance the public interest role of the hall as the national venue with the challenges of conducting much of the operations in a commercial environment.  This blend of public service and commercial activity is well reflected by the breakdown of the hall's direct income for 2013.  In that year, two thirds or &euro;4.563 million of the direct income was derived from our own income generating activities, while one third or &euro;2.33 million was received from the State by way of a grant-in-aid.  Our self-generated income includes diverse elements such as ticket sales, charges and commissions on the hire of the hall to external promoters, rental income from RTE in respect of the residency by the symphony orchestra, income from the catering and bar franchise, membership fees, corporate associates, commercial sponsorship, advertising and philanthropy.  Against the background of these competing demands, we believe that the legislation should provide a clear mandate for the concert hall through the articulation of its statutory functions, well aligned with governance provisions appropriate to its commercial challenges.<\/p><p> By way of supporting the work of the committee, it might be helpful if I spoke briefly about the work undertaken to date by the NCH and our recommendations on areas in these proposals that we see as being of particular significance.  Following publication of the general scheme, the board of the National Concert Hall established a sub-committee of its members to review the matter and identify areas of particular strategic interest.  The sub-committee met on a number of occasions and presented its views to the board meeting at end July 2014.  Following discussion, the board agreed an approach in what it saw as a number of key heads and provisions of the proposed Bill.  These views were subsequently advised to the Department in early August.  We are happy to bring these to the attention of the committee and to discuss them further with it.<\/p><p> At executive level, operational matters have been the subject of review and input by the senior management team and views thereon have also been provided to the Department.  Consultations are continuing and the Department presented to the board at its meeting on Thursday last, both on the context for the legislation and responding to particular proposals that we had put to the Department in August.<\/p><p> There was a small number of heads within the general scheme that we identified at board level as of particular significance.  These broadly concern the functions of the National Concert Hall in terms of clarity regarding the purpose for which the hall is to be established on a statutory basis and the powers and functions of the board in support of the achievement and delivery of those functions, financial matters, staffing, and the establishment of subsidiaries.  In brief, our focus in regard to the functions of the NCH and powers of the board is to set out the rich diversity of our work and to equip the board to secure its delivery.  Our purpose in regard to the financial and staffing areas is to secure discretions and responsibilities appropriate to the commercial environment in which much of our work is undertaken.  With regard to subsidiaries, we seek provision with respect to the establishment of these in furtherance of the objects of the National Concert Hall and subject to appropriate ministerial governance controls.  Our ultimate purpose, therefore, is a legislative and governance framework that it clear, appropriate and congruent with the particular context and challenges of the NCH.<\/p><p> For completeness, draft recommendations on these heads, as previously forwarded to the Department, were provided to the committee by way of an appendix.  We readily acknowledge that the language of the final text of the Bill will express quite differently the content of the heads themselves.<\/p><p> We believe that the establishment of the National Concert Hall on a statutory basis offers a unique platform to build on the hall's significant achievements over the last 30 years and can also serve to advance the opportunities that exist to develop the National Concert Hall to its full potential in the public interest.  We are happy to meet the committee this afternoon and to support the committee in its consideration of the general scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014093000006#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Kearney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412084700,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kearney for his opening statement.

The disposition of the board, having gone around the course a number of times, is that it welcomes the establishment of the National Concert Hall, NCH, on a statutory basis.  We are of the view that it gives appropriate legal recognition to the prominence of the NCH as a national institution.  We have identified a number of key areas, through which I am happy to walk members briefly for the information of the joint committee, on which the board honed in as being important in respect of pursuing the interests of the hall within a statutory framework and of developing and building on the initial offering from the Department in the general scheme.  I will list them briefly for the benefit of members.  Heads 9 and 10 deal with the functions and powers of the National Concert Hall and in those areas, we seek and have proposed to the Department certainly a more succinct articulation of what the concert hall should be about.  Much of what is contained in the general scheme is taken from the memorandum and articles of association, which are more than 30 years old and which were written in a different context.  In this legislation, what we really need is a more succinct, focused and permissive articulation of what the hall is about.  It needs some reflection at a policy level, as well as simpler and more clear language as to its particular remit, and this is what we have sought to offer the Department.  We want to be absolutely clear that the board has the powers to deliver on this.<\/p><p>  Heads 23 and 24 relate to the director and staff of the National Concert Hall and, in that space, the board's thinking is that as we are operating largely in a commercial environment, we need some of the freedoms that are enjoyed by commercial bodies and having us subject to the strictures of a Department is not really fit for the purpose of a body that now derives two thirds of its direct income from commercial activities.  As for head 33, we welcome what is already there and have suggested this is important.  We have introduced more explicitly the issue of fund-raising in this regard.  In our deliberations, we noted that the first Schedule to the 1997 legislation governing the national cultural institutions lists the premises at which those bodies are located.  We would really welcome it were it possible to reflect in law the premises of the NCH.  We recognise this should not be a straitjacket and that, obviously, one would provide the Government and the Minister with the freedom to add additional provision to this, should they so wish.  However, in seeking philanthropic giving, in respect of the confidence of donors and in having a National Concert Hall, it appears highly desirable that one would specify that its location would have statutory recognition.<\/p><p>  The final point, on which I will conclude, is a horizontal issue in that within the financial area, the board has suggested some areas for improvement.  We seek improved discretion in head 24 in terms of staff pay.  Within head 30 in respect of accounts, we think our current system for the presentation and preparation of accounts is highly efficient and wish to hold onto that, rather than perhaps slowing it down by bringing it directly into the Comptroller and Auditor General process.  Similarly, with regard to heads 33 and 34 in respect of gifts etc., we are happy to elucidate on those points should members so wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014093000008#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Kearney"},{"type":"speech","time":1412085300,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Is mian liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh na finn&eacute;ithe inniu.  N&iacute;l aon amhras faoi n&aacute; go raibh a gcur i l&aacute;thair thar a bheith soil&eacute;ir.  I dtosach, tuigimid an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann leis seo agus an strucht&uacute;r a bheidh ann ag dul ar aghaidh amach anseo.  In welcoming the representatives of the Department and the National Concert Hall today, I first wish to compliment the NCH on the work and the track record it has established to date.  It is true that it is central to the cultural life both of this city and of Ireland.<\/p> <p>I am pleased that reference was made to cultural tourism.  Culture ranks exceptionally high in any surveys I have seen which studied visitor experience in this country.  It often comes in the top three in such surveys.  The importance of the National Concert Hall goes beyond what we would regard as the immediate perception, namely, a venue for performances.  Many people might go as far as to say that for an up and coming performer to get onto the stage of the National Concert Hall is close to a player getting into Croke Park for an All-Ireland final.  When talking about the National Concert Hall we are talking about a significant cultural institution.<br\/>My first response to the general scheme is that it is vital for any healthy project to examine its position in society and in a changing environment.  That is evident in what the National Concert Hall is doing.  It is going a step further in that it is also identifying the challenges on the one hand and the opportunities on the other.  That is exceptionally important.  It is also important that any institution of this calibre must be able to show that two thirds of its income comes from its activities and that it is not completely dependent on the State.  That presents a challenge and I am pleased to see the inclusion of that point.<br\/>I was not fully clear on the type of subsidiaries which are being considered.  Perhaps the chairman, Mr. Kearney, might be able to say a bit more about that.  It is good that the committee has an opportunity to examine a Bill at the general scheme stage.  Previously, it was done and dusted and that was it.  We have the opportunity to examine various aspects of the Bill but my mind has been very much put at ease by what the chairman said about the <i>modus operandi<\/i>that has been employed and the setting up of a sub-committee.  It seems to have been done professionally, which is good, because very often with something that might be regarded as not so much radical but certainly a fundamental change in approach, it is very important when an approach is agreed that one can build on it and no subsequent controversies will arise.  The method that has been used is very important.<br\/>How proactive a role does the board play in the operations of the National Concert Hall?  The chairman probably knows where I am coming from with that particular question.  It is an important point because we have had controversy in recent days about another institution.  The institution in question could have done without it.  For that reason, the approach in this case could, in a way, mark our cards in the future in terms of the role of the board and how often it meets.  I do not expect the board to deal with bookings but it would be nice if the chairman could expand on the matter.  The only two areas on which I seek more information is the type of subsidiaries being considered and to what extent the board is proactive.<br\/>I wish those involved in the National Concert Hall well in the future.  I do not mind putting on record my admiration for the Department and the work it has done and the accessibility of officials.  From experience, that does not apply in any other country.  That is most encouraging and helpful.  It is one of the marks of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It has provided not just funding, which is one issue, but encouragement and understanding for the vision that arts and culture bodies have in this country.<\/p> <p>A very good partnership exists between the Department, the National Concert Hall and cultural institutions generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014093000008#K00500","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412086200,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I will take the second question first and ask my colleague, Mr. Simon Taylor, to give more detail on subsidiaries.

On governance, a number of areas have been identified as needing attention and much of the board's work is conducted through its sub-committees on governance, finance and audit, programme spectrum and so on.  There are five sub-committees and they are used to the governance donkey work.<\/p><p>  On operation and management, the Senator is correct that the board does not directly intervene but it has influence as there is a diverse range of talent on the board.

The programme spectrum sub-committee considers the full spectrum of work and the balance offered by the hall between, for example, traditional classical music and Irish traditional music or modern music.  There is active engagement through the sub-committees but we seek to build on the boundaries between the board and executive.  A review was carried out by Brigid McManus this year on improving governance at the concert hall and one of our current tasks is the implementation of this review.  I acknowledge the prescience of the Senator on this point.  In answer to the basic question, it is an active and challenging board that takes up time.<\/p><p>  On subsidiaries, the purpose is fund-raising and the model used by other national cultural institutions is having a separate subsidiary for this purpose.

That is absolutely not the case.  The purpose of the Bill is to update the governance framework within which the National Concert Hall operates.  The special purpose vehicle that was established more than 30 years ago is no longer appropriate to the workings of a national cultural institution.  The Bill sets out to apply an up-to-date statutory framework to the functions of the National Concert Hall.  It is not an attempt to make it more dependent on the private sector.  In fact, these provisions will ensure its future statutorily as a cultural institution, giving it more certainty than it has right now.  There is no suggestion whatsoever in anything that is proposed here that would push it in the direction of more of its funding coming from the private sector.<\/p><p> What is envisaged is a complex funding model, as set out by Mr. Kearney.  Unlike some of the other institutions, it involves a mixture of revenue streams, including from ticket sales and sponsorship, some income from philanthropy and partnerships, and one third coming from the public purses.  That mix may vary in future, but we do not envisage a significant change in the level of public sector support.  The purpose of the subsidiaries is to give the institution the flexibility into the future to move with the times and engage in third-party partnerships and other fund-raising activities.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's second question was about the terms and conditions of employees.  The staff of the National Concert Hall will remain within the public sector and transfer on the terms and conditions they currently enjoy.  Mr. Kearney referred to a discussion that has been going back and forth between him and the Department around the flexibility which should be afforded the National Concert Hall, given its remit within the commercial sector, to allow a measure of adjustability in terms of staffing and terms and conditions.  That is a policy issue in terms of public pay and so on and is probably not best grounded within the legislation.  We must be mindful of not putting in place anything that is restrictive and would not allow the institution to capture those types of opportunities.<\/p> <p>Just to confirm, staff in the National Concert Hall will transfer on the pay and conditions that they have at the moment.  That is provided for very specifically in the legislation.  I referred to the memorandum and articles of the National Concert Hall which currently allows for 15 members.

I wish to note at the outset and put on the record that I was appointed Senator as a nominee of the Taoiseach, I presume on the basis that I have some interest in and experience of the arts world.  I also want to put on record that I am director of the Abbey Theatre, which is a national cultural institution, and I am a member of the council of national cultural institutions.  I am familiar, therefore, with the work of many of my colleagues in the national cultural institutions.  My questions come from the experience of having worked in both the commercial and subsidised sectors.  I welcome the pre-legislative scrutiny because it is a non-combative way of trying to unpick the various issues.  I see certain polite conflicts between the National Concert Hall and the Department on key areas.<\/p><p>  It is stated in head 9, section 3 that the Minister may give general policy direction in writing to the hall board in the performance of its functions with the exception of functions relating to artistic and curatorial matters.  It is an extraordinary power to give to any Minister.  While artistic and curatorial matters are disassociated, I would like to hear from the chairman and Mr. &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; as assistant secretary on this matter because in the running of a national cultural institution, there is very little to differentiate between putting on a play or a concert and the business of putting on that play or concert.  A particular head would be required to define when an issue is not artistic and when it is not business.  It is fairly predominant throughout the proposed scheme that the Minister has a huge amount of power in terms of managing and interfering, with no arm's-length principle, and that he or she can find many different ways to influence the board, from appointments to the board, the necessary qualifications for which are very vague and while some are listed, there is no mention of artists or composers being on the board, to the issue of gender balance, which is dealt with by requiring it to the greatest extent practical, whereas the Bill should be very clear about gender balance, to issues around the submission of the statement of strategy.  My cynical reading of this is to see it as a way for the Minister to have day-to-day involvement in the running of the National Concert Hall.  I would like to hear whether that is true and whether it is the intention.  It is only a scheme and there might be a way we can unpick that.  That is one broad question.<\/p><p>  I welcome Mr. &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;'s statement that this is enabling rather than prescriptive legislation and that he has looked at similar types of legislation. What are the other examples of legislation, particularly in Ireland?  The National Concert Hall is a quasi-commercial organisation which depends on punters buying tickets at a show, performance or concert and on how good that production is.<\/p> <p>Its activity is fairly commercial so it has to be nimble and be able to turn on a sixpence.  The general scheme of the Bill does not reflect the need to be nimble about staffing, notwithstanding the rights of the staff.  Could Mr. &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; and Mr. Taylor explain how they would manage the National Concert Hall&rsquo;s business in this environment? <br\/>My third question is for Mr. Kearney and the Department.  Was the code of practice for the governance of State bodies considered an appropriate mechanism?  What are its advantages?  The only advantage I see is that the Minister has significant power over everything the National Concert Hall is doing.  That is the only big difference because at the moment there is an arm&rsquo;s-length relationship between them.  We should get some reassurance on that.  I am concerned about the fit-for-purpose legislation.<br\/>Mr. Kearney has mentioned staffing, financial matters and what I call the nimbleness.  He said too that there should be some discretion and responsibility appropriate to the commercial environment in which the work is undertaken.  I do not see that reflected here.  He has had various discussions with the Department.  I do not see any of the board&rsquo;s suggestions in the general scheme of the Bill.  Where does he think this committee might support the board?<br\/>This point might appear in other legislation but under head 23, section 9 relates to the fact that the director, who is the Accounting Officer has to go before committees and the Comptroller and Auditor General to give account of the board.  Section 9, however, states:<blockquote>In the performance of the duties of Director under subsection (8), the Director shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.<\/blockquote>Not only will the Minister control absolutely everything the National Concert Hall will do &ndash; in fact the Minister might as well be running the National Concert Hall &ndash; but this will emasculate the independence of the director general&rsquo;s view of policy.  I might have misread this and I am happy to be corrected on that.  Those are my broad concerns, that the Minister is increasing her power, which does not bode well in light of the recent issues around the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  I could have misread all of this and I look forward to Mr. &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;&rsquo;s reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014093000012#O00300","speaker":"1167","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412087400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I will start with the last question.

The provision is not unusual and has appeared in a number of recent pieces of legislation such as the 2014 Act governing the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Competition and Consumer Protection Agency Act 2014 and the Education and Training Boards Act 2013.

We seek here - Senator Mac Conghail is correct that there are few examples of it - almost to blend and balance both so that it veers neither one way nor the other.

It was simply to revert to the point asked by Senator Mac Conghail on the challenges the operation of the concert hall faces, being both a public service and a commercial organisation.  To a large extent, this cuts to the very core of this proposed legislation because it is a tricky one on which to get the right balance, as I believe everyone recognises.  However, we are in a special place in being a national cultural institution while at the same time having as significant a commercial operation as we do.  We have all exercised quite a lot of time in trying to find a perfect model for this and this process is showing up that we still have a little bit of work to do in this regard.<\/p><p>  For us, the challenge is that, obviously, we welcome and absolutely endorse the public service remit we have in supporting the musical life and fabric of the country.  However, we also recognise we must operate in a way that is on a good business footing.  In trying to make decisions on what is the statutory provision, therefore by nature of this we must have a good deal of independence of operation to make the necessary business decisions that also would help to support the public service remit of the hall.  I do not perceive the two things as being mutually antagonistic in any way.  To a large extent, our successful commercial operation helps to underpin further our success in delivering the public service remit.  We must find the right balance and if this legislation can help us to achieve this more effectively than our current model, then we all would welcome it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014093000016#S00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Taylor"},{"type":"speech","time":1412088600,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Taylor.

Senator Mac Conghail, in conjunction with many of the other questions posed, raises interesting questions about the whole idea of accountability.

Consequently, integrity and independence are actually two different things and this debate is really bringing this point to the fore.  Members have had a few debates on this issue previously and to my mind, when it is taxpayers' money, then it is the policy of Government or general arts policy.  However, that can only be healthy if there is a dialogue going on with those who actually are experts in the field and that it is not a dictatorial process.<\/p> <p>The Minister is not necessarily going to be an expert in the arts.  On the Minister's side, and in the public interest, one would always like to think that these policies that are forthcoming are well debated in the democratic sense, and therefore that the public interest is being accounted for and that pressure is being put on people within the arts where they are being funded by taxpayers to reach out to the community, to be relevant to the public and to get more people involved in and feeling the benefit of the arts.

It would want to be fairly cautiously framed.  It has to be relevant to what the Oireachtas has approved.  The proposal for consultation is very welcome but even within that there would be certain limits that the courts would set on what was appropriate for a Minister to confer, even with the agreement of the body.<\/p><p>  Going back to Deputy Mulherin's point, there is a balance to be struck between accountability and independence.  The narrative is probably a general policy issue about board members coming before Oireachtas Committees as a collective.  There are certain merits there.  It is perhaps unusual to hear it from this side of the table, but there are merits beyond what is put on a paper application and put into an institutional process.  Part of it is about interpersonal competence and there is a part that is richer than that.  I think the proposal was trying to reach into that.
